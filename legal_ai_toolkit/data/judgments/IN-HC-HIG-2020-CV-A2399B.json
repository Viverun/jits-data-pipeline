Nande, Advocate\n\nHon'ble Shri Justice P. Sam Koshy\nOrder On Board\n\n1. Since the issue involved in the bunch of writ petitions and the cause of\n\naction also being the same, all these writ petitions are being decided by\n\nthis common order.\n\n2. In all these writ petitions the challenge is to the order passed by the\n\nAppellate Authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nrejecting the\n\nappeal preferred by the petitioner Bank thereby affirming the order\n\npassed by the Controlling Authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n.\n\n(Since the date of passing of the orders by the two authorities i.e. the\n\nAppellate Authority & the Controlling Authority are different, the dates\n\nare not being deliberately mentioned, the contents of all the orders are\n\nidentical.)\n\n3. The common facts running all these writ petitions are that the\n\nrespondent no.1 in all these writ petitions were officers of the petitioner\nBank. After serving the Bank for a considerable period of time, all the\n\nrespondent no.1 officers stood retired on attaining the age of\n\nsuperannuation on different dates. After their retirement, in the process\n\nof settling their retiral dues, the Bank paid certain amount towards\n\nGratuity to each of the respondent officers which according to the\n\nrespondent no.1/officers was erroneously calculated. According to the\n\nrespondent officers, they were entitled for much more than what was\n\ncalculated by the petitioner Bank. The respondent no.1/officers\n\naccordingly filed a claim application under the provisions of the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nfor the difference of gratuity before the\n\nControlling Authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\ni.e. the Assistant\n\nLabour Commissioner (Central).\n\n4. After due consideration of the pleadings and contentions put forth on\n\neither side, the learned Controlling Authority vide its order dated\n\n20.02.2019 allowed the application holding that the applicants therein\n\nare entitled for much more gratuity than what has been granted to them\n\nand passed an order. The amount of gratuity in each of the cases is\n\ndifferent that is why this Court is not referring to any fixed amount.\n\n5. The order dated 20.02.2019 passed by the Controlling Authority was\n\nsubjected to challenge before the Appellate Authority i.e. the Dy. Chief\n\nLabour Commissioner (Central) located at Raipur. The Appellate\n\nAuthority also, after due consideration of the contentions put forth on\n\neither side, affirmed the order of the Controlling Authority thereby\n\nrejecting the appeal of the petitioner Bank. It is these two orders\n\npassed by the Appellate Authority and the Controlling Authority which is\n\nunder challenge in these bunch of writ petitions.\n6. The main dispute in all the writ petitions so also before the authorities\n\nconcerned was, as to what would be the pay which would be taken into\n\nconsideration for calculating the amount of gratuity.\n\n7. On consideration of the submissions made by either party to the\n\ndispute, the core issue which needs consideration in these bunch of writ\n\npetitions is whether in the process of quantifying the amount of gratuity\n\npayable to the respondent no.1 officers, the dearness allowance would\n\nbe treated as part of pay or not.\n\n8. There are two provisions of law which need to be considered in the\n\nprocess of deciding the issue involved in these cases. First is the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nwhich is a central Act (hereinafter\n\nreferred as \"the Act of 1972\"). Second is the Chhattisgarh Rajya Gramin\n\nBank (Officers & Employees)Service Regulations, 2013 (hereinafter\n\nreferred as \"the Regulations of 2013\").\n\n9. Initially when all the respondent no.1 officers retired from service, the\n\nBank gave them gratuity of rupees ten lakhs as that was the ceiling limit\n\nunder the Act of 1972. Since the provisions under the Act of 1972 as\n\nalso the Regulations of the petitioner Bank envisaged a clause that the\n\nOfficers shall be entitled for the benefits under that provision which is\n\nmore beneficial between the two. Based upon that when the petitioner\n\nBank calculated the payment of gratuity payable to each of the\n\nrespondent no.1 officers, the calculation made under the Regulations of\n\n2013 came to be more than the ceiling limit, therefore, the Bank\n\ndecided to pay gratuity to the respondent no.1 officers as per the\n\ncalculation under the Regulations of 2013. It is here that the dispute\n\narose.\n10. According to the respondent no.1 officers, while calculating the\n\ntotal amount of gratuity payable under the Regulations 2013 the\n\npetitioner Bank ought to have taken the dearness allowance received\n\nby the respondent no.1 officers as part of pay which would have\n\nenhanced the total amount substantially.\n\n11.The sole contention raised by the petitioner Bank is that the respondent\n\nno.1 officers can have the option of getting gratuity either as per the\n\ncalculation under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nwith a ceiling of rupees 10\n\nlakhs or they may avail the gratuity in terms of the Regulations of 2013.\n\nAccording to the petitioner Bank, there cannot be a situation where the\n\nrespondent officers can claim the benefit under both the provisions of\n\nlaw. In other words, the contention of the petitioner bank is that if the\n\nrespondent officers contend that they would get gratuity under the Act of\n\n1972, the mode of calculation would be as provided under the said Act\n\nand taking into consideration the definition of wage as provided under\n\nthe Act of 1972. In the alternative if the respondent officers choose and\n\nopt to have the benefit of the Regulations of 2013, the gratuity will be\n\npaid to them strictly in accordance to the mode and method of\n\ncalculation as provided under clause 72 of the Regulations of 2013.\n\n12. Learned counsel for the petitioner Bank does not dispute the fact that\n\nas per Sub\nSection 5\nof\nSection 4\nof the Act of 1972, an employee is\n\nentitled to receive better terms of gratuity under any award or agreement\n\nor contract with the employer. This in other words means if there is a\n\nscheme more beneficial framed by the employer, the officer/employee\n\nshall be entitled for gratuity strictly in accordance to the provisions of that\n\nbeneficial legislation which in this case is the Regulations of 2013.\n13. Referring to Clause 72 of the Regulations of 2013 it was\n\nvehemently contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the\n\nsaid provision provides for grant of gratuity to an officer @ one month\n\npay for every completed year of service and in the event the employee\n\nhas more than 30 years of service, he shall also be entitled for an\n\nadditional amount @ one half of a months pay for each completed year\n\nof service beyond 30 years.\n\n14. For understanding what actually the 'pay' means, we will have to\n\ntake the assistance of the definition as provided under Clause M of\n\nSection 2\nwhich defines pay. According to the petitioner, the definition of\n\npay under the Regulations of 2013 strictly means basic pay drawn per\n\nmonth in addition stagnation increments and any part of emoluments\n\nwhich may specifically be classified as \"pay\" under the Regulations. It is\n\nalso the contention of the petitioner that when the definition of pay\n\nmeans only basic pay with stagnation increments and emoluments\n\nspecifically classified as pay, it means there is a deliberate exclusion of\n\ndearness allowance and therefore, dearness allowance cannot be taken\n\ninto consideration for quantifying the amount of gratuity payable to the\n\nrespondent No.1 officers.\n\n15.\nIn support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner Bank\n\nheavily relied upon the decision of the High Court of Bombay in the case\n\nof\nVidarbha Konkan Gramin Bank v. the Appellate Authority and\n\nanother\n, 2020 SCC on line Bombay 17 wherein the Single Bench of\n\nthe Bombay High Court has allowed the petition of the Bank setting\n\naside the order passed by the Appellate Authority and the Controlling\n\nAuthority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nand has also held that the\nexpression \"pay\" as provided under the Regulations of 2013 does not\n\ninclude dearness allowance along with basic pay.\n\nIn addition, the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner also relied upon the judgment of the\n\nAllahabad High Court in the case of\nBaroda Uttar Pradesh Gramin\n\nBank v. the Appellate Authority\nin Misc. Single No. 7163 of 2012\n\ndecided on 15.10.2019.\n\nHe also relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nBeed District Central Cooperative Bank\n\nLtd. v. State of Maharashtra & others\n, 2006 (8) SCC 514 wherein the\n\ngolden rule of interpretation of statute was considered and it was held\n\nthat even if the laws are beneficial legislation or welfare legislation, it\n\ndoes not contemplate that the claimant can have the liberty of obtaining\n\nthe benefits both under the Act as well as under the Regulations.\n\nReferring to paragraph-14 of\nthe said judgment\ncounsel for the petitioner\n\nsubmitted that under the said ratio or principle of law laid down, the\n\nemployee/officer can have the benefit of only the provision of law which\n\nhe opts for and he cannot have the benefit under both laws.\n\n16. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the officers opposing the\n\npetitions submits that the Central Act i.e. the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n\nitself provides for an employee to receive gratuity under the more\n\nbeneficial scheme if any framed by the employer. In the instant case,\n\naccording to the counsel for the respondent no.1, since there is a\n\nRegulation framed i.e. the Regulations of 2013 and there is a mode of\n\ncalculation provided, the calculation of gratuity has to be made strictly in\n\naccordance with the provisions of Clause 72 of the Regulations of 2013.\n\nAccording to him, the term \"pay\" used in Clause 72 of the Regulations of\n\n2013 includes the basic pay with dearness allowance, increment and\nalso emoluments which have been specifically classified as part of pay.\n\nAccording to the counsel for the respondent no.1 officers, on a conjoint\n\nreading of the two definitions of 'emolument' and 'pay', under the\n\nRegulations 2013 it includes basic pay plus dearness allowance.\n\n17.\nIn support of his contention learned counsel for the officers heavily\n\nrelied upon the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case\n\nof\nAll India Gramin Bank Pensioners Organization Unit Rewa v.\n\nMadhyanchal Gramin Bank and Another\n, WP No. 9182 of 2017 and\n\nconnected writ petitions decided on 06.09.2018. The said judgment was\n\nfurther tested before the Division Bench which too affirmed the same in\n\nWrit Appeal No. 1318 of 2018 and other connected writ appeals decided\n\non 26.02.2019. According to the counsel for the respondent officers,\n\nboth these judgments of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was further\n\ntaken to the Supreme Court who have also given a stamp of approval by\n\ndismissing the SLP preferred by the Bank.\n\nIt was also the contention of\n\nShri Vyas that the order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has also\n\nrecently been followed by the High Court of Telengana in the case of\nB.\n\nN. Nageswara Rao v. Sapthagin Grameena Bank & another\ndecided\n\non 07.02.2020.\n\n18. Having heard the arguments put forth on either side it would be relevant\n\nat this juncture to refer to certain provisions of Regulation of 2013 which\n\nis germane for the adjudication of the present dispute. Before going into\n\nthe definition of the different terminologies it would be trite at this\n\njuncture to refer to the Clause 72 of the Regulation of 2013 which deals\n\nwith the Gratuity:\n\n\"72.Gratuity. - (1) An officer or employee shall be eligible for\npayment of gratuity either as per the provisions of the\nPayment\n\nof Gratuity Act, 1972\n(39 of 1972) or as per sub-regulation (2),\n\nwhichever is higher.\n\n(2) Every officer or employee shall be eligible for gratuity on,-\n\n(a) retirement,\n\n(b) death,\n\n(c) disablement rendering him unfit for further service as\ncertified by a medical officer approved by the Bank, or\n\n(d) resignation after completing 10 years of continuous service,\nor\n\n(e) termination of service in any other way except by way of\npunishment after completion of 10 years of service :\n\nProvided that in respect of an employee there shall be no\nforfeiture of gratuity for dismissal on account of misconduct\nexcept in cases where such misconduct causes financial loss to\nthe bank and\nin that case\nto that extent only.\n\n(3) The amount of gratuity payable to an officer or employee shall\nbe one months pay for every completed year of service or part\nthereof in excess of six months subject to a maximum of 15\nmonth's pay :\n\nProvided that where an officer or employee has completed more\nthan 30 years of service, he shall be eligible by way of gratuity\nfor an additional amount at the rate of one half of a month's pay\nfor each completed year of service beyond 30 years :\n\nProvided further that in respect of an officer the gratuity is\npayable based on the last pay drawn :\n\nProvided also that in respect of an employee pay for the\npurposes of calculation of the gratuity shall be the average of\nthe basic pay (100%), dearness allowance and special\nallowance and officiating allowance payable during the 12\nmonths preceding death, disability, retirement, resignation or\ntermination of service, as the case may be.\"\n\n19. Plain reading of the aforesaid provisions of law what reflects is that\n\neven the aforesaid clause also clearly stipulates that an officer or an\n\nemployee of the Bank shall be entitled for gratuity either under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nor as per the Sub-Clause 2 of the Clause\n\n72 of the Regulation of 2013 whichever fetches more monetary benefits\n\nto an employee or an officer.\n20. Now coming to the mode of calculation as per the sub clause 3 of the\n\nRegulation of 2013 the term \"Pay\" has been used for the purpose of\n\ncalculating the gratuity to an officer. As we can see that it is mentioned\n\nthat it shall be one Month's pay for every completed year of service.\n\nThat it would be relevant at this juncture to take note of the fact that so\n\nfar as the third proviso to Sub Clause 3 of Clause 72 envisages that for\n\nthe purpose of calculating the gratuity in respect of an employee pay for\n\nthe calculation shall be average of Basic pay, Dearness allowance and\n\nspecial allowances and officiating allowances payable during the last 12\n\nmonth's of the service. What is note worthy at this juncture is that the\n\nframers of the said provisions has clearly mentioned that in the case of\n\nan employee it shall be the basic pay with Dearness allowance and\n\nspecial allowance which means so far as calculation of gratuity for an\n\nofficer is concerned, there is no break up of the definition of pay provided\n\nand it is the general term of \"Pay\" which has been used for calculating\n\nthe gratuity. As in the case of an employee the framers of the regulation\n\ncould have also specifically said that the calculation of gratuity for an\n\nofficer would be one month's of basic pay and other specific allowance.\n\nThe fact that they have not specifically held that it would be one month of\n\n'basic pay' rather it is one month of 'pay' means there is a deliberate and\n\nconscious exclusion of term 'basic pay' from Sub Clause 3 of Clause 72\n\nso far as officers are concerned.\n\n21. To further put things straight it would be relevant at this juncture to refer\n\nto the definition of the term 'pay', 'emoluments' and 'salary' under\n\nRegulations 2013.\n\n2(m) \"Pay\" means basic pay drawn per month by the officer or employee\nin a pay scale including stagnation increments and any part of the\n\nemoluments which may specifically be classified as pay under these\n\nregulations;\n\n2(i) \"Emoluments\" means aggregate of salary and allowances, if any\n\n2(o) \"Salary\" means aggregate of pay and dearness allowance \"\n\n22.As regards, the calculation of gratuity of an officer is concerned it is the\n\nterminology which has been used for quantifying the gratuity which is\n\nrelevant. Reading of the definition of 'pay' again does not restrict itself to\n\nthe basic pay alone. It clearly indicates that term pay includes basic pay\n\nof an officer including stagnation increment and is also inclusive of any\n\npart of the emoluments which may be specifically classified as pay\n\nunder these regulations. This means the emoluments that an officer was\n\ndrawing would also have to be treated as part of pay. Now what the term\n\nemolument means, has to be construed from the definition of\n\nemoluments as provided in Clause 2(i) of the Regulation of 2013.\n\nClause 2(i) again while defining emoluments clearly means the\n\naggregate of salary and allowances. Now to know what is the aggregate\n\nof salary for deciding the emoluments which could be classified as pay it\n\nbecomes necessary for us to know the definition salary as provided\n\nunder 2(o) of the Regulation of 2013. As per the 2(o) the term salary\n\nmeans aggregate of pay and Dearness Allowance.\n\n23.Now from the reading of the Clause 2(i) defining emoluments and 2(o)\n\ndefining salary, the adjective \"aggregate\" has been used. The term\n\naggregate in common parlance means something which is formed by\n\ncombining many. Thus, it would clearly mean that term emolument used\n\nin 2(m) means it is not the one singular component but a combination of\n\na few or many.\n24.Now what is also to be taken note of at this juncture is that the present\n\nwrit petition is at the third stage of litigation before reaching the High\n\nCourt two other forums or at two other stages firstly before the\n\nControlling Authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nand also before\n\nthe Appellate Authority under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nthe issue\n\ninvolved in the case has been considered.\n\n25.Neither in the present bunch of writ petitions nor before the Controlling\n\nAuthority or before the Appellate Authority the petitioners have not been\n\nable to show any document by it which could be established that\n\nDearness Allowance firstly is not an emolument and secondly if at all if it\n\nis an emolument it is not one which has been specifically classified as\n\npay under Regulation, 2013. The definition of pay under the Regulations\n\nspecifically envisages that an emolument unless it may specifically be\n\nclassified as pay under these regulations it would not be part of Pay for\n\ncalculating Gratuity. This would clearly mean that petitioner Bank when\n\nthey decided to pay certain emolument to officers or a category of an\n\nofficer or an employee it would simultaneously decide whether it would\n\nform part of pay or not. No such document whatsoever has been\n\nproduced by the petitioner Bank in the three stages of litigation.\n\n26.Another aspect which needs to be considered is the fact that if the\n\nframers of the regulation intended that gratuity for the officer were to be\n\ncalculated based upon their basic pay alone it would had been simply\n\nreflected in Sub Clause 3 of Clause 72 one month's basic pay for every\n\ncompleted year of service as is specifically mentioned in the other\n\nproviso of Sub clause 3 for the purpose of calculating gratuity for an\n\nemployee. The fact that term pay has been used itself gives sufficient\nindication that framers of the regulation intended the general term pay\n\nand it was not just confined to the basic pay alone. This also has to be\n\nseen as a deliberate exclusion of basic pay while framing sub\nSection 3\n.\n\nIn other words, the framers of the regulation had taken the term pay in\n\nbroader perspective rather than giving it restrictive or narrow meaning\n\nconfined to the term basic pay.\n\n27. It is hear that judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court rendered by\n\nthe Single Bench in the case of All India Gramin Bank Pensioners\n\nOrganisation, Rewa. which needs a reference. Learned Single Bench\n\nof the M.P. High Court while deciding the said case in paragraph 19 to\n\n24 has held as under :-\n\n\"(19) The parties are at loggerheads on the meaning of the word \"pay\".\n\nThe officers contended that the word \"pay\" must be read with\n\n\"emoluments\" & \"salary\", whereas, as noticed, the employer's stand\n\nis that only such part of emolument can be treated as \"pay\" which is\n\nspecifically classified as pay. Clause 2(m) shows that \"pay\" means\n\nbasic pay of the officers/employees which includes stagnation\n\nincrements and any part of emoluments which may specifically be\n\nclassified as \"pay\" under these Regulations. The definition of\n\n\"emoluments\" shows that it is aggregate of salary and allowance.\n\n\"Salary\" includes aggregate of pay and DA.\n\n(20) A microscopic reading of Regulations show that there exists no\n\nprovision whereby any part of emolument may specifically be\n\nclassified as pay. This expression- any part of emoluments which\n\nspecifically be classified as pay needs interpretation. In my view, a\n\nconjoint reading of definition of \"pay\", \"emoluments\" & \"salary\" is\n\nrequired for proper interpretation of the meaning of \"pay\" or the said\n\nhighlighted expression. It is important to note that \"emoluments\" is\n\naggregate of salary and allowance and \"salary\" is aggregate of pay\nand dearness allowance. Thus, said three definitions are deeply\n\ninterlinked and correct meaning of said expression can be drawn by\n\ncombined reading of said three provisions. The definition of \"pay\"\n\nrefers about emolument, whereas emolument includes salary which\n\nincludes pay and dearness allowance. Thus, dearness allowance is\n\nspecifically classified and must form part of pay because the said\n\ndefinitions are closely interwoven. Otherwise, expression leads to\n\nan absurdity and impossibility. Absurdity, inconsistency and\n\nimpossibility because in the Regulations there exists no provision\n\nfor undertaking such exercise of specially classifying an emolument\n\nas pay.\n\n(21) The settle law is that if the grammatical construction leads to some\n\nabsurdity or inconsistency with the rest of instruments, it may be\n\ndeparted from so as to avoid the absurdity and inconsistency.{See:\n\nAIR 1952 SC 324, [Shamrao vs. District Magistrate,Thana]; 1996\n\n(2) All ER 23, [Imperical Chemicals Industries vs.Colmer] & 2009 (\n2)\n\nSCC 1, [Mahmadhusen Abdulrahim Kalota Shaikh v. Union of\n\nIndia\n].\n\nSimilar view is taken by Supreme Court in AIR 1998 SC\n\n1070, [R. Rudraiah vs. State of Karnataka] and\nAIR 2000 SC 1261,\n\n[Molar Mal vs. Kay Iron Works\n]}. Justice CORDOZO said \"A judge\n\nmust think of himself as an artist, who although he must know the\n\nhandbooks, should never trust to them for his guidance; in the end\n\nhe must rely upon his almost instinctive sense of where the line lay\n\nbetween the word and the purpose which lay behind it.\" {See: Mr.\n\nJustice Cordozo by Learned Hand, 52Harvard Law Review, pp.\n\n361-63}.\n\n(22) This is trite law that statute should not be construed as theorems\n\nof Euclid, but it should be construed with some imagination of the\n\npurposes which lies behind them. It is said by Judge LEARNED\n\nHAND in Lehigh Valley Coal v. Yensavage, 218Fed 547, pp. 552,\n\n553 : 235 US 705 (1915). In the words of Justice Chhinappa Reddy,\n\nJ \"Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are\nthe bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the\n\ntexture, context is what gives colour. Neither can be ignored. Both\n\nare important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual\n\ninterpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted\n\nwhen we know why it was enacted.\".\n{See:\nReserve Bank of India\n\nvs. Pearless General Finance and Investment Co.\n,reported in 1987\n\n(1) SCC 424}. Iyer, J opined \"to be literal in meaning is to see the\n\nskin and miss the soul. The judicial key to construction is the\n\ncomposite perception of 'deha' and 'dehi' of the provision.\"\n\n{See:\n\nAIR 1977 SC 965, [Chairman, Board of Mining Examination and\n\nChief Inspector of Mines v. Ramjee\n]}. In view of principles\nlaid down\n\nin\nthe said authorities, the definition, clauses and Regulation 72\n\nmust be read conjointly to draw the meaning of second proviso of\n\nRegulation 72 and, more particularly, meaning of \"last pay\". As per\n\nthe text and in the context the aforesaid expression relied upon by\n\nlearned senior counsel is used, in my judgment \"pay\" includes\n\ndearness allowance as it exists as a classification in the definition of\n\n\"salary\" which has a direct nexus/relation with \"emoluments\" and\n\n\"pay\".\n\n(23) The matter may be viewed from another angle. The provision\n\nrelating to grant of gratuity is a beneficiary provision. It must be\n\nconsidered on the anvil of beneficent rule of construction. It is trite\n\nlaw that in the matter of welfare legislation, especially involving the\n\nwork force, the terms of contract and the provisions of law should\n\nbe liberally construed in favour of weak. {See:\nWorkmen of Binny\n\nLtd. v. Management of Binny Ltd.\n, reported in 1985 (4) SCC 325;\n\nIndian Bank vs. K. Usha\n, reported in AIR 1998 SC 866.}.\n\n(24) In view of aforesaid analysis, in the considered opinion of this\n\nCourt the respondents have erred in not including DA while\n\ncalculating gratuity under the Regulations. Thus, respondents are\n\ndirected to include DA and recalculate the gratuity of the petitioners\n\nand pay the difference arising thereto to the petitioners within 60\ndays from the date of communication of this order. Since, employer\n\nhas not taken into account the DA for calculating gratuity because\n\nof a genuine interpretation problem which is not based on any other\n\nreasons like lethargy or inaction, I am not inclined to grant interest\n\non such payment of gratuity to the petitioners.\"\n\n28.This judgment of the Single Bench has been further tested before the\n\nDivision Bench of the M.P. High Court and Division Bench also has put a\n\nstamp of approval by dismissing the Writ Appeal. The bank had also\n\nchallenged the two judgments before the Supreme Court in an S.L.P.\n\nwhere the S.L.P. also got dismissed in limine. The dismissal of the S.L.P.\n\nfurther makes it clear that Hon'ble Supreme Court also did not find any\n\nabsurdity or illegality in the two judgments rendered by the M.P. High\n\nCourt which led to the dismissal of the S.L.P. in limine.\n\n29. From the pleadings that have been made by the petitioner-Bank and also on\n\nconsidering the submissions made on either side, what is not in dispute is the\n\nfact that both the petitioner as well as the respondents accept the fact that the\n\nofficers are entitled for gratuity amount whichever is higher in between the\n\ncalculation that is made on comparison between the two i.e. under the\n\nPayments of Gratuity Act\nor under the Regulation, 2013.\n\n30. The real controversy between the parties is as to the basis of calculation of\n\nthe amount of gratuity payable. Since there is no upper ceiling or cap provided\n\nin the regulations like under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, the officers insisted\n\nthat they be paid gratuity under the Regulations by including DA as a\n\ncomponent within the expression Pay as defined under Clause-2M of the\n\nRegulations, 2013. The fact which requires consideration also is that there is\n\nno exclusion of DA reflected in the definition of Pay under the Regulations,\n\n2013. It is here that the definition of emolument becomes more relevant. The\n\nemolument under the definition under 2-I of the Regulations means aggregate\nof salary and allowances and what exactly is salary is also defined under 2-O\n\nof the Regulations, 2013 which clearly holds that salary means aggregate Pay\n\nand DA.\n\n31. What needs to be considered now under the given circumstances is, can\n\nexpression of Pay as is reflected under the definition clause 2-M of the\n\nRegulations, 2013 mean inclusive of DA or excluding DA ?\n\n32. If we read the definition Clause 2-M of the Regulations, it clearly reflects that\n\nthe framers of the said Regulations were of the view that Pay means Basic\n\nPay plus the emoluments which is classified as Pay. Now what are emolument\n\nwhich can be classified as Pay. The Bank has not produced any documentary\n\nproof to show what are those emoluments which according to the Bank is\n\nspecifically classified as Pay. Under the circumstances, it becomes necessary\n\nto take the definition of emolument and the definition of salary together into\n\nconsideration to decide whether the DA would be part of Pay for the purpose\n\nof calculating gratuity.\n\n33. It is here that the Single Bench of MP High Court has clearly held that the\n\nexpression Pay, Emolument and Salary are interlinked, interconnected,\n\ninterwoven and supplementing each other. This court fully endorses the view\n\ntaken by the Single Bench of MP High Court. The view of this court gets\n\nfurther strengthened from the plain reading of Sub Clause-3 and the three\n\nprovisos provided under Clause-72 of the Regulations, 2013.\n\n34. If the framers of the Regulations were of the view that for calculating gratuity\n\nfor officers DA was not to be taken into consideration, they would have simply\n\nclarified it in the proviso as has been done in the case of 'employees' which is\n\nreflected in the 3rd proviso where in respect of an employee it has been\n\nspecifically held that the gratuity shall be the average of basic pay plus DA\n\nand special allowances, whereas, so far as the officers are concerned, in the\n\nsecond proviso it has been specifically mentioned that the gratuity shall be\npayable based upon the last pay drawn. Emphasis has been given on Pay.\n\nThe authorities could have simply held that it would be payable on the basic\n\npay and those allowances which are part of Pay under the Regulations.\n\nHaving not done so, the term Pay would have to be given a broader and wider\n\ninterpretation and the said interpretation should always be tilting towards the\n\nweaker section i.e. officers as payment of gratuity is one of those beneficial\n\nlegislation enacted for the benefit of the employees and officers.\n\n35. As regards the judgments of Bombay High Court which has been heavily\n\nrelied upon by the petitioner-Bank, true it is that the Bombay High Court has\n\ntaken a different view than what has been taken by the MP High Court. It is\n\nalso undisputed legal position that when there are two conflicting views\n\navailable for a court in deciding the matter and if the two conflicting views are\n\nof the same High Court, the option left for this court is for referring the matter\n\nto a larger Bench. However, in case if the conflicting views are of different\n\nHigh Courts, the Bench has an option of testing and then to endorse a view\n\nfrom among the two that which is more probable and justifiable. This court\n\nfinds the judgment of MP High Court to be more probable in the factual matrix\n\nof the case. Moreover, the judgment of MP High Court has also been tested\n\nbefore the Division Bench as also before the Supreme Court and before both\n\nthe higher forums it has got the stamp of acceptance, unlike in the case of\n\nBombay High Court where it is not known whether the judgment of the\n\nBombay High Court has been subjected to challenge further or not. The same\n\nprinciple also applies so far as judgment of Allahabad High Court is\n\nconcerned.\n\n36. There is yet another ground on which this court is reluctant to entertain the\n\nwrit petition i.e. the scope of judicial review in exercise of the writ jurisdiction,\n\nwhile testing an order passed by the quasi judicial authorities, Tribunal and\n\nLabour Courts. It is settled position of law that under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India while hearing a matter arising out of the Labour Court,\n\nTribunal and Quasi Judicial Authority, the High Court does not sit as an\n\nappellate authority. It has only the power of superintendence over those\n\nCourts, Tribunals and Authorities.\n\n37. The judicial review does not mean to re appreciate the whole dispute afresh\n\nand reach to a different conclusion when the authorities below has himself\n\ngiven reasons for reaching to the conclusion that he has arrived at. The\n\ninterference by this court in exercise of its power under\nArticle 226\nwould\n\nconfine itself to the extent of testing the order passed by the appellate\n\nauthority and find out whether there is an error of jurisdiction or whether there\n\nis an excess of jurisdiction and also whether there is any perversity in the\n\nfindings given by the authority whose order is under challenge.\n\n38. The power of superintendence or the supervisory powers or the power of\n\njudicial review in a petition where the order of Labour Court, Quasi Judicial\n\nAuthority or Tribunal is under challenge, has to be sparingly exercised that too\n\nonly in the event of there being any error of law. A finding of fact arrived at with\n\nreasons and justification given cannot be upset only because the High Court\n\nfinds that there is another view possible. The jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\n\ncannot be used as revisional power or as appellate powers as the order under\n\nchallenge does not arise out of question of violation of the fundamental rights\n\nor violation of any of the constitutional rights, more particularly when there are\n\nprovision of appeal provided under the statute and the appellate authority also\n\nhas considered these aspects in exercise of is appellate powers.\n\n39.\nIn case of\nSwaran Singh and Another Vs. State of Punjab & Others\n,\n\n1976(2)SCC868, the Supreme Court discussing on the power of writ court\n\nunder\nArticle 226\nin paragraphs 12 and 13 has held as under :\n\n\"12. Before dealing with the contentions canvassed, it will be\nuseful to notice the general principles indicating the limits of the\njurisdiction of the High Court in writ proceedings under Article\n\n226. It is well-settled that Certiorari jurisdiction can be\nexercised only for correcting errors of jurisdiction committed by\ninferior courts of tribunals. A writ of Certiorari can be issued\nonly in the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction which is different\nfrom appellate jurisdiction. The Court exercising special\njurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nis not entitled to act as an\nappellate Court. As was pointed out by this Court in Syed\nYakoob's case (supra) \"this limitation necessarily means that\nfindings of fact reached by the inferior court or Tribunal as a\nresult of the appreciation of evidence cannot be re-opened or\nquestioned in writ proceedings. An error of law which is\napparent on the face of the record can be corrected by a writ\nbut not an error of fact, however grave it may appear to be.\"\n\n13. In regard to a finding of fact recorded by an inferior tribunal, a\nwrit of Certiorari can be issued only if in recording such a\nfinding the tribunal has acted on evidence which is legally\ninadmissible, or has refused to admit admissible evidence, or if\nthe finding is not supported by any evidence at all, because in\nsuch cases the error amounts to an error of law. The writ\njurisdiction extends, only to cases where orders are pissed by\ninferior courts or tribunals in excess of their jurisdiction or as a\nresult of their refusal to exercise jurisdiction vested in them or\nthey act illegally or improperly in the exercise of their\njurisdiction causing grave miscarriage of justice.\"\n\n40. The said principle of law has been reiterated many a times thereafter and the\n\nsaid view still holds the field.\n\n41.\nIn yet another recent decision in\nHeinz India Private Limited and Another Vs.\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh and Others\n, 2012(5)SCC443, reiterating the same\n\nprinciple in paragraphs 66 and 67 it was held as under :\n\n\"66.That the Court dealing with the exercise of power of judicial\n\nreview does not substitute its judgment for that of the\n\nlegislature or executive or their agents as to matters within\n\nthe province of either, and that the Court does not supplant\n\n'the feel of the expert' by its own review, is also fairly well-\nsettled by the decisions of this Court. In all such cases\n\njudicial examination is confined to finding out whether the\n\nfindings of fact have a reasonable basis on evidence and\n\nwhether such findings are consistent with the laws of the\n\nland. [See\nUnion of India v. S.B. Vohra\n, (\n2004) 2 SCC 150,\n\nShri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India\n, (1990) 3 SCC\n\n223, and Thansingh Nathmal and Ors. v. Supdt. of Taxes and\n\nOrs., Dhubri, AIR 1964 SC 1419].\n\n67.\nIn\nDharangadhra Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra\n\nand Ors.\n, AIR 1957 SC 264, this Court held that decision of a\n\nTribunal on a question of fact which it has jurisdiction to\n\ndetermine is not liable to be questioned in proceedings under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution unless it is shown to be totally\n\nunsupported by any evidence.\nTo the same effect is the view\n\ntaken by this Court in Thansingh Nathmal's case (supra)\n\nwhere this Court held that the High Court does not generally\n\ndetermine questions which require an elaborate examination\n\nof evidence to establish the right to enforce which the writ is\n\nclaimed.\"\n\n42. This view further has been followed in\nPepsico India Holding Private Limited\n\nVs. Krishna Kant Pandey\n, 2015(4)SCC 270.\n\n43. Since the dispute involved in the present case has already been thrashed out\n\nbefore the Controlling Authority who has elaborately discussed the contentions\n\nput forth on either side and based on the material produced before the\n\nControlling Authority has given an order which has also been affirmed by the\n\nappellate authority under the Act, the scope of judicial interference gets\n\nreduced substantially except on the ground of an error of jurisdiction or excess\n\nof jurisdiction which in this case is not a ground of challenge.\n44. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, this court is of\n\nthe opinion that no strong case has been made out by the petitioners calling\n\nfor an interference to the impugned order under challenge.\n\n45. As a consequence all these writ petitions thus being devoid of merits deserve\n\nto be and are accordingly dismissed.\n\nSd/-\n\nP. Sam Koshy\nJudge\nKhatai/Rohit/Inder",
