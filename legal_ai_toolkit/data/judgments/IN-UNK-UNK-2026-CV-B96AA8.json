However, above the 'Senior Civil Surgeon', only panel\nseniority and the date of appointment will be taken into consideration.\n\n 3.2.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants contends\nthat Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) was considered \nas senior to the Respondent / Writ Petitioner and the same has been furnished\nin the Counter Affidavit filed by the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner and a\nstatement that she is senior most to Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) is not acceptable in the eye of law.\n\n 3.3.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants proceeds\nto take a plea that the Government had taken a decision to promote and\nappoint the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 (Dr.A.Edwin Joe), as the\nDirector of Medical Education by considering that he is the senior most Dean\nand senior of all promotional level and he was the first to complete more\nthan 10 years of teaching experience.\n\n 3.4.It is represented on behalf of the Appellants that Dr.A.Edwin Joe\n(The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) got promotion for the post of\n'Dean' for the panel year 2009-10 and joined as Dean on 03.03.2010 and for\nmore number of years served as Dean and therefore, the Government promoted \nhim as 'Director of Medical Education' by following the existing Rules. Apart\nfrom that, it is the plea of the Appellants that the said Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The\nAppellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) had rendered service of 6 years in the\nfeeder category post of Dean. But the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner had\nrendered only three years of service in the feeder category post as on the\ncrucial date of consideration i.e.15.03.2016.\n\n 3.5.Expatiating his contention, the Learned Additional Advocate General\nfor the Appellants proceeds to point out that the Learned Single Judge should\nhave noted that the post of 'Director of Medical Education' comes under\nselection post under Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Medical Service.\n\n 3.6.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants projects\nan argument that as per the proviso of section 7(1) of the Tamil Nadu\nGovernment Servant (Condition of Service) Act 2016, while selecting the Head\nof the Department, the number of qualified candidates to be considered, shall\nbe fixed as twice the number of vacancies plus three in the seniority list in\nthe class, category or service. Moreover, the Appellants take a stand that in\nthe present case, the number of vacancy was one and therefore, five\ncandidates were considered and that Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) is not only senior most person in the feeder\ncategory of the post of 'Dean', but also meritorious candidate to hold the\npost of 'Director of Medical Education.'\n\n 3.7.The Appellants, in the 'Memorandum of Grounds of Appeal' has taken\na categorical stand that merit wise also Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) is the most meritorious among the candidates in the \npanel and that the Government had considered the 'Seniority of Medical\nOfficers' in the cadre of 'Dean'. The core contention advanced on behalf of\nthe Appellants is that the Learned Single Judge should have taken note of\nthat it is not mandatory to select the Medical Officers for the post of Head\nof the Department, as per the seniority (Civil Medical List). Moreover, the\nLearned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants submits that the\nGovernment have the powers to appoint a Medical Officer based on the 'Merit\nand Ability', who had fulfilled the qualifications prescribed as per the Rule\nprovisions for the Head Of Department post.\n\n 3.8.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants brings\nit to the notice of this Court that the Government had filed a detailed\ncounter in W.P.(MD)No.6790 of 2016 that Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) is the senior most person than Dr.S.Revwathy (Writ \nPetitioner), which was also accepted by this Court. The Learned Additional\nAdvocate General for the Appellants points out that the Government issued\norders in G.O.(Ms).No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department, dated \n23.10.2009 only for the Government Doctors for providing Dynamic Assured\nCareer Progression (DACP) due to lack of adequate promotional opportunities\nand stagnation at various levels in the system and the said executive order\nis not overcoming the existing special Rules. The Appellants' case is that\nthe Learned Single Judge should have taken note of the fact that while\npreparing panel for the post of 'Director of Medical Education' for the year\n2015-16, the name of the First Respondent / Writ Petitioner was in the third\nplace i.e. below the name of Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 \nof 2017).\n\n 3.9.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants contends\nthat the post of 'Director of Medical Services' is governed by Rule 21 of the\nTamil Nadu Medical Services Special Rules (Annexure I) and Rule 3(3) speaks\nof 'Director of Medical Education - Promotion from among the Officers holding\nthe posts of Deans of Medical Colleges, Director, King Institute, Guindy and\nDirectors of Upgraded Institutes. Further, Rule 4 enjoins 'Promotion to the\nposts shall be made on the grounds of merit and ability and seniority being\nconsidered only where merit and ability are approximately equal'.\n\n 3.10.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants\nemphatically proceeds to state that the post of Director of Medical Education\nis an important post, where the Director should have experience not only in\nthe medical education, but should have an experience in the administration\nand reference to the Special Rule for Medical Rule 8(b), specifies that no\nperson shall be eligible for appointment for the post of Director of Medical\nEducation, unless (1) He possesses a post graduate degree in a Medical\nfaculty or any other qualification approved by the Medical Council of India\nto be treated on par with MD/MS awarded by Indian University; (2) He has\nserved for a period of not less than ten years after completing the required\npost graduate degree mentioned in clause (I) above, in one or more of the\nfollowing posts, namely, Tutor/Assistant Professor/Professor/Reader in a\nClinical or Non clinical department in a Government teaching medical\ninstitution, out of which four years must be of teaching experience as\nReader/Professor; (3) He has administrative experience for a period of not\nless than two years in one or more of the following posts, namely Director of\nUpgraded Institute or Director Institute of Thoracic Medicine, Director of\nKing Institute, Guindy/Dean/Principal/Superintendent of a Medical\nCollege/Medical College Hospital out of which one year must be as a Dean of\nMedical College and (4) He has one year left over service prior to date of\nretirement.\n\n 3.11.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants\ncontends that in terms of Rule 3(a)(3) of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service\nSpecial Rules, Section 21 Part I, the third Respondent is more experienced in\nthe field of administration and considered as meritorious and immensely\nsuitable for being promoted as the Director of Medical Education.\n\n 3.12.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants takes a\nplea that an administrative experience in the post of Dean also an important\ncriteria and as per Rule 8(e) of the Special Rule, the required qualification\nmust be available with reference to 15th March of the year, in which, the\nappointment is made and that the appointment to the post of Director of\nMedical Education was made by the Government on 25.04.2017. \n\n 3.13.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants\ncontends that the 'Dean' is the feeder category to the post of Director of\nMedical Education and that the third Respondent (The Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) working as Dean for more number of years than the \nthird Respondent, has more merit and ability to hold the post of the Director\nof Medical Education.\n\n 3.14.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants\nsubmits that the ingredients of G.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare (A1)\nDepartment, dated 25.04.2017 were not considered by the Learned Single Judge \nin proper perspective and that the consequential positive direction issued by\nthe Learned Single Judge in the writ petition is beyond the ambit of\ndiscretionary power conferred under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India.\n\nApart from that, it is projected on the side of the Appellants that in\nearlier round of litigation challenging the appointment of Dr.Vimala, the\nsimilar consequential prayer for Mandamus was not considered by this Court.\n\n 3.15.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants points\nout that the Learned Single Judge had interfered in the appointment based on\n'Note File References' and that the note file references and insertions are\nroutine administrative exercise in the 'Government Administrative Hierarchy'\nand that cannot be taken into consideration to decide the issue.\n\n 3.16.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants\ncontends that the impleaded party viz., the Second Respondent in\nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 is not eligible to be considered for the post of\nDirector of Medical Education, since he is facing Rule 17(b) charges and\ntherefore, as per Tamil Nadu Government Servant (Condition of Service) Act\n2016, he is not eligible to be considered for the post of Director of Medical\nEducation.\n\n 3.17.The Learned Additional Advocate General for the Appellants\nsubmits that the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is challenging the\nappointment of the appointed person only on the ground that she is senior as\nper Civil Medical List (CML) number and in fact, she has not disputed the\nqualification of the appointed person. In this connection, the Learned\nAdditional Advocate General for the Appellants refers to the observation made\nby this Court in W.P.(MD)No.2775 of 2008, dated 09.06.2010, wherein at\nparagraph No.12, it is mentioned as under:-\n\n \"12.On a perusal of the letter dated 21.05.2008 sent by the Health &\nFamily Welfare Department, produced by the Learned Counsel for the \npetitioner, under the \nRight to Information Act\n, I find that the Special Rules\nof Tamil Nadu Medical Service could be applied only upto the cadre of Civil\nSurgeon and the criteria for future promotion to the next higher category is\nas per panel seniority or date of promotion and not based on the Civil\nMedical List seniority. The relevant particulars in the said letter reads\nthus:\n\n ?(i) As per Rule 12 of the Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Medical\nService, the seniority upto the cadre of Civil Surgeons shall be determined\nwith reference to their CML Number.\n\n (ii) Panel seniority or date of promotion is the criteria for future\npromotion to the next higher cadre and not the CML seniority?.\n\n(4).Submissions of First Respondent/Writ Petitioner:-\n\n 4.1.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\ncontends that a vacancy arose to the post of Director of Medical Education\nconsequent to the retirement of Dr.R.Vimala on 31.10.2016 and that the\npromotion to the post of Director of Medical Education is governed by Rule\n124 of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules. Moreover, it is\nrepresented on behalf of the First Respondent that Rule 124 of the Tamil Nadu\nMedical Service Special Rules, does not anywhere mentioned that the post of\nDirector of Medical Education is a selection post.\n\n 4.2.Advancing his arguments, the Learned Counsel for the First\nRespondent submits that even if it is considered as selection post, where the\npromotion is based on merit and ability, the G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms Department, dated 18.10.1993 clearly defines 'Merit'\nand 'Ability' and if the merit and ability are considered as equal without\nany charges or punishment in previous five years, the Civil Medical List\nSeniority alone is considered as basis for promotion.\n\n 4.3.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent adds to point out\nthat the crucial date for the post of promotion to the 'Director of Medical\nEducation' is not mentioned as 15th March of that year and it is the date on\nwhich previous incumbent retires as it is a single post and Head of\nDepartment post of Non-IAS cadre, as clarified in G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel\nand Administrative Reforms Department, dated 18.10.1993. \n\n 4.4.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent contends that as per\ninstructions prescribed in G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms Department, dated 18.10.1993, a panel is to be prepared three months\nin advance and this is to ensure that the cases of those persons, who have a\nminimum service of one year from the date of retirement of previous incumbent\nare not omitted because of an administrative delay.\n\n 4.5.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent brings it to the\nnotice of this Court that G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\nDepartment, dated 18.10.1993 and G.O.Ms.No.440, Personnel and Administrative \nReforms Department, dated 26.10.1990 had clearly mentioned about the \npreparation of panel eligibility and the Special Rules pertaining to the\nposts. Apart from that, the G.O.Ms.No.124, Health and Family Welfare\nDepartment, dated 10.06.2003, speaks of amendment to the Tamil Nadu Medical \nService Special Rules in regard to the post of Director of Medical Education.\n\n 4.6.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent points out that\n'Civil Medical List Seniority' holds good for all promotions in Medical\nService and all panels are drawn, as per Civil Medical List Seniority. In\nfact, G.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated\n25.04.2017 is the only panel for appointment of Director of Medical\nEducation, where no 'Civil Medical List' is mentioned and this is to hide the\nFirst Respondent/Writ Petitioner's Seniority.\n\n 4.7.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent submits that the\nSeniority as per Civil Medical List is as under:- \n\nName \nCML-2005 \n CML-2010 \n Retirement\nDr.S.Revwathy \n\n4018 \n\n1888 \n\nFeb - 2018\nDr.Shanthimalar \n\n4171 \n\n2033 \n\nJune - 2021\nDr.AL.Meenakshi Sundaram \n\n4220 \n\n2082 \n\nAug - 2021 \nDr.Narayanababu \n\n4233 \n\n2094 \n\nOct - 2020\nDr.A.Edwin Joe \n\n4821 \n\n2666 \n\nJuly - 2019\n\n 4.8.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent takes a plea that\nG.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department, dated 23.10.2009 \nclearly says that ?For all higher posts and posts in common pool, Civil\nMedical List Seniority is the basis for promotion?. Also that, it is\nprojected on the side of the First Respondent that even for the post of Head\nof the Department in any Medical College, G.O.Ms.No.226, Health and Family \nWelfare (A1) Department, dated 10.10.2013 clearly mentions that 'senior most\nMedical Officer as per Civil Medical List seniority in the concerned\nspeciality of the Medical College shall be considered for the Headship/Head\nof the Department subject to the condition that he/she should not have lost\nhis/her seniority as a result of relinquishment of right for promotion or as\na result of any punishment imposed on him/her.\n\n 4.9.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent projects an argument\nthat an entry into Medical service in the State of Tamil Nadu was ?Single\nWindow? - ?Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission? and further that the 'Civil\nMedical List' has 'Legal Sanction'. Besides these, it is represented on\nbehalf of the First Respondent that the post of graduation may be done at any\ntime and clinical specialties in 1980 - 90s have to do Diploma Course and\nthen only Degree Course, whereas the non-clinical specialties do not have\nDiploma. \n\n 4.10.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent refers to the Chart\nin respect of the First Respondent and the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of\n2017, which runs as under:- \n\nRespondent \nAppellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 \nJoined M.B.B.S. \n\n1976 \n\n1978 \n\nCompleted M.B.B.S. \n\n1981 \n\n1984 \n\nDiploma DGO \n1984-1986 \n\n- - -\n\nM.D. \n1988-2000 \n1986-1989 \nSelection in TNPSC \n1984-Batch \n1987-Batch \nJoined Tamil Nadu Medical Service \n\n1986 \n\n1989 \n\nCivil Medical List Number\n1888/2010 \n2665/2010 \nDean Promotion (by willingness)\n2012 panel \n2010 panel \nRetirement \nFeb - 2018\nJuly - 2019\n\n 4.11.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Petitioner submits\nthat the First Respondent/Petitioner became eligible and had submitted her\nwillingness for 'Dean' promotion in the year 2010. However, as per\nG.O.Ms.No.39, Health and Family Welfare Department (A1) Department, dated \n16.02.2010, the creation of 15 posts of Medical Superintendent was made to\nthe 15 medical college hospitals in Pay Band - IV with Grade Pay of\nRs.8,700/- by redesignation and redevelopment of one post of Professor of\nAnatomy of the respective Medical Institution in the same scale of pay.\n\nFurther, it was mentioned in the said Government Order that duties and\nresponsibilities so far exercised by the Dean of Government Medical College\nand Hospital will be shared by the Medical Superintendent of the Medical\nCollege Hospital and the Dean of the Medical College, as defined in Annexure\nII to this order. Therefore, it is submitted on behalf of the First\nRespondent that all the non-clinical professors became Dean in the year 2010-\n2011 and that is reason why, her junior viz., the Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 (Dr.A.Edwin Joe) became Dean in the year 2010. Apart \nfrom that, once again these posts were merged due to hardship in\nadministration and as a result, in the year 2011, all the Medical\nSuperintendents became Deans. Moreover, from the year 2012 panel, all senior\nclinical side Teachers became Deans and this is evident from G.O.(D)No.1305,\nHealth and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 28.11.2013, which relates to\nthe panel for the post of Dean of Medical College for the year 2013-2014.\n\n 4.12.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent comes out with a plea\nthat the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner joined in Primary Health Centre in\nthe year 1987 and rendered rural service till the year 1990 and after\ncompletion of post graduation, also served rural public in Aayakudi.\nThereafter, she entered the teaching side and from the year 1991 till 2013\nserved in the O & G Department. \n\n 4.13.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent points out that the\nAppellant in W.A(MD)No.1301 of 2017 after Post Graduation joined in the\nForensic Medical Department and served only in the College and had not served\nany rural service and not connected with direct patient care. Apart from\nthat, the Learned Counsel for the First Respondent contends that the First\nRespondent was given the best academician award by the students and by the \nTamil Nadu Medical Council during the year 2013.\n\n 4.14.The core stand taken on behalf of the First Respondent/petitioner\nis that she is senior to the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 and this is\nestablished from seniority list of Medical Officers for the post of Director\nof Medical Education for the panel year 2015-2016 sent by Dr.R.Vimala dated\n20.10.2015 wherein the First Respondent was mentioned as 'eligible for\nDirector of Medical Education' in Serial No.21 and the Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 mentioned as 'eligible' in Serial No.38. In this\nconnection, it is represented on behalf of the First Respondent/petitioner\nthat the seniority is arrived at as per 'Civil Medical List' only, as per\nG.O.Ms.No.353, dated 23.10.2009. \n\n 4.15.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent draws the attention\nof this Court to G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\nDepartment, dated 18.10.1993, which clearly states that the estimated vacancy\nis to be proposed atleast three months in advance and panel must be prepared\nby the Head of the Department, failing which, by the Secretary himself three\nmonths in advance, the panel must be intimated to all in the panel by the\nregistered post for any objection to be raised within two months and the\nthird month must be utilised for finalisation, so that, the next person will\ntake over from the previous incumbent.\n\n 4.16.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent contends that one\nDr.Geethalakshmi retired on 31.01.2016 and that Dr.R.Vimala had a left over\nservice of nine months (31.10.2016) and the First Respondent/petitioner who\nwas the next senior in Civil Medical List to Dr.R.Vimala had two years, one\nmonth left over service as on 31.01.2016. To accommodate Dr.R.Vimala, \nG.O.Ms.Nos.446 and 447, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated \n18.03.2016 were passed without a panel relaxing the Rules, which was\nhighlighted in the Judgment of this Court, dated 09.11.2016 in\nW.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016. \n\n 4.17.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent submits that\nDr.R.Vimala retired on 31.10.2016 and that the First Respondent/Petitioner is\nthe senior most with left over service on 1 year and four months, as she is\nto retire on 28.02.2018. The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent points\nout that the Junior viz., Dr.Narayanababu was given Director of Medical\nEducation incharge from 01.11.2016 and that no panel was prepared and he was \nplaced in full additional charge as Director of Medical Education and worked\nas Dean, Kilpauk Medical College till 25.04.2017.\n\n 4.18.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent proceeds to point\nthat willingness for Director of Medical Education post from eligible\ncandidates was called for on 19.12.2015 in Ref.No.83241/E1/1/2015 and again\nin Ref.No.52744/E1/1/2016, dated 08.07.2016 and that the eligible candidates\nwith willingness as per seniority should have been sent by the Director of\nMedical Education on 29.07.2016 in the same reference number, but this list\nis not produced by the Appellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 with a mala fide\nintention to hide the First Respondent's seniority. Further, it is\nrepresented on behalf of the First Respondent that the list would be the\nsame, as the one already sent by the same Director of Medical Education viz.,\nDr.R.Vimala on 31.12.2015 and 29.07.2016, as there is no senior person in\nDean cadre with full eligibility for Director of Medical Education to\nintervene between (1)Dr.R.Vimala, in Serial No.18; (2)Dr.S.Revwathy, in\nSerial No.21; (3)Dr.AL.Meenaskhi Sundaram, in Serial No.27; and Dr.A.Edwin \nJoe, in Serial No.38.\n\n 4.19.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent submits that\nG.O.(D)No.1210, dated 07.09.2016 which estimated the vacancy for the post of\n'Director of Medical Education' arising on 31.10.2016, as shows in\nG.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017 \nitself, no panel was prepared from 31.10.2016 to 25.04.2017 and on the date\nof estimated vacancy also, the First Respondent has a left over service of\nmore than one year.\n\n 4.20.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent refers to the\nJudgment of this Court in W.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016, dated 09.11.2016, wherein \nat paragraph No.27, it was observed as under:- \n\n \"Since the post of the Director of Medical Education has fallen vacant,\nthe First Respondent is under a statutory obligation to draw a panel for the\nappointment to the post of the Director of Medical Education and consider the\nshort listed candidates, strictly in accordance with the sub-clause (a) to\nClause 4 in Part II of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service. We hope\nand trust such exercise is to be done in a fair and transparent manner and\nstrictly in accordance with law.\"\n\nand submits that the said observation has not been followed by the Appellants\nin W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017. \n\n 4.21.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent strenuously contends\nthat the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner's representations together with the\nJudgements of this Court in W.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016, dated 09.11.2016, from \n14.11.2016 onwards addressed to the Principal Secretary, Health and Family\nWelfare Department and even to the Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu \non 14.11.2016, 25.12.2016, 13.02.2017 and 20.02.2017 had not met with any \nresponse and hence, the First Respondent filed W.P.(MD)No.3523 of 2017 in the \nlight of the Judgment in W.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016 praying for passing of an\norder by this Court to direct the Appellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 to\nappoint her as the Director of Medical Education forthwith.\n\n 4.22.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent submits that the\nAppellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 have completely violated the\nG.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated \n18.10.1993 and G.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department, \ndated 23.10.2009. The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent contends that\nthe First Respondent had a left over service of one year and four months on\nthe date of retirement of previous incumbent Dr.R.Vimala and because of the\ndeliberate administrative delay, six months was evaded to prepare a wrong\npanel which is in pure violation of G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms Department, dated 18.10.1993 and G.O.Ms.No.354, Health \nand Family Welfare (B2) Department, dated 23.10.2009 and as against the \nJudgment passed in W.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016. \n\n 4.23.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent submits that with a\nview to elongate the promotion and appointment of the First Respondent as\n'Director of Medical Education' and without complying with the Judgment of\nthis Court in W.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016, dated 09.11.2016, as well as the\nimpugned order of the Learned Single Judge passed in the writ petition, the\nAppellants have preferred the present writ appeals before this Court.\n\n(5).The Second Respondent's Pleas:- \n\n 5.1.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent submits that the \nSecond Respondent (Impleaded petitioner) was appointed as Medical Officer in\nTamil Nadu Medical Service in the year 1986, with a qualification of Post\nGraduate Degree M.D., (Anaesthesiology) in the year 1994 and was promoted as \nProfessor in Anaesthesiology in the year 2004. It is represented on behalf of\nthe Second Respondent that the Second Respondent based on his seniority and \neligibility, was promoted to the post of Dean on 18.03.2013.\n\n 5.2.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent takes a stand that \nthe Second Respondent is one of the eligible persons included in the panel\nfor promotion to the post of Director of Medical Education prepared as on the\nvacancy arose on 28.12.2015 consequent to the orders passed by this Court in\nW.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016, dated 09.11.2016. \n\n 5.3.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent proceeds to point \nthat that the Second Respondent is the most meritorious candidate with\nreference to merit and ability for selection to the post of Director of\nMedical Education, since he had received appreciation award from the Chief\nSecretary to Government of Tamil Nadu for his participation in resuscitation\nof building collapse victims at Moulivakam, Chennai during 2004 while working\nas 'Dean of Stanley Medical College'. Also that the Second Respondent had\nreceived a 'Certificate of Merit' from the District Collector, Thiruvarur\nduring Independence Day Celebrations, 2015 for securing five years\nrecognition for the Government Thiruvarur Medical College and for\nestablishing Corneal Transplantation Surgeries and also for improving the\nfacilities in Intensive Care Unit and Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department.\nBesides these, it is the plea of the Second Respondent that he had received\n'Certificate of Merit' during Republic Day Celebrations in the year 2006 for\nestablishing an Emergency Help line and maintaining an Emergency Help line \n(which is first of its kind) in the State of Tamil Nadu and also for\narranging Medical Camp for the entire judicial employees of Thiruvarur\nDistrict.\n\n 5.4.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent submits that the \nSecond Respondent had received the 'Best Teacher Award' from the Tamil Nadu \nDR.M.G.R. Medical University. Moreover, the Second Respondent was nominated \nfor the 'Best Practices Award 2015', as per proceedings of the First\nRespondent, dated 27.07.2016. As such, it is the contention of the Learned\nCounsel for the Second Respondent that the Second Respondent's services were \nappreciated by the Department and the State Government through out his \ncareer.\n\n 5.5.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent vehemently projects \nan argument that in W.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017 filed by the First Respondent,\nthis Court, found that the draft order in G.O.(D)No.948, dated 25.04.2017 was\nmanipulated by deleting the words 'Merit and Ability of the Medical Officers\nare equal' and by inserting the words 'Merit wise Dr.A.Edwin Joe is the most\nmeritorious among the candidate in the panel (The Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017)'. \n\n 5.6.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent contends that the \nSecond Respondent is very much aggrieved against the finding in the common \norder dated 20.09.2017, in W.P.(MD)No.3523 of 2017 and W.P.(MD)No.10257 of \n2017, wherein at paragraph Nos.12.2 and 12.3, an assertion was made that 'CML \nSeniority' is the basis for and appointment of Director of Medical Education.\n\n 5.7.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent submits that the post \nof Director of Medical Education comes under Special clause, sub clause (3)\nof the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules and as per Rule 3, the post\nof Director of Medical Education to be filled up by promotion from among the\nOfficer holding the post of Dean of Medical College and other equivalent\nposts. Moreover, as per Rule 4(a), promotion to the post of Director of\nMedical Education shall be made on the ground of merit and ability, seniority\nbeing considered only when merit and ability are approximately equal.\n\n 5.8.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent contends that Rule \n8(b) of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, prescribes\nqualification for the post of Director of Medical Education, which prescribes\neducational qualification and service qualification, which include\nadministrative experience for a period of not less than 2 years in one or\nmore of the post set out therein, out of which one year must be as a 'Dean of\nMedical College'.\n\n 5.9.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent comes out with an \nargument that Rule 12 of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules\nprescribes seniority and appointment as full member in the category of Civil\nSurgeons wherein it is directed that appointment as a full member of the\nservice in the post stated therein including the post of Dean of Medical\nColleges, borne on the cadre of Civil Surgeons, shall be made with reference\nto the date of regular appointment or promotion to the particular category.\n\n 5.10.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent submits that as per \nRule 12 of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, a person becomes a\nfull member of service in the post of the Dean of Medical College only from\nthe date of first regular appointment or promotion to the post and thereby\nthe seniority can be counted only by reckoning the date of appointment\n/promotion to the post of the Medical College and not otherwise.\n\n 5.11.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent brings it to the\nnotice of this Court that as per Rule 3 of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service\nSpecial Rules, the post of Clinical Associate Professor and non-clinical\nAssociate Professor can be filled up either by promotion or by direct\nrecruitment, if no qualified member is available and therefore, once the post\nof Associate Professor to be filled up with either by promotion or by direct\nrecruitment, the question of reckoning the seniority based on CML seniority\nbeyond the post of Associate Professor does not arise, as it will offend the\nright of directly recruited Associate Professors, who are not assigned with\nCML number in the post of Assistant Surgeon (entry level post). Therefore, it\nis the stand of the Second Respondent that after the post of Associate\nProfessor, any further promotion to be made must be based on 'Panel\nSeniority'.\n\n 5.12.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent refers to Rule 4(c)\nof Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules (including first explanation and\nproviso to the Rules) and contends that 'CML Seniority' is not the basis for\npromotion to the higher post and the Service Rules framed under \nArticle 309\n\nof Constitution of India clearly prescribes that the panel seniority is the\nbasis for promotion to the post of Director of Medical Education.\n\n 5.13.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent submits that \nG.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare Department, dated 23.10.2009 relied \non in the impugned common order dated 20.09.2017 of the W.P.(MD)No.3523 of \n2017 and W.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017, to follow 'CML Seniority' was subsequently \nreviewed and clarificatory amendment order in G.O.Ms.No.245, dated 30.10.2013 \nwas issued, as per which in clause (9) of the Government Order, the CML\nseniority will be taken into account as and when preparing the panel for the\npost of Senior Assistant Surgeon/Civil Surgeon/Senior Civil Surgeon/Chief\nCivil Surgeon, the Director of Medical and Rural Health Side and Associate\nProfessor/Professor in the Director of Medical Education Side. Accordingly,\nupto the Associate Professor/Professor in DME side alone, the CML seniority\nwill be followed and in short, G.O.Ms.No.354, dated 23.10.2009 cannot be\nrelied upon, when the same was subsequently amended as per G.O.Ms.No.245, \ndated 30.10.2013.\n\n 5.14.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent contends that the \nSecond Respondent was appointed as Dean on 18.03.2013, but the First \nRespondent/Writ Petitioner was appointed as Dean on 21.03.2013. Therefore, it\nis contended on behalf of the Second Respondent is the senior to the First\nRespondent in the 'Panel Seniority' in the post of Dean to be considered for\npromotion to the post of District Medical Officer following panel seniority.\n\n 5.15.Furthermore, it is the stand of the Second Respondent that even as\nper performance in medical service, he is the most meritorious candidate that\ncan be borne out of records. That apart, it is the contention of the Second\nRespondent that the Learned Single Judge in the impugned common order of the \nW.P.(MD)No.3523 of 2017 and W.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017, dated 20.09.2017, gave \na positive direction to appoint the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner, which\naffects the right of the Second Respondent, who is senior to the First\nRespondent, as per seniority in the post of Dean.\n\n 5.16.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent contends that the \nLearned Single Judge had arrived at subjective satisfaction of the records\nwith reference to serious discrepancy committed in the process of selection\nand rendered a finding that the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017\n(Dr.A.Edwin Joe) was positively recommended for promotion to the post of\nDirector of Medical Education, though merit and ability of the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner and other Medical Officers are stated to be equal.\n\n 5.17.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent submits that when \nonce the selection is vitiated due to manipulation/discrepancy committed in\nthe process of selection, the Appellants should have been directed by the\nLearned Single Judge to conduct the selection to the post of Director of\nMedical Education afresh in accordance with Rules. Added further, it is the\nplea of the Second Respondent that there cannot be any positive direction\nbeing issued to appoint the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner as Director of\nMedical Education, when the selection is based on 5 panellists, which include\nthe Second Respondent without assessment of comparative merit and ability,\nparticularly, when the Second Respondent being senior to the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner in the panel seniority.\n\n 5.18.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent contends that once \nit is made clear that the selection is not in accordance with Rule 4(a) of\nTamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, the matter is to be remanded back\nto the Respondents to redo the selection in accordance with Service Rules\nbased on comparative merit and ability of the panellists in accordance with\nlaw.\n\n 5.19.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent points out that\nwhen this Court in W.A(MD)No.1304 of 2016, on 09.11.2016, had directed the \nRespondent therein to draw a panel for appointment to the post of Director of\nMedical Education and considering the short listed candidates strictly in\naccordance with Rule 4(a) of Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, this\nCourt, while passing the orders in W.P(MD)No.10257 of 2017, should have\ndirected the Respondents therein (The Appellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017) \nto comply the legal requirement, as per Rule 4(a) of Tamil Nadu Medical\nService Special Rules by conducting selection afresh, instead of issuing\npositive direction to appoint the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner, usurping\nthe powers of the Appointing Authority.\n\n 5.20.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent also strenuously \ntakes a stand that the Learned Single Judge in the common order dated\n20.09.2017 in W.P.(MD)No.3523 of 2017 and W.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017, at \nparagraph No.20, had clearly observed that the First Respondent (The First\nAppellant in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017) had failed to record the reasons much\nless plausible reason objectively as to the comparative merit and ability of\nthe Medical Officers and also as to the seniority of the Medical Officer when\ntheir merit and ability approximately equal, then it is for the Hon'ble Court\nto remand the matter back to the Appellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 to re-\ndo the selection in accordance with law by fulfilling all the requisite legal\nrequirements with reference to the assessment of comparative merit and\nseniority etc.\n\n(6).The Second Respondent's Citations:-\n\n \n6.1.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent relies the decision\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nK.KUPPUSAMY AND ANOTHER v. STATE OF TAMIL \nNADU AND OTHERS\n reported in (1998) 8 SCC, 469, wherein at paragraph No.3, it \nis observed and held as follows:-\n\n ?The short point on which these appeals must succeed is that the\nTribunal fell into an error in taking the view that since the Government had\nindicated its intention to amend the relevant rules, its action in proceeding\non the assumption of such amendment could not be said to be irrational or\narbitrary and, therefore, the consequential orders passed have to be upheld.\nWe are afraid this line of approach cannot be countenanced. The relevant\nrules, it is admitted, were framed under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the\nConstitution. They are statutory rules. Statutory rules cannot be overridden\nby executive orders or executive practice. Merely because the Government had\ntaken a decision to amend the rules does not mean that the rule stood\nobliterated. Till the rule is amended, the rule applies. Even today the\namendment has not been effected. As and when it is effected ordinarily it\nwould be prospective in nature unless expressly or by necessary implication\nfound to be retrospective. The Tribunal was, therefore, wrong in ignoring the\nrule.?\n\n \n6.2.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent cites the decision\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSTATE OF ORISSA AND OTHERS v. PRASANA KUMAR \nSAHOO\n reported in (2007) 15 SCC 129, wherein it is observed as follows:-\n\n \"The State is bound by the constitutional scheme to treat all persons\nequally in the matter of grant of public employment as envisaged under\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. Policy decision taken by the State in\nexercise of its jurisdiction under \nArticle 162\n would be subservient to the\nrecruitment rules framed by the State either in terms of a legislative Act or\nthe proviso to \nArticle 309.\n A purported policy decision issued by way of an\nexecutive instruction cannot override the statute or statutory rules far less\nthe constitutional provisions.\"\n\n \n6.3.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent seeks in aid of the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSTATE BANK OF INDIA v. MOHD. \nMYNUDDIN\n reported in AIR 1987 SC 1889 and 1890, wherein it is laid down as \nunder:-\n\n \"Whenever promotion to a higher post is to be made on the basis of\nmerit no officer can claim promotion to the higher post as a matter of right\nby virtue of seniority alone with effect from the date on which his juniors\nare promoted. It is not sufficient that in his confidential reports it\nis recorded that his services are 'satisfactory'. An officer may be\ncapable of discharging the duties of the post held by him satisfactorily but\nhe may not be fit for the higher post. Before any such promotion can be\neffected it is the duty of the management to consider the case of the\nofficer concerned on the basis of the relevant materials. If promotion has\nbeen denied arbitrarily or without any reason ordinarily the Court can\nissue a direction to the management to consider the case of the officer\nconcerned for promotion but it cannot issue a direction to promote the\nofficer concerned to the higher post without giving an opportunity to\nthe management to consider the question of promotion. This Court is not\nby its very nature competent to appreciate the abilities, qualities or\nattributes necessary for the task, office or duty of every kind of post\nin the modern world and it would be hazardous for it to undertake the\nresponsibility of assessing whether a person is fit for being promoted to a\nhigher post which is to be filled up by selection. The duties of such\nposts may need skills of different kinds - scientific. technical,\nfinancial, industrial, commercial, administrative, educational etc. The\nmethod of evaluation of abilities or the competence of persons to be selected\nfor such posts have also become now-a-days very much refined and \nsophisticated and such evaluation should, therefore, in the public interest\nordinarily be left to be done by the individual or a committee consisting of\npersons who have the knowledge of the requirement of a given post to be\nnominated by the employer. Of course, the process of selection adopted by\nthem should always he honest and fair. It is only when the process of\nselection is vitiated on the ground of bias, mala fides or any other\nsimilar vitiating circumstances other considerations will arise. Writ\nAppeal No.1027 of 1986, D/- 25.09.1986 (Andh Pra), Reversed. AIR 1968 SC \n1113, Foll.\"\n\n 6.4.The Learned Counsel for the Second Respondent draws the attention \nof this Court to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in AJAYKUMAR DAS \nv. STATE OF ORISSA AND OTHERS reported in 2011 (11) SCC 136, at special page \n139, wherein at paragraph No.14, it is observed as under:- \n\n \"Neither the Circular dated 18.06.1982 nor the subsequent Circular\ndated 19.03.1983 modifying the earlier Circular dated 18.06.1982 can override\nthe statutory provision contained in Rule 74(b) of the Code if it results in\nreduction of pay of the employee on promotion. That Orissa Service Code has\nbeen framed under \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India is not in dispute.\nIt is well settled that Statutory Rules framed under \nArticle 309\n of the\nConstitution can be amended only by a Rule or Notification duly made\nunder \nArticle 309\n and not otherwise. Whatever be the efficacy of the\nExecutive Orders or Circulars or Instructions, Statutory Rules cannot be\naltered or amended by such Executive Orders or Circulars or Instructions nor\ncan they replace the Statutory Rules. The Rules made under \nArticle 309\n of the\nConstitution cannot be tinkered by the administrative Instructions or\nCirculars.\"\n\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017: \n\n(7).The Appellant's Submissions:-\n\n 7.1.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant contends that the\nLearned Single Judge should have dismissed the writ petition on the basis\nthat the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is not having one year left over\nservice, which is a mandatory condition, as per Rule 8(b) (iv) of Tamil Nadu\nMedical Service Special Rules. Further, it is the stand of the Appellant that\nin the earlier round of litigation, the Division Bench of this Court made a\nspecific observation that there should not be any appointment by violating\nthe Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, especially, Rule 8(b)(iv) and\nRule 4.\n\n 7.2.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant takes a plea that the\nLearned Single Judge should have dismissed the W.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017 on \nthe ground that the Second Respondent/Government by properly following the\nTamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules and upon considering the merit and\nability, had appointed the Appellant as 'Director of Medical Education'. As\nsuch, there is no illegality in the impugned order assailed in the Writ\npetition.\n\n 7.3.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant points out that the\nLearned Single Judge should have considered that the claim made by the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner seeking positive direction to appoint her in the\npost of Director of Medical Education in the earlier round of litigation\nviz., in W.P.(MD)No.6790 of 2016, was rejected by the Learned Single Judge as\nwell as by the Hon'ble Division Bench, in W.A.(MD)No.1304 of 2016. Therefore,\nthe positive direction given by the Learned Single Judge is not proper one\nand liable to be interfered with by this Court.\n\n 7.4.According to the Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant, the\nFirst Respondent/Writ Petitioner claiming the 'Civil Medical List Seniority',\nis not having any statutory force for an appointment to the post of Director\nof Medical Education and therefore, the order of the Learned Single Judge\nrequires interference.\n\n 7.5.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant takes a stand that\nthe Learned Single Judge should have considered that as per Rule 3 of the\nTamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, the post of Dean is one of the\nFeeder Category to the post of Director of Medical Education and further, as\nper Rule 8(b), the administrative experience in the post of Dean is also\nprescribed as requirement. Therefore, it is represented on behalf of the\nAppellant that having more experience 'in the Cadre of Dean' was rightly\nconsidered by the Government towards the merit and ability of the Appellant\nand consequently appointed the Appellant as 'Director of Medical Education',\nwhich is the proper one. The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant\nsubmits that as per Service Rules, 15th March of the year, is the cut off\ndate for preparing the panel and in fact, the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner is not possessing one year left over service with reference to the\ncut off date and thereby not eligible to be considered for the post of\nDirector of Medical Education.\n\n 7.6.It is represented on behalf of the Appellant that this Court in\nW.A(MD)No.1304 of 2016, dated 09.11.2016 had categorically held that there\nshould not be any violation of Rules while appointing a person to the post of\nDirector of Medical Education and thereby made it clear that the one year\nleft over service is one of the main criteria, which cannot be diluted to and\nin favour of the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner. Moreover, it is the plea\nof the Appellant that the Learned Single Judge in paragraph No.13 of the\nJudgment in the common order dated 20.09.2017 of the W.P.(MD)No.3523 of 2017 \nand W.P.(MD)No.10257 had rightly found that the Appellant is having\nexperience ahead of the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner and therefore, the\nallowing of the writ petition is not a proper one.\n\n 7.7.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant contends that since\nmerit and ability alone are the deciding factor and not the seniority based\non the date of original appointment, in this regard, the conclusion arrived\nat by the Learned Single Judge to the effect that the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner is the senior most person based on the panel prepared by\nDr.S.Geethalakshmi and further that the appointment of Appellant as Director\nof Medical Education is not proper, requires interference, in the hands of\nthis Court. The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant submits that there\nare no materials placed before the Learned Single Judge to arrive at a\nconclusion that the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is having more merit and\nability over and above the Appellant and in the absence of the same, the\nLearned Single Judge should not have allowed the writ petition filed by the\nFirst Respondent.\n\n 7.8.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant contends that 'note\nfiles' have no scope over the final decision and the Learned Single Judge\nought not to decide the issue in question based on the observations made in\nthe note file. Also that, it is the plea of the Appellant that before\narriving at a conclusion, the Learned Single Judge had not heard any one of\nthe parties.\n\n(8).The Appellant's Decisions:-\n\n \n8.1.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant cites the decision of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSTATE OF MYSORE AND ANOTHER v. SYED MAHMOOD AND \nOTHERS\n reported in AIR 1968 SC 1113 at special page 1114, wherein at \nparagraph No.2, it is observed as under:-\n\n ?2.Promotion to the posts of senior statistical assistants is made from\nthe cadre of junior statistical assistants and progress assistants. Rules\n4(3)(b) of the Mysore State Civil Services General Recruitment Rules, 1957\nrequires such promotions to be made by selection on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit, that is seniority subject to the fitness of the candidate to\ndischarge the duties of the post from among persons eligible for promotion.\nIn 1959 the seniority of junior statistical assistants was governed by the\nseniority list published on January 16, 1958. Syed Mahmood and Bhao Rao were \njunior statistical assistants. While making selections for promotion to the\nposts of senior statistical assistants from the cadre of junior statistical\nassistants in 1959, the State Government was under a duty to consider whether\nhaving regard to their seniority and fitness they should be promoted. But\nwithout considering their case at all, the State Government promoted junior\nstatistical assistants ranking below them in point of seniority. The\npromotions were irregularly made and they were, therefore, entitled to ask\nthe State Government to reconsider their case. In the circumstances, the High\nCourt could issue a writ to the State Government compelling it to perform its\nduty and to consider whether having regard to their seniority and fitness\nthey should have been promoted on the relevant dates when officers junior to\nthem were promoted. Instead of issuing such a writ, the High Court wrongly\nissued writs directing the State Government to promote them with\nretrospective effect. The High Court ought not to have issued such writs\nwithout giving the State Government an opportunity in the first instance to\nconsider their fitness for promotion in 1959.?\n\n \n8.2.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant relies on the decision\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSTATE OF BIHAR v. KRIPALU SHANKAR\n reported \nin AIR 1987 SC 1554, at special page 1555, wherein it is observed as under:-\n\n ?It would be dangerous to find an action for contempt, for the views\nexpressed in the notes file, on the discovery of unpleasant or unsavoury\nnotes, on a perusal of the notes file by the Court, after getting them\nsummoned. This would impair the independent functioning of the civil service\nessential to democracy. This would cause impediments in the fearless\nexpression of opinion by the officers of the Government. The notings on files\ndiffer from officer to officer. It may well be that the notes made by a\nparticular officer, in some cases, technically speaking is in disobedience in\nan order of the Court or may be in violation of such order but a more\nexperienced officer sitting above him can always correct him. To rely upon\nthe notings in a file for the purpose of initiating contempt, in our view,\ntherefore, would be to put the functioning of the Government out of gear. We\nmust guard against being over sensitive, when we come across, objectionable\nnotings made by officers, sometimes out of inexperience, sometimes out of\nover zealousness and sometimes out of ignorance of the nuances of the\nquestion of law involved.?\n\n \n8.3.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant refers to the Judgment\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSTATE BANK OF INDIA AND OTHERS v. MOHD\n.\n\nMYNUDDIN reported in AIR 1987 SC 1889 and 1890, whereby and where under, it \nis observed as follows:- \n\n \"Whenever promotion to a higher post is to be made on the basis of\nmerit no officer can claim promotion to the higher post as a matter of right\nby virtue of seniority alone with effect from the date on which his juniors\nare promoted. It is not sufficient that in his confidential reports it\nis recorded that his services are 'satisfactory'. An officer may be\ncapable of discharging the duties of the post held by him satisfactorily but\nhe may not be fit for the higher post. Before any such promotion can be\neffected it is the duty of the management to consider the case of the\nofficer concerned on the basis of the relevant materials. If promotion has\nbeen denied arbitrarily or without any reason ordinarily the Court can\nissue a direction to the management to consider the case of the officer\nconcerned for promotion but it cannot issue a direction to promote the\nofficer concerned to the higher post without giving an opportunity to\nthe management to consider the question of promotion. This Court is not\nby its very nature competent to appreciate the abilities, qualities or\nattributes necessary for the task, office or duty of every kind of post\nin the modern world and it would be hazardous for it to undertake the\nresponsibility of assessing whether a person is fit for being promoted to a\nhigher post which is to be filled up by selection. The duties of such\nposts may need skills of different kinds - scientific. technical,\nfinancial, industrial, commercial, administrative, educational etc. The\nmethod of evaluation of abilities or the competence of persons to be selected\nfor such posts have also become now-a-days very much refined and \nsophisticated and such evaluation should, therefore, in the public interest\nordinarily be left to be done by the individual or a committee consisting of\npersons who have the knowledge of the requirement of a given post to be\nnominated by the employer. Of course, the process of selection adopted by\nthem should always he honest and fair. It is only when the process of\nselection is vitiated on the ground of bias, mala fides or any other\nsimilar vitiating circumstances other considerations will arise. Writ\nAppeal No.1027 of 1986, D/- 25.09.1986 (Andh Pra), Reversed. AIR 1968 SC \n1113, Foll.\"\n\n \n8.4.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant seeks in aid of the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nM.V.THIMMAIAH AND OTHERS v. UNION \nPUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION AND OTHERS\n reported in 2008 (2) SCC 119, at special \npage 124, wherein it is held as under:-\n\n ?Provisions have been made for special reports and in administrative\njurisprudence special reports can be sought for in respect of any officer\nwhenever his case comes for consideration and if the Selection Committee\nwants to have an up-to-date report of that incumbent. It is an established\npractice to call for such kind of special reports. The idea is that for not\nreporting the annual confidential reports of the incumbent, why the incumbent\nshould be made to suffer. Therefore, the Selection Committee or the authority\nconcerned can always ask for annual confidential reports which were not\nwritten for a particular year by the reporting authority or by the reviewing\nauthority or in some cases it can also seek a special report. Such practice\ncannot be said to be unusual practice in administrative jurisprudence. In the\npresent case, it appears that a special report in respect of officer KRN was\nobtained and that was considered by the Selection Committee. Therefore, this\nprocedure adopted by the Selection Committee cannot be found to be arbitrary\nor in any way discriminatory.?\n\n \n8.5.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant invites the attention\nof this Court to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nSHANTI SPORTS \nCLUB AND ANOTHER v. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS\n reported in (2009) 15 SCC 705, \nat special page 708, wherein it is laid down as follows:-\n\n ?The concept of equality enshrined in \nArticle 14\n is a positive concept.\n\nArticle 14\n said article cannot be invoked for perpetuating irregularities or\nillegalities. The Court can command the State to give equal treatment to\nsimilarly situated persons, but cannot issue a mandate that the State should\ncommit illegality or pass wrong order because in another case such an\nillegality has been committed or wrong order has been passed. If any\nillegality or irregularity has been committed in favour of an individual or a\ngroup of individuals, others cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court\nor of the Supreme Court and seek a direction that the same irregularity or\nillegality be committed in their favour by the State or its\nagencies/instrumentalities.?\n\n \n8.6.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant cites the decision of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJASBIR SINGH CHHABRA AND OTHERS v. STATE OF \nPUNJAB AND OTHERS\n reported in (2010) 4 SCC 192, at special pages 193 and 194, \nwherein it is observed as under:-\n\n ?It is trite to say that while exercising power of judicial review, the\nsuperior courts should not readily accept the charge of malus animus laid\nagainst the State and its functionaries. The burden to prove the charge of\nmala fides is always on the person who moves the Court for invalidation of\nthe action of the State and/or its agencies and instrumentalities on the\nground that the same is vitiated due to mala fides and the courts should\nresist the temptation of drawing dubious inferences of mala fides or bad\nfaith on the basis of vague and bald allegations or inchoate pleadings. In\nsuch cases, wisdom would demand that the Court should insist upon furnishing\nof some tangible evidence by the petitioner in support of his/her\nallegations.\n\n In a democratic polity like ours, the functions of the Government are\ncarried out by different individuals at different levels. The issues and\npolicy matters which are required to be decided by the Government are dealt\nwith by several functionaries some of whom may record notings on the files\nfavouring a particular person or group of persons. Someone may suggest a\nparticular line of action, which may not be conducive to public interest and\nothers may suggest adoption of a different mode in larger public interest.\nHowever, the final decision is required to be taken by the designated\nauthority keeping in view the larger public interest. The notings recorded in\nthe files cannot be made basis for recording a finding that the ultimate\ndecision taken by the Government is tainted by mala fides or is influenced by\nextraneous considerations. The Court is duty bound to carefully take note of\nthe same.? \n\n 8.7.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant relies on the decision\nof the Division Bench of this Court in D.JAGANNATHAN, IAS DISTRICT COLLECTOR \nNAMAKKAL DISTRICT v. S.SATTNATHAN AND FIVE OTHERS reported in 2013 (6) CTC \n129 and 130, wherein it is held as follows:-\n\n ?A combined reading of the above said provisions would show that the\npowers of the Central Administrative Tribunal are governed and controlled by\nthe enactment. It cannot be a substitute to the powers of the High Court in\nits exercise under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India. That is the\nreason why this writ petition is filed before us seeking to invoke the said\npower under the Constitution. Therefore, the Tribunal constituted under the\nAct has to exercise its statutory functions and powers accordingly. In other\nwords, such a power, which is circumscribed by the enactment, cannot be \nallowed to be exercised beyond it.?\n\n \n8.8.The Learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant points out the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nUNION OF INDIA AND ANOTHER v. ASHOK \nKUMAR AGGARWAL\n reported in 2013 (15) JT 200, wherein at paragraph Nos.16 to \n18, it is observed as under:-\n\n ?16. The instant case is required to be considered in light of the\naforesaid settled legal propositions, statutory provisions, circulars etc.\nThe Tribunal inter alia had placed reliance on notings of the file. The issue\nas to whether the notings on the file can be relied upon is no more res\nintegra.\n\n \nIn \nShanti Sports Club v. Union of India MANU/SC/1505/2009\n : (2009) 15\nSCC 705, this Court considered the provisions of \nArticles 77(2)\n, 77(3)\n and\n\n166(2)\n of the Constitution and held that unless an order is expressed in the\nname of the President or the Governor and is authenticated in the manner\nprescribed by the rules, the same cannot be treated as an order on behalf of\nthe Government. The \nCourt further held\n:\n\n ?43.A noting recorded in the file is merely a noting simpliciter and\nnothing more. It merely represents expression of opinion by the particular\nindividual. By no stretch of imagination, such noting can he treated as a\ndecision of the Government. Even if the competent authority records its\nopinion in the file on the merits of the matter under consideration, the same\ncannot be termed as a decision of the Government unless it is sanctified and\nacted upon by issuing an order in accordance with \nArticles 77(1)\n and \n(2)\n or\n\nArticles 166(1)\n and \n(2).\n The noting in the file or even a decision gets\nculminated into an order affecting right of the parties only when it is\nexpressed in the name of the President or the Governor, as the case may be,\nand authenticated in the manner provided in \nArticle 77(2)\n or \nArticle 166(2).\n\nA noting or even a decision recorded in the file can always be\nreviewed/reversed/overruled or overturned and the court cannot take\ncognizance of the earlier noting or decision for exercise of the power of\njudicial review.?\n\n \nSimilarly, while dealing with the issue, this Court in \nSethi Auto\nService Station v. DDA MANU/SC/8127/2008\n : AIR 2009 SC 904 held:\n\n ?14. It is trite to state that notings in a departmental file do not\nhave the sanction of law to be an effective order. A noting by an officer is\nan expression of his viewpoint on the subject. It is no more than an opinion\nby an officer for internal use and consideration of the other officials of\nthe department and for the benefit of the final decision-making authority.\nNeedless to add that internal notings are not meant for outside exposure.\nNotings in the file culminate into an executable order, affecting the rights\nof the parties, only when it reaches the final decision-making authority in\nthe department, gets his approval and the final order is communicated to the\nperson concerned.? \n\n 17. In Jasbir Singh Chhabra v. State of Punjab MANU/SC/0152/2010 : \n\n(2010) 4 SCC 192, this Court held:\n\n ?35...... However, the final decision is required to be taken by the\ndesignated authority keeping in view the larger public interest. The notings\nrecorded in the files cannot be made basis for recording a finding that the\nultimate decision taken by the Government is tainted by mala fides or is\ninfluenced by extraneous considerations....?\n\n 18. Thus, in view of the above, it is evident that the notings in the\nfiles could not be relied upon by the Tribunal and Court. However, the issue\nof paramount importance remains as what could be the effect of judgment and\norder of the Tribunal dated 16.12.2011 wherein the Tribunal had directed the\nAppellants to reconsider the whole case taking into account various issues\ninter-alia as what would be the effect of quashing of the charge sheet by the\nTribunal against the Respondent; the report/recommendation of the Law\nMinistry to revoke the sanction; the effect of affidavit filed by the then\nFinance Minister after remand of the sanction matter by the High Court to the\neffect that though the competent authority had accorded sanction, the entire\nrelevant matter had not been placed before him; the directions passed by the\nHigh Court against the officers of the CBI in the cases of Shri Vijay\nAggarwal and Shri S.R. Saini; and the duration of pendency of criminal trial\nagainst the Respondent and, particularly, taking note of the stage/status of\nthe criminal proceedings, in view of the fact that the Respondent is on bail\nsince 2000 and since the investigation is completed, whether there is any\npossibility of tampering with the evidence.?\n\n(9).The First Respondent/Writ Petitioner's Contentions:-\n\n 9.1.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nsubmits that one Dr.Narayana Babu, a junior in service from 01.11.2016, was\nposted as Director of Medical Education in-charge with full additional\ncharge. Further, it is represented on behalf of the First Respondent that on\n01.11.2016, the First Respondent had the more than one year of left over\nservice and this administrative delay cannot reduce her claim of having left\nover service of more than one year.\n\n 9.2.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nprojects an argument that the impugned order was shown to be prepared on \n27.09.2016, as per Letter No.52744/E1/1/2016 for the post of Director of\nMedical Education and on that date viz., 27.09.2016 also, the First\nRespondent had more than one year of left over service and this is mentioned\nin the Judgment of this Court in W.P.(MD).No.10257 of 2017 in Paragraph 12 ?\n12(1) and 12(2).\n\n 9.3.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nforcibly contends that the words ''merits and ability of the Medical Officers\nare equal'' are deleted and the words ''Dr.A.Edwin Joe is more meritorious''\nare inserted, which proves the mala fide intention to avoid the First\nRespondent, who is the senior and more meritorious and to accommodate \nDr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017). \n\n 9.4.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nbrings it to the notice of this Court in earlier W.P.(MD)No.6790 of 2016, the\nFirst Respondent's claim was not rejected, but the writ petition was\ndismissed with an opinion 'as Dr.R.Vimala is sernior, there is no harm in\nrelaxing the Rule.' Furthermore, it is the stand of the First Respondent that\nDr.R.Vimala was senior in Civil Medical List only with Civil Medical List\nNo.3948, but her Civil Medical List number is 4018. Besides these, it is the\nsubmission of the Learned Counsel for the First Respondent that Dr.R.Vimala\nretired on 31.10.2016, and this Court had hoped and trusted that the next\npanel will be prepared, as per Law and in a transparent manner. In short, it\nis the plea of the First Respondent that in W.A.(MD).No.1304 of 2016, the\nFirst Respondent's claim was not dismissed at all.\n\n 9.5.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner comes\nout with an argument that G.O.Ms.No.354, dated 26.10.2009 is meant for a\ndynamic assured career progression and to mitigate the stagnation in\npromotion and the said Governance Orders states that 'In the Director of\nMedical Education side 5(b) for higher level posts and posts in common pool,\nthe Civil Medical List seniority will be the basis for promotion' and this is\nmentioned in the orders passed by this Court in W.A.(MD).No.1304 of 2016 and \norders in W.P.(MD).No.10257 of 2017. \n\n 9.6.The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nsubmits that 'Dean' is one of the 'Feeder Category'and Dean for two years and\ndirectors with Dean for one year is the required fulfillment to be eligible\nfor the post of Director of Medical Education, as per the G.O.Ms.No.124,\ndated 10.06.2003. Also that, it is the contention of the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner that a longer period cannot be considered as merit\nand minimum two years as 'Dean' is only a prerequisite to become\neligible for the post of Director of Medical Education.\n\n 9.7.The grievance of the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is that she\nhad more than one year left over service on 31.10.2016 i.e. the date of\nretirement of Dr.R.Vimala and originally she should have been promoted and\nappointed as Director of Medical Education on 01.02.2015 itself when\nDr.S.Geethalakshmi retired. In fact, on 01.02.2015, the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner had two years of left over service. The Learned Counsel for the\nFirst Respondent/Writ Petitioner contends that the Tamil Nadu Public Service\nCommission being the single entry for Tamil Nadu Medical Service, the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner was selected in the year 1984 batch, whereas the\nAppellant belongs to 1986 batch and in reality, the Appellant is junior to\nher in two batches. The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner strenuously submits that the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is\nnot only senior, but also more meritorious than the Appellant and therefore,\nas per Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative \nReforms Department, dated 18.10.1993 and G.O.Ms.No.124, dated 10.06.2003 and \nG.O.Ms.No.354, dated 23.10.2009, the First Respondent is entitled for\npromotion and rightly eligible to be appointed to the post of Director of\nMedical Education from the date of retirement of Dr.Geethalakshmi i.e. on\n31.01.2015.\n\n(10).Weighing the Pros and Cons:-\n\n 10.1.At the out set, this Court, points out that G.O.(Ms)No.368,\nPersonnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated 18.10.1993, speaks of \n'Public Service Preparation of Panel for appointment by promotion/by\nrecruitment by transfer' and in this regard, the Government had issued\ndetailed instructions. Furthermore, paragraph No.2 (viii) (1) of the\naforesaid G.O.(Ms)No.368, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, \ndated 18.10.1993, under the head 'Filling up of posts of Heads of\nDepartment', reads as under:- \n\n \"To fill up a single vacancy in respect of Head of Department, the\nclaims of the first 5 qualified candidates in the seniority list should be\nconsidered and a panel of atleast two names should be got approved in order\nto meet any contingency. According to the orders issued in the Government\nOrder fifth read above, to be eligible for promotion as Head of Department,\nan Officer should have not less than one year's service left before\nretirement. Those who do not have such a minimum period of left over service\nbut are otherwise found to be fully qualified, and are fit for promotion as\nHead of Department and deserve recognition on the crucial date of preparation\nof panel, should be compensated by appointing them as officers on Special\nduty with a specific assignment and with the same scale of pay as that of the\nHead of Department.\" \n\n 10.2.Besides the above, the afore stated G.O.(Ms)No.368, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms Department, dated 18.10.1993, at paragraph\nNo.2(vii)(2) specifies as follows:- \n\n \"Proposals to fill up the posts of Heads of Department (non-IAS) will\nhave to be initiated by the Secretaries to Government themselves 3 months in\nadvance of the prospective date of retirement of the existing incumbent, as\nall the relevant particulars would be available in the Secretariat. If the\ninitiative to send proposals is left with the Heads of Department themselves\nthere are found to be delays caused by subjective considerations. Such\npromotion proposals will have to be suitably monitored by the Secretaries to\nGovernment themselves so that orders are issued before the retirement of the\nexisting incumbent and the cases of those who have a minimum service of one \nyear from the date of retirement of the previous incumbent are not omitted\nbecause of administrative delay.\"\n\n 10.3.The Appellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017/Respondent Nos.2 and 3 \nin W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 have taken a stand before this Court that a 'Civil\nMedical List' number in regard to the appointment of 'Director of Medical\nEducation', has no relevance to the post of 'Director of Medical Education',\nas per the Service Rules. It is also the case of the Appellants (\nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017/Respondent Nos.2 and 3 in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) \nthat the 'Civil Medical List' number has no role for the promotions beyond\nAssociate Professor, as per the ingredients of paragraph No.2(vii) of the\naforesaid Government Order and in fact, G.O.(Ms).No.245, Health and Family\nWelfare (A2) Department, dated 30.10.2013, at paragraph No.4, under the\ncaption 'Director of Medical Education side', and paragraph Nos.5 to 9,\nenjoins as under:- \n\n \"4)DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL EDUCATION SIDE: \n\n i. In Director of Medical Education side, posts sanctioned in\nG.O.Ms.No.684, Health and Family Welfare Department, dated 18.12.1998 and \nthereafter from time to time will continue to exist for future promotions as\nper the norms of Medical Council of India.\n\n ii. The posts of Professors will be created in Pay Band-IV (Rs.37400 ?\n67000/- + Grade Pay Rs.8700) in all departments and colleges as per the norms\nof Medical Council of India.\n\n iii. The eligibility for promotion will be as per the norms of Medical\nCouncil of India. However, the promotion will be subject to availability of\nvacancies based on the sanctioned posts. Since some of them might be eligible\nfor promotion as per the norms of Medical Council of India, which may be\nearlier than the State Government?s proposed time bound promotion, their\nearlier promotion, will be subject to availability of vacancies, fulfilling\nthe qualifications as per the norms of Medical Council of India / rules\ngoverning the post and empanelment for such posts. However, it is made very\nclear that automatic promotions will not be given to Medical Officers, based\non the norms of Medical Council of India. For those who have got into Pay\nBand-IV much earlier than the promotion, their promotion will be protected\nsubject to availability of sanctioned posts.\n\n 5)Designation and scales in Director of Medical Education side will be\nsame as in Director of Medical and Rural Health Services side. Additional\ndesignation as Assistant Professor / Senior Assistant Professor / Associate\nProfessor / Professor would be depending on Medical Council of India norms.\n\n 6)Promotion will not be given during pending disciplinary proceedings\nor during currency of punishment as per the existing Disciplinary Proceedings\nrule. The Medical Officer will be considered from the next day after\ncompletion of the currency of punishment.\n\n 7)The relinquishment of right for promotion will postpone this, till\nthe Medical Officer completes 3 years and will get his due benefit from the\nnext day.\n\n 8)After getting the promotion, the right to relinquish is still be\navailable, but it will be restricted to administrative post only.\n\n 9) The CML seniority will be taken into account as and when preparing\nthe panel for the post of Senior Assistant Surgeon / Civil Surgeon / Senior\nCivil Surgeon / Chief Civil Surgeon in the Director of Medical and Rural\nHealth Services side and Associate Professor / Professor in the Director of\nMedical Education side.?\n\n 10.4.The Appellants (W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017/Respondent Nos.2 and 3 in \nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) refers to Rule 3-Recruitment-(a)-Appointment to the\nvarious classes shall be made as follows, which specific reference to Rule\n3(a)(3) of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules \nSection 21\n Part I,\nwhich runs as under:- \n\n \"(1). ...\n\n (2). ...\n\n (3).Director of Medical Education,\n Promotion from among the officers holding the posts of Deans of\nMedical Colleges, Director, King Institute, Guindy and Directors of Upgraded\nInstitutes: \n\n Provided that if no qualified and suitable officer is available for\npromotion from among the above categories, by promotion from among Civil\nSurgeons holding the posts of clinical Professors/ Associate Professors and\nNon-Clinical Professors / Associate Professors.\"\n\n 10.5.The Appellants (W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017/Respondent Nos.2 and 3 in \nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) points out that as on the crucial date for\nconsideration, i.e. on 15th March of the year, in terms of Rule 8 under the\ncaption 'Special Qualifications' (e) of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service\nSpecial Rules, the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is not eligible for\npromotion to the post of Director of Medical Education, due to less than one\nyear left over service. Also, the Appellants (W.A.(MD)No.1300 of\n2017/Respondent Nos.2 and 3 in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) case is that the \nAppellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 was appointed as Dean in the year 2010 \nitself, but the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner was appointed as Dean only\nin the year 2013.\n\n 10.6.It is seen from the communication of the then Director of Medical\nEducation (R.Vimala), Chennai-10, in the Reference No.83241/E1(1)2015, dated \n30.12.2015, addressed to the Secretary to Government, Health and Family \nWelfare Department, Chennai-9, wherein the service particulars and proforma 1\nand 2 particulars were enclosed showing the list of Medical Officers for\ndrawing a panel from among the Deans for the post of 'Director of Medical\nEducation' in respect of the panel year, 2015-2016. In the said 'Seniority\nList' of Medical Officers, at Serial No.18, the present designation of\nDr.Vimala.R was mentioned as Dean and the Institution was described as \n'Madras Medical College, Chennai'. In fact, at Serial No.21, the name of the\nFirst Respondent/Writ Petitioner (Dr.Revwathy) was shown and her designation\nwas described as Dean-cum-Special Officer. In the Seniority List of Medical\nOfficers, at Serial No.38, the name of the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of\n2017 (Dr.Edwin Joe.A) was found and his present designation was mentioned as \nDean and the Institution's name was mentioned as Coimbatore Medical College, \nCoimbatore. \n\n 10.7.In this regard, it is to be pointed out by this Court that it is\nthe stand of the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner that the Seniority list of\nMedical Officers' is arrived at as per 'Civil Medical List' only as per\nG.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department, dated 23.10.2009. \nIn this connection, this Court, significantly points out that in the\nG.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department, dated 23.10.2009, \nunder the caption 'II.Director of Medical Education Side', it is mentioned as\nunder:- \n\n ?II. Director of Medical Education side:-\n\n (i) The Medical Officers working in the Medical College Hospitals,\nInstitutions and dispensaries under the control of Directorate of Medical\nEducation shall come under the Director of Medical Education unit.\n\n (ii) The Director of Medical Education will maintain the seniority list\nof the doctors in this unit and will effect the promotions.\n\n (iii) The Director of Medical Education unit?s seniority list will be\nof two categories (1).General seniority- for all those doctors with MBBS and\ndiploma degree. (2).Specialist seniority- Speciality wise seniority for those\nwith master degree and or super speciality degree.\n\n (iv) Both the general seniority and speciality seniority will be based\non their seniority in Civil Medical List. After getting the seniority in\ntheir speciality, their future promotions would be based on the speciality\nspecific seniority and they would not have further lien on their seniority in\nCivil Medical List for the purpose of promotion. However seniority in Civil\nMedical List would be relevant only for the limited purpose of fixing inter?\n\nse seniority relative to those joining their speciality in the Director of\nMedical Education side. No equivalent promotion can be claimed by any\nspecialist based on inter?se Civil Medical List seniority on account of\ndoctors in some other speciality. Civil Medical List seniority would after\nthat be relevant only to fix the seniority in the speciality specific\nseniority list, and after that, it is that seniority list which would operate\nas illustrated in the annexure to this order.\n\n (v) For higher level posts and posts in common pool, the Civil Medical\nList seniority will be the basis for promotion.\n\n (vi) Entry into Director of Medical Education side against particular\nvacancy in any speciality should strictly be on the basis of Civil Medical\nList seniority, provided the person is eligible otherwise.\n\n (vii) Once a person joins any speciality under Director of Medical\nEducation, his inter-se seniority in the speciality would depend on the\nperson?s seniority in the Civil Medical List . The Civil Medical List would\ncontinue to decide the speciality specific seniority, till the Associate\nProfessor level. However, any person getting promoted under any speciality\nwould not entitle other persons in other specialities to be promoted\nsimilarly, if they are senior in the Civil Medical List to such a person.\nSimilarly, any person in any speciality would not be entitled to get a\npromotion, based on a junior in the same speciality having got such a\npromotion in the Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Director of\nMedical and Rural Health Services, (ESI) and Director of Public Health and\nPreventive Medicine side.\n\n (viii) A new grade viz., ?Senior Assistant Professor? equivalent to\nCivil Surgeon (CS) shall be created and a Medical Officer should have spent\nat least three years as Assistant Professor to become a Senior Assistant\nProfessor.\n\n (ix) The combined grade of Associate Professor / Professor is split\ninto two, namely, Associate Professor and Professor corresponding to Senior\nCivil Surgeon and Chief Civil Surgeon on Director of Medical and Rural Health\nServices, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine side,\nrespectively. Thus, Assistant Professor, Senior Assistant Professor,\nAssociate Professor and Professor would be in the Pay band and Grade Pays \nlaid down in the G.O.(Ms). No. 234 Finance (Pay Cell) Department. Dated\n1.06.2009, corresponding to the pre-revised scales of Rs. 9100/-, Rs.10000/-,\nRs. 12000/- and Rs.14300/- respectively.?\n\n 10.8.It comes to be known that when Dr.Geethalakshmi retired on\n31.10.2016, Dr.R.Vimala, the then Director of Medical Education, had a left\nover service of nine months (31.10.2016) and the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner, who was the next senior in Civil Medical List to Dr.R.Vimala, had\ntwo years one month left over service as on 31.01.2016. Indeed, as per\nG.O.(MD)No.446, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 18.03.2016, \nthe Government based on the estimate of vacancies, approved by it in\nG.O.(D)No.1605, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 14.12.2015, \nhad approved a regular panel consisting the name of Dr.R.Vimala (Medical\nOfficer), by relaxing Rule 8(b)(iv) of the Special Rules for Tamil Nadu\nMedical Services in favour of an individual. It is to be borne in mind that\nwhen Dr.R.Vimala, retried on 31.10.2016, the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nhad one year and four months left over service and she is to retire on\n28.02.2018.\n\n 10.9.According to the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner, the\nG.O.(D)No.1210, dated 07.09.2016, which estimated the vacancy for the post of\n'Director of Medical Education' assigning on 31.10.2016, as one mentioned in\nG.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, \nthe fact of the matter is that notwithstanding the fact that vacancy was\nestimated, no panel was prepared from 31.10.2016 to 25.04.2017 and even on \nthe date of estimated vacancy, the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner had a\nleft over service of more than one year.\n\n 10.10. At this juncture, this Court, worth recalls and recollects the\nDivision Bench Judgement of this Court, dated 09.11.2016, in W.A.(MD)No.1304 \nof 2016 filed by the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner (As an Appellant),\nwherein at paragraph Nos.25 to 27, it is observed as under:- \n\n ?25.The First Respondent has also put up a Note to the Secretary to\nthe Government, Health and Family Welfare Department, in C.No.51354/A1/2015, \nfor relaxation of the relevant Rules in favour of the third Respondent as\nshe does not have a minimum period of left over service before her\nretirement. The Secretary to the Government has noted/expressed his opinion,\nwhich reads as follows:\n\n \"Already Dr.Vimala is the senior most. More importantly, in view of\nmerit, Dr.Vimala may be considered.\"\n\nand as already pointed out, the impugned orders relaxing the Rule 8(b)(iv) of\nthe Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Medical Service and appointing her as the\nDirector of Medical Education came to be passed on 18.03.2016 by two separate \nGovernment Orders. \n\n 26. This Court after carefully scanning through the above records and\non a careful analysis of the materials available on record, is of the\nconsidered opinion that while appointing the third Respondent, the Sub-clause\n\n(a) to Clause 4 in Part II of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service\nhas not been complied with. However, it is brought to the knowledge of this\nCourt that the third Respondent retired from service on 31.10.2016 and\ntherefore, the subject matter of challenge no longer survives.\n\n 27. Since the post of the Director of Medical Education has fallen\nvacant, the First Respondent is under a statutory obligation to draw a panel\nfor the appointment to the post of the Director of Medical Education and\nconsider the short listed candidates, strictly in accordance with the Sub-\nclause (a) to Clause 4 in Part II of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical\nService. We hope and trust that such exercise is to be done in a fair and\ntransparent manner and strictly in accordance with law.?\n\n 10.11. In the instant case, it transpires that the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner had addressed a communication dated 14.11.2016, to \nthe Principal Secretary-Health and Family Welfare, Chennai, (Through the\nDirector of Medical Education, Chennai), wherein, she had stated that she is\nthe senior most Dean having all the required qualifications to fill up the\npost of Director of Medical Education, which is vacant now etc. In fact, she\nhad mentioned in the said representation that she must be posted as\n'Director of Medical Education' and also she mentioned that 'she had 29 years\nof unblemished service'. Also, she had mentioned that she joined in the Tamil\nNadu Medical Service in the year 1987 (1984 TNPSC selection) and her Civil\nMedical List number is 4018 (2005).\n\n 10.12. The First Respondent/Writ Petitioner submitted another\nrepresentation, dated 25.12.2016, addressed to the Chief Secretary,\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu, Chennai (Through proper channel), wherein she had \nreferred to the earlier representation, dated 14.11.2016, addressed to the\nHealth Secretary to the Tamil Nadu Government. In reality, the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner had averred in her afore stated second\nrepresentation, dated 25.12.2016, to the effect that she was promoted as Dean\nin March 2013 and worked in 'Kanyakumari, Coimbatore and Madurai Medical \nColleges as 'Dean' and now working as Dean, Karur Medical College, Karur'.\n\n 10.13. The First Respondent/Writ Petitioner gave a third\nrepresentation, dated 25.12.2016 addressed to the Principal Secretary-Health\nand Family Welfare, Chennai (Through the Director of Medical Education,\nChenani), wherein she had made a request that 'she must be posted as Director\nof Medical Education'. The First Respondent/Writ Petitioner had addressed a\ncommunication, dated 13.02.2017, addressed to the Chief Secretary, Government \nof Tamil Nadu, Chennai, wherein she had mentioned about her earlier\nrepresentations, dated 14.11.2016, 25.12.2016, and 07.02.2017 and also stated\nthat she is the eligible senior most and meritorious candidate and requested\nto consider her representation, apart from seeking personal interview,\nwherein she may be allowed to present the facts.\n\n 10.14. The First Respondent/Writ Petitioner had addressed a letter in\nreference No.499/E/17, dated 20.02.2017 (Through the Director of Medical\nEducation, Chennai) addressed to the Principal Secretary, Health and Family\nWelfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, Chennai, whereby and where under, she had \ncategorically mentioned that she had made four representations i.e. on\n14.11.2016, 25.12.2016, 07.02.2017 and 13.02.2017 and also stated that as\nthere was no positive response, she was subjected to much physical and mental \nagony. \n\n 10.15. It is not out of place for this Court to make a pertinent\nmention that Rule 4(a) to (c) of Part II of \nSection 21\n of Tamil Nadu Medical\nService Special Rules, speaks of 'promotion' and the same runs as under:-\n\n \"4.Promotion ? (a) Promotion to the following posts shall be made on\ngrounds of merit and ability, seniority being considered only where merit and\nability are approximately equal:\n\n Director of Medical and Rural Health Services.\n\n Director of Family Welfare.\n\n Director of Medical Education.\n\nCivil Surgeons in hospitals or in Stations; Personal Assistant to the\nDirector of Medical and Rural Health services, Medical Officer to the Chennai\nCity Police, Director of King Institute, Guindy and Deputy Directors, King\nInstitute, Guindy.\n\n Principal, School of Indigenous Medicine.\n\n Clinical and Non-Clinical Associate Professors.\n Woman State Family Planning Officer. \n\n State leprosy Officer.\n\n Assistant State Drugs Controller.\n\n Senior Drugs Inspector.\n\n State Tuberculosis Officer.\n\n Deputy Assistant Director, King Institute, Guindy.\n Civil Surgeon Specialists.\n\nJoint Directors of Medical and Rural Health Services and Joint Director of\nServices.\n\nSuperintendent, Government Tuberculosis Hospital, Nagercoil.\nAdditional Director of Medical and Rural Health Services (Family Welfare).\n\n (b) Members of the service holding posts, substantively or in an\nofficiating capacity, in the category of Non-Clinical Lecturers, Tutor/\nAssistant Professors (including officiating Non-clinical Professors) or\nClinical Lecturers, Senior Residents / Assistant Professors (including\nofficiating clinical Professors) or Assistant Surgeons in the King Institute,\nGuindy or Assistant Surgeons holding posts in Specialist Departments in which\nit is considered necessary to retain them in the interests of continuity and\nof the public may be promoted a supernumerary Civil Surgeons and for that\npurpose the posts which they hold in the said categories shall be raised to\nthe status of supernumerary Civil Surgeons in Category 1 of Class 1 either\npermanently or temporarily. The Government may decide, from time to time,\nthe period or periods for which the posts should be raised to the status of\nsupernumerary Civil Surgeons. So long as, such members hold the said \nsupernumerary posts of Civil Surgeons, the cadre of Category 1 of Class 1\nshall be deemed to have been increased and the cadre of the category of Non-\n\nClinical Lecturers, Tutors / Assistant Professors, Clinical Lecturers or\nClinical Tutors or Assistants or Assistant Surgeons in the King Institute,\nGuindy or Assistant Surgeons in the General Line shall be deemed to have been\nreduced by the number of posts of supernumerary Civil Surgeons so held.\n\n (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 12, if a Medical\nOfficer, who is senior to another Medical Officer in the cadre of Assistant\nSurgeons possesses the post-graduate qualification prescribed for the post\nof Associate Professor (either Clinical or Non-Clinical) in a particular\nspeciality, but does not possess the teaching experience for the period\nprescribed in that speciality anywhere, the Junior Medical Officer possesses\nboth the Post-Graduate qualification and the prescribed teaching experience\nin the speciality, the Junior may be appointed temporarily in any future of\nexisting vacancy inthat speciality, and continued till the senior acquires\nthe prescribed teaching experience. On acquiring such teaching experience,\nthe senior Medical Officer shall, subject to sub-rule (a), be appointed as\nReader in the place of the junior or in any other existing vacancy and for\npurposes of seniority in the cadre of Associate Professor, the Senior Medical\nOfficer shall be the senior.\n\n Explanation ? For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the\nrule shall apply to all Medical Officers who may be on deputation for\ntraining or higher service in India or abroad or who have been posted in\ncorporate institutions:\n\n Provided that a Junior Medical Officer in the cadre of Assistant\nSurgeons shall be the senior in the category of Reader in the particular\nspeciality as against the senior Medical Officer, if at the time of\npromotions of the junior Medical Officer as Reader, the senior Medical\nOfficer does not possess the post-graduate qualification.\n\n Explanation ? A Person shall be deemed to have acquired the post-\ngraduate qualification in a speciality on the next date of last examination\n(which may include oral, written or practical examination\"\n\n 10.16. It is to be noted that the Second Respondent (In W.A.(MD)No.1300\nof 2017) was appointed as Dean on 18.03.2013, but the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner was appointed as Dean on 21.03.2013. Therefore, the Second\nRespondent claims that he is senior to the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nin the panel seniority, in the post of Dean to be considered for promotion to\nthe post of Director of Medical Education following the panel seniority.\n\n 10.17. There is no two opinion of a prime fact that the post of\n'Director of Medical Education' comes under Rule 3(a) (3) of \nSection 21\n Part\nI of Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules. As per Rule 3(a)(3) of Part I\n\nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, the post of\nDirector of Medical Education is to be filled up by promotion from among the\nofficers holding the post of Deans of Medical Colleges, Director, King\nInstitute, Guindy and Directors of Upgraded Institutes etc.\n\n 10.18. In terms of Rule 4 of \nSection 21\n Part I of Special Rules for\nTamil Nadu Medical Service under the head 'Promotion', the promotion to the\npost of Director of Medical Education shall be made on the basis of merit and\nability, seniority being considered only when merit and ability are\napproximately equal. Rule 8-'Special Qualifications' of \nSection 21\n Part I of\nTamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, specifies qualifications for the\npost of Director of Medical Education, which enjoins educational\nqualifications and service qualifications, which includes administrative\nexperience for not less than two years period in one or more of the posts\nmentioned therein, out of which, one year must be as a Dean of Medical\nCollege.\n\n 10.19. Rule 12 (a) to (d) of \nSection 21\n Part I of Tamil Nadu Medical\nService Special Rules, deals with 'Seniority and Appointment as full member\nin the cadre of Civil Surgeon' and the same runs as follows:- \n\n \"12.Seniority and appointment as full member in the cadre of Civil\nSurgeons ? (A) Notwithstanding anything contained in General rule 35, the\nseniority of Civil Surgeons shall be determined with reference to their rank\nin the cadre of Assistant Surgeons. However, appointment as a full member of\nthe service in the following posts borne on the cadre of Civil Surgeons shall\nbe made with reference to the date of first regular appointment or promotion\nto the particular category.\n\nDirector, Tuberculosis Institute and Tuberculosis Clinics and Professor of\nTuberculosis, Medical College, Chennai.\n\n Director, King Institute, Guindy.\n\n Deputy Director, King Institute, Guindy.\n\n Non-Clinical Associate Professors.\n\n Clinical Associate Professors.\n\n The Deans of the Medical Colleges.\n\n The Directors of Upgraded Institutes.\n\n State Leprosy Officer.\n\n State Tuberculosis Officer\n Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services and Joint Director\nof Health Services.\n\n Additional Director of Medical and Rural Health Services (Family\nWelfare).\n\n (b) In case a member of the service referred to in sub-rule (b) of rule\n4 is promoted as a Supernumerary Civil Surgeon in an officiating Capacity, he\nshall, on the expiry of the period for which he was so promoted, revert to\nthe category from which he was promoted. \n\n (c) No person shall be eligible for appointment as a full member of the\nservice in any of the posts of Supernumerary Civil Surgeons referred to in\nsub-rule (b) of rule 4 unless his turn for such appointment arises in\naccordance with his rank in the cadre of Assistant Surgeons.\n\n (d) In case any Director of the Upgraded Institute, who does not attain\nthe age of 55 years before expiry of his existing term, he shall be confirmed\nonly when he is granted extension of service in the post of Director up to\nthe age of 55 years, or beyond. Such confirmation shall be with\nretrospective effect.\"\n\n 10.20. In regard to the aspect of 'Civil Medical List Seniority' is\nconcerned, a clarificatory Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.245, Health and\nFamily Welfare (A2) Department, dated 30.10.2013, was issued by the State \nGovernment in respect of Tamil Nadu Medical Service and Rule 4 (a) of the\nsaid clarificatoy Government Order, in a crystalline fashion, points out that\nthe Civil Medical List Seniority will be taken into account, as and when\npreparing the panel for the post of Senior Assistant Surgeon/Civil\nSurgeon/Senior Civil Surgeon/Chief Civil Surgeon, in the Director of Medical\nand Rural Health Services side and Associate Professor/Professor in the\nDirector of Medical Education side and as such, one cannot press into service\nthe ingredients of G.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department,\ndated 23.10.2009, in the considered opinion of this Court. Moreover, even as\nper Clause 7 of G.O.Ms.No.354, Health and Family Welfare (B2) Department, \ndated 23.10.2009, the Civil Medical List number has no sanctity beyond the\npost of 'Associate Professor Level'.\n\n 10.21. It is to be pointed out that the term 'Seniority' in simple\nEnglish means a longer life than of another thing or person taken for\ncomparison. Insofar as the Government servant is concerned, it means 'the\nlength of service', if the service of an individual is longer than that of\nanother person, the first named is called 'Senior to the other'. An employee\nmust belong to the same stream before he can claim seniority vis-a-vis.\n\n \n10.22. It is to be remembered that 'Seniority' is a comparative concept\nbetween 'Employees', who are equally circumstanced. The question of\n'Seniority' is to be determined with reference to the Rules in force on the\ndate of appointment to the service, as per decision of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in \nUNION OF INDIA v. S.S.UPPAL\n reported in 1996 (2) SCC 168.\n\n 10.23. At this stage, this Court, cites the decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in H.V.PARDASANI v. U*NION OF INDIA, reported in AIR 1995 SC \n781, wherein it is observed that there is no dispute that in the absence of\nany special provisions, regulating the determination of seniority, length of\ncontinuous service in any particular grade would be the basis for determining\nseniority in that grade etc.\n\n 10.24. In determining 'Inter se' seniority, of employees, the length of\nactual service rendered in the same cadre or grade would be generally\naccepted criterion. Furthermore, 'Seniority' can be a determinative factor in\nconsideration for promotion and it becomes an integral part of \nArt.16(1)\n of\nthe Constitution of India.\n\n \n10.25. It cannot be forgotten that in the decision of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in \nRAJBIR SINGH v. STATE OF HARYANA\n reported in 'JUDGMENT TODAY' 1996 \n(1) SC 222, wherein it is observed that 'Persons who might be affected must\nbe made a party'.\n \nContinuing further, it is to be pointed out that 'Gradation\nList' has to be prepared in accordance with the 'Principles of Seniority'\nlaid down either statutory or by instructions or Rules and normally, the\nvalidity of such a list is required to be judged with reference to such\n'Principles of Seniority' as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nUNION\nOF INDIA v. H.R.PATANKAR\n reported in AIR 1984 SC 1587.\n\n 10.26. Apart from the above, it is to be pointed out that prior to the\npublication of 'Gradation List', certain formalities are required to be\nadhered. In this regard, 'Draft Gradation List' is to be prepared and then\ncirculated to the concerned employees, so as to invite\nrepresentations/objections from them. Thereafter, the concerned authority is\nto consider the objections raised by the aggrieved individuals, ultimately,\nthe approved 'Gradation List' is to be published. Ordinarily, no reliance can\nbe placed on a 'Gradation List', unless it is circulated for the purpose of\ninviting objections from the affected persons and this springs from the\n'Principles of Natural Justice'.\n\n 10.27. \nIn fact, 'Redrawing of a Seniority' or 'Gradation List', without\nany reason was held to be an ordinary one, as per decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in \nSUSHMA MUTREJA v. UNION OF INDIA\n reported in AIR 2001 SC \n2452.\n\n \n10.28. One cannot brush aside a pivotal fact that 'Assigning of\nSeniority' arises only in relation to employees, who are similarly placed\ni.e. where they are functioning in the same rank, grade or cadre, beyond\ndoubt, 'Seniority' is a comparative or a relevant concept, in the earnest\nopinion of this Court. Even in case of 'Selection Post', the 'Seniority' in\nthe 'Feeder Grade', from which, the selection is to be made, can be an\nimportant factor, because employees of a given seniority are treated in the\nzone of consideration while granting promotion to the selection posts, as per\ndecision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nD.D.SHARMA (COL) v. UNION OF INDIA\n \nreported in 1993 (1) SLR 584 (Delhi).\n\n 10.29. No wonder, the purpose of assigning seniority is to enable the\nfilling up of promotional posts. Although, under many statutory Rules or\nadministrative instructions, 'Seniority' is not a prime factor, in granting\npromotion, e.g. when the Rules speak of Seniority-cum-Merit or Merit-cum-\nSeniority, yet it is hard to find rules or instructions, which completely\nignore seniority in relation to 'Promotion'.\n\n 10.30.It is to be pointed out that an 'Executive Order' is to be passed\nin conformity with the 'Rules'. In fact, the State Government's power to\nissue Executive instructions is limited to filling up of the gaps or reaching\nthe area, which otherwise is not covered by the existing Rules. The Executive\npower of the State, if it does not violate the Provision(s) of the\nConstitution of India or any Law, it cannot be circumscribed.\n\n 10.31. As a matter of fact, 'Duty to act Judicially' will arise from\nthe very nature of function intended to be performed. If there is power to\ndecide and determine to the prejudice of an individual, 'Duty to act\nJudicially' is very much implicit in exercise of such power. Furthermore, the\n'Power of Judicial Review' is exercised to ensure that a person receives a\nfair treatment and not to ensure that the conclusion with the authority\nreaches is necessarily correct, in the eye of the Court.\n\n 10.32. It may be out of place for this Court to make a significant\nmention that as per G.O.(Ms)No.99, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (A) \nDepartment, dated 21.09.2015, the grievance petition should be redressed\nwithin a maximum period of one month of its receipt and it should be with a\n'Speaking Order' in the event of a redressal or rejection, if found\nnecessary. Besides this, in the afore stated Government Order, there is a\nreference to W.P.No.20527 of 2014, dated 01.08.2014, wherein a direction was\nissued to issue the Government Order directing all the concerned authorities\nto redress the grievance petition within a maximum period of 30 days from the\nreceipt of grievance petition with a 'Speaking Order', in case for some\nreason, additional time is required, the person who has made the\nrepresentation would be informed in writing for the extended period of time.\n\n \n10.33. It is to be pointed out that a power of relaxation cannot be\nutilised to give general exemption for compliance with regulations regardless\nof Justice and Equity to make unqualified persons eligible for promotion, as\nper decision in \nLAKSHMAN v. ANDHRA PRADESH STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD\n reported \nin 1998 LAB IC 927 (AP).\n \nThe power of relaxation to be exercised in public\ninterest in a given case and there cannot be any whole sale relaxation, as\nper decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nP.SADAGOPAN v. FOOD CORPORATION OF \nINDIA\n reported in AIR 1997 SC 2700.\n\n 10.34. \nIn fact, in the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJANKI\nPRASAD PARIMOO v. STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR\n reported in AIR 1973 SC 930, the \nConstitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court observes that 'Selection\nmeans that the man selected for promotion must be of merit. Where promotion \nis by seniority, merit takes the second place, but when it is a selection,\nmerit takes first place and it is implicit in such a selection that the man\nmust not be just average'.\n\n \n10.35. It is well known that promotion to a 'Selection Post' is not a\nmatter of right, which can be claimed merely by seniority, ordinarily in\nconsidering the question of a public servant's claim for promotion to a\nSelection Post, his seniority and merit will have to be considered. Where\nthe criterion is 'Merit-cum-Suitability' and after consideration and\nevaluation merit and suitability of a junior are found to be superior, it was\nheld that 'Seniority' has no role to play, as per decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in \nSarat Kumar Dash & Ors v. Biswajit Patnaik & Ors\n reported \nin 1995 SCC, Supl. (1) 434.\n\n 10.36. \nIn the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nNIRANJAN PRASAD \nSINHA v. UNION OF INDIA\n, reported in AIR 2001 SC 2269, it is held that\n'Seniority among persons holding similar posts in the same cadre has to be\ndetermined on the basis of length of service, and not other fortuitous\ncircumstance'.\n\n \n10.37. At this stage, this Court, pertinently points out that 'if there\nis any omission to adhere to the procedure for making promotion, then the\npromotion granted is liable to be cancelled, as per decision in \nKAMESHWAR \nPRASAD v. STATE OF BIHAR\n, reported in 1995 (6) SCC 44.\n\n 10.38. A mere glance of the impugned common order of the Learned Single \nJudge dated 20.09.2017, in W.P.(MD)No.3523 of 2017 and W.P.(MD)No.10257 of \n2017, wherein at paragraph No.17, it is observed as under:- \n\n \"This Court, prima facie, is of the view that the directions issued by\nthe Honourable Division Bench in the aforesaid judgment have not at all been\nadhered to by the First Respondent strictly in accordance with law, as the\nFirst Respondent has given a go-by to the same while considering the third\nRespondent for the promotion to the post of the Director of Medical\nEducation.\"\n\n 10.39. Also, in the aforesaid impugned common order in W.P.(MD)Nos.3523 \nand 10257 of 2017, dated 20.09.2017, at paragraph No.20, it is mentioned as\nfollows:- \n\n \"Further, this Court holds that the First Respondent while considering\nthe name of the third Respondent for the promotion to the post of the\nDirector of Medical Education, failed to record reasons much less plausible\nreasons objectively as to the comparative merit and ability of the Medical\nOfficers and also as to the seniority of the Medical Officers, when their\nmerit and ability are approximately equal, based on which, the third\nRespondent has been appointed to the said post. Moreover, as on the crucial\ndate, the petitioner was having the left over service of more than one year\nand the administrative delay in preparing the panel cannot deprive the\npetitioner of her promotion to the post of the Director of Medical Education.\nTherefore, the impugned Government Orders require to be interfered with by\nthis Court in exercise of the powers under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of\nIndia.\" \n\n 10.40. In fact, in the common order dated 20.09.2017, in\nW.P.(MD)Nos.3523 and 10257 of 2017 at paragraph No.12.5 and 14, it is \nobserved as follows:- \n\n \"12.5. However, on perusal of the draft order in G.O.(D)No.948, Health\nand Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, this Court finds that\nthe words 'the merit and ability of the Medical Officers are equal', are\ndeleted and the words 'Dr.A.Edwin Joe is the senior most Dean and senior of\nall promotional level. Further, he was the first to complete more than 10\nyears of teaching experience. Merit wise also he is the most meritorious\namong the candidates in the panel.' are inserted.\n\n 14. However, this Court finds that the above grounds on which, the\nthird Respondent has been positively considered for the promotion to the post\nof the Director of Medical Education, are not in accordance with Sub-Clause\n\n(a) to Clause 4 in Part II of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service.\n\nUpon consideration of the relevant materials placed on record, this Court\nholds that the date on which a candidate was appointed as a Dean, has no\nrelevance at all, while considering his/her name for the promotion to the\npost of the Director of Medical Education.\"\n\n 10.41. Insofar as the observation made in G.O.(D)No.948, Health and\nFamily Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, to the effect that 'among\nfive Medical Officers, disciplinary action has been initiated against\nDr.A.L.Meenakshi Sundaram under Rule 17(b) of the Tamil Nadu Civil Services\n(Discipline and Appeal) Rules', however, against charge memo, the above\nMedical Officer has filed W.P.No.42367 of 2016 before the High Court of\nMadras. In its interim order, dated 02.12.2017, the Hon'ble High Court of\nMadras had directed the Respondents to consider the name of Dr.A.L.Meenakshi \nSundaram for promotion to the post of Director of Medical Education based on\ninclusion of the name in the panel, which has reference to the impugned\ncharge memo, the Appellants' stand in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017, is that the\nGovernment had considered the eligibility of the Second Respondent\n(Dr.A.L.Meenakshi Sundaram) without reference to the disciplinary action\ninitiated against him and ultimately, the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of\n2017 (Dr.A.Edwon Joe), was found meritorious among the candidates in the \npanel and as per seniority in the cadre of Dean as well as meritorious, he\nwas appointed and posted as Director of Medical Education, as per\nG.O.(D)No.950, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017. \n\n 10.42. In the instant case, the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner has\ntaken a stand that the period of service as Dean by the Medical Officers was\nnot taken as an eligible criteria and the seniority in the Civil Medical List\nis to be considered for promotion to the post of Director of Medical\nEducation and Dr.S.Geethalakshmi, Senior in the Civil Medical List was\nappointed as Director of Medical Education, as per G.O.(D)No.123, Health and\nFamily Welfare (A) Department, dated 31.01.2010 and not based on her joining\ndate as Dean. \n\n 10.43. But the Second Respondent (In W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017), claims \nthat he is senior to the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner in the panel\nseniority in the post of Dean to be considered for promotion to the post of\nDirector of Medical Education following the panel seniority, besides he being\na meritorious candidate even as per performance in Medical service. But the\nAppellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 (Dr.A.Edwon Joe), takes a plea that as\nper Sub Rule 8(b) of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special\nRules, Part I, under the caption 'Special Qualifications' to the post of\nDirector of Medical Education, the administrative experience in the post of\nDean is very much relevant and apart from that, eligibility of one year left\nover service prior to the date of retirement is must for the selection to the\nsaid post. Furthermore, it is the contention of the Appellant (In\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) that the date of retirement of the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner is 28.02.2018 and thereby she is not having one\nyear left over service as on the date of selection and appointment viz., on\n25.04.2017.\n\n 10.44. In regard to the stand taken on behalf of the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner that a panel of atleast two names should be got\napproved as per G.O.(Ms.).No.368, Personnel and Administrative Reforms \nDepartment, dated 18.10.1993, it is the plea of the Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 (Dr.A.Edwin Joe), that 'two candidates' to be\nselected is only to meet the 'Contingency' and just because one candidate was\nselected, it is not an illegal one.\n\n 10.45. At this stage, this Court, relevantly points out that in terms\nof Sub clause (a) to clause 4 in Part II of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu\nMedical Service Special Rules, promotion to the post of Director of Medical\nEducation, shall be made on the grounds of merit and ability, seniority being\nconsidered only where merit and ability are approximately equal. However, the\nFirst Appellant/First Respondent (The Government of Tamil Nadu) in\nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017, took into consideration the date of promotion as\nDean for considering the seniority among the eligible officers. Obviously,\nthe First Appellant (The Government of Tamil Nadu) in W.A.(MD)NO.1300 of \n2017, had not taken into consideration of a very primordial fact that the\nthen Director of Medical Education (Dr.S.Geethalakshmi) sent a panel for\npromotion to the post of Director of Medical Education to the Secretary to\nGovernment, Health and Family Welfare Department, mentioning the names of (1) \nDr.R.Vimala - one year left over service not available. Officer on Special\nDuty (OSD) can be given; (2) Dr.S.Revathy - senior most Civil Medical List\neligible; (3) Dr.AL.Meenakshi Sundaram - Eligible; and (4) Dr.Edwin Joe -\nEligible. In fact, the then Director of Medical Education had clearly\nmentioned that the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is the senior most in the\nCivil Medical List etc.\n\n 10.46. Admittedly, before the Learned Single Judge, in W.P.(MD)No.3523 \nof 2017 (filed by Dr.S.Revwathy as Writ Petitioner-First Respondent in\nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017), the Second Respondent in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 \n(Dr.A.L.Meenakshi Sundaram) was not a party to the proceedings. Likewise, the\nsaid Dr.A.L.Meenakshi Sundaram was not arrayed as party to the proceedings in \nW.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017. \n\n 10.47. In fact, the then Director of Medical Education, Kilpauk,\nChennai in the communication addressed to the Principal Secretary to\nGovernment, Health and Family Welfare Department, Secretariat, Chennai, dated \n27.09.2016, had mentioned in Serial No.1, the name of Dr.A.Edwin Joe,\nCoimbatore Medical College, Coimbatore (The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of \n2017), as Civil Medical List No.2005, as 4821 and stated that he was promoted\nas Dean in the panel year 2009-2010. As a matter of fact, the First\nRespondent/Writ Petitioner (Dr.S.Revwathay, Dean cum Special Officer-Karur\nMedidcal College, Karur) was shown as serial No.2005, as '4018' and mentioned\nthe panel year, in which she was promoted as Dean as 20.12.2013. Indeed, the\nSecond Respondent in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 (Dr.A.L.Meenakshi Sundaram, \nDean, Thiruvarur Medical College, Thiruvarur) was mentioned as Civil Medical\nList-2005 '4220' and the panel year, in which, he was promoted was mentioned\nas 20.12.2013. In the annexure-I of the said communication, the date of\njoining as Dean in respect of the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017\n(Dr.A.Edwin Joe) was mentioned as 03.03.2010 and the First Respondent/Writ \nPetitioner (Dr.S.Revwathy) was mentioned as 21.03.2013 and the Second \nRespondent in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 viz., Dr.A.L.Meenakshi Sundaram was \nmentioned as 18.03.2013. \n\n 10.48. A perusal of the draft Order-1, in respect of G.O.(D)No.948,\nHealth and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, this Court, at\npage 579 of the file, shows that after the words, 'the Government have again\nexamined merit and ability of the above five Medical Officers and found that\nthe words 'merit and ability of the Medical Officers are equal', had been\nscored out and on the left hand side of C.No.29643/A1/16, it is written in\nblack ink as under:- \n\n \"Dr.A.Edwin Joe is the senior most Dean and senior of all promotional\nlevel. Further, he was first to complete more\n 10 years\nthan / teaching experience. Merit wise also, he is the meritorious among the\ncandidates in the panel.\"\n\n 10.49. Further, at page No.579, in C.No.29643/A1/16, this Court, on\nperusal, finds that after the words 'according to the seniority in the cadre\nof Dean, the words 'and as well as meritorious' (written in black ink), it is\nmentioned as Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017) is the \nsenior most medical officer among the five Medical Officers. Even though, the\naforesaid scoring out of the words 'merit and ability of the Medical Officers\nare equal', do find a place in the draft order in G.O.(D)No.948, Health and\nFamily Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, at page 579 of the file in\nC.No.29643/A1/16 and notwithstanding the fact that on the left hand side\nmargin of the said file, the words beginning from Dr.A.Edwin Joe is the\nsenior most Dean etc., as afore stated, were written in black ink, they are\nclearly an interpolation and significantly, even in the draft G.O.(D)No.948,\nHealth and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, no signature of\nthe official who made that scoring of or writing of the words as afore\nstated, is seen and the absence of even the short initial or signature of the\nconcerned person/official, who had made correction, as described above,\nclearly creates a simmering doubt in the mind of this Court and to put it\nsuccinctly, the scoring out of the words beginning from 'the merit and\nability of the Medical Officers are equal' and the inserted writings made on\nthe left hand side margin of the page No.579 in C.No.29643/A1/16, to say the\nleast, does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Therefore, this Court,\ncomes to an irresistible and inescapable conclusion that the words\n'Dr.A.Edwin Joe is the senior most Dean and senior of all promotional level\netc.' are clearly interpolated and the same cannot be brushed aside in a\nlighter fashion.\n\n 10.50. In view of the forgoing discussions and reasons, this Court,\nopines that the name of Dr.A.Edwin Joe (The Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of \n2017) was positively recommended for promotion to the post of Director of\nMedical Education and the same is not legally tenable, in the considered\nopinion of this Court.\n\n 10.51. On the crucial date, the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner was\nhaving a left over service of more than one year and the administrative delay\nin preparing the panel cannot act as a detriment in denying the chances of\nher promotion to the post of Director of Medical Education. Apart from that,\nan authority must pass a reasoned order and definitely, there must be an out\nline of process of reasoning, which will have an appearance of justice. An\nunreasoned order may be a just, but may not appear to be so, to an\n'Aggrieved Person'.\n\n 10.52. Insofar as the present case is concerned, Rule 4(a) of Part II\nof \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, viz., 'the\npromotion to the post of Director of Medical Education shall be made on the\nground of merit and ability, seniority being considered only where merit and\nability are approximately equal' were not considered in proper real\nperspective by the First Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017/First\nRespondent and in fact, the First Appellant/First Respondent had considered\nthe Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 (Dr.A.Edwin Joe) positively for\npromotion to the post of Director of Medical Education, which is not in\naccordance with the afore stated Rule 4(a) in Part II of \nSection 21\n of the\nTamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules.\n\n 10.53. Furthermore, the impugned G.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family \nWelfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, does not spell out tangible\nreasons in a qualitative, quantitative and an objective fashion, in regard to\nthe consideration of comparative merit and ability of the Medical Officers\nand also as to the seniority of Medical Officers, when their merit and\nability are approximately equal. As a matter of fact, the impugned\nG.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, \ndoes not speak about the aspect of the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner\nhaving left over service of more than one year on the crucial date, viz.,\n15th March of the year, in which, the selection for appointment is made, as\nper Sub Rule 8(e) of \nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special\nRules. Moreover, in regard to the filling up of post of Head of Department,\nto fill up a single vacancy in respect of Head of Department, the claims of\nthe first five qualified candidates in the seniority list should be\nconsidered and a panel of atleast two names should be got approved in order\nto meet any contingency, as per G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative \nReforms Department, dated 18.10.1993. \n\n 10.54. In the present case, the spirit and tenor of approving the panel\nof atleast two names in order to meet any contingency, as per requirement of\nG.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department, dated \n18.10.1993, was not addressed to and merely the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 \nof 2017 (Dr.A.Edwin Joe) was selected, which is nothing but a procedural\nirregularity, which vitiates the selection.\n\n 10.55. When the selection is not in accordance with Rule 4(a) of\n\nSection 21\n of the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Special Rules, then, this Court\nis of the considered view that the entire subject matter in issue is to be\nremitted back to the Appellants in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017, for carrying out\nthe selection de novo in accordance with service rules based on comparative\nmerit and ability of the panelists in accordance with law, as opined by this\nCourt.\n\n 10.56. Turning now to the plea that a Court of Law cannot issue any\npositive direction of promotion being given to the concerned person, at this\nstage, this Court, relevantly points out the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in STATE OF MYSORE VS C. R. SESHADRI & ORS reported in AIR 1974 SC 460, \nwherein it is observed that 'In our constitutional scheme, a broad three-fold\ndivision exists. The power to promote an officer belongs to the Executive and\nthe judicial power may control or review government action, but cannot extend\nto acting, as if, it were the Executive. The Court may issue directions, but\nleave it to the Executive to carry it out. The judiciary cannot promote or\ndemote officials, but may demolish a bad order of Government or order\nreconsideration on correct principles.'\n\n 10.57. It is to be pointed out that the proper course for a Court of\nLaw to adopt is to direct the authorities concerned that the case of an\nindividual be considered afresh by the selection committee based on Rules and\nRegulations and in accordance with law. In short, in exercising its power of\njudicial review, the High Court cannot give direction to the authorities, in\nregard to the method for selection or promotion. To put it differently, if a\npromotion is denied wrongfully, then a Court of Law will not only direct re-\nconsideration of the case, but may issue necessary directions.\n\n 10.58. It is not out of place for this Court to make a pertinent\nmention that even if a Court of Law or Tribunal comes to a conclusion that\ndenial of promotion to a individual was unjustified, since it was passed on\nthe basis of adverse remarks, which were vague or not sufficient, it is not\ncompetent to direct the authorities to grant promotion to the concerned\nemployee, but can give directions for reconsideration of the case in\naccordance with law, as per the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nSTATE OF MADHYA PRADESH VS SRIKANT CHAPHEKAR reported in AIR 1993 SC (WEEKLY) \n\n129. 11.Conclusion:-\n\n Be that as it may, on a careful consideration of respective contentions\nand on an over all assessment of the surrounding facts and circumstances of\nthe instant case, in a cumulative manner, this Court, comes to an\nirresistible conclusion that the G.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare\n(A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, had not weighed the pros and cons of\ncomparative merit and ability of the Medical Officers coupled with their\nseniority and when the First Respondent in W.A.(MD)Nos.1300 and 1301 of \n2017/Writ Petitioner pleads that she is senior to the Second Respondent in\nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 and the Appellant in W.P.(MD)No.1301 of 2017, the \nsame was not reflected in a qualitative and quantitative terms in the\naforesaid Government Order and besides that, when the Second Respondent in \nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 has come before this Court to take stand that he is\nthe most meritorious candidate that can be borne out of records; when the\nAppellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017, contends that his appointment is made \non merit and ability, the seniority has no priority; further that the\nadministrative experience in the post of Dean, is not relevant to the post of\nDirector of Medical Education, which is contrary to Service Rule\n12(8)(b)(iii); also that in the note file bearing C.No.29643/A1/16 at page\n579, certain insertions made in black ink etc., do not inspire the confidence\nof this Court; when the Appellant in W.A(MD)No.1301 of 2017, comes out with a\nplea that he is senior to the First Respondent in W.A.(MD)Nos.1300 and 1301\nof 2017/Writ Petitioner; in short, when the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of\n2017, was mentioned by name, as the senior most Dean and senior of all\npromotional level in the note file in C.No.29643/A1/16 at page 579, as afore\nstated etc., by scoring out the words 'merit and ability of the Medical\nOfficers are equal' and when the words 'meritorious also the Appellant in\nW.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 was mentioned as he is the senior most meritorious \namong the candidates in the panel' by way of interpolation/insertion, this\nCourt, based on equity, fair play, justice and good conscience and even as a\nmatter of prudence, sets aside the G.O.(D)No.948, Health and Family Welfare\n(A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017 and the consequential G.O.(D)No.950, Health \nand Family Welfare (A1) Department, dated 25.04.2017, to prevent an\naberration of justice and to promote substantial cause of justice. Further,\nthis Court, directs the First Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017/First\nRespondent, to re-consider the case of the First Respondent in\nW.A.(MD)Nos.1300 and 1301 of 2017/Writ Petitioner, the Second Respondent in \nW.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017 and the Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1301 of 2017 afresh \nfor promotion to the post of Director of Medical Education, in a 'Fair',\n'Free',\n\n'Just', 'Impartial', 'Unbiased', 'Dispassionate manner' and that too with an\nopen mind, and to pass necessary qualitative, quantitative and tangible\nreasons by evaluating the comparative merit, ability and seniority etc.,\nofcourse, in accordance with Law/Rules and Regulations, within a period of\nsix weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this Judgment. Insofar as the\nobservation of the Learned Single Judge in issuing positive direction in\nW.P.(MD)No.10257 of 2017, dated 20.09.2017, to the First Respondent (i.e. The\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu, Rep. by its Principal Secretary, Health and Family\nWelfare Department - The First Appellant in W.A.(MD)No.1300 of 2017) to grant\npromotion to the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner, as Director of Medical\nEducation with all consequential benefits, as she is due to retire in\nFebruary, 2018, are held to be incorrect, in the eye of Law and accordingly,\nthey are set aside to prevent an aberration of Justice.\n\n 12.With the aforesaid Direction(s) and Observation(s), these Writ\nAppeals stand disposed of. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous \nPetitions are closed.\n\nTo\n\n1.The Government of Tamil Nadu, \n Represented by its Principal Secretary,\n Health and Family Welfare Department,\n Fort St.George, Chennai ? 600 009.\n\n2.The Director of Medical Education,\n Kilpauk,\n Chennai ? 600 010.\n\n3.The Dean,\n Government Tiruvarur Medical College and Hospital,\n Tiruvarur. \n\n.\u001a",

The Learned Counsel for the First Respondent/Writ\nPetitioner strenuously submits that the First Respondent/Writ Petitioner is\nnot only senior, but also more meritorious than the Appellant and therefore,\nas per Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative \nReforms Department, dated 18.10.1993 and G.O.Ms.No.124, dated 10.06.2003 and \nG.O.Ms.No.354, dated 23.10.2009, the First Respondent is entitled for\npromotion and rightly eligible to be appointed to the post of Director of\nMedical Education from the date of retirement of Dr.Geethalakshmi i.e. on\n31.01.2015."

Obviously,\nthe First Appellant (The Government of Tamil Nadu) in W.A.(MD)NO.1300 of \n2017, had not taken into consideration of a very primordial fact that the\nthen Director of Medical Education (Dr.S.Geethalakshmi) sent a panel for\npromotion to the post of Director of Medical Education to the Secretary to\nGovernment, Health and Family Welfare Department, mentioning the names of (1) \nDr.R.Vimala - one year left over service not available.
