A perusal of the Deed of agreements to sell given in the\ntable indicates that 16 agreements to sell were executed\non different dates between 29.03.2007 to 25.03.2008. It\nwas the case of the claimant-appellant herein before the\nlearned arbitrator that the respondents executed in the\nform of agreements to sell, an irrevocable Power of\nAttorney, appointing the claimant as true and lawful\nperson to transfer the said property. The respondents\nwere required to get the properties converted from\nagricultural lands to non-agricultural lands at their own\ncost and expenses and sale consideration was to be paid\nonly at the time of execution of the conveyance deed.\nHowever, till date, the respondents had not got the\nproperties converted from agricultural lands to non-\nagricultural lands nor had obtained and produced the\ntitle clearance certificate from reputed solicitor nor they\nappear to have made attempt to do so and further for\nconversion of the lands from new tenure to old tenure.\n\n5.

It was further contended before the\nlearned arbitrator that the claimant was always ready\nand willing to perform the terms and conditions of the\nagreements to sell and the application for conversion of\nthe lands in question from agricultural lands to non-\nagricultural lands was required to be moved by the\nvendor and the claimant had no role to play. It was\nfurther argued that since the agreement to sell was for\npurchase of lands in question as non-agricultural lands\nafter conversion, no invalidity can be attached to the\nagreements in view of\nSection 63(1)(c)\nof the Gujarat\nTenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (for short\n\"Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948\"). It was argued that the\nprovisions of the Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948 would not\nbe applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n6. The stand of the claimant was that the irrevocable Power\nof Attorney executed in favour of the claimant being\ncoupled with the pecuniary interest could not be revoked\nyet the respondents had issued public notices dated\n29.06.2012 and 30.06.2012 to cancel or to revoke the\nPower of Attorney. The total payment of consideration\nmade by the claimant to the owners with respect to the\nentire sale transaction of all the properties is\napproximately Rs. 51,08,04,634/- (Rs. Fifty One Crores\nEight Lakhs Four Thousand Six Hundred and Thirty Four\nOnly). After execution of the agreements to sell, the\n\nPage 7 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

When nothing was done for a long time, the claimant\ninspected the records of the Revenue Department in the\nmonth of January 2011 and came to know that the\nrespondents executed a sale deed in favour of third\nparties for some of the properties, which however, have\nnot been included in the claim petition. It was,\nthereafter, agreed between the parties that the\nrespondents shall not transfer, assign, mortgage the\nproperties, subject matter of agreements to sell, to third\nparties and they will get the title clearance certificate for\nthe property in question and would get it converted from\nagricultural to non-agricultural use before execution of\nthe sale deed in favour of the claimant.\n\n8. However, in the month of June 2012, the claimant came\nacross a public notice in the newspapers \"Gujarat\nSamachar\" daily and \"Times of India\" daily stating that\nfour respondents, viz. Mr. Ajay Patel, Mr. Atul Amin, Mr.\nChirag Amin and Mr. Pragnesh Patel have revoked the\nPower of Attorney given by them to the claimant with\nrespect to the properties in question and other\nproperties which were part of Exhibit 16 with respect to\nwhich the sale deeds were executed by them in favour of\nthe third party.

An application under\nSection 9\nof the Act' 1996 for\ninterim relief was then moved by the claimants and\nbefore the civil court at Viramgam, a consent term had\nbeen arrived at between the parties whereunder, they\nhave submitted their consent/compromise purshis\nagreeing for appointment of the learned sole arbitrator\nwho happened to be a retired Judge of the High Court of\nGujarat. It was also agreed that both the parties shall\nmaintain status quo as per the interim order passed by\nthe civil court till the award is passed by the learned\narbitrator.

A perusal of the said order indicates that the\nrespondents have taken a stand that it has come to their\nknowledge only a couple of days back that the sole\narbitrator was not competent to proceed further with the\npresent arbitral proceeding, as he has conducted the\narbitration in utter violation of the provisions embodied\nin\nSections 12(1)\nand\n12(2)\nof the Arbitration Act' 1996\nand a request had been made to the learned Arbitrator\nto withdraw from the proceedings.

Mr. Ajay Patel, one of the respondents before the\nlearned arbitrator, in his application dated 24.09.2016,\nhas clearly stated that because of the close relationship\nof Mr. Mahendra G.

It was, thus, opined\nthat in view of these conditions, it cannot be said that\nthere was no concluded contract between the parties.\nThe clauses in the contract like arbitration clause in the\nagreement cannot be modified, amended or\nsupplemented, except by an agreement in writing,\nsigned by both the parties thereto, is proof of the fact\nthat there was no uncertainty and the agreements\ncannot be said to be inconclusive.\nSection 17\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act, thus, has no application. It was\nfurther noted that the arbitrator is competent to grant\nspecific relief for part performance of the contract as it\ncan equally grant specific relief for performance of the\nentire contract.\n\n25. On the issue about revocation of the Power of Attorney\nexecuted by the vendors, it was held that the Power of\nAttorney given in favour of the claimant as the true and\nlawful attorney to do all or any of the acts, deeds,\nmatters and things mentioned thereto, was irrevocable.\nMoreover, the claimant had paid more than 50% of the\nsale consideration and the said fact is not disputed.\nUnder these circumstances, the Power of Attorney being\ncoupled with pecuniary interest in the lands agreed to be\npurchased by the claimant cannot be revoked.\n\n26.

There\nis no question of invalidity of the said agreement as\nsuch. As regards the provisions of Section 43 of the\nGujarat Tenancy Act' 1948, it was opined that in Exhibit\n9, there is a specific condition that after getting the\nlands converted into non-agricultural use and also\ngetting the lands converted from old tenure to new\ntenure, the sale deed is to be executed. A conditional\ndecree, as such, can be passed requiring the vendor to\nget the lands in question converted into non-agricultural\nuse and new tenure and then execute the sale deed.\n\n27. It was, thus, opined that a proper reading of Exhibit 9\nmakes it clear that the Sale Deed is to be executed only\nafter the NA permission is obtained and, therefore, it can\nbe said that the agreement is in two parts like reciprocal\npromises. The first part is of getting NA, title clearance\nand tenure changed, which was the obligation of the\nvendors to perform and on compliance of these\nconditions, second part for execution of the sale deed\nwould arise and, thus, for payment of balance sale\nconsideration.\n\nPage 21 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

The argument with regard to the invalidity of the\nagreements to sell being hit by\nSection 43(2)\nand\nSection 63(1)(c) was, thus, answered in negative. It was\nfurther held that there was no clause in Exhibit 9\n(Agreement), which can be read over to give either party\nright to determine the agreement. Moreover, the\nvendors in the written arguments had admitted that they\nhad neither repudiated nor renunciated the agreement\nand hence, even according to the respondents, the\nAgreement Exhibit 9 is in force.\n\n29. On the issue of limitation and the readiness and\nwillingness of the claimant to perform its part of the\nAgreement, it was held that though in every agreement,\nthe respondents vendors stated that the time of three\nmonths was given for obtaining NA, but no time was\nfixed or stipulated to complete the transaction, except in\nfive claim petitions where six months' time was\nindicated. The contention of the vendors that the\nclaimant was required to file the claim within three\nyears on the expiry of the period of six months and in\ncase, six months' time is not stipulated in the contract,\nthey were required to file the claim within reasonable\ntime, was rejected with the observation that the cause of\naction for filing the claim petition arose when the\nperformance of contract was refused by the respondents.\nReference has been made to\nArticle 54\nto the\nSchedule\nof the Limitation Act\nto hold that the period of three\nyears begins to run either from the date of performance,\n\nPage 22 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

It\nwas held that in five claims though time stipulated to\ncomplete the transaction is indicated as six months, but\nno date is fixed.\n\n30. The claimant came to know about refusal of the vendors\nto perform its part of contract when public notice was\npublished in the newspapers on 30.06.2012 and\n29.06.2012. These notices were duly replied by the\nclaimant and all the claim petitions have been filed\nwithin the period of limitation, which is to reckon from\nthe date of the public notice to cancel the Power of\nAttorney, i.e., the date when the vendors refused\nperformance. With these findings, the Tribunal has\ndeclared the award in the following manner :-\n\n\"(1) It is hereby declared that the power of\nAttorney dated August 31 2007 Exh. 10 executed\nby respondent in favour of the claimant is\nirrevocable and cannot be revoked.

The Agreements for\nSale being prohibited and forbidden by the provisions of\nSections 43 and 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948, in\ncontravention of the statutory provisions, cannot be put\ninto execution by directing the respondents to execute\nthe sale deed after seeking NA permission or conversion\nof the land in question from new tenure to old tenure.\n\n33. The Court under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act' 1996\nhas further proceeded to examine the issue pertaining to\nthe readiness and willingness on the part of the claimant\nand the delay in approaching the Tribunal for specific\nperformance of the Agreements to Sell. It was held that\nas per\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act\n, the limitation for\nspecific performance of an agreement is three years\nfrom the date fixed for the performance and if no such\ndate is fixed, when the plaintiff has noticed that the\nperformance is refused. Out of 16 agreements, 5\ntransactions stipulated time period of six months for\ncompletion of transaction from the date of the respective\nagreements. With reference to such contracts, which\nwere executed in the year 2007, proceedings were\ninitiated by filing application under\nSection 9\nof the\nArbitration Act' 1996 before the civil court only on\n17.10.2012.

The claim for\nspecific performance of the Agreements to Sell in five\nReferences Nos. 5/12, 6/12, 8/12, 15/12 and 18/12,\ntherefore, was barred by limitation.\n\n34. With respect to other agreements, the stipulated time is\nof three months for obtaining NA permission from the\ndate of the agreement. The vendors had executed the\nPower of Attorney in favour of the claimant and hence,\nthe claimant was required to take steps for obtaining the\nrequisite permission within the specified time limit. No\nsteps had been taken by the claimant for taking requisite\npermission till the Power of Attorney was cancelled and\nthe claimant had approached the Arbitral Tribunal after\nfive years, which itself shows that the claimant was not\nready and willing to perform its part of the contract.\nThis delay itself dis-entitles the claimant to seek specific\nperformance of Agreements to Sell. The Arbitral\nTribunal ought to have refused specific performance for\nthis reason. On the contrary, if assumed for the moment\nthat the vendors were required to obtain NA permission\nand the claimant was obliged to start any process for\nconversion of the lands into NA, then when the vendors\ndid not initiate steps for conversion of lands within the\nstipulated period of three months, it would clearly\nsuggest that the vendors had refused the performance of\nthe agreement and the period of limitation of three years\nwould start from the expiry of the stipulated period of\nthree months from the date of the agreement.

On the validity of the order dated 20.10.2016 rejecting\nthe application moved by the respondents under\nSection\n/\nof the Arbitration Act' 1996, it was held that\n\nSection 12(1)(a)\nof the Arbitration Act' 1996 casts duty\non the arbitrator at the time of his appointment to\ndisclose in writing any circumstances such as existence\nof either direct or indirect, of any past or present\nrelationship with or interest in any of the parties,\nwhether financial, business, professional or any other\nkind which is likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to\nhis independence or impartiality.\nSection 12(2)\nof the\nArbitration Act' 1996 casts duty on the arbitrator that he\nshould during the arbitral proceedings disclose in\nwriting the circumstances referred to in sub-section (1),\nif any.

The effect of these provisions is that if the challenge is\nnot successful, the arbitral proceedings must go on\nwithout any right to appeal.

Even if it is\nassumed that in the birthday party thrown by Mr.\nMahendra G.

In any case, re-\nappreciation of evidence would not be permissible on the\nplea of patent illegality apparent on the face of the\nrecord. However, the finding based on no evidence at all\nor an award which ignores the vital evidence in arriving\nat a decision would be perverse and can be set aside on\nthe ground of patent illegality.\n\n47. It was with these assertion, the learned counsel for the\nappellant vehemently argued that the civil court in\nexercise of jurisdiction under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act' 1996 has committed an illegality in re-\nappreciating the evidence on record so as to arrive at an\nalternative view than what has been taken by the\nlearned Arbitrator.

The\nagreements to sell were for aggregation of land and\nsome part of the land was non-agricultural with respect\nto which there was an obligation of the vendors to obtain\npermission of the competent authority to clear his title\nand execute the sale deed. In any case, the appellant\nwas not handed over possession of the lands in question\nand there was no transfer, which can be said to be hit by\n\nSection 43\nor Section 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy Act'\n1948.\n\n49.

It was, thus, held by the full bench that an instrument of\ntransfer or an agreement made by an instrument in\nwriting for transfer in favour of a non-agriculturist\nbecome valid on the permission being granted by the\nCollector or an officer authorised by the State\nGovernment on the condition as may be prescribed in\nthe order of permission.

It was, thus, held that there is no absolute bar\nin Section 63 about the transfer of a land though there is\na restriction like Section 63, which contemplates\nabsolute bar by making transfer of a land of restricted\nnature illegal without previous permission of the\nCollector.\n\n51.

The agreement itself puts an obligation upon\nthe vendors to move application before the Collector or\nauthorised officer to seek permission. The vendors\nhaving not moved any application, cannot take benefit of\ntheir own wrong so as to contest the claim of the\nappellant that the appellant is entitled for a decree of\nspecific performance of an agreement with the condition\nthat the vendors have to apply to the Collector or to the\nauthorised officer seeking permission and then execute\nthe Sale Deed on such permission being granted on the\nconditions prescribed in the order of permission.\n\n52.

Once\nthis set of evidence was brought before the learned\narbitrator, it was required to keep its hands off by\nwithdrawing from the arbitration.

It was further argued that the decree for specific\nperformance of the contract could not have been\nawarded by the learned arbitrator, inasmuch as, the\nclaim was barred by limitation. The agreements to sell\nwere executed between March 2007 to March 2008 over\na period of one year and as against total sale\nconsideration of Rs. 6,91,72,700/-, an amount of\nRs.2,93,37,961/- had been paid as against the\noutstanding of Rs. 3,98,34,749/-. There has been no\nexpression of readiness and willingness on the part of\nthe claimant for more than three years, the limitation\nprescribed for seeking a decree of specific performance\nof agreement. The Power of Attorney executed by the\nvendors was coterminous with the agreement which\nprescribe that all formalities for seeking NA permission\nand clearing the title of the vendors would be completed\nwithin a period of six months from the date of the\nagreement. The Power of Attorney executed on\n31.08.2007 had given the power to the claimant to seek\npermission under Section 63. After expiry of outer limit\nfrom the last of six months of such agreement executed\non 25.03.2008, limitation period of three years would\nexpire on 24.09.2011, which would be the cut-off date\nfor institution of the proceedings seeking for decree of\nspecific performance of agreement.

There was complete silence and the claimant,\nin fact have themselves abandoned the project. The\ncancellation of the Power of Attorney in the year 2012\ncannot be taken as a refusal of the vendors of the\nperformance of the contract on its part, inasmuch as, the\nPower of Attorney was cancelled much after the expiry\nof the time period of six months for completion of the\nformalities provided under the contract when the\nlimitation under\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act, 1963\nof\nthree years from the date fixed for the performance or if\nno such date is fixed when the plaintiff has noticed that\nthe performance is refused, had expired. Further, when\nthere was no readiness and willingness expressed by the\nvendors, viz. the complainant throughout the period of\nmore than three years of the contract, there was no\nquestion of grant of decree for specific performance of\ncontract on the premise that the time was not the\nessence of the contract. The submission is that the\nlearned arbitrator has committed a patent illegality in\nholding that the limitation under\nArticle 54\nwould run\nfrom the date of the cancellation of the Power of\nAttorney and the claim was within the prescribed period\nof limitation of three years.\n\n61. Lastly, it was argued that Section 63 of the Gujarat\nTenancy Act' 1948 prohibits transfer to a non-\nagriculturist except without the permission of the\nCollector.

However,\nthe Collector or an authorised officer may grant\npermission for such sale on such conditions as may be\nprescribed. Keeping in mind this provision, six months\ntime period was prescribed in the agreement to\ncomplete the process of seeking permission from the\nCollector, which has not been adhered to by the\nclaimant/vendee who had been given power on the basis\nof the Power of Attorney dated 31.08.2007 to apply and\nseek permission of the competent authority. There has\nbeen failure on the part of the vendee to adhere to the\nsaid condition of the agreement. The agreements which\nare invalid under Section 63(1)(c) of the Gujarat Tenancy\nAct' 1948 are in their nature determinable.\nSection\n14(1)(c)\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides inter\nalia that a contract which is in its nature determinable\ncannot be specifically enforced. Simultaneously,\n\nSection 43\nof the Indian Contract Act makes the\nagreements in question unlawful, inasmuch as, the\nagreement in writing for transfer in favour of a person\nwho is not an agriculturist is forbidden by law.\n\n62. The question of ex post facto permission of the Collector\nto attach validity to such an agreement is not of\nrelevance in the instant case, inasmuch as, performance\nof the contract was not possible after six months.

Additionally, the concept of the\n\"fundamental policy of Indian law\" would\ncover compliance with statutes and judicial\nprecedents, adopting a judicial approach,\ncompliance with the principles of natural\njustice, and Wednesbury [Associated\nProvincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury\nCorpn., (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)]\nreasonableness. Furthermore, \"patent\nillegality\" itself has been held to mean\ncontravention of the substantive law of India,\ncontravention of the 1996 Act, and\ncontravention of the terms of the contract.\n\n12. It is only if one of these conditions is met\nthat the Court may interfere with an arbitral\naward in terms of\nSection 34(2)(b)(ii)\n, but\nsuch interference does not entail a review of\nthe merits of the dispute, and is limited to\nsituations where the findings of the arbitrator\nare arbitrary, capricious or perverse, or when\nthe conscience of the Court is shocked, or\nwhen the illegality is not trivial but goes to the\nroot of the matter.

Pursuant to the\ninsertion of Explanation 1 to\nSection 34(2)\n,\nthe scope of contravention of Indian public\npolicy has been modified to the extent that it\nnow means fraud or corruption in the making\nof the award, violation of Section 75 or\n\nSection 81\nof the Act, contravention of the\nfundamental policy of Indian law, and conflict\nwith the most basic notions of justice or\nmorality. Additionally, sub-section (2-A) has\nbeen inserted in\nSection 34\n, which provides\nthat in case of domestic arbitrations, violation\nof Indian public policy also includes patent\nillegality appearing on the face of the award.\nThe proviso to the same states that an award\nshall not be set aside merely on the ground of\nan erroneous application of the law or by\nreappreciation of evidence.\n\n14. As far as interference with an order made\nunder\nSection 34\n, as per\nSection 37\n, is\nconcerned, it cannot be disputed that such\ninterference under\nSection 37\ncannot travel\nbeyond the restrictions laid down under\n\nSection 34\n. In other words, the Court cannot\nundertake an independent assessment of the\nmerits of the award, and must only ascertain\nthat the exercise of power by the Court under\n\nSection 34\nhas not exceeded the scope of the\nprovision. Thus, it is evident that in case an\narbitral award has been confirmed by the\nCourt under\nSection 34\nand by the Court in an\nappeal under\nSection 37\n, this Court must be\nextremely cautious and slow to disturb such\nconcurrent findings.\"\n\n27.\nIn\nSsangyong Engg.

Insofar as domestic awards made in India\nare concerned, an additional ground is now\navailable under sub-section (2-A), added by\nthe Amendment Act, 2015, to\nSection 34\n.\n\nHere, there must be patent illegality\nappearing on the face of the award, which\nrefers to such illegality as goes to the root of\nthe matter but which does not amount to mere\nerroneous application of the law. In short,\nwhat is not subsumed within \"the fundamental\npolicy of Indian law\", namely, the\ncontravention of a statute not linked to public\npolicy or public interest, cannot be brought in\nby the backdoor when it comes to setting\naside an award on the ground of patent\nillegality.\n\n38. Secondly, it is also made clear that\nreappreciation of evidence, which is what an\nappellate court is permitted to do, cannot be\npermitted under the ground of patent\nillegality appearing on the face of the award.\n\n39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of\nAssociate\nBuilders [Associate Builders v. DDA\n, (2015) 3\nSCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204], namely, a\nmere contravention of the substantive law of\nIndia, by itself, is no longer a ground available\nto set aside an arbitral award.\n\nPara 42.2 of\n\nAssociate Builders [Associate Builders v. DDA\n,\n(2015) 3 SCC 49 : (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204],\nhowever, would remain, for if an arbitrator\ngives no reasons for an award and\ncontravenes\nSection 31(3)\nof the 1996 Act,\nthat would certainly amount to a patent\nillegality on the face of the award.\n\n40. The change made in\nSection 28(3)\nby the\nAmendment Act really follows what is stated\nin paras 42.3 to 45 in\nAssociate Builders\n[Associate Builders v.

Also,\nif the arbitrator wanders outside the contract\nand deals with matters not allotted to him, he\ncommits an error of jurisdiction. This ground\nof challenge will now fall within the new\nground added under\nSection 34\n(2-A).\n\n41. What is important to note is that a\ndecision which is perverse, as understood in\nparas 31 and 32 of\nAssociate Builders\n[Associate Builders v. DDA\n, (2015) 3 SCC 49 :\n\n(2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204], while no longer\nbeing a ground for challenge under \"public\npolicy of India\", would certainly amount to a\npatent illegality appearing on the face of the\naward. Thus, a finding based on no evidence\nat all or an award which ignores vital evidence\nin arriving at its decision would be perverse\nand liable to be set aside on the ground of\npatent illegality. Additionally, a finding based\non documents taken behind the back of the\nparties by the arbitrator would also qualify as\na decision based on no evidence inasmuch as\nsuch decision is not based on evidence led by\nthe parties, and therefore, would also have to\nbe characterised as perverse.\"\n\n28. The limited scope of challenge under\nSection 34\n\nof the Act was once again highlighted by this Court\nin\nPSA Sical Terminals [PSA Sical Terminals (P)\nLtd. v. V.O.

The scope of interference would be\nlimited to grounds provided under\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration Act. The interference would\nbe so warranted when the award is in\nviolation of \"public policy of India\", which has\nbeen held to mean \"the fundamental policy of\nIndian law\". A judicial intervention on account\nof interfering on the merits of the award\nwould not be permissible. However, the\nprinciples of natural justice as contained in\n\nSections 18\nand\n34(2)(a)(iii)\nof the Arbitration\nAct would continue to be the grounds of\nchallenge of an award. The ground for\ninterference on the basis that the award is in\nconflict with justice or morality is now to be\nunderstood as a conflict with the \"most basic\nnotions of morality or justice\". It is only such\narbitral awards that shock the conscience of\nthe Court, that can be set aside on the said\nground. An award would be set aside on the\nground of patent illegality appearing on the\nface of the award and as such, which goes to\nthe roots of the matter. However, an illegality\nwith regard to a mere erroneous application\nof law would not be a ground for interference.\n\nEqually, reappreciation of evidence would not\nbe permissible on the ground of patent\nillegality appearing on the face of the award.\n\n41. A decision which is perverse, though\nwould not be a ground for challenge under\n\"public policy of India\", would certainly\namount to a patent illegality appearing on the\nface of the award. However, a finding based\non no evidence at all or an award which\nignores vital evidence in arriving at its\ndecision would be perverse and liable to be\nset aside on the ground of patent illegality.\n\n42.

This Court has in several other judgments\ninterpreted\nSection 34\nof the 1996 Act to\nstress on the restraint to be shown by Courts\nwhile examining the validity of the arbitral\nawards. The limited grounds available to\nCourts for annulment of arbitral awards are\nwell known to legally trained minds. However,\nthe difficulty arises in applying the well-\nestablished principles for interference to the\nfacts of each case that come up before the\nCourts. There is a disturbing tendency of\nCourts setting aside arbitral awards, after\ndissecting and reassessing factual aspects of\nthe cases to come to a conclusion that the\naward needs intervention and thereafter,\ndubbing the award to be vitiated by either\nperversity or patent illegality, apart from the\nother grounds available for annulment of the\naward. This approach would lead to corrosion\nof the object of the 1996 Act and the\nendeavours made to preserve this object,\nwhich is minimal judicial interference with\narbitral awards. That apart, several judicial\npronouncements of this Court would become\na dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside\nby categorising them as perverse or patently\nillegal without appreciating the contours of\nthe said expressions.\n\n29. Patent illegality should be illegality which\ngoes to the root of the matter.

An arbitral\naward stating no reasons for its findings\nwould make itself susceptible to challenge on\nthis account. The conclusions of the arbitrator\nwhich are based on no evidence or have been\narrived at by ignoring vital evidence are\nperverse and can be set aside on the ground\nof patent illegality.

The High\nCourt has entered into the merits of the claim\nand has decided the appeal under\nSection 37\n\nof the Arbitration Act as if the High Court was\ndeciding the appeal against the judgment and\ndecree passed by the learned trial court.

On the question as to whether the agreements were\ncontingent contract or contract creating absolute\nliabilities between the parties without contemplating any\ncontingency, it is clear that the agreements clearly\ncontemplated that the sale deeds were to be executed\nafter the requisite permission was obtained from the\nCollector for transfer of the lands in question to a non-\nagriculturist and that without permission, the land was\nnot to be sold. The question is whether the Court or the\narbitrator has jurisdiction to pass a contingent or\nconditional decree of specific performance directing the\nvendor to seek necessary permission and execute sale\ndeed.\n\n72.\nIn\nRojasara Ramjibhai Dahyabhai vs Jani\nNarottamdas Lallubhai\n[1986 (3) SCC 300], the\nappellant had entered into an agreement to purchase\nplots recorded as Girasdar agricultural land of which he\nwas a tenant from Girasdari.

In the meantime,\nthe\nSaurashtra Land Reforms Act, 1951\ncame into force\nwith effect from 01.09.1951 and the appellant was\nrecognised to be an occupant thereof under the\nprovisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1898. The\nappellant thereafter, obtained permission for converting\nthe land both as plots for non-agricultural use. The\nrespondent then called upon the appellant to execute the\nconveyance of the property in accordance with the\nagreement to sell between the parties and on his failure\nto comply, the suit for specific performance was\ninstituted.\n\n73.

The decision of the Privy Council in Motilal v. Nanhelal\nGhasiram [AIR 1930 PC 287] was relied therein to\nobserve that it is an authority for the proposition that if\nthe vendor agrees to sell the property which can be\ntransferred only with the sanction of some Government\nauthority, the Court has jurisdiction to order the vendor\nto apply to the authority within a specified period, and if\nthe sanction is forthcoming to convey to the purchaser\nwithin a certain time.

It was argued before the Apex\nCourt that the contract was contingent upon the grant of\npermission by the Prant Officer and on refusal thereof,\nthe parties would be governed by\nSection 56\nof the\nContract Act, according to which, a contract becomes\nvoid if something supervenes after its execution which\nrenders it impracticable. While answering the question\nwhether the order of the Prant Officer rendered the\ncontract impracticable, it was noted by the Apex Court\nthat the said order was not of such a catastrophic\ncharacter as can be said to have struck at the very root\nof the whole object and purpose for which the parties\nhad entered into the bargain in question or to have\nrendered the contract impracticable or impossible of\nperformance.\n\n77. It was held therein that a careful perusal of the order of\nthe Prant Officer indicated that it was not conclusive nor\nwas based on the merits of the application seeking\npermission, rather refusal was on technical ground\nwhich do not prohibit the appellant from making a fresh\napplication to the Collector in view of Section 63 of the\n\nPage 74 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

It was, thus, concluded that since the\norder of the Prant Officer therein did not put any fetter\non the appellant to apply to the Collector or the\nAdditional Collector for grant of the requisite permission\nfor sale and purchase of the land after obtaining the\naforesaid certificate, no untoward event or change of\ncircumstances supervened to make the agreement\nfactually or legally impossible of performance so as to\nattract\nSection 56\nof the Contract Act.\n\n78.\nIn\nMrs. Chandnee Widya Vati Madden\n(supra), the\nApex Court had discussed\nSection 12\nand Section 21 of\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1877.

The vendor made an\napplication, but for the reasons of her own withdrew the\nsame. In the suit filed by the vendees for specific\nperformance of the contract or in the alternative for\ndamages, it was found that the vendees were always\nready and willing to perform their part of the contract\nand that it was the vendor who willfully refused to\nperform her part of contract and that the time was not of\nthe essence of the contract.

For the reason\nbest known to the defendant vendor, though such an\napplication was made, but the vendor decided to\nwithdraw the same. On the finding that the plaintiffs\nhave always been ready and willing to perform their part\nof the contract and that it was the defendant who\nwillfully refused to perform her part of the contract and\nthat the time was not of the essence of the contract, the\nCourt has directed to enforce the terms of the contract\nand to enjoin upon the defendant-appellant to make the\nnecessary application to the Chief Commissioner or such\nother competent authority as may have been empowered\nto grant the necessary sanction to transfer within the\ntime prescribed therein.

The general principle is that if a condition is laid down\nthat the transferor is bound to do everything to give\neffect to the contract, specific performance can be\nobtained with a direction to the transferor to obtain the\nrequisite consent or permission. The principle is that\nunless and until the transaction itself is unlawful, it may\nbe enforced directing the defendant/transferor to take\nsuch steps as are necessary for affecting the contract.\nThe principle is that if the vendor has agreed to sell the\nproperty, which can be transferred only with the\nsanction of some Government authority, the Court has\njurisdiction to order the vendor to apply to the authority\nand if the sanction is not forthcoming, to convey to the\npurchaser the same, but on the ground that the sanction\nis not available, decree for specific performance cannot\nbe refused. It is settled that when permission from some\nauthority is required to be obtained, prior obtaining of\nthe same is not a condition precedent for grant of decree\nfor specific performance, if after grant of the decree\npermission can be obtained. The conditional decree for\nspecific performance can be granted making it subject to\nobtaining permission or exemption, as contemplated in\nthe Statute. The relief can be moulded to such an extent\nthat the vendor is required to obtain permission or\nconsent. It has been the consistent view that on the\nground of non-availability of consent or permission, the\nvendor cannot avoid such an agreement. There are\n\nPage 77 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

The distinction between two statutory provisions under\nSections 43 and 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948 has\nbeen noticed by the Full Bench of this Court in\nShaikh\nIsmailbhai Hushainbhai\n(supra), wherein it was held\nthat there is a radical difference between the language\nof two statutes. The provisions of Section 43 of the\nGujarat Tenancy Act puts complete prohibition in\nexecution of even an agreement in writing to transfer a\nland of restricted tenure without the previous sanction of\nthe Collector. In view of the negative language of the\nstatute, the two conditions of transfer in Sub-section (1)\nof\nSection 43\nare of mandatory character.\nSection 43\n,\nthus, not only prohibits transfer by sale, lease, etc, but it\nexpressly prohibits execution of agreement in writing to\ntransfer a land by sale, lease, etc. without complying\nwith the conditions in Sub-section (1) of\nSection 43\n.\n\n84. On the other hand, Section 63 (1) though couched in\nnegative language, but the first proviso attached to Sub-\nsection (1) qualifies the negative language employed in\nthe main sub-section, which makes an agreement made\nby an instrument in writing for sale, lease etc. to a non-\nagriculturist invalid. The first proviso to Sub-section (1)\nof Section 63 attaches validity to such transfer on the\npermission being granted by the Collector or an\nauthorised officer, on such conditions as may be\nprescribed.

However, the\nclaimant had not taken any step by applying for\nobtaining requisite permission in the specified time limit\nuntil the Power of Attorney was cancelled in the year\n2012.

Independence, which is more an objective\nconcept may thus, be more straightforwardly\nascertained by the parties at the outset of the arbitration\nproceedings in light of the circumstances disclosed by\nthe arbitrator, while impartiality will more likely surface\nduring the arbitration proceedings.\n\n103. In our considered opinion, once the circumstances\nenumerated in Clause 9 of the\nFifth Schedule to the\nArbitration Act\n' 1996 has surfaced during the course of\narbitration proceedings and it was brought on record\nthat the learned arbitrator has a close family\nrelationship with one of the persons controlling the\nclaimant Company having 51% share of the claimant\nCompany, it was incumbent for the learned arbitrator to\nkeep his hands off, inasmuch as, there has been no\ndisclosure on the part of the learned arbitrator when the\nsaid fact came on record for the first time in the year\n2015 during the course of the cross-examination of Mr.\nRajesh Lodha. We are also inclined to give benefit of\ndoubt to the learned arbitrator that he was not aware of\n\nPage 92 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

Lodha in the Claimant\nCompany, but when this fact was brought to his\nknowledge even after the completion of the argument by\nmeans of the application under\nSection 12(2)\nof the\nArbitration Act' 1996 filed on 26.09.2016 prior to filing\nof the written statement, in order to maintain the\nindependence and impartiality of the arbitral\nproceedings, the learned arbitrator ought to have\nrecused himself as the circumstances existed has an\neffect giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the\nindependence and impartiality of the learned arbitrator.\n\n104. For the above discussion, we are of the view that the\naward of the learned arbitrator is found to be vitiated by\npatent illegality appearing on the face of the record\nbeing in conflict with the basic notions of justice and\nmorality and, thus, being in conflict with the public\npolicy of India. The illegality found in the award is not\ntrivial, but goes to the very root of the matter and, thus,\nthe interference made by the court in setting aside the\naward in terms of\nSection 34(2) (b)(iii)\nand Sub-section\n(2A) cannot be said to suffer from any error of law. This\nis not a case where the award has been found to be bad\non review of the case of the parties on merits by re-\nappreciation of the evidence or on the premise that the\naward is a result of erroneous application of the\nstatutory provision. The claim was found to be hit by\n\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act\non the face of the record\nand as such could not have been awarded and further,\n\nPage 93 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.
