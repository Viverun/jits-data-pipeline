Advocate for appellants/State.\nMs. Malti Dadariya, learned counsel for respondents.\n\nCORAM :\n Hon'ble Mr. Justice Sanjay Yadav, Judge\n Hon'ble Mr. Justice B.K. Shrivastava, Judge\n\n ORDER\n\n (Jabalpur, dated : 25.11.2019)\n\nPer : Sanjay Yadav, J :-\n\n This appeal under Section 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Uchcha\n\nNyayalaya (Khand Nyayapeeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam, 2005, is\n\ndirected against the order dated 11.04.2017 passed in Writ Petition\n\nNo.21362/2015.\n\n2. The issue raised in the petition, at the instance of the petitioner\n\nNo.1, was as to counting of the service rendered on daily wages in\n\nthe Work Charged Contingency Paid Establishment for pension on\n\nretirement after regularization in the Work Charged and\n\nContingency Paid Establishment. Whereas the issue raised by the\n\npetitioner No.2 was grant of family pension.\n\n 2\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n3. Evidently, the Rules which governs the pension are Madhya\n\nPradesh (Work Charged and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension\n\nRules, 1979. Petitioner No.1 was initially appointed as Chowkidar\n\non 14.02.1979 on Work Charged and Contingency Paid\n\nEstablishment. He was regularized on 01.05.2013. And, retired on\n\nattaining the age of 62 years with effect from 31.08.2015. As to\n\npetitioner No.2 her husband was appointed as Chowkidar in\n\nContingency establishment on 01.05.1984 and was regularized with\n\neffect from 01.05.2013. He died on 10.10.2013. The petitioner were\n\ndenied pension/family pension on the ground that they did not have\n\nminimum qualifying service under Rule 6 of 1979 Rules.\n\n4. Learned Single Judge relying upon the decision in Writ\n\nPetition No.2698/2003 (\nLallan Bai vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\nand others\n) decided on 17.11.2004 held thus :\n\n 8. Thus, the services rendered by the petitioner No.1\n and husband of the petitioner No.2 for a period of 2\n years and 5 months respectively after their regularization\n are inconsequential what is relevant is that the tenure of\n their service prior to their regularization which is 34\n years and 29 years respectively for both the petitioners.\n\n 9. \nIn the result, this petition also deserves to be and is\n hereby allowed on the same terms as in the case of\n \nLallan Bai\n (supra). It is further directed that the\n respondents shall determine the pension in accordance\n with law in terms of the above direction within 3 months\n from today and make the payment of the same along\n with interest of 6% per annum from the date the pension\n\n 3\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n has been wrongfully deprived to the petitioners. No\n order as to costs.\n\n5. \nIn \nLallan Bai\n (supra), it is held :\n\n \"10. M.P. Work charged and Contingency Paid Employees\n Pension Rules, 1979 defines the contingency paid employees to\n mean an employee who is paid on monthly basis. Work charge\n employees means a person employed upon the actual\n execution, as distinct from general supervision of a specified\n work or upon subordinate supervision of the departmental\n labour excluding the daily paid labour and muster-role\n employee employed on the work. It is not in dispute in the\n instant cases that Bal Kishan Patel was regularized and brought\n under the purview of the Rules of 1979 w.e.f. 13.2.1997 and\n deceased Jagmohan Singh Gond was brought under the\n purview of the above rules w.e.f 13.6.1992. Rule 2(c) defines\n the permanent employees thus:-\n\n \"Permanent employee\" means a contingency\n paid employee or a work-charged employee who\n has completed fifteen years of service or more on\n or after the 1st January, 1974:\n\n Provided that in respect of a contingency\n paid employee who has attained the age of\n superannuation or on after 1-4-1981 Permanent\n employee means an employee who has completed\n ten years of service on or after the 1st January,\n 1974.\n\n 11. Rule 4(A) which has been amended w.e.f. 29.11.1996\n with retrospective effect provides that in case any permanent\n employee has died while in service or after retirement on\n pension on or after 1-4-1981 shall be entitled to family pension\n under Rule 47 of M.P. Civil Services Pension Rules, 1976,\n Earlier the embargo which was created as per original rule 4-A\n which was incorporated on 30.1.1996. The Rule has been given\n retrospective effect w.e.f. 24.1.1984 Rule 4-A of M.P. Work\n charged and Contingency Paid Employees rules, 1979 was\n incorporated on 30.1.1996.\n\n 4-A. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule,\n the family of a permanent employee who dies\n\n 4\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n while in service or after retirement of pension on\n or after 1-4-1981 shall be entitled to family\n pension at the rate of 30% of death/retirement\n subject to a minimum of Rs. 40 per month and\n maximum of Rs. 100 Per month subject to other\n conditions of Rule 47 of the M.P. civil Services\n (Pension) Rules, 1976 except sub-rule (3) of the\n said rule.\n\n Later, Rule 4-A was amended with effect from\n29.11.1996. Rule 4-A as amended on 29.11.1996 is quoted\nbelow:-\n\n \"fu;e 4 ¼d½& fu;e 4 fdlh ,sls LFkk;h deZpkjh\n ftldh lsok esa jgrs ;k lsok fuo``fRr gksus ds i'pkr~~ 1\n vçSy 1981 dks ;k mlds i'pkr~~ e``R;q gks tkrh gS] dk\n ifjokj] e/; çns'k flfoy lsok ¼isa'ku½ fu;e 1976 ds\n fu;e 47 dh fofgr njksa ij rFkk vU; 'krksZ ds\n v/;k/kkhu jgrs gq, isa'ku ikus dk gdnkj gksxkA\" \"\n\n12. Rule (6) of the Pension Rules, 1979 relating to the work-\ncharged and contingency paid employees provides for\ncommencement of qualifying service. It is clearly provided\nunder Rule 6(3) that on absorption of temporary employee\nwithout interruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from 1st January, 1974 onwards, if\nsuch service is of not less than six years shall be counted for\npension as if such service was rendered in a regular post. Rules\n6 is quoted below:-\n\n 6.

On absorption of a permanent employee\n without interruption against any regular\n pensionable post, the service rendered with effect\n from 1st January, 1959 on wards shall be counted\n for Pension as if such service was rendered in a\n regular post.\n\n (3). On absorption of temporary employee\n without interruption against any regular\n pensionable post, the service rendered with effect\n from 1st January, 1974 onwards, if such service is\n of not less than six years shall be counted for\n pension as if such service was rendered in a\n regular post.\n\n13. Rule 47 of the M.P Civil Services Pension Rules, 1976 is\nquoted below:-\n\n 47- Contributory family pension. -\n\n (1) to a Government servant entering service in\n a pensionable establishment on or after 1st April,\n 1966, and\n\n (b) to Government servant who was in service\n on 31st march, 1966 and came to be governed by\n the provisions of the Family Pension Scheme for\n State Government Employees, 1966 contained in\n Government of Madhya Pradesh Finance\n Department Memo No. 1963/C.R. 903-IVR.II\n dated 17th August, 1966 as in force immediately\n before the commencement of these rules.\n\n (2) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n (3)(a) Where a Government servant, who is not\n governed by the Woekman's Compensation Act,\n 1923 (No. 8 of 1923), dies while in service after\n having rendered not less than weven years\n continuous service, the rate of family pension\n payable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\n of the pay last drawn or twice the family pension\n\n 6\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nadmissible under sub-rule (2), whichever is less,\nand the amount so admissible shall be payable\nfrom the date following the date of death of the\nGovernment servant:-\n\n(I) for a period of seven years; or\n\n(ii) up to the date on which the deceased\nGovernment servant would have attained the age\nof 67 years had he survived, whichever period is\nless.\n\n(b) Where a Government servant who is not\ngoverned by the Workmen's compensation Act,\n1923 (No. 8 of 1923) dies after retirement after\nhaving rendered not less than seven years\ncontinuous service., the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof the pay last drawn by the pensioner before\nretirement or twice the family pension admissible\nunder sub-rule (2), whichever is less, and the\namount so admissible shall be payable from the\ndate following the date of death of the pensioner:-\n\n(i) for a period of seven years; or\n\n(ii) till the date on which the pensioner would\n\nhave reached the age of 67 years had he remained\nalive, whichever period is shorter:\n\nProvided that the amount of family pension shall\nnot exceed the pension sanctioned to the\nGovernment servant at the time of retirement. In\ncases where the amount of family pension as\nadmissible under clause (b) (i) of sub-rule (2) of\nthis rule exceeds the pension sanctioned at the\ntime of retirement, the amount of family pension\nsanctioned under this sub-rule shall not be less\nthan that amount. The term 'pension sanctioned at\nthe time of retirement' shall mean 'the pension\ninclusive of the part of the pension which the\n\n 7\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nretired Government servant may have commuted\nbefore death.'\n\n(c)(i) Where a Government servant who is\ngoverned by the workmen's \nCompensation Act,\n1923\n (No. 8 of 1923) dies while in service after\nhaving rendered not less than seven years\ncontinuous service, the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof the pay last drawn or one and a half times the\nfamily pension admissible under sub-rule (2)\nwhichever is less.\n\n(ii) where a Government servant who is\ngoverned by the \nWorkmen's Compensation Act,\n1923\n (No. 8 of 1923) dies after retirement after\nhaving rendered not less than seven years\ncontinuous service, the rate of family pension\npayable to the family shall be equal to 50 per cent\nof pay last drawn by the Government servant or\none and half times the family pension admissible\nunder sub-rule (2), whichever is less.\n\n(iii) The family pension so determined under\nsub-clause(i) or (ii) shall be payable for the period\nmentioned in clause (a) or clause (b) as the case\nmay be :\n\nProvided that where a compensation is not\npayable under the aforesaid Act, the Head of\noffice shall issue a certificate ot the Audit Officer\nto the effect that family of the deceased\nGovernment servant. Is not eligible for any\ncompensation under the aforesaid Act and the\nfamily shall be paid family pension on the scale\nand for the period mentioned in clause (a).\n\n(d) After the expiry of the period referred to in\nclause (a) or (b), the family, in receipt of family\npension under those clauses or clause (c)c, shall\n\n 8\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n be entitled to family pension at the rate\n admissible under su-rule(2).\n\n 14. It is apparent that for the purpose of family pension Rule\n 4-6 of the Pension Rules of 1979 read with Rule 47 of the\n Rules of 1976 makes it clear that if an incumbent has rendered\n not less than 7 years continuous services, family of incumbent\n is entitled for the family pension. It is not in dispute that\n deceased Jabmohan Singh Gond had rendered the continuous\n service for more than 7 years. Rule 6(3) of the Pension Rules of\n 1979 clearly provides that without interruption for not less than\n 6 years such services shall be counted for pension as if such\n services has rendered on regular post, qualifying service has to\n be given effect to while considering the length of the service, as\n specified in Rule 2(c) of the Rules of 1979 otherwise the\n purpose of fiction created of Rule 6(3) stands defeated. Thus\n the submission raised by the respondents that as per Rule 6(3),\n services cannot to be computed towards qualifying service,\n cannot be accepted. The services which has been rendered, as\n qualifying service, under Rule 6(3) of the Pension Rules of\n 1979 has to be counted, as rendered on a regular post.\n Thereafter entitlement has to be determined by the respondents\n in accordance with law.\"\n\n6. In view whereof, the findings arrived at by learned Single\n\nJudge cannot be faulted with.\n\n7. As regard to pension for the personnel who are initially\n\nengaged on daily wagers in Work-Charged and Contingency Paid\n\nEstablishment and later regularised, the services rendered prior to\n\nregularisation is counted for the purpose of pension. For an\n\nauthority, please see decision rendered by a co-ordinate Bench of\n\n 9\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nIndore in the case of \nState of M.P. vs Ramchandra Singh\n : Writ\n\nAppeal No.179/2010 decided on 05.08.2013, wherein it is held :\n\n \"7. Considering the entire controversy, we find that\n the stand of the appellants/State is severely lopsided\n and misguided. Considering the case of the petitioner\n that he was a Gangman and for his services rendered\n pension to be paid, would be regulated by the M.P.\n Pension Rules of 1979. The appellants/State have not\n denied the fact that the petitioner was working as a\n daily wager in the respondent/Public Works\n Department from 1/6/1957 to 31/12/1995 and after\n more than 25 years of service he was regularized on\n the post w.e.f. 1/1/1996. Then undoubtedly the case of\n the respondent/petitioner would fall under Rule 6(3) of\n the M.P. (Workcharged and Contingency Paid\n Employees) Pension Rules 1979.\n\n 8. Dealing with the matter in detail we find that the\n petitioner was a Gangman working on a daily wage\n basis and not working against any permanent post as\n alleged and the dispute that he cannot be extended the\n benefit of the M.P. Pension Rules 1979 is however,\n finally set at rest in the matter of Vishnu Mutiya and\n others vs. State of M.P. And others : 2006(1)MPLJ 23\n whereby a Full Bench of this Court has held thus:\n\n \"While deciding the Gulabsingh's case the 1977\n Rules and Pension Rules of 1979 were not\n brought to the notice of the Court. Under Rule 6\n of 1976 Rules the employees who were in service\n for at least fifteen years on 1.1.1974 were eligible\n for the status of permanent work charged or\n contingency paid employees. This has been made\n\n 10\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n more liberal by the 1979 Rules. Rule 2(c) of the\n 1979 Rules lays down that a contingency paid\n employee or a workcharged employee becomes\n permanent employee wherever he completes\n fifteen years of his service though it may be after\n 1.1.1974.\"\n\nAnd further\n \"in such circumstances we hold that the services\n of gangmen are governed by the Rules applicable\n to work charged and contingency paid employees\n even though the gangman is not included in the\n schedule of 1976 Rules and the age of\n superannuation is 62 years as other Class IV\n employees of the Statement Government because\n they are in comparable category.\"\n\n9. Thus, we find that the entire controversy hinges\non the period that the employee has served prior to\nregularization as a work charged employee and\nwhether such services should be counted for pension\nas already stated above. We find that the ratio laid\ndown in the case of Mamta Shukla (supra) would not\nbe applicable in the present case simply for the reason\nthat the case of the respondent/petitioner is fully\ncovered by the sub-rule (3) of Rule 6 as amended vide\nnotification dated 30th January, 1996 in the M.P.\n(Workcharged and Contingency Paid Employees)\nPension Rules 1979 vide FD No.B25/ 17/95/PWC/IV\nwhich provides for counting of six years service\nrendered in the Work-Charged Establishment without\ninterruption prior to regularization in the regular\ndepartment.\n\n10. We also find that the point of discrimination has\nbeen raised by the learned Counsel for the\n\n 11\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nrespondent/petitioner stating that similar relief was\ngranted to other gangmen in Writ Appeal No.279/2009\n(\nState of M.P. Vs. Dhanna\n), W.A. No.253/2011 (\nState\nof M.P. vs. Nanuram\n) and W.A. No.400/2011 (\nState of\nM.P. vs. Ratanbai\n). We find that the petitioner has\nrendered blemishless service of almost 43 years in the\nPublic Works Department of the State and therefore, in\na welfare State where retiral benefit is the obligation\nof the State, such bureaucracy and mulish behaviour is\nnot to be accepted. This Court had already imposed\ncost of Rs.40,000/on the State.\n Moreover the case of\nthe applicant does not come within the purview of\nMamta Shukla (supra) since his case is completely\ncovered by sub rule (3) of Rule 6 of the M.P.\n(Workcharged and Contingency Paid Employees)\nPension Rules 1979 is already stated above.\n\n11. In the present case although the respondent was\nappointed as a gangman on muster role on 01/06/1957\nhe was regularized w.e.f. 01/01/1996 and he retired on\n30/06/2000 and six years uninterrupted services prior\nto the regularization shall be taken into consideration\nby the appellant/department while calculating the\npension of the respondent/petitioner. We have no\nhesitation in holding that the State is misguided in its\nappeal and it deserves to be dismissed as such.\n\n12. Consequently, it is hereby declared that the\nservices of the respondent/petitioner would be\ngoverned by sub rule (3) of Rule 6 of the M.P.\n(Workcharged and Contingency Paid Employees)\nPension Rules, 1979 and the case is squarely covered\n\n 12\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n by several judgments of the earlier Division Bench\n and no error has been committed by the learned Single\n Judge in allowing the writ petition. If the\n petitioner/respondent has not been paid the pension\n and other consequential benefits the appellant/State\n shall do so within two months from the date of this\n order and it is directed in the interest of justice the\n amount shall be paid with interest at the rate of 6% per\n annum.\"\n\n8. In view whereof, the petitioner No.1 was entitled for counting\n\nof his past service under Rule 6(3) of 1979 Rules.\n\n9. Now coming to family pension. The issue, in our opinion, has\n\nbeen duly considered and decided in the case of \nSmt. Sampat Bai\n\nvs State of Madhya Pradesh\n : Writ Petition No.17240/2012 on\n\n05.02.2013, wherein it is held :\n\n \"Question is whether the respondents are justified\n in rejecting the claim and whether the proposition of\n law \nlaid down in\n Mamta Shukla (supra) and the\n provisions of M.P. (Work Charged and Contingency\n Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 and M. P. Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules 1976, supports the rejection\n order.\n\n And whether rendering 10 years of service in a\n work charged establishment will also be condition\n precedent for granting of family pension, could be\n ascertained after examining the relevant provision of\n 1979 Rules and that of 76 Rules.\n\n Rule 4 A of the Rules of 1979 and Rule 6 thereof\n respectively provide for:\n\n \"4 A. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 4 the\n family of a permanent employee, who dies while in\n\n 13\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\nservice or after retirement on pension on or after the\n1st April 1981 shall be entitled to family pension at the\nrate of 30% of his/her pay drawn at the time of\ndeath/retirement subject to minimum, of Rs.40/- per\nmonth and maximum of Rs. 100/- per month subject to\nother conditions of Rule 47 of Madhya Pradesh Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules, 1976 except sub-rule (3) of\nthe said Rules.\n\n6. Commencement of qualifying service - (1) subject\nto the provisions of Chapter III of the Madhya Pradesh\nCivil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 or section IV of\nthe Madhya Pradesh New Pension Rules, 1951 as the\ncase may be, for calculating qualifying service of a\npermanent employee who retires as such, the service\nrendered with effect from the 1st January, 1959\nonwards shall be counted.\n\n(2) On absorption of a permanent employee without\ninterruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from 1st January, 1959\nonward shall be counted for pension as if such service\nwas rendered in a regular post.\n\n(3) On absorption of temporary employee without\ninterruption against any regular pensionable post, the\nservice rendered with effect from 1st January, 1974\nonwards, if such service is of less than six years shall\nbe counted for pension as if such service was rendered\nin a regular post.\n\nWhen the aforesaid two Rules are read together, it is\nclear as crystal that the provisions which govern the\nfamily pension has a different field of operation than\nthe provisions regarding pension to an employee who\nretires from the work-charged establishment and are\ngoverned by Rule 6 of Rules of 1979.\n\nBy virtue of Rule 4 A the provisions as contained\nunder Rule 47 of the M.P.

We further hold that an employee, who was\nnot appointed in accordance\nwith the provisions of Recruitment Rules framed by\nthe concerned department, i.e., the Recruitment Rules\nof 1977, would not be eligible to count his past service\nas qualifying service for the purpose of grant of\npension in accordance with the Pension Rules of 1979\nand we answer the substantial questions of law Nos. 2\nand 3 accordingly.\n\n25. \nIn regard to substantial question of law No. 1\nEarlier Division Bench of this Court in W.P. No.\n1273/2000, \nState of M.P. vs. Ramsingh and another\n, as\nheld that a daily wager employee would not fall within\nthe definition of work charged and contingency paid\nemployee, hence his case would not be covered by\nMadhya Pradesh Workcharged and Contingency Paid\n\n 16\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n Employees Pension Rules, 1979, has not been noticed\n by the subsequent Division Bench of this Court in\n \nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P.

However, in the subsequent case, the\n Division Bench has held that if an employee comes\n within the definition of work charged and contingency\n paid employee as defined the Pension Rules of 1979,\n then he is eligible to count his past service for the\n purpose of qualifying service in accordance with the\n Rules of 1979. In our opinion, there is no conflict\n between the Division Bench judgments, because the\n findings of the Division Benches are based on\n different factual aspects. Accordingly, we answer the\n substantial question of law No. 1 that there is no\n conflict of opinion between the two Division Bench\n judgments.\n \nHence, the decision of the Division Bench\n in the case of \nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. and\n others\n, 2010(4) MPLJ 332, is not per incuriam. We\n answer substantial question of law No. 1 accordingly.\"\n\n Apparent, it is from the above pronouncement\n that, the issue as to grant of family pension to a widow\n of an employee of work charged who are apparently\n covered by Rule 4A of Rules of 1979 was not the term\n of reference and nor was the same dwelt upon by the\n Full Bench.\n\n In view of above, the respondents are not justified\n in denying the family pension to the petitioner only on\n the ground that the petitioner's husband did not\n complete 10 years of service in Regular Work Charged\n Establishment.\n\n In view whereof, the impugned order dated\n 07.05.2012 is quashed. The respondents are directed to\n grant family pension to the petitioner from the date of\n entitlement. Petitioner shall also be entitled for the\n interest @ 7.5% on the difference till its final\n payment.\"\n\n10. In view of the above discussion, since we perceive no\n\nillegality in the impugned order, we decline to cause an indulgence.\n\n 17\n\n Writ Appeal No.1184/2017\n\n 11. The appeal filed by State of M.P. and its functionaries is\n\n dismissed.\n\n (SANJAY YADAV) (B. K.
