The petitioners have filed this petition seeking the following\n\n relief(s):-\n\n \"10.1 \"The Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n call for the entire records pertaining to the promotion\n case of the petitioners for its kind perusal.\n 10.2 The Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to set\n aside the order impugned dated 01.02.2014\n (Annexure P/1) issued by the respondent No.2.\n 10.3 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n direct the respondent authorities, particularly the\n respondent No.2 to consider the name of the\n petitioners for their next promotion to the post of\n Subedar (M) w.e.f. 2005 instead of 2009 with all\n consequential benefits.\n\n 10.4 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n direct the respondent authorities, particularly the\n respondent No.2 to recall the gradation list issued for\n the year 2013(Annexure P/8) and place the name of\n the petitioners in pursuance to the gradation list of\n 2003 (Annexure P/7).\n\n 10.5 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n direct the respondent authorities, particularly the\n respondent No.2 place the name of respondents No.4\n & 5 at the fag end of the gradation list in view of GOP\n No.55 (Annexure P/2) and Rule 2005 (Annexure P/4).\n 10.6 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\n grant any other relief, as if may deem fit and\n appropriate.\n\n 10.7 Cost of the petition may also be given.\"\n\n2. Mr. Kar, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\n\n submitted that the petitioners were holding the post of Sub-\n\n Inspector (M) under the Police Head Quarter, General Branch,\n\n Raipur in the year 2005. He further submitted that respondents No.\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 3\n\n 4 & 5 were juniors to the petitioners who were promoted to the\n\n post of Subedar (M) and the candidature of the petitioners was not\n\n considered by the Departmental Promotion Committee for the\n\n reasons best known to it. He also submitted that the petitioners\n\n were promoted to the post of Subedar (M) in the year 2009 and a\n\n seniority list was published in the year 2013, then they came to\n\n know that they had been placed below respondents No. 4 & 5 in\n\n the gradation list. He further argued that the petitioners are entitled\n\n to get the seniority and consequential benefits from the year 2005\n\n when respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted.\n\n3. On the other hand, Ms. Sonkar, the learned Panel Lawyer\n\n appearing for the State would oppose the submissions made by\n\n Mr. Kar. Ms. Sonkar submitted that respondents No. 4 & 5 were\n\n transferred to the State of Chhattisgarh on the mutual ground and\n\n thereafter, the seniority list was published. She further submitted\n\n that respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted to the post of Subedar\n\n (M) in the year 2005 but no action was taken by the petitioners. In\n\n the year 2009, the petitioners were also promoted to the post of\n\n Subedar (M). She also submitted that the gradation list was\n\n published in the year 2005 and thereafter, in the year 2009, and\n\n the subsequent gradation list was published in the year 2013. She\n\n further argued that the petitioners have approached this Court\n\n claiming therein seniority from the year 2005 when respondents\n\n No. 4 & 5 were promoted. She also stated that the claim of the\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 4\n\n petitioners is stale as the instant petition has been filed after a\n\n lapse of nine years without explaining the reasons for the delay.\n\n4. I have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and\n\n perused the documents placed on record.\n\n5. In the present petition, the petitioners have not pleaded when they\n\n were appointed and when respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted\n\n to the post of Subedar (M). Even the date of the meeting of DPC\n\n has not been pleaded in the instant writ petition. Admittedly,\n\n respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted to the post of Subedar (M)\n\n in the year 2005. It is pleaded that respondents No. 4 & 5 were\n\n transferred to the State of Chhattisgarh after the reorganization of\n\n the State of Chhattisgarh by mutual consent, therefore, they\n\n should have been placed below the petitioners in the gradation list.\n\n The contention raised by the learned counsel appearing for the\n\n petitioners appears to be reasonable but the petitioners failed to\n\n challenge the gradation list as well as the order of promotion which\n\n was passed in the year 2005. After the year 2005, the petitioners\n\n were promoted to the post of Subedar (M) in the year 2009. In the\n\n year 2014, the present petition was filed claiming therein seniority\n\n from the year 2005.\n\n6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nChennai\n\n Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and Others\n\n Vs. T.T. Murali Babu\n reported in (2014) 4 SCC 108 held as\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 5\n\n under:-\n\n '17. In the case at hand, though there has been four\n years' delay in approaching the court, yet the writ court\n chose not to address the same. It is the duty of the court\n to scrutinize whether such enormous delay is to be\n ignored without any justification. That apart, in the\n present case, such belated approach gains more\n significance as the respondent employee being\n absolutely careless to his duty and nurturing a\n lackadaisical attitude to the responsibility had remain\n unauthorizedly absent on the pretext of some kind of ill\n health. We repeat at the cost of repetition that remaining\n innocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the\n cause of justice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for\n it is likely to affect others. Such delay may have impact\n on others' ripened rights and may unnecessarily drag\n others into litigation which in acceptable realm of\n probability, may have been treated to have attained\n finality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such\n indolent persons -who compete with \"Kumbhakarna\" or\n for that matter \"Rip Van Winkle\" . In our considered\n opinion, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and\n on the said ground alone the writ court should have\n thrown the petition overboard at the very threshold.\n\n7. Recently, the Apex Court in the matter of \nRushibhai\n\n Jagdishbhai Pathak Vs. Bhavnagar Municipal Corporation\n\n reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 64 held as under:-\n\n '9. The doctrine of delay and laches, or for that matter\n statutes of limitation, are considered to be statutes of\n repose and statutes of peace, though some contrary\n opinions have been expressed (in Nav Rattanmal Vs.\n state of Rajasthan, AIR 1961 SC 1704). The courts have\n expressed the view that the law of limitation rests on the\n foundations of greater public interest for three reasons,\n namely, (a) that long dormant claims have more of\n cruelty than justice in them; (b) that a defendant might\n have lost the evidence to disapprove a stale claim; and\n\n \n(iii) that persons with good causes of action (who are\n able to enforce them) should pursue them with\n reasonable diligence (\nState of Kerala Vs. V.R.\n Kalliyanikutty\n, (1999) 3 SCC 657 relying on Halsbury's\n Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 28, para 605; Halsbury's\n Laws of England , Vol. 68 (2021) para 1005. Equally,\n change in de facto position or character, creation of third\n party rights over a period of time, waiver, acquiesce, and\n need to ensure certitude in dealings, are equitable public\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 6\n\n policy considerations why period of limitation is\n prescribed by law. Law of limitation does not apply to\n writ petitions, albeit the discretion vested with a\n constitutional court is exercised with caution as delay\n and laches principle is applied with the aim to secure the\n quiet of the community, suppress fraud and perjury,\n quicken diligence, and prevent oppression.\n(see \nPopat\n and Kotecha Property Vs. State Bank of India Staff\n Association\n (2005) 7 SCC 510).Therefore, some\n decisions and judgments do not look upon pleas of delay\n and laches with favour, especially and rightly in cases\n where the persons suffer from adeptness, or incapacity\n to approach the courts for relief. However, other\n decisions, while accepting the rules of limitation as well\n as delay and laches, have observed that such rules are\n not meant to destroy the rights of the parties but serve a\n larger public interest and are founded on public policy.\n\n \nThere must be a lifespan during which a person must\n approach the court for their remedy. Otherwise, there\n would be unending uncertainty as to the rights and\n obligations of the parties. (See \nN. Blarkrishnan Vs. M.\n Krishnamurthy\n, (1998)7 SCC 123.\n Referring to the\n principle of delay and laches, this Court, way back in\n Moons Mils Ltd Vs. M.R. Mehar, President, Industrial\n Court, Bombay AIR 1967 SC 1450, had referred to the\n view expressed by Sir Barnes Peacock in The Lindsay\n Petroleum Company and Prosper Armstrong Hurd,\n Abram Farewell, and John Kemp, (L.R.) 5 P.C.221 in the\n following words:\n\n \" Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an\n arbitrary or a technical doctrine, Where it would be\n practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the\n party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be\n regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by this\n conduct and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving\n that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in\n which it would not be reasonable to place him if the\n remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of\n these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material.\n But in every case,if an argument against relief, which\n otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay,\n that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any\n statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be\n tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two\n circumstances, always important in such cases, are, the\n length of the delay and the nature of the acts done\n during the interval, which might affect either party and\n cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one\n course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.\"\n\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 7\n\n8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of \nBichitrananda\n\n Behera Vs. State of Orissa and others\n reported in 2023 Livelaw\n\n (SC) 883, under relevant para 21 held as under:-\n\n \"21. Profitably, we may reproduce relevant\n passagesfrom certain decisions of this Court:\n\n \n(\nA) Union of India v Tarsem Singh\n, (2008) 8 SCC 648:\n\n \"To summarise, normally, a belated service related claim\n will be rejected on the ground of delay and laches\n (where remedy is sought by filing a writ petition) or\n limitation (where remedy is sought by an application to\n the Administrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions to\n the said rule is cases relating to a continuing wrong.\n Where a service related claim is based on a continuing\n wrong, relief can be granted even if there is a long delay\n in seeking remedy, with reference to the date on which\n the continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing\n wrong creates a continuing source of injury. But there is\n an exception to the exception. If the grievance is in\n respect of any order or administrative decision which\n related to or affected several others also, and if the\n reopening of the issue would affect the settled rights of\n third parties, then the claim will not be entertained. For\n example, if the issue relates to payment or refixation of\n pay or pension, relief may be granted in spite of delay\n as it does not affect the rights of third parties. But if the\n claim involved issues relating to seniority or promotion,\n etc., affecting others, delay would render the claim stale\n and doctrine of laches/limitation will be applied. Insofar\n as the consequential relief of recovery of arrears for a\n past period is concerned, the principles relating to\n recurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a\n consequence, the High Courts will restrict the\n consequential relief relating to arrears normally to a\n period of three years prior to the date of filing of the writ\n petition.\" (emphasis supplied)\n (B) Union of India v N Murugesan, (2022) 2 SCC 25:\n\n \"Delay, laches and acquiescence\n\n 20. The principles governing delay, laches, and\n acquiescence are overlapping and interconnected on\n many occasions. However, they have their distinct\n characters and distinct elements. One can say that\n delay is the genus to which laches and acquiescence\n are species. Similarly, laches might be called a genus to\n a species by name acquiescence. However, there may\n be a case where acquiescence is involved, but not\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 8\n\n laches. These principles are common law principles,\n and perhaps one could identify that these principles find\n place in various statutes which restrict the period of\n limitation and create non consideration of condonation\n in certain circumstances. They are bound to be applied\n by way of practice requiring prudence of the court than\n of a strict application of law. The underlying principle\n governing these concepts would be one of estoppel.\n The question of prejudice is also an important issue to\n be taken note of by the court.\n\n Laches\n\n 21. The word \"laches\" is derived from the French\n language meaning \"remissness and slackness\". It thus\n involves unreasonable delay or negligence in pursuing\n a claim involving an equitable relief while causing\n prejudice to the other party. It is neglect on the part of a\n party to do an act which law requires while asserting a\n right, and therefore, must stand in the way of the party\n getting relief or remedy.\n\n 22. Two essential factors to be seen are the length of\n the delay and the nature of acts done during the\n interval. As stated, it would also involve acquiescence\n on the part of the party approaching the court apart from\n the change in position in the interregnum. Therefore, it\n would be unjustifiable for a Court of Equity to confer a\n remedy on a party who knocks its doors when his acts\n would indicate a waiver of such a right. By his conduct,\n he has put the other party in a particular position, and\n therefore, it would be unreasonable to facilitate a\n challenge before the court. Thus, a man responsible for\n his conduct on equity is not expected to be allowed to\n avail a remedy.\n\n 23. A defence of laches can only be allowed when there\n is no statutory bar. The question as to whether there\n exists a clear case of laches on the part of a person\n seeking a remedy is one of fact and so also that of\n prejudice. The said principle may not have any\n application when the existence of fraud is pleaded and\n proved by the other side. To determine the difference\n between the concept of laches and acquiescence is\n that, in a case involving mere laches, the principle of\n estoppel would apply to all the defences that are\n available to a party. Therefore, a defendant can\n succeed on the various grounds raised by the plaintiff,\n while an issue concerned alone would be amenable to\n acquiescence.\n\n Acquiescence\n\n 24. We have already discussed the relationship\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 9\n\n between acquiescence on the one hand and delay and\n laches on the other.\n\n 25. Acquiescence would mean a tacit or passive\n acceptance. It is implied and reluctant consent to an\n act. In other words, such an action would qualify a\n passive assent. Thus, when acquiescence takes place,\n it presupposes knowledge against a particular act. From\n the knowledge comes passive acceptance, therefore\n instead of taking any action against any alleged refusal\n to perform the original contract, despite adequate\n knowledge of its terms, and instead being allowed to\n continue by consciously ignoring it and thereafter\n proceeding further, acquiescence does take place. As a\n consequence, it reintroduces a new implied agreement\n between the parties. Once such a situation arises, it is\n not open to the party that acquiesced itself to insist\n upon the compliance of the original terms. Hence, what\n is essential, is the conduct of the parties. We only dealt\n with the distinction involving a mere acquiescence.\n When acquiescence is followed by delay, it may\n become laches. Here again, we are inclined to hold that\n the concept of acquiescence is to be seen on a case-to-\n case basis.\" (emphasis supplied)\n (C) Chairman, State Bank of India v M J James, (2022)\n 2 SCC 301:\n\n \"36. What is a reasonable time is not to be put in a\n straitjacket formula or judicially codified in the form of\n days, etc. as it depends upon the facts and\n circumstances of each case. A right not exercised for a\n long time is nonexistent. Doctrine of delay and laches\n as well as acquiescence are applied to non-suit the\n litigants who approach the court/appellate authorities\n belatedly without any justifiable explanation for bringing\n action after unreasonable delay. In the present case,\n challenge to the order of dismissal from service by way\n of appeal was after four years and five months, which is\n certainly highly belated and beyond justifiable time.\n Without satisfactory explanation justifying the delay, it is\n difficult to hold that the appeal was preferred within a\n reasonable time. Pertinently, the challenge was\n primarily on the ground that the respondent was not\n allowed to be represented by a representative of his\n choice. The respondent knew that even if he were to\n succeed on this ground, as has happened in the writ\n proceedings, fresh inquiry would not be prohibited as\n finality is not attached unless there is a legal or statutory\n bar, an aspect which has been also noticed in the\n impugned judgment. This is highlighted to show the\n prejudice caused to the appellants by the delayed\n challenge. We would, subsequently, examine the\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 10\n\n question of acquiescence and its judicial effect in the\n context of the present case.\n\n Xxx\n\n 38. \nIn \nRam Chand v. Union of India [Ram Chand\n v.\n Union of India, (1994) 1 SCC 44] and State of U.P. v.\n Manohar [State of U.P. v. Manohar, (2005) 2 SCC 126]\n this Court observed that if the statutory authority has not\n performed its duty within a reasonable time, it cannot\n justify the same by taking the plea that the person who\n has been deprived of his rights has not approached the\n appropriate forum for relief. If a statutory authority does\n not pass any orders and thereby fails to comply with the\n statutory mandate within reasonable time, they normally\n should not be permitted to take the defence of laches\n and delay.\n \nIf at all, in such cases, the delay furnishes a\n cause of action, which in some cases as elucidated in\n \nUnion of India v. Tarsem Singh [Union of India\n v. Tarsem\n Singh, (2008) 8 SCC 648 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 765]\n may be continuing cause of action.The State being a\n virtuous litigant should meet the genuine claims and not\n deny them for want of action on their part. However, this\n general principle would not apply when, on\n consideration of the facts, the court concludes that the\n respondent had abandoned his rights, which may be\n either express or implied from his conduct.\n\nAbandonment implies intentional act to acknowledge,\n as has been held in para 6 of Motilal Padampat Sugar\n Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. [Motilal Padampat Sugar\n Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., (1979) 2 SCC 409 : 1979\n SCC (Tax) 144] Applying this principle of acquiescence\n to the precept of delay and laches, this Court in U.P. Jal\n Nigam v.Jaswant \nSingh [U.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant\n Singh\n, (2006) 11 SCC 464 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 500]\n after referring to several judgments, has accepted the\n following elucidation in Halsbury's Laws of England :\n\n \n(\nJaswant Singh\n case [\nU.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant Singh\n,\n (2006) 11 SCC 464 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 500] , SCC\n pp. 470-71, paras 1213)\n \"12. The statement of law has also been summarised in\n Halsbury's Laws of England, Para 911,p. 395 as follows:\n\n 'In determining whether there has been such delay as to\n amount to laches, the chief points to be considered are:\n\n (i) acquiescence on the claimant's part;and\n\n (ii) any change of position that has occurred on the\n defendant's part.\n\n Acquiescence in this sense does not mean standing by\n while the violation of a right is in progress,but assent\n Neutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 11\n\n after the violation has been completed and the claimant\n has become aware of it. It is unjust to give the claimant\n a remedy where, by his conduct, he has done that\n which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver\n of it; or where by his conduct and neglect, though not\n waiving the remedy, he has put the other party in a\n position in which it would not be reasonable to place\n him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted. In\n such cases lapse of time and delay are most material.\n Upon these considerations rests the doctrine of laches.'\n\n 13. In view of the statement of law as summarised\n above, the respondents are guilty since the respondents\n have acquiesced in accepting the retirement and did not\n challenge the same in time. If they would have been\n vigilant enough, they could have filed writ petitions as\n others did in the matter. Therefore, whenever it appears\n that the claimants lost time or whiled it away and did not\n rise to the occasion in time for filing the writ petitions,\n then in such cases, the court should be very slow in\n granting the relief to the incumbent. Secondly, it has\n also to be taken into consideration the question of\n acquiescence or waiver on the part of the incumbent\n whether other parties are going to be prejudiced if the\n relief is granted. In the present case, if the respondents\n would have challenged their retirement being violative\n of the provisions of the Act, perhaps the Nigam could\n have taken appropriate steps to raise funds so as to\n meet the liability but by not asserting their rights the\n respondents have allowed time to pass and after a\n lapse of couple of years, they have filed writ petitions\n claiming the benefit for two years. That will definitely\n require the Nigam to raise funds which is going to have\n serious financial repercussions on the financial\n management of the Nigam. Why should the court come\n to the rescue of such persons when they themselves\n are guilty of waiver and acquiescence?\"\n\n \n39. Before proceeding further, it is important to clarify\n distinction between \"acquiescence\" and \"delay and\n laches\". Doctrine of acquiescence is an equitable\n doctrine which applies when a party having a right\n stands by and sees another dealing in a manner\n inconsistent with that right, while the act is in progress\n and after violation is completed, which conduct reflects\n his assent or accord. He cannot afterwards complain.\n [See \nPrabhakar v. Sericulture Deptt.\n, (2015) 15 SCC 1 :\n\n \n(2016) 2 SCC (L&S) 149. Also, see \nGobinda Ramanuj\n Das Mohanta v. Ram Charan Das\n, 1925 SCC OnLine\n Cal 30 : AIR 1925 Cal 1107] In literal sense, the term\n acquiescence means silent assent, tacit consent,\n concurrence, or acceptance, [See Vidyavathi Kapoor\n Neutral Citation\n2024:\nCGHC:26151\n\n 12\n\n Trust v. CIT\n, 1991 SCC OnLine Kar 331 : (1992) 194\n ITR 584] which denotes conduct that is evidence of an\n intention of a party to abandon an equitable right and\n also to denote conduct from which another party will be\n justified in inferring such an intention.\n \n[See \nKrishan Dev\n v. Ram Piari\n, 1964 SCC OnLine HP 5 : AIR 1964 HP 34]\n Acquiescence can be either direct with full knowledge\n and express approbation, or indirect where a person\n having the right to set aside the action stands by and\n sees another dealing in a manner inconsistent with that\n right and in spite of the infringement takes no action\n mirroring acceptance. [See \"Introduction\", U.N. Mitra,\n Tagore Law Lectures -- Law of Limitation and\n Prescription, Vol. I, 14th Edn., 2016.] However,\n acquiescence will not apply if lapse of time is of no\n importance or consequence.\n\n 40. Laches unlike limitation is flexible. However, both\n limitation and laches destroy the remedy but not the\n right. Laches like acquiescence is based upon equitable\n considerations, but laches unlike acquiescence imports\n even simple passivity. On the other hand, acquiescence\n implies active assent and is based upon the rule of\n estoppel in pais. As a form of estoppel, it bars a party\n afterwards from complaining of the violation of the right.\n \nEven indirect acquiescence implies almost active\n consent, which is not to be inferred by mere silence or\n inaction which is involved in laches. Acquiescence in\n this manner is quite distinct from delay. Acquiescence\n virtually destroys the right of the person. [See\n \nVidyavathi Kapoor Trust v. CIT\n, 1991 SCC OnLine Kar\n 331 : (1992) 194 ITR 584] Given the aforesaid legal\n position, inactive acquiescence on the part of the\n respondent can be inferred till the filing of the appeal,\n and not for the period post filing of the appeal.\n Nevertheless, this acquiescence being in the nature of\n estoppel bars the respondent from claiming violation of\n the right of fair representation.\"\n\n9. It is the duty of the court to scrutinize whether such enormous\n\n delay is to be ignored without any justification. Remaining\n\n innocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the cause of\n\n justice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for it is likely to affect\n\n others. Such delay may have impact on others' ripened rights and\n\n may unnecessarily drag others into litigation which in acceptable\n Neutral Citation\n 2024:CGHC:26151\n\n 13\n\n realm of probability, may have been treated to have attained\n\n finality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such indolent\n\n persons, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and on the\n\n said ground alone this Court deems it appropriate to dismiss this\n\n petition at the very threshold. The doctrine of delay and laches, or\n\n for that matter statutes of limitation are considered to be statutes of\n\n repose and statutes of peace. There must be a lifespan during\n\n which a person must approach the court for their remedy.\n\n Otherwise, there would be unending uncertainty as to the rights\n\n and obligations of the parties.\n\n \n10.Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case in\n\n light of the judgments passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\n matters of \nChennai Metropolitan Water Supply\n (supra),\n\n \nRushibhai Jagdishbhai Pathak\n (supra) and \nBichitrananda\n\n Behera\n (supra), it is quite vivid that the petitioners have\n\n approached this Court after a delay of 9 years and in para 7 of the\n\n writ petition, they have stated that there is no delay in filing the\n\n instant petition. The petitioners utterly failed to explain the delay\n\n caused in filing the instant petition, therefore, in the considered\n\n opinion of this Court, this petition is liable to be and is hereby\n\n dismissed on account of delay and laches. No costs.\n\n Sd/-\n\n (Rakesh Mohan Pandey)\n Judge\nRekha",

It is neglect on the part of a\n party to do an act which law requires while asserting a\n right, and therefore, must stand in the way of the party\n getting relief or remedy."

Therefore, it\n would be unjustifiable for a Court of Equity to confer a\n remedy on a party who knocks its doors when his acts\n would indicate a waiver of such a right. By his conduct,\n he has put the other party in a particular position, and\n therefore, it would be unreasonable to facilitate a\n challenge before the court.

Thus, when acquiescence takes place,\n it presupposes knowledge against a particular act. From\n the knowledge comes passive acceptance, therefore\n instead of taking any action against any alleged refusal\n to perform the original contract, despite adequate\n knowledge of its terms, and instead being allowed to\n continue by consciously ignoring it and thereafter\n proceeding further, acquiescence does take place. As a\n consequence, it reintroduces a new implied agreement\n between the parties. Once such a situation arises, it is\n not open to the party that acquiesced itself to insist\n upon the compliance of the original terms. Hence, what\n is essential, is the conduct of the parties. We only dealt\n with the distinction involving a mere acquiescence.\n When acquiescence is followed by delay, it may\n become laches.
