As per the facts pleaded in the writ petition, petitioner is an\n\nemployee of respondent No.1-Bank. He joined the services as Clerk\n\non 31st of January, 1995.

So far as the first issue is concerned Seven Judges Bench\n\nof Apex Court in the case of \nPradeep Kumar Biswas vs. Indian\n\nInstitute of Chemical Biology\n, (2002) 5 SCC 111 while considering\n\nthe test as \nlaid down in\n the case of \nAjay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib\n\nSehravardi\n, (1981) 1 SCC 722 and overruling the view taken in\n\nSabhajit Tewari vs. Union of India and others\n, (1975) 1 SCC 485\n\nobserved as under :\n\n \"40. The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests\n formulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles so that if\n a body falls within any one of them it must, ex-hypothesis, be\n considered to be a State within the meaning of \nArticle 12.\n The\n question in each case would be - whether in the light of the\n cumulative facts as established, the body is financially,\n functionally and administratively dominated by or under the\n control of the Government. Such control must be particular to the\n body in question and must be pervasive. If this is found then the\n body is a State within \nArticle 12.\n On the other hand, when the\n control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it\n would not serve to make the body a State.\"\n\n9. The question w.r.t. Punjab State Co-operative Land\n\nMortgage Bank being a 'State' or not already stands answered by Full\n\nBench of this Court in the case of Pritam Singh vs. State (FB), AIR\n\n1982 Punjab and Haryana 228. \nThe Full Bench following the\n\nprinciples laid down in \nAjay Hasia\n's case (supra) concluded as\n\n 4 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:49 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 5\n\nunder :-\n\n \"25. From the above, the conclusion, therefore, is inevitable that it\n has not even remotely been established that respondent No. 3 the\n mortgage bank (against which alone the primary relief is claimed),\n is an instrumentality or agency of the State. Consequently, it cannot\n be deemed to be an authority within the meaning of \nArt. 12\n of the\n Constitution of India and thus not amenable to a writ of certiorari\n under \nArt. 226\n of the Constitution of India, which is the primary\n relief sought.\n\n 26. Repelled on his primary plank to establish that the mortgage\n bank was an instrumentality of the State and consequently\n amenable to the writ jurisdiction (despite the fact of its being\n registered under the \nCo-operative Societies Act\n), Mr. Saini made a\n tactical retreat to make a flanking attack which seems to be equally\n futile. It was forcefully contended that in spite of the fact that the\n mortgage bank may not be an authority under \nArt. 12\n of the\n Constitution of India, a writ of certiorari will nevertheless still lie\n for quashing the order of the Managing Director of the respondent-\n mortgage bank, whereby the petitioner has been compulsorily\n retried. This contention might merit some dubious tribute to the\n ingenuity of the learned counsel but the same is patently\n fallacious.\"\n\n It needs to be mentioned that in afore-said judgment Full Bench\n\napproved the view taken by Single Bench viz-a-viz the respondent-\n\nBank in this case holding that it is not 'State'.\n\n10. Being bound by ratio of law \nlaid down by\n the Full Bench\n\nin \nPritam Singh\n's case (supra), I have no hesitation in holding that the\n\nrespondent-Cooperative Society is not 'State' or instrumentality thereof\n\nand, thus, would not fall within ambit of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution\n\nof India. Resultantly, the first question framed in Para 7 stands\n\n 5 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 6\n\nanswered in favour of the respondent.\n\n11. Now coming on to the second issue. The law has evolved.\n\nOwing to the change post economic liberalization of the country in the\n\n1990s, role of the State is getting limited. Doctrine of laissez-faire is\n\nthe norm. However, it has led to creation of a parallel eco-system\n\nwherein bodies of different characters and species are performing\n\npublic functions. The Apex Court in the case of \nAnadi Mukta\n\nSadguru vs. V.R. Rudani and others\n, (1989) 2 SCC 691 made\n\nfollowing observations :-\n\n \"The term \"authority\" used in \nArticle 226\n, in the con- text, must\n receive a liberal meaning unlike the term in \nArticle 12.\n \nArticle 12\n\n is relevant only for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental\n rights under \nArt. 32.\n \nArticle 226\n confers power on the High Courts\n to issue writs for enforcement of the fundamental rights as well as\n non-fundamental rights. The words \"Any person or authority\" used\n in \nArticle 226\n are, therefore, not to be confined only to statutory\n authorities and instrumentalities of the State. They may cover any\n other person or body performing public duty. The form of the body\n concerned is not very much relevant. What is relevant is the nature\n of the duty imposed on the body. The duty must be judged in the\n light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the\n affected party. No matter by what means the duty is imposed. If a\n positive obligation exists mandamus cannot be denied.\"\n\n12. \nIn the case of \nSt. Mary's Education Society and another\n\nvs. Rajendra Prasad Bhargava and others\n, 2022 SCC OnLine SC\n\n1091 while concluding the law w.r.t. maintainability of writ petition\n\n 6 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 7\n\nagainst the State instrumentality/bodies involved in public functions\n\nheld as under :\n\n \"(a) An application under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution is\n maintainable against a person or a body discharging public duties\n or public functions. The public duty cast may be either statutory\n or otherwise and where it is otherwise, the body or the person\n must be shown to owe that duty or obligation to the public\n involving the public law element. Similarly, for ascertaining the\n discharge of public function, it must be established that the body\n or the person was seeking to achieve the same for the collective\n benefit of the public or a section of it and the authority to do so\n must be accepted by the public.\n\n (b) Even if it be assumed that an educational institution is\n imparting public duty, the act complained of must have a direct\n nexus with the discharge of public duty. It is indisputably a public\n law action which confers a right upon the aggrieved to invoke the\n extraordinary writ jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n for a prerogative\n writ. Individual wrongs or breach of mutual contracts without\n having any public element as its integral part cannot be rectified\n through a writ petition under \nArticle 226.\n Wherever Courts have\n intervened in their exercise of jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n,\n either the service conditions were regulated by the statutory\n provisions or the employer had the status of \"State\" within the\n expansive definition under \nArticle 12\n or it was found that the\n action complained of has public law element.\n\n (c) It must be consequently held that while a body may be\n discharging a public function or performing a public duty and thus\n its actions becoming amenable to judicial review by a\n Constitutional Court, its employees would not have the right to\n invoke the powers of the High Court conferred by \nArticle 226\n in\n respect of matter relating to service where they are not governed\n or controlled by the statutory provisions. An educational\n institution may perform myriad functions touching various facets\n of public life and in the societal sphere. While such of those\n\n 7 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 8\n\n functions as would fall within the domain of a \"public function\"\n\n or \"public duty\" be undisputedly open to challenge and scrutiny\n under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution, the actions or decisions\n taken solely within the confines of an ordinary contract of service,\n having no statutory force or backing, cannot be recognised as\n being amenable to challenge under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution. In the absence of the service conditions being\n controlled or governed by statutory provisions, the matter would\n remain in the realm of an ordinary contract of service.\n\n (d) Even if it be perceived that imparting education by private\n unaided the school is a public duty within the expanded\n expression of the term, an employee of a nonteaching staff\n engaged by the school for the purpose of its administration or\n internal management is only an agency created by it. It is\n immaterial whether \"A\" or \"B\" is employed by school to\n discharge that duty. In any case, the terms of employment of\n contract between a school and non-teaching staff cannot and\n should not be construed to be an inseparable part of the obligation\n to impart education. This is particularly in respect to the\n disciplinary proceedings that may be initiated against a particular\n employee. It is only where the removal of an employee of non-\n\n teaching staff is regulated by some statutory provisions, its\n violation by the employer in contravention of law may be\n interfered by the court. But such interference will be on the\n ground of breach of law and not on the basis of interference in\n discharge of public duty.\n\n (e) From the pleadings in the original writ petition, it is apparent\n that no element of any public law is agitated or otherwise made\n out. In other words, the action challenged has no public element\n and writ of mandamus cannot be issued as the action was\n essentially of a private character.\"\n\n13. Thus, the proposition that emerges is that for an\n\nestablishment to be a 'State' as defined under \nArticle 12\n of the\n\n 8 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 9\n\nConstitution of India, it must pass the tests as enumerated by Apex\n\nCourt in \nAjay Hasia\n's case (supra) and reiterated by the Constitution\n\nBench in the case of \nPradeep Kumar Biswas\n (supra). In case the\n\nestablishment against whom writ has been filed falls within the ambit\n\nof \nArticle 12\n and can be termed as 'State', there would be no doubt\n\nabout the same being amenable to writ jurisdiction. However, writ\n\npetition will not be held to be maintainable against a body discharging\n\npublic function merely because it does not fall within the definition of\n\n'State'. The test is : whether cause of action pleaded by the petitioner\n\ninvolves breach of statutory provision? In the case of Cooperative\n\nSociety also though it is not 'State' but a breach of statutory Rules\n\nwould render it amenable to writ jurisdiction.\n\n14. Even in the case of \nS.S. Rana vs. Registrar Co-operative\n\nSocieties & Anr.\n (2006) 11 SCC 434 Apex Court held as under :-\n\n \"8. ....It is not in dispute that the Society has not been constituted\n under an Act. Its functions like any other Co-operative Society\n are mainly regulated in terms of the provisions of the Act, except\n as provided in the bye-laws of the Society. The State has no say\n in the functions of the Society. Membership, acquisition of shares\n and all other matters are governed by the bye-laws framed under\n the Act. The terms and conditions of an officer of the Co-\n operative Society, indisputably, are governed by the Rules. Rule\n 56, to which reference has been made by Mr. Vijay Kumar, does\n not contain any provision in terms whereof any legal right as such\n is conferred upon an officer of the Society.\n\n 9. It has not been shown before us that the State exercises any\n\n 9 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 10\n\n direct or indirect control over the affairs of the Society for deep\n and pervasive control. The State furthermore is not the majority\n shareholder. The State has the power only to nominate one\n director. It cannot, thus, be said that the State exercises any\n functional control over the affairs of the Society in the sense that\n the majority directors are nominated by the State. For arriving at\n the conclusion that the State has a deep and pervasive control\n over the Society, several other relevant questions are required to\n be considered, namely : (1) How the Society was created ?; (2)\n Whether it enjoys any monopoly character ?; (3) Do the functions\n of the Society partake to statutory functions or public functions ?;\n and (4) Can it be characterised as public Authority ?\n\n 10. The respondent No. 1-Society does not answer any of the\n afore-mentioned tests. \nIn the case of a non-statutory society, the\n control thereover would mean that the same satisfies the tests \nlaid\n down by\n this Court in \nAjay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi\n,\n (1981)1 SCC 722. [See Zoroastrian Coop. Housing Society Ltd.\n\n v. District Registrar, Coop. Societies (Urban) & Ors., 2005(5)\n SCC 632].\n\n 11. It is well settled that general regulations under an Act, like\n \nCompanies Act\n or the \nCo-operative Societies Act\n, would not\n render the activities of a company or a society as subject to\n control of the State. Such control in terms of the provisions of the\n Act are meant to ensure proper functioning of the Society and the\n State or statutory authorities would have nothing to do with its\n day-to-day functions.\n\n \n12. The decision of the Seven Judge Bench of this Court in\n \nPradeep Kumar Biswas\n (supra), whereupon strong reliance has\n been placed, has no application in the instant case.\n \nIn that case,\n the Bench was deciding a question as to whether in view of the\n subsequent decisions of this Court, the law was correctly \nlaid\n down in\n \nSabhajit Tewary v. Union of India & Ors.\n, (1975) 1\n SCC 485, and it not whether the same deserved to be overruled.\n The majority opined that the Council of Scientific and Industrial\n\n 10 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 11\n\n Research (CSIR) was a 'State' within the meaning of \nArticle 12\n of\n the Constitution of India. This Court noticed the history of the\n formation thereof, its objects and functions, its management and\n control as also the extent of financial aid received by it. Apart\n from the said fact it was noticed by reason of an appropriate\n notification issued by the Central Government that CSIR was\n amenable to the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative\n Tribunal in terms of \nSection 14(2)\n of the Administrative\n Tribunals Act, 1985.\n \nIt was on the aforementioned premises this\n Court opined that \nSabhajit Tewary\n (supra) did not lay down the\n correct law.\n \nThis Court reiterated the following six tests \nlaid\n down in\n \nAjay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi\n, (1981) 1 SCC\n 722 :\n\n \"(1) One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the\n corporation is held by Government, it would go a long\n way towards indicating that the corporation is an\n instrumentality or agency of Government.\n\n (2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much\n as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it\n would afford some indication of the corporation being\n impregnated with Governmental character.\n\n (3) It may also be relevant factor ...whether the\n corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State\n conferred or State protected.\n\n (4) Existence of deep and pervasive State control may\n afford an indication that the corporation is a State agency\n or instrumentality.\n\n (5) If the functions of the corporation are of public\n importance and closely related to Governmental functions,\n it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation\n as an instrumentality or agency of Government.\n (6) 'Specifically, if a department of Government is\n transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor\n supportive of this inference' of the corporation being an\n instrumentality or agency of Government.\"\n\n \n11 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 12\n\n This \nCourt further held\n :\n\n \"This picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests\n formulated in Ajay Hasia are not a rigid set of principles\n so that if a body falls within any one of them it must, ex\n hypothesi, be considered to be a State within the meaning\n of \nArticle 12.\n The question in each case would be whether\n in the light of the cumulative facts as established, the body\n is financially, functionally and administratively dominated\n by or under the control of the Government.

As the respondent No. 1 does not satisfy any of the tests \nlaid\n down in\n \nPradeep Kumar Biswas\n (supra), we are of the opinion\n that the High Court cannot be said to have commtted any error in\n arriving at a finding that the respondent-Bank is not a State within\n the meaning of \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n \n14. We are, however, not oblivious of a three judge Bench decision\n in \nGayatri De v. Mousumi Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. &\n Ors.\n, 2004(3) RCR (Civil) 204 : (2004) 5 SCC 90, wherein this\n Court held a writ petition to be maintainable against the\n cooperative society only stating :\n\n \"We have, in paragraphs supra, considered the judgments\n for and against on the question of maintainability of writ\n petition. The judgments cited by the learned Senior\n Counsel appearing for the respondents are distinguishable\n on facts and on law. Those cases are not cases covered by\n the appointment of a Special Officer to manage the\n administration of the Society and its affairs.

The said decision, therefore, is of no assistance to us.\n\n \n16. Our attention has also been drawn to U.P. State Cooperative\n Land development \nBank Ltd. v. Chandra Bhan Dubey & Ors.\n,\n 1999(1) S.C.T. 593 : (1999) 1 SCC 741, wherein the writ petition\n was held to be maintainable principally on the ground that it had\n been created under an Act.\n \nReliance has also been placed upon\n \nRam Sahan Rai v. Sachiv Samanaya Prabandhak & Anr.\n, 2001\n (2) S.C.T. 231 : (2001) 3 SCC 323, wherein again the appellant\n thus was recruited in a Society constituted under the U.P.\n Cooperative Land Development Bank Act, 1964 and this Court,\n having examined different provisions of rules, bye-laws and\n regulations, was of the firm opinion that the State Government\n exercised all-pervasive control over the Bank and moreover its\n employees were governed by statutory rules, prescribing an entire\n gamut of procedure of initiation of disciplinary proceedings by\n framing a set of charges culminating in inflicting of appropriate\n punishment, after complying with the requirements of giving a\n show-cause and an opportunity of hearing to the delinquent.\n\n \n17. It is, therefore, evident that in \nRam Sahan Rai\n (supra) also the\n cooperative society was held to be established under a statute.\n \nWe\n may notice that in \nNayagarh Cooperative Central Bank Ltd. &\n Anr. v. Narayan Rath & Anr.\n, (1977) 3 SCC 576, this Court was\n of the opinion that :\n\n \"The High Court has dealt with the question whether a\n writ petition can be maintained against a cooperative\n society, but we are inclined to the view that the\n observations made by the High Court and its decision that\n such a writ petition is maintainable are not strictly in\n accordance with the decisions of this Court. We would\n have liked to go into the question for ourselves, but it is\n unnecessary to do so as Respondent 1 by his writ petition,\n\n 13 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 14\n\n was asking for relief not really against a cooperative\n society but in regard to the order which was passed by the\n Registrar, who was acting as a statutory authority in the\n purported exercise of powers conferred on him by the\n \nCooperative Societies Act\n. The writ petition was in that\n view maintainable.\"\n\n \n18. We may notice in some decisions, some High Courts have\n held wherein that a writ petition would be maintainable against a\n society if it is demonstrated that any mandatory provision of the\n Act or the rules framed thereunder, have been violated by it. [See\n \nBholanath Roy & Ors. v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n, (1996)\n Vol. 1 Calcutta Law Journal 502].\n\n 19. The Society has not been created under any statute. It has not\n been shown before that in terminating the services of the\n appellant, the Respondent has violated any mandatory provisions\n of the Act or the rules framed thereunder. In fact, in the writ\n petition no such case was made out.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n15. In the present writ petition, the petitioner prays for writ of\n\nmandamus and not for writ of certiorari. Trite it is that in order to\n\ninvoke the mandamus jurisdiction, the petitioner is under obligation to\n\nshow public or statutory duty laid on the respondent and to\n\ndemonstrate an equally clear legal right to enforce the same. On the\n\naforesaid principle, ratio of law \nlaid down by\n Full Bench of this Court\n\nin \nPritam Singh\n's case (supra) is fully in-line with exceptions carved\n\nout in \nS.S. Rana\n's case (supra). Now the question arises is: whether\n\nthe Punjab State Cooperative Agricultural Development Bank Service\n\n 14 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 15\n\nCommon Cadre Rules, 1978 are mandatory?.\n\n16. It need not look far as the said issue also stands concluded\n\nby Full Bench of this Court in \nJasbir Singh vs. Commissioner\n\n(Appeals), Jalandhar Division and others\n, 2011(4) RCR (Civil) 1,\n\nwherein it has been held that :-\n\n \"37. There are three categories of Service Rules which can be\n framed to regulate the conditions of service of the employees of\n the Society. In first category, a registered Society under the\n \nSocieties Act\n can frame its own Service Rules to regulate the\n service conditions of its employees. The Rules may be binding\n between the Society and its employees. The second category of\n the Rules is those rules which are formulated under Section 85(2)\n (xxxviii), which empower the Government to frame Service Rules\n for any Co-operative Society or for class of societies with regard\n to qualifications for employees of a Society or class of society and\n the conditions of service subject to which persons may be\n employed by Societies. Such Rules so framed have the force of\n Statute and are deemed to be incorporated as a part of the Statute,\n whereas this principle does not apply to the first category of Rules\n framed by the Society because those Rules merely govern the\n internal management, business or administration of a society.\n They are of the nature of the Articles of Association of a\n Company incorporated under the \nCompanies Act\n. They may be\n binding between the persons affected by them, but they do not\n have the force of a statute. But the second category of Rules is the\n Statutory Rules and they have the force of the statute. Similarly,\n there is third category of Rules known as Common Cadre Rules.\n These rules could have been framed under Section 84-A of the\n Punjab Act which provide that an apex society may suo motu and\n when required to do so by the Registrar shall constitute a common\n cadre of all, or specified class of employee in the service of that\n society or in the service of the central societies which are\n\n 15 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 16\n\n members of the apex society or in the service of the primary\n societies which are members of the apex society. Sub-section (2)\n further provides that when a common cadre of employee is\n constituted under sub-section (1), the Registrar shall\n notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being\n in force or any agreement, settlement or award determine the pay\n scales and allowances admissible to such employees and Apex\n Society shall make rules for the regulation of recruitment and\n conditions of service of such employees with the prior approval of\n the Registrar. Therefore, the Common Cadre Rules framed under\n sub-section (2) by the Registrar are also having the statutory\n colour and stand on the same footing as that of the Statutory\n Rules.\"\n\n17. Thus Full Bench of this Court has already held that the\n\nCommon Cadre Rules are mandatory in nature and, thus, the writ of\n\nmandamus to enforce the same would be maintainable in view of\n\nsettled law.\n\n18. In the present case admittedly, the service conditions of the\n\nemployees of the Bank are governed by the Punjab State Cooperative\n\nAgricultural Development Bank Service Common Cadre Rules, 1978\n\nwhich are statutory in nature. The petitioner claims right to be\n\nconsidered for promotion on the basis of the said Rules. Thus, writ\n\npetition is held to be maintainable. The petitioner claims that the\n\naction of the authorities in relying upon un-communicated ACRs ought\n\nnot have been considered to deny him promotion. On merits the\n\nrespondent-Bank in its written statement has not denied that the\n\n 16 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 17\n\nAverage ACRs were never communicated to the petitioner. As per\n\ncounsel for the petitioner the matter is squarely covered by ratio of law\n\nlaid down by\n this Court in the case of \nRajinder Kumar vs. Punjab\n\nState Agricultural Development Bank Limited - CWP No.20465\n of\n\n2012, decided vide order dated 13th of May, 2016 in which this Court\n\nheld as under :\n\n \n\"The said stand taken by the Bank, cannot be accepted. It\n has been time and again held that ACRs, whether good or\n adverse, have to be communicated to the employee so that he can\n improve his performance. The Apex Court in \nDev Dutt Vs. Union\n of India & others\n 2008 (8) SCC 725 held to that effect.\n \nThe said\n view has further been approved by a three-Judge Bench of the\n Apex Court in \nSukhdev Singh vs. Union of India and others\n,\n 2013 (5) SCR 1004. The relevant portion reads as under:-\n\n \"8. In our opinion, the view taken in Dev Dutt that every\n entry in ACR of a public servant must be communicated to\n him/her within a reasonable period is legally sound and\n helps in achieving threefold objectives. First, the\n communication of every entry in the ACR to a public\n servant helps him/her to work harder and achieve more\n that helps him in improving his work and give better\n results. Second and equally important, on being made\n aware of the entry in the ACR, the public servant may feel\n dissatisfied with the same. Communication of the entry\n enables him/her to make representation for upgradation of\n the remarks entered in the ACR. Third, communication of\n every entry in the ACR brings transparency in recording\n the remarks relating to a public servant and the system\n becomes more conforming to the principles of natural\n justice. We, accordingly, hold that every entry in ACR -\n poor, fair, average, good or very good - must be\n communicated to him/her within a reasonable period. 9.\n\n \n17 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 18\n\n The decisions of this Court in \nSatya Narain Shukla vs.\n Union of India\n and others10 and \nK.M. Mishra vs. Central\n Bank of India\n and others11 and the other decisions of this\n Court taking a contrary view are declared to be not laying\n down a good law.\"\n\n \nSimilarly, in \nDr.Gurdev Singh Bhardwaj vs. State of\n Punjab and others\n 2013 (1) RSJ 474, it was held that adverse\n entry needs to be communicated to the employee and is liable to\n be ignored while determining the bench marks. The relevant\n portions read thus:-\n\n \n\"12. Following the dictum \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court, it\n is clear that the average report relating to the year 2005- 06\n which clearly had an adverse effect insofar as\n consideration of the petitioner for purposes of promotion to\n the higher post of Senior Medical Officer, was required to\n be conveyed to him. Accordingly, it is held that the ACR\n for the year 2005- 06 having not been communicated to the\n petitioner was liable to be ignored while determining the\n bench mark.\n\n 13. That apart, I find that the respondent-authorities have\n acted arbitrarily in not considering the ACR of the\n petitioner for the year 2007-08. The right of an employee\n to be considered for promotion is a fundamental right\n under \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution of India. It is not just a\n right of consideration but, in fact, an obligation cast upon\n the employer to afford a fair consideration to an employee\n in terms of the principles of service jurisprudence. It has\n been admitted that the petitioner had been graded 'very\n good' for the year 2007-08 and such report had been duly\n received but was not available at the time of preparation of\n agenda submitted before the Departmental Promotion\n Committee. This cannot be a basis for denying to the\n petitioner the grading in terms of assigning three numbers\n for such 'very good' report for the year 2007- 08. 14.\n Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would bring\n to my notice that the petitioner has since retired on\n\n 18 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 19\n\n 29.2.2012, having attained the age of superannuation. 15.\n Accordingly, I allow the present petition in terms of\n directing the respondent-authorities to reconsider the claim\n of the petitioner for promotion to the post of Senior\n Medical Officer in terms of determining the bench mark\n afresh by ignoring the ACR for the year 2005-06 and in\n terms of taking into account the five previous ACRs i.e.\n for the years 2008-09, 2007- 08, 2006-07, 2004-05 and\n 2003-04. It is further directed that if in pursuance to such\n exercise, which shall be concluded positively within a\n period of three months from the date of receipt of a\n certified copy of this order, the petitioner fulfils the\n requisite bench mark, then orders shall be issued\n promoting the petitioner to the post of Senior Medical\n Officer on a notional basis. The petitioner in such\n eventuality would also be held entitled to notional pay\n fixation on the post of Senior Medical Officer as on the\n date of his superannuation and would be released the\n revised pensionary/retiral benefits accordingly.\"\n Accordingly, keeping in view the settled position of law,\n the present writ petition is allowed....\"\n\n19. The same approved by the Division Bench holding that :-\n\n \"11. However, if the appellant-bank introduced the element of\n 'selection' for promoting its officials, then it cannot adopt the rule\n of seniority-cum-merit. In that even, the bank needs to amend its\n rules and insert the criteria of 'merit-cum-seniority' or 'selection'.\n The fact remains that as per the existing provisions of the rules, the\n respondent having earned all the favourable annual confidential\n reports, was entitled to be promoted on seniority-cum-merit basis.\n Denial of such benefit to him was undoubtedly violative of \nArticle\n 14\n \n& 16\n of the Constitution. Hence, the interference made by\n learned Single Judge is fully justified.\"\n\n 19 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\nCWP No.27527 of 2017 20\n\n20. Thus, in view of the fact that the Division Bench has\n\nalready held that denial of promotion at the hands of the Punjab State\n\nCooperative Agricultural Development Bank Limited by considering\n\nun-communicated ACR would be violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n\nConstitution of India in view of law \nlaid down by\n Apex Court in the\n\ncase of Dev Dutt. \nvs. \nUnion of India and others\n (supra) as approved\n\nby Three-Judges Bench in the case of \nSukhdev Singh vs. Union of\n\nIndia and others\n (supra), the claim of the petitioner merits\n\nacceptance.\n\n21. Accordingly, present writ petition is allowed. Respondents\n\nare directed to promote the petitioner from the date his juniors were\n\npromoted i.e. 7th of July, 2017 as Deputy Manager and the financial\n\nbenefits due to the petitioner be disbursed accordingly. Needful be\n\ndone within a period of three months from the date of receipt of\n\ncertified copy of this order.\n\nFebruary 23, 2023 (PANKAJ JAIN)\nDpr JUDGE\n Whether speaking/reasoned : Yes/No\n Whether reportable : Yes/No\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:033951\n\n 20 of 20\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 03-03-2023 01:58:50 :::",
