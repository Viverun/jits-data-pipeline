Further direction is sought for to direct the 1st respondent\n\nnamely, The Principal Secretary to Government Welfare Department,\n\nto regularize the service of the writ petitioners from the date of initial\n\nappointment and allot them as Data Entry Operators or in equal\n\ndesignation as that of the 4th and 5th respondents or the vacancy of\n\nData Entry Operator, within the time frame fixed by this Court.\n\n3. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the writ\n\npetitioners contended that all the writ petitioners were admittedly\n\nengaged as daily wage employees. However, they are already in\n\nservice for a considerable length of time as the nature of job is\n\nperennial. The writ petitioners are fully qualified for regular\n\nappointment to the post of Data Entry Operators and they possess all\n\nthe requisite qualifications for permanent absorption. It is further\n\ncontended that such adhoc appointments made during the year 2001\n\ncannot be continued for an unspecified period and in the event of\n\nallowing the respondents to engage employees on daily wages for an\n\nindefinite period, the same would be in violation of the basic principles\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nof law. The very fact that the writ petitioners are allowed to continue\n\nas daily wage employees for many number of years is also evident\n\nfrom the nature of job, which is continuous. Thus, the case of the writ\n\npetitioners ought to have been considered by the respondents for the\n\npurpose of grant of regularization and permanent absorption in\n\nsanctioned posts in the regular time scale of pay. After the merger\n\nDistrict Blindness Control Society with the 2nd respondent, the\n\ndesignation of the writ petitioner became District Co-ordinator. The\n\nwrit petitioners are continuously discharging their duties and\n\nresponsibilities in the collectorate and they are fully eligible and\n\nqualified for permanent appointment. The learned counsel for the writ\n\npetitioner states that though the writ petitioners are engaged as daily\n\nwage employees under the Government of India Scheme, the post is\n\npermanent in nature and the Tamil Nadu State Blindness Control\n\nSociety was initially constituted for a definite purpose and the mission\n\ncontinues till today and under these circumstances, the service of the\n\nwrit petitioner is to be regularised.\n\n4. It is further contended that the cases of the similarly placed\n\npersons were already considered and the order of request has already\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeen issued by the competent authority. The benefit of permanent\n\nabsorption extended to the other similarly placed persons must be\n\nextended to the writ petitioners also. The writ petitioners cannot be\n\ntreated differently in the matter of grant of regularization and\n\npermanent absorption.\n\n5. Relying on the Government orders, the learned counsel for\n\nthe writ petitioner states that the case of the writ petitioner cannot be\n\ndiscriminated on the ground that they are continuing as daily wage\n\nemployees and thereafter as consolidated employees. The respondents\n\nare now compelling the writ petitioners to sign the contract agreement\n\nfor employment to the tenure of 11 months. The mere fact that the\n\nother employees had signed the agreement cannot be a ground for the\n\nwrit petitioners also to sign such contract agreements, which all are\n\ncontrary to the initial appointment of the writ petitioners.\n\n6. The learned special Government Pleader appearing on behalf\n\nof the respondents opposed the contentions of the writ petitioners by\n\nstating that the writ petitioners were initially appointed as a District\n\nCo-ordinator on daily wage basis and were posted in the District\n\nBlindness Control Society and subsequently, consolidated payment was\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmade on contract basis with effect from the year 2011 onwards. The\n\npost of Co-ordinator was re-designated as Data Entry Operators .\n\nHowever, the post of Data Entry Operators are not sanctioned as a\n\npermanent post and based on the representation submitted by the\n\ndaily wage Data Entry Operators, the respondents had taken a decision\n\nto grant consolidated pay. However, there is no change in the\n\nConditions of Service and they are being paid the monthly consolidated\n\npay. They are engaged as contract employees under the scheme.\n\nTherefore, the writ petitioners have no right to claim regularization or\n\npermanent absorption at no point of time. The Government has taken\n\na decision to regularize their services in a sanctioned posts.\n\n7. The learned counsel for the respondent urged this Court by\n\nstating that the grant of regularization or permanent absorption cannot\n\nbe made, as if the petitioners were appointed in a sanctioned posts\n\nand possessing the requisite qualifications, when the post of the writ\n\npetitioners are not sanctioned one and they were appointed in a daily\n\nwage basis and thereafter, on consolidated pay, they have no right to\n\nclaim regularization or permanent absorption. Thus, all these writ\n\npetitions liable to be dismissed.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n8. Undoubtedly, the District Health Society and the National\n\nProgramme for control of Blindness are the schemes implemented by\n\nthe Government of India in the National Programme for control of\n\nBlindness welfare, Government of India. The Society was registered\n\nand the District Collector is the administrator of the Society. The\n\nscheme is being implemented for the welfare of the people and the\n\nsame is continued only by the Government of India and therefore,\n\nquestion of granting regularization would not arise at all.\n\n9. The Guidelines for Voluntary and Government Organizations\n\nas per the 12th Five Year Plan July, 2014 issued by the National\n\nProgramme For Control of Blindness Directorate General of Health\n\nServices states that “Recurring assistance as per details below will be\n\nprovided towards salaries of the following Ophthalmic Manpower on\n\ncontractual basis only for the duration of the 12th Plan”.\n\n10. Accordingly, the monthly consolidated pay has been fixed as\n\nper the guidelines for Data Entry Operator with knowledge of accounts\n\nat District Level. The number of persons to be engaged on contractual\n\nbasis is fixed at 500 and salary per month is fixed as Rs.8,000/- per\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmonth.\n\n11. Under these circumstances, this Court is of the considered\n\nopinion that the writ petitioners were engaged on daily wage basis by\n\nthe National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) and they are\n\ngoverned by the service conditions of the state. The order of\n\nappointment issued to the writ petitioner during the year 2011 is also\n\nenclosed by the writ petitioners. The model order of appointment is\n\nextracted here under:\n\nNOTE FOR THE CITY HEALTH OFFICER\n\nSub: District Blindness Control Society-filling up of the post\nof Co- ordinator and Driver on the daily wages requested-reg.\n\nA Co-ordinator and Driver post in Chennai District Blindness Control\nSociety is Vacant. For smooth functioning of the programme the posts has to\nbe filled up.\n\nThe duties and responsibilities of the Co-ordinator are mentioned\nbelow:-\n\n1.Maintenance of Accounts\n\n2.Store management\n\n3.All correspondence\n\n4.Arrangement of Basic Camps for Cataract\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n5.Verification of the Cataract cases who are operated by NGO's\nA Candidate has applied for the post of Co-ordinator Mrs.p.Vasanthi\nwho has completed B.A., Typewriting in lower grade (English & Tamil) and\ncomputer (MS Office & Tally) and driver name Mr.M.Karnalakannan.\n\nDaily wages of Rs.230/- per day for Co-ordinator and Rs.205/per day\nfor driver. Hence the order of the City Health Officer are requested.\n\n1.To appoint Mrs.P.Vasanthi for the post of Co-ordinator and driver\nM.Kamalakannan in Chennai District Blindness Control Society on daily wages.\n\n2.To Meet the expenditure from the DBCS fund.\n\nDistrict Programme Manager City Health Officer.\n\n12. Subsequently, the respondents have taken a decision to pay\n\nthe consolidated pay and accordingly, the writ petitioners are receiving\n\nthe monthly consolidated pay. On account of the fact that it is a\n\nscheme implemented by the Government of India and the writ\n\npetitioners are engaged as contract employees on consolidated pay,\n\nthe impugned circulars are issued for the purpose of re-engaging these\n\nwrit petitioners through out-sourcing on contract basis on certain\n\nterms and conditions. As per the impugned circular, the conditions are\n\nstipulated to the contractual/out-sourcing services appointed under\n\nNHM are as follows:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSupport Recurring Grant-in-aid to meet salaries of Ophthalmic\ntowards Manpower to States\nsalaries of Recurring assistance as per details below will be\nOphthalmi provided towards salaries of the following Ophthalmic\nc Manpower on Contractual Basis only for the duration of\nManpower the 12th Plan:\n\nto States\n\n*A provision of 5% annual increase of remuneration may be\nconsidered subject to performance appraisal by a committee\nfor contractual staff and consultants.\n\n13. The Mission Director/State Health Secretary Tamil Nadu in\n\nhis letter dated 27.04.2018 has stated that the terms and conditions\n\nissued in circular dated 15.04.2016 and 11.09.2017 are to be followed\n\nscrupulously for the Data Entry Operators working in the District\n\nBlindness Control Society. The circulars are challenged on the ground\n\nthat the writ petitioners in the absence of executing an agreement are\n\nlikely to be terminated from service and therefore, the writ petitioners\n\nare constrained to move the present writ petition.\n\n14. The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing on\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbehalf of the respondents states that few contractual employees have\n\nsigned the agreement and the writ petitioners are refusing to sign the\n\ncontractual agreement as per the circular issued by the Mission\n\nDirector, State Health Society. It is further contended that all along the\n\nwrit petitioners are serving only as a Daily Wages Employees in\n\naccepting the terms and conditions of their services and therefore, now\n\nthey cannot seek any permanent employment and there is no\n\nsanctioned post under the scheme for the purpose of grant of\n\npermanent absorptions.\n\n15. Considering the facts and circumstances, this Court is of the\n\nopinion that undoubtedly, the writ petitioners are working for more\n\nthan 15 years as Data Entry Operators on daily wages basis and\n\nthereafter, the monthly consolidated pay is being paid. However, the\n\nwrit petitioners were not appointed by following the recruitment rules\n\nas applicable for appointment to the post of Data Entry Operators in\n\nthe Government Services. In the initial order of appointment itself, it is\n\nstated that they are appointed in the category of skilled labourers in\n\nthe District Blindness Control Society. Further, it is clarified that the\n\npost of skilled labourer is purely temporary basis and the order of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappointment will be cancelled without any notification. The said\n\nappointment order was issued by the president/District Blindness\n\nControl Society/District Collector. The president of the District\n\nBlindness Control Society has issued the order of appointment. On a\n\nperusal of the preamble of the national programme for control of\n\nblindness, it is unambiguous that the respective District\n\nCollector/District Mission Officer is the Chairman of the society Chief\n\nMedical/ District Health Officer is the Vice Chairman and the other\n\npersons are holding the post of Member Secretary Technical officers\n\nand members. The functions of the society are narrated as under\n\nfunctions:-\n\nFunctions:\n\nThe primary purpose of the District Health Society is to\nplanm implement and monitor blindness control activities in the\ndistrict as per pattern of assistance approved for the National\nProgramme for Control of Blindness. On the basis of scheme\napproved for the 11th plan, important functions of the District\nHealth Society are:-\n\n1.To assess the magnitude and spread of blindness in the\ndistrict by means of active case finding village wise to be recorded\nand maintained in Blind Registers (Format I);\n\n2.To organize screening camps for identifying those\nrequiring cataract surgery and other blinding disorders, organize\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntransportation and conduct of free medical or surgical services\nincluding cataract surgery for the poor in Government facilities or\nNGOs supporting the programme,\n\n3.To plan and organize training of community level workers,\nteachers and ophthalmic assistants/nurses involved in eye care\nservices.\n\n4.To procure drugs and consumables including micro-\n\nsurgical instruments required in the Government facilities.\n\n5.To receive and monitor use of funds, equipments and\nmaterials from the government and other agencies/donors\n\n6.To involve voluntary and private hospitals providing\nfree/subsidized eye care services in the District and identify NGO\nfacilities that can be considered for non-recurring grants under the\nprogramme\n\n7.To organize screening of school children for detection of\nrefractive errors and other eye problems and provide free glasses\nto poor children.\n\n8.To promote eye donation through various media and\nmonitor collection and utilization of eyes collected by eye donation\ncentres and eye banks.\n\n9. The PMOAs (Paramedical Ophthalimic Assistance) shall be\ndoing the regular screening for and other diseases in the out reach\ncamps. They shall be under the direct control of the District\nOphthalmic Surgeon / DPM. The TA/DA of the PMOA is for the out\nreach camps conducted shall be paid by District Health Society.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n16. The Grant in aid funds will be released by the Government of\n\nIndia to State Health Society [or State Health & FW Society] based on\n\nAnnual Action Plan submitted to Government of India. For release of\n\nfunds by Government of India, it needs to submit certain documents.\n\nGovernment of India will release funds in two equal installments in a\n\nfinancial year. The District Health Society is expected to send\n\ninformation related to performance and expenditure incurred in the\n\nprescribed formats to the State society, who would forward complete\n\ninformation to the Central Programme Division in DGHS, Ministry of\n\nHealth and Family Welfare, Government of India. The entire details\n\ngoverning the scheme is narrated in the guidelines for State Health\n\nSociety and District Health Society. This being the nature of the\n\nscheme, under which the writ petitioners are working, this Court is of\n\nthe considered opinion that the grant of regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption in the sanctioned posts in any one of the department in the\n\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu is certainly impermissible.\n\n17. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners urged this Court\n\nby stating that the writ petitioners are entitled to avail the benefit of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nparagraph No.53 of the judgment of “Umadevi Case”, wherein the\n\none time benefit of regularization has been granted.\n\n18. This Court is of the opinion that the initial appointment of the\n\nwrit petitioners was made by the District Blindness Control Society and\n\nthey were initially appointed on daily wage basis and based on their\n\nrepresentation, the respondents have paid monthly consolidated pay.\n\nThis being the factum, now the circulars are issued for appointment of\n\nstaff on contract basis through out-sourcing based on certain terms\n\nand conditions. If at all, the writ petitioners are interested in\n\ncontinuing as a staff in the scheme related works, they are at liberty to\n\nsign the agreement and continue their employment. Contrarily, they\n\ncannot claim regularization or permanent absorption based on the\n\ninitial appointment as a daily wage basis. Subsequently, as a\n\nconsolidated pay, wherein no fresh service conditions are imposed.\n\nThe writ petitioners were engaged on contract basis and the scheme is\n\ncontinuing. The mere continuation of the scheme would not confer any\n\nright on the writ petitioners to claim regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption, in respect of one time benefit of regularization in Uma Devi\n\nCase.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n19. This Court is of the opinion that the writ petitioners are not\n\nentitled to get any such benefit as they were not appointed by the\n\nCompetent Authority of the Government of Tamil Nadu and their initial\n\nappointment was by the President of the District Level Society under\n\nthe scheme and this apart, the legal principles regarding the\n\nregularization and permanent absorptions are now settled by the Apex\n\nCourt and this Court also considered all those judgments in\n\nW.P.No.28633 to 28646 of 2014 dated 12.12.2017 and the relevant\n\nparagraphs are extracted here under:\n\n27. Considering the arguments advanced both by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners as well as the learned\ncounsel for the respondents, this Court has to first consider\nthe factual matrix involved in these writ petitions on hand.\n\nThe writ petitioners, undoubtedly, were appointed as daily\nwage employees in the year 2003 and they are continued in\nservice for more than ten years, is the claim set out in these\nwrit petitions. However, pursuant to the Judgment of the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\nthe case of\nThe State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi\n,\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 [herein after referred to as\n“Umadevi Case”], one time benefit was granted by the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in Paragraph (53) of the\nJudgment.\n\n28. Even before\nthe said judgment\n, the State of Tamil\nNadu issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006. As per the said\nGovernment Order, the temporary employees who have\ncompleted ten years of service as on the date of the\nGovernment Order can be regularised. Even prior to the\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the\nGovernment issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006,\ngranting the benefit of one time regularization in respect of\nthe temporary employees who have completed ten years of\nservice as on 28.02.2006. Thus, the State was extending\nthe benefit of regularization or permanent absorption to the\ntemporary/daily rated employees who have completed ten\nyears of service as on 28.02.2006.\n\n29. Pursuant to the said Government order, large\nnumber of temporary employees were conferred with the\nbenefit of regularization and based on that, the writ\npetitioner also raised his claim for regularization. However,\nafter the Constitution Bench judgment rendered in\n“Umadevi Case”, the State Government issued\nG.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Department,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndated 27.06.2013. In the above said G.O.Ms.No.74, the\nGovernment have imposed certain conditions and those\nconditions are akin to that of the recruitment rules in force.\nThe very idea of issuing G.O.Ms.No.74, is to provide certain\nrestricted concession to the temporary employees who were\notherwise appointed by following the recruitment rules in\nforce. Therefore, the prospectus of the large number of\nemployees who have served on daily wage basis are\nprevented from getting their regularization. In other words,\nthe said G.O.Ms.No.74 prescribes certain conditions and\nrestrictions for regularization and for granting permanent\nabsorption. Thus, the persons who are eligible to be\nregularized under G.O.Ms.No.22, are prevented from getting\nthe benefit from and out of the said Government order and\nG.O.Ms.No.74, imposes certain restrictions.\n\n30. Thus, the learned counsel brought to the notice of\nthis Court that in the similar circumstances, the learned\nSingle Judge of this Court dealt with the issues in\nW.P.No.29346 of 2014 & etc.,batch and delivered a\njudgment on 22.09.2017, setting aside the said\nG.O.Ms.No.74, in respect of extending the same with\nretrospective effect. In other words, the implementation of\nthe Government orders was restricted only prospectively and\naccordingly, the relief of regularization was granted to those\nwrit petitioners.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n31. The learned Additional Government Pleader\nbrought to the notice of this Court that the State preferred\nWrit Appeals in W.A.Sr.No.89134/17 in W.P.29346/14,\nW.A.Sr.No.89136/17 in W.P.No. 7594/14, W.A.Sr.\nNo.89142/17 in W.P.No.15668/14, W.A.Sr.No.89143/17 in\nW.P. No.13545/14,W.A.Sr.No. 89138/17 in\nW.P.No.29212/14 on 13.11.2017, against\nthe said judgment\n\nand the same is pending.\n\n32. Thus, this Court has to consider the issues\nindependently and based on the judgments of the Apex\nCourt of India in the matter of regularization and permanent\nabsorption. However, the learned Additional Government\nPleader brought to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble\nDivision Bench of this Court passed an order in the batch of\nWrit Appeals in W.A.No.2911 of 2012 and etc., batch on\n10.07.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench has\nconsidered the terms and conditions imposed in\nG.O.Ms.No.74 and passed an order stating that the services\nshall not be disturbed in the light of the Government Order\npassed in G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms Department dated 27.06.2013 as well as the order\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal\nNos.2726-2729 of 2014 with Nos.2730-31 of 2014.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n33. The Additional Government Pleader is of the\nopinion that the terms and conditions imposed in\nG.O.Ms.No.74 had already been taken note of by the Hon'ble\nDivision Bench and the entire Government Order was upheld\nand the direction was issued to pass orders in the light of the\nG.O.Ms.No.74 and therefore, the judgment delivered by the\nlearned Single Judge, need not be relied upon and more so,\nthe State also preferred writ appeals against the said orders.\n\n34. Under these circumstances, this Court has to\nconsider the issues independently based on the judgments of\nthe Apex Court of India.\n\n35. The authoritative judgment in the subject of\nregularization and permanent absorption is the judgment of\nthe Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nin “Umadevi Case”. All other subsequent judgments cited\nby the respective counsels are by the Hon'ble Two Judges\nBench of the Supreme Court of India. Thus, the binding\nnature of the judgments rendered in respect of other cases\nhas to be cogently read and harmoniously interpreted based\non the legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n36. Before considering the subject of regularization\nand permanent absorption, this Court has to consider the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ninterpretation of the judgments on “binding nature” or\n“binding precedent” . In view of the fact that the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner has cited number of judgments,\nwhich were passed subsequent to the Constitution Bench\njudgment, stating that Paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi\nCase” has been interpreted in different ways and under\ndifferent circumstances and the present case is also to be\nconsidered and a direction to be issued for regularization. In\nview of the fact that large number of judgments are cited\nbefore this Court in the matter of regularization and\npermanent absorption, now, this Court has to first decide\nwhat all are the judgments which all are having a “binding\nprecedent” and on this reason, this Court has to consider\nvery interpretation of the concept regarding “binding\nprecedent”. In respect of judgments in relation to the\ninterpretation of “binding precedent”, this Court is inclined to\nconsider the very recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd vs\nPranay Sethi and Others, reported in JT 2017 (10) SC\n\n450. It is pertinent to note that it is a judgment by the\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nheaded by His Lordship, Hon'ble Chief Justice of India, Dipak\nMisra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of India delivered this\njudgment and it is relevant to quote paragraphs (15 to 26):\n\n“15. The aforesaid analysis in Santosh Devi (supra) may\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nprima facie show that the two-Judge Bench has\ndistinguished the observation made in Sarla Verma’s case\nbut on a studied scrutiny, it becomes clear that it has really\nexpressed a different view than what has been laid down in\nSarla Verma (supra). If we permit ourselves to say so, the\ndifferent view has been expressed in a distinctive tone, for\nthe two-Judge Bench had stated that it was extremely\ndifficult to fathom any rationale for the observations made\nin para 24 of the judgment in Sarla Verma’s case in respect\nof self-employed or a person on fixed salary without\nprovision for annual increment, etc. This is a clear\ndisagreement with the earlier view, and we have no\nhesitation in saying that it is absolutely impermissible\nkeeping in view the concept of binding precedents.\n\n16. Presently, we may refer to certain decisions which deal\nwith the concept of binding precedent.\n\n17.\nIn\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias Kalika Singh\nand others [JT (2003) (4) SC 489], it has been held:-\n\n“10. … an earlier decision may seem to be incorrect to a\nBench of a coordinate jurisdiction considering the question\nlater, on the ground that a possible aspect of the matter\nwas not considered or not raised before the court or more\naspects should have been gone into by the court deciding\nthe matter earlier but it would not be a reason to say that\nthe decision was rendered per incuriam and liable to be\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nignored. The earlier judgment may seem to be not correct\nyet it will have the binding effect on the later Bench of\ncoordinate jurisdiction. …”\n\n17.1.The Court has further ruled:-\n\n“10. … Easy course of saying that earlier decision was\nrendered per incuriam is not permissible and the matter will\nhave to be resolved only in two ways — either to follow the\nearlier decision or refer the matter to a larger Bench to\nexamine the issue, in case it is felt that earlier decision is\nnot correct on merits.”\n\n18.\nIn\nG.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and others\n(2014)\n13 SCC 759), the Court has accepted the said principle on\nthe basis of judgments of this Court rendered in\nUnion of\nIndia v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd.\n(\n1985) 4 SCC 369),\nSundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija v. Collector, Thane,\nMaharashtra\n(\n1989) 3 SCC 396)and Tribhovandas\nPurshottamdas Thakkar v. Ratilal Motilal Patel\n(AIR\n1968 SC 372).\nIt may be noted here that the Constitution\nBench in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India and\nanother [JT 2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated that the\nprior Constitution Bench judgment in Union of India v.\n\nMadras Bar Association [JT 2010 (5) SC 553]is a\nbinding precedent. Be it clarified, the issues that were put to\nrest in the earlier Constitution Bench judgment were treated\nas precedents by latter Constitution Bench.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n19.\nIn this regard, we may refer to a passage from\nJaisri\nSahu v. Rajdewan Dubey\n(AIR 1962 SC 83):-\n\n“11. Law will be bereft of all its utility if it should be thrown\ninto a state of uncertainty by reason of conflicting decisions,\nand it is therefore desirable that in case of difference of\nopinion, the question should be authoritatively settled. It\nsometimes happens that an earlier decision given by a\nBench is not brought to the notice of a Bench hearing the\nsame question, and a contrary decision is given without\nreference to the earlier decision. The question has also been\ndiscussed as to the correct procedure to be followed when\ntwo such conflicting decisions are placed before a later\nBench. The practice in the Patna High Court appears to be\nthat in those cases, the earlier decision is followed and not\nthe later. In England the practice is, as noticed in the\njudgment in Seshamma v. Venkata Narasimharao that the\ndecision of a court of appeal is considered as a general rule\nto be binding on it. There are exceptions to it, and one of\nthem is thus stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd Edn.,\nVol. 22, para 1687, pp. 799-800:\n\n“The court is not bound to follow a decision of its own if\ngiven per incuriam. A decision is given per incuriam when\nthe court has acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its\nown or of a Court of a co-ordinate jurisdiction which covered\nthe case before it, or when it has acted in ignorance of a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndecision of the House of Lords.\nIn the former case it must\ndecide which decision to follow, and in the latter it is bound\nby the decision of the House of Lords.”\n\nIn\nVirayya v. Venkata Subbayya\nit has been held by the\nAndhra High Court that under the circumstances aforesaid\nthe Bench is free to adopt that view which is in accordance\nwith justice and legal principles after taking into\nconsideration the views expressed in the two conflicting\nBenches, vide also the decision of the Nagpur High Court in\nBilimoria v. Central Bank of India. The better course would\nbe for the Bench hearing the case to refer the matter to a\nFull Bench in view of the conflicting authorities without\ntaking upon itself to decide whether it should follow the one\nBench decision or the other. We have no doubt that when\nsuch situations arise, the Bench hearing cases would refer\nthe matter for the decision of a Full Court.”\n\n20. Though the aforesaid was articulated in the context of\nthe High Court, yet this Court has been following the same\nas is revealed from the aforestated pronouncements\nincluding that of the Constitution Bench and, therefore, we\nentirely agree with the said view because it is the precise\nwarrant of respecting a precedent which is the fundamental\nnorm of judicial discipline.\n\n21.\nIn the context, we may fruitfully note what has been\nstated in\nPradip Chandra Parija and others v. Pramod\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nChandra Patnaik and others [JT (2002) 5 SCC 23]. In\nthe said case, the Constitution Bench was dealing with a\nsituation where the two-Judge Bench disagreeing with the\nthree-Judge Bench decision directed the matter to be placed\nbefore a larger Bench of five Judges of this Court. In that\nscenario, the Constitution Bench stated:-\n\n“6. … In our view, judicial discipline and propriety demands\nthat a Bench of two learned Judges should follow a decision\nof a Bench of three learned Judges. But if a Bench of two\nlearned Judges concludes that an earlier judgment of three\nlearned Judges is so very incorrect that in no circumstances\ncan it be followed, the proper course for it to adopt is to\nrefer the matter before it to a Bench of three learned Judges\nsetting out, as has been done here, the reasons why it could\nnot agree with the earlier judgment. …\n\n22.\nIn\nChandra Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and\nanother\n[JT (2002) (3) SC 493], another Constitution\nBench dealing with the concept of precedents stated thus:-\n\n“22. … The doctrine of binding precedent is of utmost\nimportance in the administration of our judicial system. It\npromotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions.\nJudicial consistency promotes confidence in the system,\ntherefore, there is this need for consistency in the\nenunciation of legal principles in the decisions of this Court.\nIt is in the above context, this Court in the case of Raghubir\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSingh (1989) 2 SCC 754)held that a pronouncement of law\nby a Division Bench of this Court is binding on a Division\nBench of the same or smaller number of Judges. …\n\n23. Be it noted, Chandra Prakash concurred with the view\nexpressed in Raghubir Singh and Pradip Chandra Parija.\n\n24.\nIn\nSandhya Educational Society and another v.\nUnion of India and others\n(2014) 7 SCC 701), it has been\nobserved that judicial decorum and discipline is paramount\nand, therefore, a coordinate Bench has to respect the\njudgments and orders passed by another coordinate Bench.\n\nIn\nRattiram and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\n(2012) 4 SCC 516), the Court dwelt upon the issue what\nwould be the consequent effect of the latter decision which\nhad been rendered without noticing the earlier decisions.\n\nThe Court noted the observations in Raghubir Singh\n(supra) and reproduced a passage from Indian Oil\nCorporation Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation (1995) 4 SCC\n\n96)which is to the following effect:-\n\n“8. … The Division Bench of the High Court in Municipal\nCorpn., Indore v. Ratnaprabha Dhanda was clearly in error\nin taking the view that the decision of this Court in\nRatnaprabha was not binding on it. In doing so, the Division\nBench of the High Court did something which even a later\ncoequal Bench of this Court did not and could not do. …\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n25. It also stated what has been expressed in Raghubir\nSingh (supra) by R.S. Pathak, C.J. It is as follows:-\n\n“28. We are of opinion that a pronouncement of law by a\nDivision Bench of this Court is binding on a Division Bench of\nthe same or a smaller number of Judges, and in order that\nsuch decision be binding, it is not necessary that it should\nbe a decision rendered by the Full Court or a Constitution\nBench of the Court. …”\n\n26. In Rajesh (supra) the three-Judge Bench had delivered\nthe judgment on 12.04.2013. The purpose of stating the\ndate is that it has been delivered after the pronouncement\nmade in Reshma Kumari’s case. On a perusal of the decision\nin Rajesh (supra), we find that an attempt has been made\nto explain what the two- Judge Bench had stated in\nSantosh Devi (supra). The relevant passages read as\nfollows:-\n\n“8. Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually intended\nto follow the principle in the case of salaried persons as laid\ndown in Sarla Verma case and to make it applicable also to\nthe self-employed and persons on fixed wages, it is clarified\nthat the increase in the case of those groups is not 30%\nalways; it will also have a reference to the age. In other\nwords, in the case of self-employed or persons with fixed\nwages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 years,\nthere must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe deceased while computing future prospects. Needless to\nsay that the actual income should be income after paying\nthe tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased\nwas in the age group of 40 to 50 years.\n\n9. In Sarla Verma case, it has been stated that in the case\nof those above 50 years, there shall be no addition. Having\nregard to the fact that in the case of those self-employed or\non fixed wages, where there is normally no age of\nsuperannuation, we are of the view that it will only be just\nand equitable to provide an addition of 15% in the case\nwhere the victim is between the age group of 50 to 60 years\nso as to make the compensation just, equitable, fair and\nreasonable. There shall normally be no addition thereafter.”\n\n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India, while dealing with the cases of accident\nclaims, has elaborately discussed about the “binding\nprecedent”. The case in relation to the Motor Accident\nClaims, the case of “Sarla Verma” was being followed by all\nthe Courts across the Country for the purpose of awarding\ncompensation. When the question arosed that the “binding\nnature” of the said case of “Sarla Verma” delivered by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench\nheaded by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India held that the\nprinciples laid down in the case of\n“Virayya v. Venkata\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSubbayya” , it has been held by the Andhra Pradesh High\nCourt that under the circumstances aforesaid the Bench is\nfree to adopt that view which is in accordance with justice\nand legal principles after taking into consideration the views\nexpressed in the two conflicting Benches, it is further held\nthat in the case of\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias\nKalika Singh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC\n489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be not\ncorrect yet it will have the binding effect on the later Bench\nof coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nTheir Lordships rendered the case\nof\nChandra Prakash and others v. State of U.P. and\nanother\n, reported in [JT 2002 (3) SC 493], held that\nthe doctrine of binding precedent is of utmost importance in\nthe administration of our judicial system. It promotes\ncertainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\nconsistency promotes confidence in the system, therefore,\nthere is this need for consistency in the enunciation of legal\nprinciples in the decisions of this Court.\n\n38. By enumerating the legal principle in this regard,\nthe Apex Court of India held that the judgment by the Larger\nBench of the Courts are to be treated as “binding precedent”,\nwhile deciding the legal principles involved in the particular\ncase.\n\n39. Another Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSupreme Court of India in the case of Padma Sundara Rao\nand Others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others,\nreported in (2002) 3 SCC 533, and the relevant paragraph\n(9) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions\nwithout discussing as to how the factual situation fits\nin with the fact situation of the decision on which\nreliance is placed. There is always peril in treating\nthe words of a speech or judgment as though they\nare words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be\nremembered that judicial utterances are made in the\nsetting of the facts of a particular case, said Lord\nMorris in Herrington v. British Railways Board\n[(1972) 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC 877 (HL) [Sub nom\nBritish Railways Board v. Herrington, (1972) 1 All ER\n749 (HL)]] . Circumstantial flexibility, one additional\nor different fact may make a world of difference\nbetween conclusions in two cases.”\n\n40. In view of the legal principle settled in the matter\nof “binding precedent”, now, this Court is bound by the legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the “Umadevi Case”.\n\nAdmittedly, there is no other subsequent Constitution Bench\njudgment in respect of the subject of regularization and\npermanent absorption. The last judgment rendered by the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution Bench in the subject matter is “Umadevi\nCase”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench in “Umadevi Case” are of “binding precedent” or to\nbe followed as “binding precedent”. Thus, the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition has to be\nconsidered only in the light of the principles laid down by the\nConstitution Bench. All other judgments subsequently\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India may have\ncertain distinctions far and against. However, these\njudgments are to be interpreted only based on the facts and\ncircumstances prevailing in that particular case and\ntherefore, this Court cannot consider those judgments\ndelivered on a particular facts in relation to that particular\ncase. However, the legal principles are to be considered in\nrelation to the facts and circumstances of the present case\non hand.\n\n41. Let us look into the basic principles enunciated by\nthe Constitution Bench in the matter of regularization and\npermanent absorption. Paragraph (5) of the “Umadevi\nCase” is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions\nwhich could not be said to be consistent with the\nconstitutional scheme of public employment. Such\ndirections are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable considerations or individualisation of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\njustice. The question arises, equity to whom? Equity\nfor the handful of people who have approached the\ncourt with a claim, or equity for the teeming millions\nof this country seeking employment and seeking a\nfair opportunity for competing for employment?\nWhen one side of the coin is considered, the other\nside of the coin has also to be considered and the\nway open to any court of law or justice, is to adhere\nto the law as laid down by the Constitution and not to\nmake directions, which at times, even if do not run\ncounter to the constitutional scheme, certainly tend\nto water down the constitutional requirements. It is\nthis conflict that is reflected in these cases referred\nto the Constitution Bench”\n\n42. This Court wants to look into the very findings\nmade by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above\nsaid paragraph (5), the Apex Court has conceded that the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India had also on occasions,\nissued directions, which could not be said to be consistent\nwith the Constitutional schemes of public employment. Such\ndirections are issued presumably on the basis of equitable\nconsiderations or individualisation of justice. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India raised a question that equity to\nwhom? Equity for the handful of people who have\napproached the Court with the claim, or equity for the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nteeming millions of this Country seeking employment and\nseeking a fair opportunity for competing for employment?\nWhen one side of the coin is considered, the other side of the\ncoin has also to be considered and the way open to any\nCourt of law or justice, is to adhere to the law as laid down\nby the Constitution and not to make directions, which at\ntimes, even if do not run counter to the constitutional\nscheme, certainly tend to water down the constitutional\nrequirements. It is this Conflict that reflected in these cases\nreferred to the Constitution Bench.\n\n43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong concern\nrecorded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The\nconcern raised by the Constitution Bench is that by granting\nrelief to a handful of people, the large sector of meritorious\nyouth of this great nation cannot be deprived of their\nconstitutional rights. Under this pretext, the Constitution\nBench commenced its consideration in “Umadevi Case”.\nThus, the very enumeration in the above paragraph is crystal\nclear that the Constitution Bench has laid down the principle\nin the matter of regularization and permanent absorption and\nthe idea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to stop\nthe practice of appointing employees, through back door on\nextraneous consideration by showing favoritism and\nnepotism.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi Case” is\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“10. When these matters came up before a Bench\nof two Judges, the learned Judges referred the cases\nto a Bench of three Judges. The order of reference is\nreported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(1)\n[(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 935 : (2003)\n9 Scale 187] . This Court noticed that in the matter\nof regularisation of ad hoc employees, there were\nconflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this\nCourt and by two-Judge Benches and hence the\nquestion required to be considered by a larger\nBench. When the matters came up before a three-\n\nJudge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter\nrequired consideration by a Constitution Bench in\nview of the conflict and in the light of the arguments\nraised by the Additional Solicitor General. The order\nof reference is reported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n(2) [(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003) 10 Scale\n388] . It appears to be proper to quote that order of\nreference at this stage. It reads: (SCC p. 45, paras\n1-5)\n“1.\n\nApart from the conflicting opinions between the\nthree-Judge Bench decisions in\nAshwani Kumar v.\nState of Bihar\n[(1997) 2 SCC 1 : 1997 SCC (L&S)\n465 : 1996 Supp (10) SCR 120] , State of Haryana\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nv.

State of Karnataka\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 :\n\n1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990)\n1 SCR 544] on the one hand and State of H.P. v.\n\nSuresh Kumar Verma [(1996) 7 SCC 562 : 1996\nSCC (L&S) 645 : (1996) 33 ATC 336 : AIR 1996 SC\n1565 : (1996) 1 SCR 972] , State of Punjab v.\n\nSurinder Kumar [(1992) 1 SCC 489 : 1992 SCC\n(L&S) 345 : (1992) 19 ATC 500 : AIR 1992 SC 1593\n: 1991 Supp (3) SCR 553] and B.N. Nagarajan v.\nState of Karnataka [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n(L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] on the other, which\nhave been brought out in one of the judgments\nunder appeal of the Karnataka High Court in\nState of\nKarnataka v. H. Ganesh Rao\n[(2001) 4 Kant LJ 466\n(DB)] , decided on 1-6-2001 the learned Additional\nSolicitor General urged that the scheme for\nregularisation is repugnant to\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n,\nand\nof the Constitution and, therefore,\nthese cases are required to be heard by a Bench of\nfive learned Judges (Constitution Bench).\n\n2. On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned\nSenior Counsel, appearing for the employees urged\nthat such a scheme for regularisation is consistent\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwith the provisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel\nappearing in CCs Nos. 109-498 of 2003, has filed\nthe GO dated 19-7-2002 and submitted that the\norders have already been implemented.\n\n4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion\nbetween the three-Judge Bench decisions of this\nCourt, we are of the view that these cases are\nrequired to be heard by a Bench of five learned\nJudges.\n\n5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble\nthe Chief Justice for appropriate orders.”\nWe are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue\nhere. We have to lay down the law. We have to\napproach the question as a constitutional court\nshould.”\n\n45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates that\nthere were conflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of\nthis Court and by two-Judge Benches of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India and therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia has considered that the question required to be\nconsidered by a larger Bench. It is further observed that\nwhen the matters came up before a three-Judge Bench, the\nBench in turn felt that the matter required consideration by a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution Bench in view of the conflict and in the light of\nthe arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor General. In\nthe reference made by the Hon'ble three-Judge Bench itself\ndecided that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\n\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution and,\ntherefore, these cases are required to be heard by a Bench\nof five learned Judges(Constitution Bench).\n\n46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi Case”, it is\nstated that in addition to the equality clause represented by\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution,\nArticle 16\nhas specifically\nprovided for equality of opportunity in matters of public\nemployment. Buttressing these fundamental rights,\nArticle\nprovides that subject to the provisions of the\nConstitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate the\nrecruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to\npublic services and posts in connection with the affairs of the\nUnion or of a State.\n\n47. In view of the interpretation placed on\nArticle 12\nof\nthe Constitution by this Court, obviously, these principles\nalso govern the instrumentalities that come within the\npurview of\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution. With a view to\nmake the procedure for selection fair, the Constitution by\n\nArticle 315\nhas also created a Public Service Commission for\nthe Union and the Public Service Commissions for the States.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nArticle 320\ndeals with the functions of the Public Service\nCommissions and mandates consultation with the\nCommission on all matters relating to methods of\nrecruitment to civil services and for civil posts and other\nrelated matters. As a part of the affirmative action\nrecognised by\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution,\nArticle 335\n\nprovides for special consideration in the matter of claims of\nthe members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nfor employment.\n\n48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi Case”\nreads as follows:\n\n“12. In spite of this scheme, there may be occasions\nwhen the sovereign State or its instrumentalities will\nhave to employ persons, in posts which are\ntemporary, on daily wages, as additional hands or\ntaking them in without following the required\nprocedure, to discharge the duties in respect of the\nposts that are sanctioned and that are required to be\nfilled in terms of the relevant procedure established by\nthe Constitution or for work in temporary posts or\nprojects that are not needed permanently. This right of\nthe Union or of the State Government cannot but be\nrecognised and there is nothing in the Constitution\nwhich prohibits such engaging of persons temporarily\nor on daily wages, to meet the needs of the situation.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBut the fact that such engagements are resorted to,\ncannot be used to defeat the very scheme of public\nemployment. Nor can a court say that the Union or the\nState Governments do not have the right to engage\npersons in various capacities for a duration or until the\nwork in a particular project is completed. Once this\nright of the Government is recognised and the\nmandate of the constitutional requirement for public\nemployment is respected, there cannot be much\ndifficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is\nordinarily not proper for the Courts whether acting\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution or under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, to direct absorption in\npermanent employment of those who have been\nengaged without following a due process of selection\nas envisaged by the constitutional scheme.”\n\n49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the “Umadevi\nCase” judgment is that the temporary engagements like\ndaily wage appointments, consolidated pay appointments\nand temporary appointments and engagements are resorted\nto, cannot be used to defeat the very scheme of public\nemployment. Nor can a Court say that the Union or the\nState Governments do not have the right to engage persons\nin various capacities for a duration or until the work in a\nparticular project is completed. Once this right of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nGovernment is recognised and the mandate of the\nconstitutional requirement for public employment is\nrespected, there cannot be much difficulty in coming to the\nconclusion that it is ordinarily not proper for the Courts,\nwhether acting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution or under\n\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to direct absorption in\npermanent employment of those who have been engaged\nwithout following a due process of selection as envisaged by\nthe constitutional scheme. Thus, it is made clear by the\nConstitutional Bench that regular recruitment rules in force,\nfollowed scrupulously by the competent authorities and\nengagements on temporary basis cannot be resorted or the\nsame cannot lead to permanent absorption or regularization.\nFurther, it is stated that the Government is entitled to\nappoint the persons on daily wages/consolidated\npay/temporary basis, if a Government is of the opinion that a\nproject has to be implemented or a special works to be\ncarried out, then they are at liberty to do so, by engaging\nthe temporary employees. Such being the concept accepted\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, no doubt, a mere\nappointment on temporary/daily wage basis cannot\nconstitute a right for the employees to claim regularization or\npermanent absorption.\n\n50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n“13. What is sought to be pitted against this\napproach, is the so-called equity arising out of giving\nof temporary employment or engagement on daily\nwages and the continuance of such persons in the\nengaged work for a certain length of time. Such\nconsiderations can have only a limited role to play,\nwhen every qualified citizen has a right to apply for\nappointment, the adoption of the concept of rule of\nlaw and the scheme of the Constitution for\nappointment to posts. It cannot also be forgotten that\nit is not the role of the courts to ignore, encourage or\napprove appointments made or engagements given\noutside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders\nbased on such sentiments or approach would result in\nperpetuating illegalities and in the jettisoning of the\nscheme of public employment adopted by us while\nadopting the Constitution. The approving of such acts\nalso results in depriving many of their opportunity to\ncompete for public employment. We have, therefore,\nto consider the question objectively and based on the\nconstitutional and statutory provisions.\nIn this\ncontext, we have also to bear in mind the exposition\nof law by a Constitution Bench in\nState of Punjab v.\nJagdip Singh\n[(1964) 4 SCR 964 : AIR 1964 SC 521] .\nIt was held therein: (SCR pp. 971-72)\n“In our opinion where a government servant has no\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nright to a post or to a particular status, though an\nauthority under the Government acting beyond its\ncompetence had purported to give that person a\nstatus which it was not entitled to give he will not in\nlaw be deemed to have been validly appointed to the\npost or given the particular status.”\n\n51. This Court cannot omit the powerful statement\nmade by the Constitution Bench in respect of providing equal\nopportunity and in respect of implementing the equality\nclause enshrined under\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\nof the Constitution.\nIn the above said paragraph (13), the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India has emphasized that it cannot also be\nforgotten that it is not the role of the Courts to ignore,\nencourage or approve appointments made or engagements\ngiven outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders\nbased on such sentiments or approach would result in\nperpetuating illegalities and in the jettisoning of the scheme\nof public employment adopted by us, while adopting the\nConstitution. We, the people of India, while adopting the\nConstitution.\n\n52. The approving of such acts also results in depriving\nmany of their opportunity to compete for public employment.\nThe Constitution Bench of “Umadevi Case”, considered the\nproposition of law\nlaid down by\nthe previous Constitution\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBench in the case of\nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n,\nreported in [AIR (1964) SC 521].\n\nThe earlier\nConstitution Bench in the case of\nState of Punjab Vs.\nJagdip Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant has\nno right to a post or to a particular status, though an\nauthority under the Government acting beyond its\ncompetence had purported to give that person a status\nwhich it was not entitled to give he will not in law be deemed\nto have been validly appointed to the post or given the\nparticular status.\n\n53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has\nelaborately discussed about various orders of the Courts\neither interim orders or final orders which were brought to\nthe notice of the Constitution Bench. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India came to the conclusion that those orders more\nor less was the issue of directions for continuation or\nabsorption without referring to the legal position obtaining.\nIt was brought to the notice of this Court that chaos has\nbeen created by such orders without reference to the legal\nprinciples and it is time that this Court settled the law once\nand for all so that in case the Court finds that such orders\nshould not be made, the Courts, especially, the High Courts\nwould be precluded from issuing such directions or passing\nsuch orders.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n54. The very arguments advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the State of Karnataka is that a chaos was\ncreated on account of various contradicting orders passed by\nthe High Courts in the matter of regularization or permanent\nabsorption in order to settle the legal principles. The learned\ncounsel urged the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India to take\nnote of the fact that there is a chaos prevailing in respect of\nthe regularization and permanent absorption of the\ntemporary/daily wages employees and brought to the notice\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the High Courts\nwould be precluded from issuing any such directions or\npassing such orders in contrary to the legal principles in the\nmatters of regularization or permanent absorption or\nappointment. The observation made in this regard is that\nbypassing of the Constitutional scheme cannot be\nperpetuated by the passing of orders without dealing with\nand deciding the validity of such orders on the touchstone of\nConstitutionality.\n\n55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the “Umadevi\nCase” judgment which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“20. The decision in Dharwad Distt.\nPWD Literate Daily\nWage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka\n[(1990) 2 SCC\n396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1\nSCR 544] dealt with a scheme framed by the State of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nKarnataka, though at the instance of the Court. The scheme\nwas essentially relating to the application of the concept of\nequal pay for equal work but it also provided for making\npermanent, or what it called regularisation, without keeping\nthe distinction in mind, of employees who had been\nappointed ad hoc, casually, temporarily or on daily-wage\nbasis. In other words, employees who had been appointed\nwithout following the procedure established by law for such\nappointments. This Court, at the threshold, stated that it\nshould individualise justice to suit a given situation. With\nrespect, it is not possible to accept the statement,\nunqualified as it appears to be. This Court is not only the\nconstitutional court, it is also the highest court in the\ncountry, the final court of appeal. By virtue of\nArticle 141\nof\nthe Constitution, what this Court lays down is the law of the\nland. Its decisions are binding on all the courts. Its main role\nis to interpret the constitutional and other statutory\nprovisions bearing in mind the fundamental philosophy of the\nConstitution. We have given unto ourselves a system of\ngovernance by rule of law. The role of the Supreme Court is\nto render justice according to law. As one jurist put it, the\nSupreme Court is expected to decide questions of law for the\ncountry and not to decide individual cases without reference\nto such principles of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing\norders not consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound\nto send out confusing signals and usher in judicial chaos. Its\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nrole, therefore, is really to interpret the law and decide cases\ncoming before it, according to law. Orders which are\ninconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the court\nin the selfsame judgment not only create confusion but also\ntend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that\nequity tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.”\n\n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad Distt.\nPWD\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. Vs. State of\nKarnataka\n, reported in (1990) 2 SCC 396, was\nconsidered in the above paragraph. It is observed that the\nrole of the Court to interpret the law and decide cases\ncoming before it, according to law. Orders which are\ninconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the\nCourt in the self same judgment not only create confusion\nbut also tend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the\nstatement, that equity tends to vary with the Chancellor's\nfoot.\n\n57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia has accepted the decision, the question of law for the\ncountry and not to decide individual cases without reference\nto such principles of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing\norders not consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound\nto send out confusing signals and result in judicial chaos.\nThe observation made in this regard are certainly to be\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nfollowed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n58.\nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the Apex\nCourt referred the spirit of\nKesavananda Bharati Vs. State\nof Kerala\n, reported in (1973) 4 SCC 225, the Court held\nthat\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\nwhich was described as a facet of\nArticle\nis part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\nIn the\ncase of\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in\n(2000) 1 SCC 168\n,\nthe said decision\nwas reiterated how\nneither the Parliament nor the legislature could transgress\nthe basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of\nequality enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof which\nArticle 16(1)\nis a\nfacet.\n\n59.\nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in the\nabove said case of\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n,\nreported in (2000) 1 SCC 168, it is held that equality and\nequal opportunity is a basis feature of our Constitution, has\nexplained the exultant position of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution in the scheme of things.\n\n60. The judgment of the another Constitution Bench in\nthe case of\nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of Bihar\n,\nreported in (1987) 1 SCC 378 and the relevant paragraph\n(3) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution and it is the essence of the rule of law\nthat the exercise of the power by the State whether it\nbe the legislature or the executive or any other\nauthority should be within the constitutional\nlimitations and if any practice is adopted by the\nexecutive which is in flagrant and systematic violation\nof its constitutional limitations, Petitioner 1 as a\nmember of the public would have sufficient interest to\nchallenge such practice by filing a writ petition and it\nwould be the constitutional duty of this Court to\nentertain the writ petition and adjudicate upon the\nvalidity of such practice”\n\n61. Let us now look into the way in which the\nConstitution Bench has arrived the conclusion in the matter\nof regularization and permanent absorption in “Umadevi\nCase” and the relevant paragraphs (43) to (50), which all\nare extracted hereunder:\n\n“43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule\nof equality in public employment is a basic feature of\nour Constitution and since the rule of law is the core\nof our Constitution, a court would certainly be\ndisabled from passing an order upholding a violation\nof\nArticle 14\nor in ordering the overlooking of the\nneed to comply with the requirements of\nArticle 14\n\nread with\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution. Therefore,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nconsistent with the scheme for public employment,\nthis Court while laying down the law, has necessarily\nto hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the\nrelevant rules and after a proper competition among\nqualified persons, the same would not confer any\nright on the appointee. If it is a contractual\nappointment, the appointment comes to an end at\nthe end of the contract, if it were an engagement or\nappointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\nsame would come to an end when it is discontinued.\nSimilarly, a temporary employee could not claim to\nbe made permanent on the expiry of his term of\nappointment. It has also to be clarified that merely\nbecause a temporary employee or a casual wage\nworker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\nappointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed\nin regular service or made permanent, merely on the\nstrength of such continuance, if the original\nappointment was not made by following a due\nprocess of selection as envisaged by the relevant\nrules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular\nrecruitment at the instance of temporary employees\nwhose period of employment has come to an end or\nof ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their\nappointment, do not acquire any right. The High\nCourts acting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nshould not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,\nregularisation, or permanent continuance unless the\nrecruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of\nthe constitutional scheme. Merely because an\nemployee had continued under cover of an order of\nthe court, which we have described as “litigious\nemployment” in the earlier part of the judgment, he\nwould not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or\nmade permanent in the service. In fact, in such\ncases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing\ninterim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the\nemployee approaching it is found entitled to relief, it\nmay be possible for it to mould the relief in such a\nmanner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to\nhim, whereas an interim direction to continue his\nemployment would hold up the regular procedure for\nselection or impose on the State the burden of\npaying an employee who is really not required. The\ncourts must be careful in ensuring that they do not\ninterfere unduly with the economic arrangement of\nits affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend\nthemselves the instruments to facilitate the\nbypassing of the constitutional and statutory\nmandates.\n\n44. The concept of “equal pay for equal work”\nis different from the concept of conferring\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npermanency on those who have been appointed on\nad hoc basis, temporary basis, or based on no\nprocess of selection as envisaged by the rules. This\nCourt has in various decisions applied the principle of\nequal pay for equal work and has laid down the\nparameters for the application of that principle. The\ndecisions are rested on the concept of equality\nenshrined in our Constitution in the light of the\ndirective principles in that behalf. But the acceptance\nof that principle cannot lead to a position where the\ncourt could direct that appointments made without\nfollowing the due procedure established by law, be\ndeemed permanent or issue directions to treat them\nas permanent. Doing so, would be negation of the\nprinciple of equality of opportunity. The power to\nmake an order as is necessary for doing complete\njustice in any cause or matter pending before this\nCourt, would not normally be used for giving the go-\n\nby to the procedure established by law in the matter\nof public employment. Take the situation arising in\nthe cases before us from the State of Karnataka.\nTherein, after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 :\n\n1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1\nSCR 544] the Government had issued repeated\ndirections and mandatory orders that no temporary\nor ad hoc employment or engagement be given.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSome of the authorities and departments had ignored\nthose directions or defied those directions and had\ncontinued to give employment, specifically interdicted\nby the orders issued by the executive. Some of the\nappointing officers have even been punished for their\ndefiance. It would not be just or proper to pass an\norder in exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nor\n32 of the Constitution or in exercise of power under\n\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution permitting those\npersons engaged, to be absorbed or to be made\npermanent, based on their appointments or\nengagements. Complete justice would be justice\naccording to law and though it would be open to this\nCourt to mould the relief, this Court would not grant\na relief which would amount to perpetuating an\nillegality.\n\n45. While directing that appointments,\ntemporary or casual, be regularised or made\npermanent, the courts are swayed by the fact that\nthe person concerned has worked for some time and\nin some cases for a considerable length of time. It is\nnot as if the person who accepts an engagement\neither temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of\nthe nature of his employment. He accepts the\nemployment with open eyes. It may be true that he\nis not in a position to bargain—not at arm's length—\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsince he might have been searching for some\nemployment so as to eke out his livelihood and\naccepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone,\nit would not be appropriate to jettison the\nconstitutional scheme of appointment and to take the\nview that a person who has temporarily or casually\ngot employed should be directed to be continued\npermanently. By doing so, it will be creating another\nmode of public appointment which is not permissible.\n\nIf the court were to void a contractual employment of\nthis nature on the ground that the parties were not\nhaving equal bargaining power, that too would not\nenable the court to grant any relief to that employee.\nA total embargo on such casual or temporary\nemployment is not possible, given the exigencies of\nadministration and if imposed, would only mean that\nsome people who at least get employment\ntemporarily, contractually or casually, would not be\ngetting even that employment when securing of such\nemployment brings at least some succour to them.\nAfter all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are\nin search of employment and one is not compelled to\naccept a casual or temporary employment if one is\nnot inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in\nthat context that one has to proceed on the basis\nthat the employment was accepted fully knowing the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nnature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In\nother words, even while accepting the employment,\nthe person concerned knows the nature of his\nemployment. It is not an appointment to a post in\nthe real sense of the term. The claim acquired by him\nin the post in which he is temporarily employed or\nthe interest in that post cannot be considered to be\nof such a magnitude as to enable the giving up of the\nprocedure established, for making regular\nappointments to available posts in the services of the\nState. The argument that since one has been working\nfor some time in the post, it will not be just to\ndiscontinue him, even though he was aware of the\nnature of the employment when he first took it up, is\nnot one that would enable the jettisoning of the\nprocedure established by law for public employment\nand would have to fail when tested on the touchstone\nof constitutionality and equality of opportunity\nenshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the\nrespondents argued that on the basis of the doctrine\nof legitimate expectation, the employees, especially\nof the Commercial Taxes Department, should be\ndirected to be regularised since the decisions in\nDharwad [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 :\n\n(1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nSingh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 825 :\n\n(1992) 21 ATC 403 : (\n1992) 3 SCR 826] , Jacob\n[Jacob M. Puthuparambil v. Kerala Water Authority\n,\n(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (\n1991) 15\nATC 697] and Gujarat Agricultural University [Gujarat\nAgricultural University v. Rathod Labhu Bechar\n,\n(2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 613] and the\nlike, have given rise to an expectation in them that\ntheir services would also be regularised. The doctrine\ncan be invoked if the decisions of the administrative\nauthority affect the person by depriving him of some\nbenefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the\npast been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy\nand which he can legitimately expect to be permitted\nto continue to do until there have been\ncommunicated to him some rational grounds for\nwithdrawing it on which he has been given an\nopportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received\nassurance from the decision-maker that they will not\nbe withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity\nof advancing reasons for contending that they should\nnot be withdrawn.\n\n[See Lord Diplock in Council for\nCivil Services Union v. Minister of Civil Service [1985\nAC 374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3 WLR 1174\n(HL)] , National Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S.\nRaghunathan\n[(1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC (L&S)\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n1770] and\nChanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of Rajasthan\n\n[(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .] There\nis no case that any assurance was given by the\nGovernment or the department concerned while\nmaking the appointment on daily wages that the\nstatus conferred on him will not be withdrawn until\nsome rational reason comes into existence for\nwithdrawing it. The very engagement was against the\nconstitutional scheme. Though, the Commissioner of\nthe Commercial Taxes Department sought to get the\nappointments made permanent, there is no case that\nat the time of appointment any promise was held\nout. No such promise could also have been held out\nin view of the circulars and directives issued by the\nGovernment after Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC\n396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 :\n\n(1990) 1 SCR 544] . Though, there is a case that the\nState had made regularisations in the past of\nsimilarly situated employees, the fact remains that\nsuch regularisations were done only pursuant to\njudicial directions, either of the Administrative\nTribunal or of the High Court and in some cases by\nthis Court. Moreover, the invocation of the doctrine\nof legitimate expectation cannot enable the\nemployees to claim that they must be made\npermanent or they must be regularised in the service\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthough they had not been selected in terms of the\nrules for appointment. The fact that in certain cases\nthe court had directed regularisation of the\nemployees involved in those cases cannot be made\nuse of to found a claim based on legitimate\nexpectation. The argument if accepted would also run\ncounter to the constitutional mandate. The argument\nin that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n47. When a person enters a temporary\nemployment or gets engagement as a contractual or\ncasual worker and the engagement is not based on a\nproper selection as recognised by the relevant rules\nor procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual\nin nature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of\nlegitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post\nwhen an appointment to the post could be made only\nby following a proper procedure for selection and in\ncases concerned, in consultation with the Public\nService Commission. Therefore, the theory of\nlegitimate expectation cannot be successfully\nadvanced by temporary, contractual or casual\nemployees. It cannot also be held that the State has\nheld out any promise while engaging these persons\neither to continue them where they are or to make\nthem permanent. The State cannot constitutionally\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmake such a promise. It is also obvious that the\ntheory cannot be invoked to seek a positive relief of\nbeing made permanent in the post.\n\n48. It was then contended that the rights of\nthe employees thus appointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are violated. It is stated that\nthe State has treated the employees unfairly by\nemploying them on less than minimum wages and\nextracting work from them for a pretty long period in\ncomparison with those directly recruited who are\ngetting more wages or salaries for doing similar\nwork. The employees before us were engaged on\ndaily wages in the department concerned on a wage\nthat was made known to them. There is no case that\nthe wage agreed upon was not being paid. Those\nwho are working on daily wages formed a class by\nthemselves, they cannot claim that they are\ndiscriminated as against those who have been\nregularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.\nNo right can be founded on an employment on daily\nwages to claim that such employee should be treated\non a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and\nmade permanent in employment, even assuming that\nthe principle could be invoked for claiming equal\nwages for equal work. There is no fundamental right\nin those who have been employed on daily wages or\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ntemporarily or on contractual basis, to claim that\nthey have a right to be absorbed in service. As has\nbeen held by this Court, they cannot be said to be\nholders of a post, since, a regular appointment could\nbe made only by making appointments consistent\nwith the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. The right to be treated equally with the\nother employees employed on daily wages, cannot be\nextended to a claim for equal treatment with those\nwho were regularly employed. That would be treating\nunequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on to\nclaim a right to be absorbed in service even though\nthey have never been selected in terms of the\nrelevant recruitment rules. The arguments based on\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution are therefore\noverruled.\n\n49. It is contended that the State action in not\nregularising the employees was not fair within the\nframework of the rule of law. The rule of law compels\nthe State to make appointments as envisaged by the\nConstitution and in the manner we have indicated\nearlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the\nemployees had worked for some length of time but\nthis has also been brought about by the pendency of\nproceedings in tribunals and courts initiated at the\ninstance of the employees. Moreover, accepting an\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nargument of this nature would mean that the State\nwould be permitted to perpetuate an illegality in the\nmatter of public employment and that would be a\nnegation of the constitutional scheme adopted by us,\nthe people of India. It is therefore not possible to\naccept the argument that there must be a direction\nto make permanent all the persons employed on\ndaily wages. When the court is approached for relief\nby way of a writ, the court has necessarily to ask\nitself whether the person before it had any legal right\nto be enforced. Considered in the light of the very\nclear constitutional scheme, it cannot be said that the\nemployees have been able to establish a legal right\nto be made permanent even though they have never\nbeen appointed in terms of the relevant rules or in\nadherence of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n50. It is argued that in a country like India\nwhere there is so much poverty and unemployment\nand there is no equality of bargaining power, the\naction of the State in not making the employees\npermanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. But the very argument indicates that\nthere are so many waiting for employment and an\nequal opportunity for competing for employment and\nit is in that context that the Constitution as one of its\nbasic features, has included\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nso as to ensure that public employment is given only\nin a fair and equitable manner by giving all those who\nare qualified, an opportunity to seek employment. In\nthe guise of upholding rights under\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution, a set of persons cannot be preferred\nover a vast majority of people waiting for an\nopportunity to compete for State employment. The\nacceptance of the argument on behalf of the\nrespondents would really negate the rights of the\nothers conferred by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution,\nassuming that we are in a position to hold that the\nright to employment is also a right coming within the\npurview of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. The\nargument that\nArticle 23\nof the Constitution is\nbreached because the employment on daily wages\namounts to forced labour, cannot be accepted. After\nall, the employees accepted the employment at their\nown volition and with eyes open as to the nature of\ntheir employment. The Governments also revised the\nminimum wages payable from time to time in the\nlight of all relevant circumstances. It also appears to\nus that importing of these theories to defeat the\nbasic requirement of public employment would defeat\nthe constitutional scheme and the constitutional goal\nof equality.”\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that adherence to\nthe rule of equality in public employment is a basic feature\nof our Constitution when it is clarified that adherence to the\nrule of equality in public employment is a basic feature of the\nConstitution, certainly, no person can deviate the principles\nin this regard and therefore, appointment in accordance with\nthe recruitment rules in force by the competent authorities is\nthe constitutional mandate and any deviation to be construed\nas violation of the constitutional principles. It is observed\nthat if it is a contractual appointment, the appointment\ncomes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\nengagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis,\nthe same would come to an end when it is discontinued.\nSimilarly temporary employee could not claim to be made\npermanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has\nalso to be clarified that merely because a temporary\nemployee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time\nbeyond the term of his appointment, he would not be\nentitled to be absorbed in regular service or made\nappointment, merely on the strength of such continuance, if\nthe original appointment was not made by following a due\nprocess of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n63. It is not open to the court to prevent regular\nrecruitment at the instance of temporary employees whose\nperiod of employment has come to an end or of ad hoc\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployees who by the very nature of their appointment do\nnot acquire any right. The High Courts acting under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue directions\nfor absorption, regularization, or permanent continuance\nunless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in\nterms of constitutional scheme.\n\n64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable to the\nfacts and circumstances of the present writ petition on hand.\nIn the present writ petition, the writ petitioners were\nappointed on daily wage basis as Nominal Muster Rolls\nemployees. The mere continuance or the length of service\nrendered alone cannot be a ground for granting the relief of\nregularization. Thus, the very legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts and\ncircumstances of the present writ petition. Further, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India deals with the “litigious\nemployment”. Of course, the situation does not arise in the\npresent case. The interim order of Status Quo granted by\nthis Court has not been properly implemented by reinstating\nthe petitioners in service and the Contempt petition filed by\nthe writ petitioners were also posted along with the writ\npetition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of “litigious\nemployment” would not arise in respect of the present writ\npetition. Therefore, the petitioners have not continued in\nservice by virtue of the interim order of Status Quo granted\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nby this Court. However, their services were ousted, after\nfiling of the writ petition.\n\n65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment\ndeals with the concept of “equal pay for equal work”. Thus,\nit may not be required to elaborate the paragraph as far as\nthe present case on hand is concerned.\n\n66. Paragraph (45) of the above said judgment states\nthat the Apex Court of India held that, while directing that\nappointments, temporary or casual, be regularized or made\npermanent, the Courts are swayed by the fact that the\nperson concerned has worked for some time and in some\ncases for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the\nperson who accepts an engagement either temporary or\ncasual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his\nemployment. He accepts the employment with open eyes.\nIt may be true that he is not in a position to bargain- not at\narm's length – Since he might have been searching for some\nemployment so as to eke out his livelihood and accepts\nwhatever he gets. But on that ground alone, it would not be\nappropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of\nappointment and to take the view that a person who has\ntemporarily or casually got employed should be directed to\nbe continued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating\nanother mode of public appointment which is not\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npermissible. A total embargo of such casual or temporary\nemployment is not possible, given the exigencies of\nadministration and if imposed, would only mean that some\npeople who at least get employment temporarily,\ncontractually or casually, would not be getting even that\nemployment when securing of such employment brings at\nleast some succour to them.\n\n67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country\nare in search of employment and one is not compelled to\naccept a casual or temporary employment if one is not\ninclined to go in for such an employment. It is in this\ncontext that one has to proceed on the basis that the\nemployment was accepted fully knowing the nature of it and\nthe consequences flowing from it. In other words, even\nwhile accepting the employment, the person concerned\nknows the nature of his employment. It is not an\nappointment to a post in the real sense of the term. The\nclaim acquired by him in the post in which he is temporarily\nemployed or the interest in that post cannot be considered to\nbe of such a magnitude, so as to enable the giving up of the\nprocedure established, for making regular appointments to\navailable posts in the services of the State.\n\n68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi Case”\njudgment, their Lordships held that the invocation of the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndoctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable the\nemployees to claim that they must be made permanent or\nthey must be regularised in the service though they had not\nbeen selected in terms of the rules for appointment. The\nfact that in certain cases the court had directed\nregularization of the employees involved in those cases\ncannot be made use of, to found a claim based on legitimate\nexpectation. The argument if accepted would also run\ncounter to the constitutional mandate. The argument in that\nbehalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment\nenumerates that when a person enters a temporary\nemployment or gets engagement as a contractual or casual\nworker and the engagement is not based on a proper\nselection as recognised by the relevant rules or procedure,\nhe is aware of the consequences of the appointment being\ntemporary, casual or contractual in nature. Such a person\ncannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for being\nconfirmed in the post when an appointment to the post could\nbe made only by following a proper procedure for selection\nand in cases concerned, in consultation with the Public\nService Commission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate\nexpectation cannot be successfully advanced by temporary,\ncontractual or casual employees.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi Case”\nJudgment, the Constitution Bench considered the right of the\nemployees thus appointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution, are violated. Even in “Umadevi Case”, those\nemployees before the Supreme Court of India were engaged\non daily wages in the department concerned on a daily wage\nthat was made known to them. There is no case that the\nwage agreed upon was not being paid. Those who are\nworking on daily wages formed a class by themselves, they\ncannot claim that they are discriminated as against those\nwho have been regularly recruited on the basis of the\nrelevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment\non daily wages to claim that such employee should be\ntreated on par with a regularly recruited candidate, and\nmade permanent in employment, even assuming that the\nprinciple could be invoked for claiming equal wages for equal\nwork. There is no fundamental right for those who have\nbeen employed on daily wages or temporarily or on\ncontractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be\nabsorbed in service. As has been held by this Court, they\ncannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a regular\nappointment could be made only by making appointments\nconsistent with the requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule of law\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ncompels the State to make appointments as envisaged by\nthe Constitution and in the manner we have indicated by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the judgment of\n“Umadevi Case”. When the Court is approached by way of\na writ, the Court has necessarily to ask itself whether the\nperson before it had any legal right to be enforced. Even,\nthe Constitution Bench dealt with the\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution of India, in a Country like India, where there is\nso much poverty and unemployment and there is no equality\nof bargaining power, the action of the State in not making\nthe employees permanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof\nthe Constitution. But the very argument indicates that there\nare so many waiting for employment and an equal\nopportunity for competing for employment and it is in that\ncontext, the Constitution as one of its basic features, has\nincluded Articles 14,16 and 309 so as to ensure that public\nemployment is given only in a fair and equitable manner by\ngiving all those who are qualified, an opportunity to seek\nemployment. In the guise of upholding rights under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, a set of persons cannot be preferred\nover a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity to\ncompete for State employment.\n\n72. Now, let us look into the important paragraph\nurged by the learned counsel for the petitioner, i.e.,\nparagraph (53) of the Judgment of “Umadevi Case”.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nParagraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There\nmay be cases where irregular appointments (not\nillegal appointments) as explained in S.V.\nNarayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC\n1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 :\n\n(1972) 2 SCR 799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4\nSCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937]\nand referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified\npersons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have\nbeen made and the employees have continued to\nwork for ten years or more but without the\nintervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals.\n\nThe question of regularisation of the services of such\nemployees may have to be considered on merits in\nthe light of the principles settled by this Court in the\ncases abovereferred to and in the light of this\njudgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\nState Governments and their instrumentalities\nshould take steps to regularise as a one-time\nmeasure, the services of such irregularly appointed,\nwho have worked for ten years or more in duly\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of\nthe courts or of tribunals and should further ensure\nthat regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nvacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up,\nin cases where temporary employees or daily\nwagers are being now employed. The process must\nbe set in motion within six months from this date.\nWe also clarify that regularisation, if any already\nmade, but not sub judice, need not be reopened\nbased on this judgment, but there should be no\nfurther bypassing of the constitutional requirement\nand regularising or making permanent, those not\nduly appointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n73. The above said paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi\nCase” is a one time relief, of Course, granted by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India to mitigate the hardship, if\nany, caused to the temporary employees. Now, the question\narises how long the benefit granted under paragraph (53)\ncan be extended to the employees and what is the\ninterpretation of the subsequent judgment by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in respect of paragraph (53) of the\njudgment of the Constitution Bench.\n\n74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India, while stopping the entire irregular\nappointments and back door appointments had taken note of\nthe fact that certain reliefs are required in respect of the\nemployees who are already regularized or in respect of those\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npersons, a proposal is already kept pending. Certainly, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India have never intended to grant\nthe relief of regularization or permanent absorption in public\nemployment contrary to the legal principles settled in earlier\nparagraphs. Thus, paragraph (53) of the judgment has to be\nunderstood harmoniously and together with the legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench in earlier\nparagraphs.\n\n75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted opinion that\nparagraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment cannot be\ntreated as an isolation and it should be considered along with\nthe other legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench.\nKeeping in mind, the legal principles settled by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in earlier paragraphs, this Court is of\nthe opinion that one time relief granted by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has to be extended in its real sense\nand the High Courts cannot travel beyond the scope of the\nintention expressed by the Constitution Bench in paragraph\n(53) of the Judgment.\n\n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited the\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case\nof\nU.P.State Electricity Board Vs. Pooran Chandra\nPandey and Others\n, reported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, and\nthe paragraph (11) of the judgment is relevant and is\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied\nupon the decision of this Court in\nSecy., State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] and has urged that no direction for\nregularisation can be given by the Court. In our\nopinion, the decision in Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is clearly\ndistinguishable. The said decision cannot be applied\nto a case where regularisation has been sought for in\npursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.”\n\n77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two Judges\nBench distinguished that case with the “Umadevi Case”.\nThe very language used in Paragraph (11) states that “in our\nopinion, the decision in “Umadevi Case” is clearly\ndistinguishable. The said decision cannot be applied to a\ncase where regularization has been sought for in pursuance\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. However, this Court is of\nthe opinion that their Lordships have distinguished the\n“Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and circumstances\nthat the case. When their Lordships have distinguished that\ncase, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles\nsettled in “Umadevi Case” has not been deviated by the\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia, as it is a “binding precedent” as stated by this Court\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nin earlier paragraphs.\n\n78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding precedent” and\nwhen the case was distinguished from “Umadevi Case” on\nfactual circumstances, the same cannot be applied in the\npresent case before this Court.\n\n79. The judgment in the case of State of Uttaranchal\nand another Vs. Prantiya Sinchai Avam Bandh Yogana\nShramik Mahaparishad, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 483\nand the relevant paragraph (5) is cited by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. A writ petition was filed before the\nUttaranchal High Court which was dismissed by the\nimpugned order. The High Court was of the view that\nall the 14 workmen, in question, were working on\ndaily wages for more than six years and had\ncompleted 240 days in each calendar year and they\nought to be regularised. Accordingly, the writ petition\nwas dismissed.”\n\n80. On a perusal of the above said judgment, this\nCourt is of the opinion that the case relates to an award\npassed by the Labour Court and an Award passed by the\nLabour Court under the provisions of the\nIndustrial Disputes\nAct\n, cannot have any relevance in respect of the Government\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemployments made by virtue of the rules framed by the\nState in this regard. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in that case, remanded the matter back for\nreconsideration by the High Court in the light of the legal\nprinciples settled in the “Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all\nrespects, the case cannot have any application in respect of\nthe facts and circumstances of the present writ petition.\n\n81. It has further cited the case of\nState of\nKarnataka and Others Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n,\nreported in (2010) 9 SCC 247 and the relevant paragraph\n(7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n“regularisation” enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court or\ntribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee\nand continued him in service voluntarily and\ncontinuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n82.\nIn\nthe above case\n, an exception has been carved\nout in relation to the one time relief granted in paragraph\n(15) of the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n83. In the case of State of Rajastan and Others Vs.\nDaya Lal and Others, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 and\nthe relevant paragraph (12), enumerates the settled\nprinciples in respect of regularization and parity in pay,\nrelevant in the context of the case and those principles\ncarved out in paragraph (12) of the above judgment are akin\nto that of the legal principles settled by the Constitution\nBench in “Umadevi Case”.\n\n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner solicited the\nattention of this Court relying the case decided by the\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in the case of\nNihal Singh and Others Vs. State\nof\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nPunjab and Others, reported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and\nthe paragraph (31) and (33) of the judgments are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\nprocess of selection adopted in identifying the\nappellants herein cannot be said to be unreasonable\nor arbitrary in the sense that it was devised to\neliminate other eligible candidates. It may be\nworthwhile to note that in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , this Court was dealing with\nappointments made without following any rational\nprocedure in the lower rungs of various services of\nthe Union and the States.\n\n33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the\nneed to employ a certain number of people for\ndischarging a particular responsibility of the State\nunder the Constitution is always with the executive\ngovernment of the day subject to the overall control\nof the legislature. That does not mean that an\nexamination by a constitutional court regarding the\naccuracy of the assessment of the need is barred.”\n\n85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this Court is of\nan undoubted opinion that there is a slight deviation in\nrespect of the legal principles carved out by the Hon'ble\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case”. This Court wishes\nto remind the language used by the Constitution Bench in\nparagraph (5) of “Umadevi Case”. To reiterate the\nlanguage used by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nemphatically in paragraph (5) that this Court has also\noccasions to issue directions which could not be said to be\nconsisted by the public employment. Such directions are\nissued presumably on the basis of equitable consideration or\nindividualization of justice. The question arises, equity to\nwhom? Equity for the handful of people who have\napproached the Court with a claim, or equity for the teeming\nmillions of this Country seeking employment and seeking a\nfair opportunity for competing for employment?\n\n86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi Case”\njudgment, again the Constitution Bench reiterated that “It is\nalso clarified that those decisions which run counter to the\nprinciple settled in this decision, or in which directions\nrunning counter to what we have held herein, will stand\ndenuded of their status as precedents.”\n\n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the\njudgment cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in\nthe case of\nNihal Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab\nand Others\n, reported in (2013) 14 SCC 65, is to be\nconsidered as denuded of their status as precedents. Thus,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthis Court is not inclined to consider and follow the same.\n\n88.\nIn the case of\nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra\nand others Vs. State of Orissa and others\n, reported in\n(2014) 4 SCC 583, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\nSupreme Court of India held that and the paragraphs (42) &\n(43) of the above said judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted\nregularisation of regular appointments and not illegal\nappointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the\nappointments in the instant case could be described\nas illegal and if they were not, whether the State\ncould be directed to regularise the services of the\ndegree-holder Junior Engineers who have worked as\nad hoc Assistant Engineers for such a long period,\nnot only on the analogy of the legislative enactment\nfor regularisation but also on the principle underlying\npara 53 of the decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] .\n\n43.As to what would constitute an irregular\nappointment is no longer res integra. The decision of\nthis Court in\nState of Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nexamined that question and explained the principle\nregarding regularisation as enunciated in Umadevi\n(3) case [\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006)\n4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . The decision\nin\nthat case\nsummed up the following three essentials\nfor regularisation: (1) the employees have worked\nfor ten years or more, (2) that they have so worked\nin a duly sanctioned post without the benefit or\nprotection of the interim order of any court or\ntribunal, and (3) they should have possessed the\nminimum qualification stipulated for the\nappointment. Subject to these three requirements\nbeing satisfied, even if the appointment process did\nnot involve open competitive selection, the\nappointment would be treated irregular and not\nillegal and thereby qualify for regularisation.\n\nPara 7\nin this regard is apposite and may be extracted at\nthis stage: (\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 :\n\n(2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250)\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n‘regularisation’ enunciated in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are\nfulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n10 years or more in a duly sanctioned post without\nthe benefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have\nemployed the employee and continued him in\nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than\nten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications\nand was working against sanctioned posts, but had\nbeen selected without undergoing the process of\nopen competitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n89. It is important to cite the case of\nSECRETARY TO\nGOVERNMENT, SCHOOL EDUCATION\nDEPARTMENT,CHENNAI v. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND\nORS.\n[ (2014) 4 SCC 769]. In paragraph No.(8), the\nHon'ble Supreme Court has observed as follows:\n\n“8.this Court in\nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal & Ors.\n,\nAIR 2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nregularisation of irregular or part-time appointments in all\npossible eventualities and laid down well-settled principles\nrelating to regularisation and parity in pay relevant in the\ncontext of the issues involved therein. The same are as\nunder:\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution will not issue directions for regularisation,\nabsorption or permanent continuance, unless the employees\nclaiming regularisation had been appointed in pursuance of a\nregular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an\nopen competitive process, against sanctioned vacant posts.\nThe equality clause contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be\nscrupulously followed and Courts should not issue a direction\nfor regularisation of services of an employee which would be\nviolative of the constitutional scheme. While something that\nis irregular for want of compliance with one of the elements\nin the process of selection which does not go to the root of\nthe process, can be regularised, back door entries,\nappointments contrary to the constitutional scheme and/or\nappointment of ineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary or ad hoc or\ndaily-wage employee, under cover of some interim orders of\nthe court, would not confer upon him any right to be\nabsorbed into service, as such service would be “litigious\nemployment”. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily-wage service\nfor a long number of years, let alone service for one or two\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nyears, will not entitle such employee to claim regularisation,\nif he is not working against a sanctioned post. Sympathy and\nsentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be grounds for passing any order\nof regularisation in the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularisation\nwith a cut-off date (that is a scheme providing that persons\nwho had put in a specified number of years of service and\ncontinuing in employment as on the cut-off date), it is not\npossible to others who were appointed subsequent to the\ncut-off date, to claim or contend that the scheme should be\napplied to them by extending the cut-off date or seek a\ndirection for framing of fresh schemes providing for\nsuccessive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek\nregularisation as they are not working against any\nsanctioned posts. There cannot be a direction for absorption,\nregularisation or permanent continuance of part-time\ntemporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in government-run\ninstitutions cannot claim parity in salary with regular\nemployees of the Government on the principle of equal pay\nfor equal work. Nor can employees in private employment,\neven if serving full time, seek parity in salary with\ngovernment employees. The right to claim a particular salary\nagainst the State must arise under a contract or under a\nstatute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n90. Reiterating the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\nCase of\nSecretary to Government, School Education\nDepartment, Chennai Vs. R.Govindaswamy and others\n,\nreported in (2014) 4 SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India emphatically ruled that the High Courts, in exercising\npower under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India will not\nissue directions for regularization, absorption or permanent\ncontinuance. Unless the employees claiming regularization\nhad been appointed in pursuance of a regular recruitment in\naccordance with relevant rules in an open competitive\nprocess against sanctioned vacant posts, the equality clause\ncontained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously\nfollowed and Courts should not issue a direction for\nregularization of services of an employee which would be\nviolative of the Constitutional scheme.\n\n91.\nIn the case of\nNand Kumar Vs. State of Bihar\nand Others\n, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 300, paragraph\n(25) & (26) are extracted hereunder:\n\n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid\ndecisions of this Court. The principle as has been\nlaid\ndown in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has also\nbeen applied in relation to the persons who were\nworking on daily wages. According to us, the daily\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the\nterm “appointment”. They do not hold a post. The\nscheme of alternative appointment framed for\nregular employees of abolished organisation cannot,\ntherefore, confer a similar entitlement on the daily\nwagers of abolished organisation to such alternative\nemployment.\n\n(See\nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers\nAssn.\n[(2006) 4 SCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] )\nTheir relevance in the context of appointment arose\nby reason of the concept of regularisation as a\nsource of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , their position continued to be that\nof daily wagers. Appointment on daily-wage basis is\nnot an appointment to a post according to the rules.\n\nUsually, the projects in which the daily wagers were\nengaged, having come to an end, their appointment\nis necessarily terminated for want of work.\nTherefore, the status and rights of daily wagers of a\ngovernment concern are not equivalent to that of a\ngovernment servant and his claim to permanency\nhas to be adjudged differently.\n\n26.In these circumstances, in our considered\nopinion, the regularisation/absorption is not a matter\nof course. It would depend upon the facts of the case\nfollowing the rules and regulations and cannot be\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\ndehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion that the\nabove two paragraphs are running contrary to the legal\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India. Thus, the rules\nlaid down in\n\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution Bench to be applied in\nrespect of\nthe above case\ncited.\n\n93.\nIn the case of\nMalathi Das and Others, Vs.\nSuresh and Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 249 and\nthe relevant paragraph (13) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is\nwholly unnecessary for us to consider as to whether\nthe cases of persons who were awaiting regularisation\non the date of the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] is required to be dealt with in\naccordance with the conditions stipulated in para 53 of\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] inasmuch as\nthe claims of the respondent employees can well be\ndecided on principles of parity. Similarly placed\nemployees having been regularised by the State and\nin case of some of them such regularisation being\nafter the decision in Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nv. Umadevi (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] we are of the view that the stand taken by the\nappellants in refusing regularisation to the\nrespondents cannot be countenanced.\n\nHowever, as\nthe said stand of the appellants stems from their\nperception and understanding of the decision in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we do not\nhold them liable for contempt but make it clear that\nthe appellants and all the other competent authorities\nof the State will now be obliged and duty-bound to\nregularise the services of the respondents (74 in\nnumber) which will now be done forthwith and in any\ncase within a period of two months from the date of\nreceipt of this order.”\n\n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once again\ntaken a deviation in respect of the legal principles settled by\nthe Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia. Therefore, such deviation to be held as denuded of\ntheir status as precedent, as\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of\nthe Constitution Bench.\n\n95.\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Rai Vs. State of Bihar\nand Others\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 265, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in paragraph (11) and (14) are held\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nas follows:\n\n“11.Elaborating upon the principles\nlaid down\nin\nUmadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] and explaining the difference between\nirregular and illegal appointments in\nState of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 :\n\n(2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , this Court held as under:\n\n(\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC\n(L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250, para 7)\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n‘regularisation’ enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following\nconditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for\n10 years or more in duly sanctioned post without\nthe benefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should have\nemployed the employee and continued him in\nservice voluntarily and continuously for more than\nten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not\nbe illegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments\nare not made or continued against sanctioned posts\nor where the persons appointed do not possess the\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the\nappointments will be considered to be illegal. But\nwhere the person employed possessed the\nprescribed qualifications and was working against\nsanctioned posts, but had been selected without\nundergoing the process of open competitive\nselection, such appointments are considered to be\nirregular.”\n\n14.Considering the facts and circumstances of\nthe case that the appellant has served the\nUniversity for more than 29 years on the post of\nnight guard and that he has served the College on\ndaily wages, in the interest of justice, the authorities\nare directed to regularise the services of the\nappellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002 (the date\non which he rejoined the post as per the direction of\nthe Registrar).\"\n\n96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited judgment,\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the appellant\nhas served in the University for more than 29 years in the\npost of night guard and that he has served the College on\ndaily wages, in the interest of justice, the authorities are\ndirected to regularise the services of the appellant\nretrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India has deviated the principles\nlaid down in\n\n“Umadevi Case”. Thus, this Court has to derive an opinion\nthat the decision would be denuded of its status as\nprecedents. For all these reasons, this Court has to\nindependently apply the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n98.\nIn the case of\nPrem Ram Vs. Managing\nDirector, Uttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam,\nDehradun and Others\n, reported in (2015) 11 SCC 255,\nundoubtedly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has\ndecided the case based on the facts and circumstances of the\ncase. However, on a plain reading of the judgment, this\nCourt is of the opinion that the legal principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench has not been considered by the Hon'ble\nTwo Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\nThus, this Court is not inclined to follow the judgment for the\npurpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n99.\nIn the case of\nSurendra Kumar and Others Vs.\nGreater Noida Industrial Development Authority and\nOthers\n, reported in (2015) 14 SCC 382, while, the\nSupreme Court of India in paragraph (13) held as follows:\n\n“13.Considering the facts of the present case on\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe touchstone\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3) case [\nState\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] , it will be seen that the Division\nBench was not right in setting aside the appointment\nof the appellants. More so, it was nobody's case\nchallenging the appointment of the appellants.\nAdmittedly, the appellants were engaged as\ncontractual employees from 1994 and have completed\nmore than ten years of continuous service with\nRespondent 1. They continued in service not by the\norders of the Court/Tribunal, but by the decision of\nthe respondents. The appellants were regularised as\nper the policy decision dated 16-4-2003 taken by\nRespondent 1 and approved by the State Government\nvide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the appointment of\nthe appellants were made pursuant to the policy of\nregularisation, the High Court was not right in\nquashing the appointment of the appellants as the\nsame were never in question before the High Court.\nThe plea that was raised by the appellants was only to\nseek regularisation with retrospective effect from 20-\n11-2002 and the consequential seniority.”\n\n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has taken note of the\none time benefit granted by the Constitution Bench in\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nparagraph (53) of the Judgment in “Umadevi Case”.\nHowever, the legal principles settled in paragraphs\n5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and 54 of the judgment has not\nbeen considered by their Lordships. Since the legal\nprinciples enunciated in the above paragraphs of the\nConstitution Bench has not been considered and the case\nwas decided based on the particular facts and circumstances\nof the case, this Court is not bound to consider it as a\n“binding precedent” as enumerated in the first portion of this\nJudgment. This Court has earlier considered the nature of\nthe “binding precedents” and the interpretation of binding\nprecedents as enumerated by the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the recent case of\n\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and Others\n,\nreported in [JT 2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\n\n101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is able to\nfind out that those cases by the Hon'ble Two Judges of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India were decided based on\ncertain facts and circumstances of the case. However, all\nthose circumstances and the legal principles were well\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in “Umadevi Case”.\nVarious paragraphs of the Constitution Bench judgment as\ndiscussed above made it very clear that all the circumstances\narisen out of the temporary/casual/daily wages employees\nwere dealt with elaborately and a findings are provided. This\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeing the factum of the case, this Court is not inclined to\nfollow the above judgment of the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as a “binding\nprecedent” and this Court is bound by the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” which\nremains as the law of the land under\nArticle 141\nof the\nConstitution of India.\n\n102. This Court is willing to cite another judgment of\nthe Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India in the case of\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage\nBoard Vs. Ranjodh Singh and Others\n, reported in\n(2007) 2 SCC Page 491. In the above judgment\nparagraph (17) & (18) are extracted hereunder:\n\n“17.A combined reading of the aforementioned\nparagraphs would clearly indicate that what the\nConstitution Bench had in mind in directing\nregularisation was in relation to such appointments,\nwhich were irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is\nexplicit. It has been so pointed out in\nNational\nFertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n[(2006) 5 SCC 493 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms: (SCC\npp. 500-01, paras 23-25)\n“23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing\non behalf of the respondents that the appointments\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwere irregular and not illegal, cannot be accepted for\nmore than one reason. They were appointed only on\nthe basis of their applications. The Recruitment Rules\nwere not followed. Even the Selection Committee had\nnot been properly constituted. In view of the ban on\nemployment, no recruitment was permissible in law.\nThe reservation policy adopted by the appellant had\nnot been maintained. Even cases of minorities had\nnot been given due consideration.\n\n24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing\nregularisation of the services only of those\nemployees whose appointments were irregular as\nexplained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n\n[AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N.\nNanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\nand B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4\nSCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] wherein this Court\nobserved: [Umadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , SCC p. 24, para 16]\n‘16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979)\n4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] this Court clearly\nheld that the words “regular” or “regularisation” do\nnot connote permanence and cannot be construed so\nas to convey an idea of the nature of tenure of\nappointments. They are terms calculated to condone\nany procedural irregularities and are meant to cure\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nonly such defects as are attributable to methodology\nfollowed in making the appointments.’\n\n25. Judged by the standards\nlaid down by\nthis Court\nin the aforementioned decisions, the appointments of\nthe respondents are illegal.\n\nThey do not, thus, have\nany legal right to continue in service.”\n(See also\nState of M.P. v. Yogesh Chandra Dubey\n\n[(2006) 8 SCC 67 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 1797] and State\nof M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 :\n\n(2006) 12 Scale 642] .)”\n\n103. The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India has dealt with the interpretation of\nparagraphs 16, 17, 19 and 22 of “Umadevi Case” and the\nparagraphs (16), (17), (19) and (22) are extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3\nSCR 937] this Court clearly held that the words\n“regular” or “regularisation” do not connote\npermanence and cannot be construed so as to\nconvey an idea of the nature of tenure of\nappointments. They are terms calculated to condone\nany procedural irregularities and are meant to cure\nonly such defects as are attributable to methodology\nfollowed in making the appointments. This Court\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nemphasised that when rules framed under\nArticle\nof the Constitution are in force, no regularisation\nis permissible in exercise of the executive powers of\nthe Government under\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution\nin contravention of the rules. These decisions and the\nprinciples recognised therein have not been\ndissented to by this Court and on principle, we see\nno reason not to accept the proposition as\nenunciated in the above decisions. We have,\ntherefore, to keep this distinction in mind and\nproceed on the basis that only something that is\nirregular for want of compliance with one of the\nelements in the process of selection which does not\ngo to the root of the process, can be regularised and\nthat it alone can be regularised and granting\npermanence of employment is a totally different\nconcept and cannot be equated with regularisation.\n\n17. We have already indicated the constitutional\nscheme of public employment in this country, and\nthe executive, or for that matter the court, in\nappropriate cases, would have only the right to\nregularise an appointment made after following the\ndue procedure, even though a non-fundamental\nelement of that process or procedure has not been\nfollowed. This right of the executive and that of the\ncourt would not extend to the executive or the court\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeing in a position to direct that an appointment\nmade in clear violation of the constitutional scheme,\nand the statutory rules made in that behalf, can be\ntreated as permanent or can be directed to be\ntreated as permanent.\n\n19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also\ncontrolled by economic considerations and financial\nimplications of any public employment. The viability\nof the department or the instrumentality of the\nproject is also of equal concern for the State. The\nState works out the scheme taking into consideration\nthe financial implications and the economic aspects.\n\nCan the court impose on the State a financial burden\nof this nature by insisting on regularisation or\npermanence in employment, when those employed\ntemporarily are not needed permanently or\nregularly? As an example, we can envisage a\ndirection to give permanent employment to all those\nwho are being temporarily or casually employed in a\npublic sector undertaking. The burden may become\nso heavy by such a direction that the undertaking\nitself may collapse under its own weight. It is not as\nif this had not happened. So, the court ought not to\nimpose a financial burden on the State by such\ndirections, as such directions may turn\ncounterproductive.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question\nwhether the jettisoning of the constitutional scheme\nof appointment can be approved, was not considered\nor decided. The distinction emphasised in\nR.N.\nNanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(1972) 1 SCC 409 :\n\n(1972) 2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The\nCourt appears to have been dealing with a scheme\nfor “equal pay for equal work” and in the process,\nwithout an actual discussion of the question, had\napproved a scheme put forward by the State,\nprepared obviously at the direction of the Court, to\norder permanent absorption of such daily-rated\nworkers. With respect to the learned judges, the\ndecision cannot be said to lay down any law, that all\nthose engaged on daily wages, casually, temporarily,\nor when no sanctioned post or vacancy existed and\nwithout following the rules of selection, should be\nabsorbed or made permanent though not at a\nstretch, but gradually. If that were the ratio, with\nrespect, we have to disagree with it.”\n\n104.\nIn the case of\nPost Master General, Kolkata\nand Others Vs. Tutu Das(Dutta\n), reported in (2007) 5\nSCC 317, paragraphs (5) & (18) are relevant and the same\nare extracted hereunder:\n\n“5.Whereas pursuant to the said direction,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nalthough the case of Niva Ghosh was allegedly\nconsidered, her case was not, whereupon a\ncontempt petition was filed. In the said contempt\nproceedings, a stand was taken by the appellant\nthat she had not completed a period of 240 days in\na year before the said cut-off date. The said\ncontempt petition was dismissed with liberty to the\nrespondent to file a fresh original application.\nPursuant to the said observations, the respondent\nfiled an application before the Central Administrative\nTribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta which was\nmarked as OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n18.There are two distinctive features in the\npresent case, which are:\n\n(i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it\ncannot be invoked where any illegality has been\ncommitted or where no legal right is established.\n\n(ii) According to the appellant the respondent having\ncompleted 240 days, does not fulfil the requisite\ncriteria. A disputed question of fact has been raised.\n\nThe High Court did not come to a positive finding\nthat she had worked for more than 240 days in a\nyear.”\n\n105.\nIn the case of\nC.Balachandran and Others Vs.\nState of Kerala and Others\n, reported in (2009) 1 SCC\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n(L& S) 610, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\ninterpreted the scope of paragraph 153 of “Umadevi Case”\nand the paragraphs (17) & (18) of\nthe said judgment\nand the\nsame is extracted hereunder:\n\n“17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon\nthe observations made in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006)\n4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] which reads as\nunder: (SCC p. 42, para 53)\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\ncases where irregular appointments (not illegal\nappointments) as explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V.\nNarayanappa\n[AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR\n128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1\nSCC 409] and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred\nto in para 15 above, of duly qualified persons in duly\nsanctioned vacant posts might have been made and\nthe employees have continued to work for ten years\nor more but without the intervention of orders of the\ncourts or of tribunals. The question of regularisation\nof the services of such employees may have to be\nconsidered on merits in the light of the principles\nsettled by this Court in the cases abovereferred to\nand in the light of this judgment. In that context, the\nUnion of India, the State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to regularise as a\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\none-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in\nduly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders\nof the courts or of tribunals and should further ensure\nthat regular recruitments are undertaken to fill those\nvacant sanctioned posts that require to be filled up, in\ncases where temporary employees or daily wagers\nare being now employed. The process must be set in\nmotion within six months from this date. We also\nclarify that regularisation, if any already made, but\nnot sub judice, need not be reopened based on this\njudgment, but there should be no further bypassing\nof the constitutional requirement and regularising or\nmaking permanent, those not duly appointed as per\nthe constitutional scheme.”(emphasis in original)\nA case of regularisation which thus attained finality\nand was not sub judice would not come within the\npurview of exception to the rule contained in Para 53\nof\nthe said judgment\n. The appellants' case, thus,\ndoes not come within the purview thereof. Only those\ncases where regularisations had already been made\nwere not to be reopened. It is not in dispute that\nservices of the appellants were terminated as far\nback as in 1987 and they did not question the legality\nor validity of the said order.\n\nIt is only after the\ndecision of this Court in\nJacob\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n: 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15 ATC 697] that\nrepresentations were filed. Such representations\nwere rejected both by the Kerala Water Authority as\nalso the State of Kerala.\n\n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus, neither\nin law nor in equity were entitled to be reinstated in\nservice. The decision of this Court in\nJacob\ncase\n[(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15\nATC 697] being not applicable to the case of the\nappellants, we are bound by the\nratio\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\nSo far as Para 53 of the judgment of the Constitution\nBench in the said case is concerned, the same has\nbeen considered by this Court in a large number of\ndecisions.\nIn\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board\nv. Ranjodh Singh\n[(2007) 2 SCC 491 : (2007) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498, para 15)\n“15.\n\nThe question came up for consideration before a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in\nState of Karnataka\nv. Umadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] wherein it was held that no person who was\ntemporarily or casually been employed could be\ndirected to be continued permanently.\n\nIt was opined\nthat by doing so it would be creating another mode of\npublic employment which is not permissible.”\n[See\nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn\n.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nLtd. [(2006) 6 SCC 310 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 1318] ,\nState of M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n[(2007) 1 SCC\n575 : (\n2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master\nGeneral v. Tutu Das (Dutta\n) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 :\n\n(2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 179] .]”\n\n106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of the\njudgment, is well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two Judges\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as cited above,\nthis Court is not inclined to consider the other judgments\nreferred by the learned counsel for the petitioner. However,\non a perusal of all these judgments cited supra, this Court is\nof the opinion that ultimately the legal principle settled in by\nthe Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case” is binding\nover the subject and the same is to be followed scrupulously\nby all the Courts across the country and the same becomes\nthe law of the land in the matter of regularization,\npermanent absorption and appointment.\n\n107. Now, considering the facts and circumstances of\nthe case on hand, it remains that the writ petitioners were\nappointed as daily rated employees for a particular period\nand, this Court has to draw an inference that all the\nGovernment orders passed subsequent to the Constitution\nBench Judgment, if runs contrary to the legal principles\nsettled by the Constitution Bench, would become invalid and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe same cannot be implemented or followed. In other\nwords, it is to be noted that the Government has no\nauthority to issue any orders granting regularization,\npermanent absorption or appointment in violation of the\nConstitutional schemes and in violation of the recruitment\nrules in force. The power of the Government in this regard is\ncertainly abrogated by the principles settled by the\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”. Such being the\nfactum of the case, the State Government is to be precluded\nas well as its authority are to be regularized in respect of\nappointing employees in contravention with the recruitment\nrules in force and effecting appointments through back\ndoors.\n\n108. This Court has to place on record that the State\nis bound to over see the appointments made in this regard\nillegally or irregularly by the competent authorities and the\nsame is to be construed as the fraud on the Constitution and\nsuch authorities are liable for prosecution under the\nDiscipline and Appeal Rules and other relevant rules. The\nState shall be vigilant in this regard and the authorities\nindulging in such activities of exercising powers by issuing\nillegal or irregular appointments are to be booked under the\nDiscipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be shown by\nthe State in this regard, since these all are the Constitutional\nprinciples required for the State to be followed and the State\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nbeing a modal employer, has to implement the Constitutional\nperspectives and the principles scrupulously and without any\ndeviation.\n\n109. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended\nthat in paragraph (15) of the judgment in “Umadevi\nCase”, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India held that a distinction between regularisation and\nconferment of permanent status in service jurisprudence has\nto be drawn. This Court is of the opinion that the conferment\nof permanent status Act, is a general law applicable to the\nemployees, in the absence of any special law governing the\nparticular subject. However, if any such law prevails and\ncovering the field of appointment of regularisation and\npermanent absorption, then the general law would not apply.\n\nIn nutshell, the special law and rules will prevail over the\ngeneral law and the special rules in force are to be applied in\nthe relevant case.\n\n110. In view of the discussions made above, this Court\nis of the opinion that the writ petitioners are not entitled for\nany relief of permanent absorption as such sought for in this\nwrit petition.\n\n20. In view of the legal principles settled by the Apex Court of\n\nIndia and considering the fact that the writ petitioners were initially\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nengaged as a Daily wage employees in a scheme by the District Level\n\nBlindness Control Society and based on their representation, the\n\npetitioners were being paid the monthly consolidated pay, this Court is\n\nof the opinion that they cannot seek regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption and appointments are to be made only by following the\n\nrecruitment rules in force.\n\n21. All appointments are to be made only under the\n\nconstitutional schemes and by following the recruitment rules in force.\n\nEqual opportunity in public employment is the constitutional mandate\n\nand the authorities competent are bound by the service rules in force\n\nand in the event of backdoor entry, the employees who were so\n\nappointed without following the rules are liable to be terminated from\n\nservice. It is pertinent to note that in the event of grant of\n\nregularization or permanent absorption in respect of daily\n\nwaged/casual employees the right of the eligible citizens are denied\n\nand the same would cause infringement of their right to participate in\n\nthe open competitive process for the purpose of securing public\n\nemployment. When lakhs and lakhs of youth of this great nation are\n\nburning their midnight lamps by way of hardwork for the purpose of\n\nsecuring public employment, the benefit of regularization and\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npermanent absorption cannot be granted contrary to the rules in force\n\nwhich would infringe the constitutional rights of all other eligible\n\ncitizens who are all aspiring to secure public employment.\n\n22. This being the legal principles to be followed, the writ\n\npetitioners have not established any case for the purpose of grant of\n\nregularization or permanent absorption and accordingly, these writ\n\npetitions stand dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected\n\nmiscellaneous petitions are closed.\n\n25.03.2019\n\nssb\n\nInternet:Yes/No\nIndex:Yes/No\nSpeaking / Non-Speaking order\n\nTo\n\n1.
