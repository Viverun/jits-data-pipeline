C.J. & P.R.Ramachandra Menon, J.\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n W.A. No. 975 OF 2011\n and\n C.R.P. Nos.138 & 139 of 2011\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n Dated this the 8th day of August, 2012\n\n JUDGMENT\n\nManjula Chellur, Ag. C.J.\n\n So far as W.A. No.975 of 2011 is concerned, it is\n\nagainst the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated\n\n01.07.2011 in W.P.(C) No.15405 of 2009. The appellants were\n\nrespondents 2 to 4 before the learned Single Judge. Aggrieved\n\nby the judgment of the learned Single Judge, they have\n\napproached the Division Bench in the above appeal.\n\n 2. CRP Nos.138 and 139 of 2011 are filed by\n\nDr.S.Sivakumar and others challenging the order dated\n\n11.11.2010 of the Mahatma Gandhi University(M.G.\n\nUniversity), Appellate Tribunal. Before the University Appellate\n\nTribunal one K.P.Balachandran was the appellant in appeal\n\nNo.7 of 2009, Dr.P.P.Chandrasekhara Pillai was the appellant in\n\nappeal No.8 of 2009 and Dr.S.Sivakumar and four others were\n\nthe appellants in appeal No.9 of 2009. These appeals were\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:2:-\n\nfiled before M.G. University Appellate Tribunal. But the appellant\n\nin appeal No.9 of 2009 had filed another appeal, appeal No.2 of\n\n2010 before the Kerala University Appellate Tribunal challenging\n\nthe appointment of one Dr.K.Mohnakumar to the post of Principal\n\nof D.B. College, Sasthamcottah which is affiliated to Kerala\n\nUniversity. The three appeals filed before the M.G. University,\n\nAppellate Tribunal pertain to the decision of the M.G. University\n\nin respect of the appointments of Dr.D.Radhakrishna Pillai and\n\nMr.D.Rajmohan as Principals of Devaswom Board Colleges(DB\n\nColleges) at different places. All the three matters are taken up\n\ntogether as the controversial issue is with regard to the\n\nappointment of Principals to Colleges affiliated to Kerala\n\nUniversity and M.G. University coming under the management of\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board (for short TDB). The facts that lead\n\nto the filing of the appeal are as under.\n\n 3. Dr.K.Mohankumar the 2nd respondent before the\n\nlearned Single Judge was appointed as Principal of D.B. College,\n\nSasthamcotta and one Mr.D.Rajmohan was appointed as Principal\n\nof D.B. College, Parumala and Dr.D. Radhakrishna Pillai was\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:3:-\n\nappointed as Principal of D.B. College, Thalayolaparambu. A\n\nnotification came to be issued on behalf of the Travancore\n\nDevaswom Board declaring the decision of the Board to draw a\n\nselection list in order to 'promote qualified teachers' to the post\n\nof Principal of the above said three Colleges after securing\n\nwillingness and other details from various teachers and lecturers.\n\n 4. It is not in dispute that the 1st respondent herein\n\nwho was the writ petitioner and various others, in all about 17\n\npersons, forwarded their willingness along with the bio-data.\n\nInterviews were conducted between 21.04.2009 and 28.04.2009\n\nby the so called selection committee presided over by the\n\nPresident and other members of the Board including the Principal\n\nof one Devaswom Board College and a principal of an unaided\n\nCollege. They were respondents before the learned Single Judge.\n\nSubsequently, the present appellant along with Mr.D.Rajmohan\n\nand Dr.D. Radhakrishna Pillai were appointed as principals of the\n\nabove three Colleges of Travancore Devaswom Board. Aggrieved\n\nby the same, the writ petitioner/1st respondent approached the\n\nlearned Single Judge on the following three grounds. 1)\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:4:-\n\nConstitution of selection committee was wrong, as the selection\n\ncommittee was required only in the case of appointment of\n\nPrincipal by 'direct recruitment'. 2) Mr.Rajmohan who was\n\nappointed as Principal is junior to the writ petitioner- Harikuttan\n\nUnnithan and 3) the writ petitioner- Harikuttan Unnithan was\n\nentitled for selection on the basis of seniority-cum-fitness.\n\nAccording to the writ petitioner, the approval of the selection and\n\nappointment of the principals was sought from Kerala University\n\nand M.G. University and the matters are still pending.\n\n \n5. The learned Single Judge after referring to the\n\narguments of both the parties proceeded to opine that the\n\ncommon selection process made in respect of different Colleges\n\nunder different Universities by interlinking two Universities was\n\nin-correct and the fundamental flaw in the entire proceedings\n\nvitiates the whole proceedings. The impugned orders at Ext.P4,\n\nP5 and P13 were quashed directing the 1st respondent Board to\n\nappoint the Principals in terms of the provisions of respective\n\nUniversity Acts so also in the light of the principle laid down by a\n\nFull Bench of this Court in \nSuresh v. Manager, S.N.M.\n\f\nWA No.\n 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:5:-\n\nCollege [2003 (3) KLT 839] wherein their lordships held; how\n\nseniority-cum-fitness criterion has to be decided. However, the\n\nrespondents i.e. the present appellant and two other appointees\n\nas Principals were continued to work as Principals in-charge till\n\nthe completion of the process of selection.\n\n 6. So far as the revision petitions, as already stated\n\nabove, the challenge was with regard to the promotions and\n\npostings of three teachers working under the Colleges run by the\n\nCorporate management of Travancore Devaswom Board, where\n\ntechnical controversy was raised in the appeals by filing\n\ninterlocutory applications challenging the maintainability of the\n\nappeals itself. The challenge was, the impugned order of TDB\n\npromoting and posting the aforesaid three persons as Principals\n\nof the respective Colleges was not being so far approved by the\n\nconcerned University, i.e. the M.G. University as well as the\n\nKerala University, therefore appeals were not maintainable.\n\n 7. According to the averments in the Interlocutory\n\nApplication, till the approval of the appointment made by the\n\nManagement is considered by respective Universities, no appeal\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:6:-\n\nunder the respective Act could be filed. By referring to an earlier\n\njudgment of the High Court in Mother Anasthesia v.\n\nUniversity Appellate Tribunal [1980 KLT 666] and Suresh v.\n\nManager, S.N.M. College(supra) the Tribunal ultimately opined\n\nthat the appeals deserve to be dismissed as not maintainable and\n\nliberty was reserved to the appellants to approach the Tribunal\n\nagain, once the approval of University is granted. Aggrieved by\n\nthe orders of the University Appellate Tribunals, these two\n\nrevision petitions are filed.\n\n 8. The entire question revolves round the authority of\n\nthe Devaswom Board to constitute a 'selection committee' so far\n\nas appointment of Principals to the three vacancies at three\n\ndifferent Colleges as stated above by promotion and not by direct\n\nrecruitment. Other relevant controversy before us is with regard\n\nto the criterion for selection and lack of qualification of\n\nrespondents who were appointed as Principals. All the three\n\nrespondents were teachers promoted as Principals and their\n\nappointment orders are set aside.\n\n \n9. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:7:-\n\nMr.Jaju Babu contended that Colleges are situated within the\n\njurisdiction of Kerala University as well as M.G. University.\n\nTherefore by referring to the definition of 'College' under the\n\nKerala University Act\n contends that it would mean only an\n\ninstitution affiliated to the University and the appointments will\n\nbe with reference to the Act. This argument was made so far as\n\nthe appointment of one of the appellants who is working in a\n\nCollege under the M.G. University. According to the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants, seniority-cum-merit has to be the\n\ncriterion and there cannot be segregation of the members in\n\nrespect of different Colleges. According to them, common\n\nselection committee was necessary only for the purpose of\n\nappointment of a Principal by direct recruitment. According to\n\nthem, seniority-cum-merit (seniority-cum-fitness) has been\n\nexplained in the case of \nRajendraKumar Srivastava v. Samyut\n\nKshetriya Gramin Bank\n [(2010) 1 SCC 335].\n \nSo also they rely\n\non decision in \nRupa Rani Rakshit v. Jharkhand Gramin Bank\n\n[(2010) 1 SCC 345] which governs the merits of the present case\n\nas the Apex Court in the above said two decisions had clearly\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos.\n \n138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:8:-\n\nstated how seniority-cum-merit or seniority-cum-fitness governs\n\nthe process whereby eligible candidates in possession of\n\nminimum necessary merit in the feeder category could be first\n\nascertained and for ascertaining the same, a written test or\n\ninterview is permissible and according to him, the learned Judge\n\nwas not justified in placing reliance in the case of \nSuresh v.\n\nManager, S.N.M. College\n(supra).\n\n \n10. The judgment of the learned Single Judge,\n\naccording to the learned counsel for the appellants, cannot be\n\nsustained in view of the law \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court in the\n\nabove two decisions. According to them, in the absence of the\n\nwrit petitioner not challenging the notification and having\n\nparticipated in the interview pursuant to Ext.P3, cannot turn\n\naround when it is learnt that he was not successful in the\n\ninterview conducted by the selection committee. According to\n\nthe appellants, the procedure followed for selection to the post of\n\nPrincipals was correct. The further contention of the appellants is\n\nthat in view of the pendency of CRP Nos.138 and 139 of 2011,\n\nthe learned Single Judge ought not to have interfered with the\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:9:-\n\nselection.\n \nWith these averments, placing reliance on \nSuresh v.\n\nManager, S.N.M. College\n [2003 (\n3) KLT 839], Haryana State\n\nWarehousing Corporation & others v. Jagat Ram and\n\nanother\n [(\n2011) 3 SCC 422], Valsala Kumari Devi v.\n\nDirector, Higher Secondary Education\n [2007(4) KLT 494\n\n(SC)], Siraj v. High Court of \nKerala [2006(2) KLT 923], Rupa\n\nRani Rakshit v. Jharkhand Gramin Bank\n [(\n2010) 1 SCC 345]\n\nand Rajendra Kumar Srivastava v. Samyut Kshetriya\n\nGramin Bank\n [(2010) 1 SCC 335] the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellants has sought for setting aside the judgment of\n\nthe learned Single Judge by allowing the appeal and also the\n\nrevision petitions.\n\n 11. As against this, the learned Senior counsel\n\nDr.S.Gopakumaran Nair arguing for the writ petitioner/1st\n\nrespondent contends that having regard to \nSection 57\n of Kerala\n\nUniversity Act and also Section 59 of M.G. University Act, the\n\nappointment of teachers in private Colleges as Principals, though\n\ncontemplates two methods of recruitment, i.e. direct recruitment\n\nand by promotion, whenever it is made by promotion, the\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:10:-\n\nauthority concerned is required to consider the appointment on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-fitness. He further contends, when the\n\nprocess of selection is by promotion, there was no necessity for\n\nselection committee to be constituted to consider the candidates\n\nfor promotion to the post of Principals which were vacant in\n\nColleges of Devaswom Board affiliated to two different\n\nUniversities. Therefore, according to him, the learned Single\n\nJudge was justified in quashing the appointment orders and in\n\nthe light of appointment orders being set aside, question of\n\nconsidering Revision Petitions would not arise. Therefore the\n\nRevision Petitions become infructuous.\n\n 12. We have gone through the various provisions of\n\nKerala University Act\n as well as the M.G. University Act. So far\n\nas the appointment of Mr.Dr.K.Mohankumar to the post of\n\nPrincipal at Sasthamcotta, it comes under the Kerala University\n\nand the procedure applicable is with reference to the Act\n\ngoverning Kerala University. So far as other two appellants,\n\nDr.D.Rajmohan and Dr.D.Radhakrishna Pillai, they come under\n\nM.G. University. It is not in dispute that all three Colleges are\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:11:-\n\nrun by the management of TDB. \nSection 57(2)\n of Kerala\n\nUniversity Act provides the procedure for appointment of\n\nPrincipals made by educational agency by promotion from among\n\nthe teachers of the College or of all the Colleges as the case may\n\nbe are by direct recruitment which means appointments can be\n\nmade either by promotion or by direct recruitment. \nSection 57\n\n(3)\n of the Kerala University Act provides, the criterion that\n\nwhenever recruitment is made by promotion, it should be on\n\nseniority-cum-fitness. A selection committee is required only if\n\nthe post of teachers and Principals are filled up by direct\n\nrecruitment. This statement of writ petitioner was\n\nuncontroverted in many ways before the learned Single Judge as\n\nthe affidavit filed on behalf of the appointed Principals\n\ncategorically indicates, whether it was under Kerala University or\n\nunder M.G. University, constitution of selection committee was\n\nnecessary only for the purpose of appointing a Principal by direct\n\nrecruitment. Therefore, there is no dispute that a selection\n\ncommittee was not at all contemplated when the selection\n\nprocess is by way of promotion. Similar to \nSection 57\n of Kerala\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:12:-\n\nUniversity Act, M.G. University Act also has relevant provision at\n\nSection 59\n. Sub-\nsection 2\n and \n3\n of \nSection 57\n of Kerala\n\nUniversity Act are pari materia so far as Sub-\nsection 2\n and \n3\n of\n\nSection 59 of M.G.University Act. Therefore, the post of\n\nPrincipal, if filed up by promotion either under \nKerala University\n\nAct\n or M.G. University Act, there is no mandate or requirement\n\nfor constitution of a selection committee.\n\n 13. In the present case, not only a common selection\n\ncommittee was constituted for the purpose of promotion to the\n\npost of Principal under different Colleges of two Universities but,\n\na common selection list was also prepared by the selection\n\ncommittee. In that view of the matter, the learned Single Judge\n\nwas justified in saying that the process of selection adopted by\n\nthe management was not justified.\n\n \n14. Lengthy arguments were addressed on the locus\n\nstandi of the writ petitioner and also what exactly 'seniority-cum-\n\nfitness' would mean. The case in \nSiraj v. High\n Court of Kerala\n\n[2006(2) KLT 923(SC)] before High Court was with regard to\n\nprescription of minimum marks for the oral examination as a\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:13:-\n\ncondition of eligibility for selection as Munsiff Magistrate. It was\n\nheld by the Apex Court that the appellant/writ petitioner was not\n\nentitled to any relief under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India\n\nfor more than one reason. First and foremost was, he has\n\nparticipated in the written test and oral test without raising any\n\nobjection in spite of being aware of the prescription that\n\nminimum marks has to be secured both in the written test and\n\nalso in the oral test. Apart from this, they were also aware of the\n\ndecision on the judicial side before the High Court. Therefore,\n\ntheir Lordships held that having participated in the interview it\n\nwas not open for them to turn around thereafter when they failed\n\nat the interview to contend that a provision of minimum mark for\n\nthe interview was not proper.\n\n 15. In the case of Rupa Rani Rakshit [(2010) 1 SCC\n\n345] apart from referring to what exactly merit-cum-seniority\n\nand seniority-cum-merit would mean their Lordships held length\n\nof service rendered by virtue of wrong appointment/promotion\n\nwhich was subsequently set aside cannot be added to the length\n\nof service for counting seniority. The main emphasis in this case\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:14:-\n\nis with regard to the criterion of seniority-cum-merit so also what\n\nwould constitute merit-cum-seniority. In the present case the\n\nchallenge is only with regard to the qualification of the candidates\n\nwho were selected. But with regard to constitution of selection\n\ncommittee, no such provision is made in the enactment.\n\n 16. As already stated above, it is the contention of\n\nthe appellants/respondents before the learned Single Judge that\n\nconstitution of selection committee is mandatory for selection to\n\nthe post of Principal by direct recruitment. A common selection\n\nlist was prepared by clubbing the teachers working under\n\ndifferent Colleges affiliated to different Universities. Therefore, if\n\nthe very selection process is defective, the defence of the\n\nappellant that having participated in the interview, he cannot\n\nquestion the selection process falls to ground. If the selection\n\nprocess itself is defective, neither the appellant nor respondents\n\ncan take benefit out of it. From such defective selection process,\n\nno legal or authoritatively selected candidate can come through.\n\nTherefore this argument of the learned counsel for the appellants\n\ncannot be accepted.\n\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:15:-\n\n 17. Then coming to the argument addressed on what\n\nis seniority-cum-fitness, according to the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, seniority-cum-fitness is nothing but seniority-cum-\n\nmerit. He relies upon as already stated above, on various\n\ndecisions. \nIn the case of \nSuresh v. Manager, S.N.M. College\n\n(supra), it was a promotion to the post of Principal on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-fitness. It was held in this case as under:\n\n \"Seniority-cum-fitness postulates promotion on the basis of\n\n seniority subject to rejection of the unfit. It does not permit\n\n selection. Such a rule is calculated to avoid heart burning. It\n\n avoids controversy. It limits discretion. It excludes arbitrariness.\n\n In the existing situation, it is reasonable. So far as the\n\n appointment by promotion is concerned, the provision has been\n\n made in\n S. 59(3)\n. It has been specifically provided that \"the\n\n educational agency shall make the appointment on the basis of\n\n seniority-cum-fitness\". These words of the Act have to be given\n\n their plain and natural meaning. The provision is couched in a\n\n mandatory language. The use of the word `shall' makes it\n\n imperative for the management to follow the prescribed criteria.\n\n In the context, the word `shall' cannot be interpreted to mean\n\n `may', for, that would lead to an anomalous situation. The\n\n Legislature appears to have clearly intended that the discretion of\n\n the management should be restricted. The senior person should\n\n be promoted unless he is found to be unfit for the post of the\n\n Principal. It is true that the post of Principal of a College is\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:16:-\n\n pivotal. A bad teacher may not be able to administer an\n\n institution. However, the management has been given the\n\n discretion to supersede a senior person, if he is found unfit. This\n\n discretion can be exercised by the management on the basis of\n\n good reasons. Since the Act provides for the remedy of appeal\n\n before an Appellate Tribunal against an order of supersession, it\n\n would be incumbent on the management to give reasons for the\n\n supersession of a senior person. The reasons cannot be fanciful\n\n or imaginary. These must have a nexus with the fitness of the\n\n candidate for the post and should be founded on tangible\n\n material.\"\n\n \n18. Another decision relied on by the counsel is\n\nHaryana State Warehousing Corporation and others v.\n\nJagat Ram and another\n [(2011) 3 SCC 422]. In this case their\n\nLordships held that in the case of seniority-cum-merit criterion\n\nwhat is required is a minimum necessary merit, but does not\n\nrequire comparative assessment of merit. Therefore, their\n\nLordships held that the promotion given to a junior in preference\n\nto the senior is only on the ground that junior is more meritorious\n\nwould violate seniority-cum-merit criterion. Their Lordships have\n\nheld at paragraph 45 in detail what it would mean which reads as\n\nunder:\n\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:17:-\n\n \"45. Thus it is the settled position that the criterion of\n\n seniority-cum-merit is different from the criterion of merit and also\n\n the criterion of merit-cum-seniority. Where the promotion is based\n\n on seniority-cum-merit, the officer cannot claim promotion as a\n\n matter of right by virtue of his seniority alone. If he is found\n\n unfit to discharge the duties of the higher post, he may be passed\n\n over and an officer junior to him may be promoted. Seniority-cum-\n\n merit means that, given the minimum necessary merit required for\n\n efficiency of administration, the senior, though less meritorious,\n\n shall have priority in the matter of promotion and there is no\n\n question of further comparative assessment of the merit of those\n\n who were found to have the minimum necessary merit required\n\n for efficiency of administration. For assessing the minimum\n\n necessary merit, the competent authority can lay down the\n\n minimum standard that is required and also prescribe the mode of\n\n assessment of merit of the employees. Such assessment can be\n\n made by assigning marks on the basis of appraisal of\n\n performance on the basis of service record and interview and\n\n prescribing the minimum marks which would entitle a person to be\n\n considered for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\"\n\n 19. \nIn the case of \nValsala Kumari Devi v. Director,\n\nHigher Secondary Education\n [2007(4) KLT 494(SC)] the\n\nappointment to the post of Higher Secondary School teacher was\n\nwith a condition 'subject to seniority and suitability'. Their\n\nLordships held that such expression occurring in the Government\n\nOrder does not mean the comparative assessment of suitability\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:18:-\n\nand it only means the suitability for the particular post and the\n\nsuitability is related to the prescribed qualification and requisite\n\nexperience. The relevant paragraphs are 12, 13 and 14 which\n\nread as under:\n\n \"12. Government Order dated 27.6.1990 makes it clear\n\n that the selection of teachers will be subject to seniority and\n\n suitability and G.O. dated 13.5.1998 specifically prescribes that\n\n the teachers appointed from General Education Subordinate\n\n Service will be treated as appointment by promotion. As stated\n\n earlier, the selection will be subject to seniority and suitability\n\n and there is no dispute that the appellant is senior to 5th\n\n respondent. She is eligible and qualified for appointment by\n\n promotion to HSST. It is not the case of the Management that\n\n she is unsuitable for promotion.\n\n 13. The expression \"subject to seniority and suitability\"\n\n occurring in G.O. dated 27.6.1990 does not mean the\n\n comparative assessment of suitability and it only means the\n\n suitability for the particular post and the suitability is related to\n\n the prescribed qualification and requisite experience. \nIn view of\n\n the distinction between the appointment by promotion from\n\n General Education Subordinate Service and an appointment to\n\n the 75% vacancies ear-marked for direct recruitment, we are of\n\n the view that the finding arrived at by the Director, Higher\n\n Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala that seniority is\n\n not the criterion for 'appointment by promotion to HSST' is\n\n erroneous and is not in terms of the Government Orders \nreferred\n\n to above\n. Though in the order, it is stated that the 5th\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:19:-\n\n respondent is more suitable than the appellant, as rightly pointed\n\n out by learned counsel appearing for the appellant,it has not\n\n been shown or indicated the reasons or grounds for arriving at\n\n such decision that the 5th respondent was found more suitable\n\n than the appellant for the post. We are also in agreement with\n\n the contention that the Director has mechanically accepted the\n\n decision of the Selection Committee that the 5th respondent is\n\n more suitable than the appellant without reference to selection\n\n for appointment by promotion to HSST against 25% quota\n\n earmarked for qualified High School Assistants. We are of the\n\n view that the Director has committed an illegality in upholding the\n\n selection of the 5th respondent for appointment to the post of\n\n HSST. Further the 5th respondent has been preferred to the\n\n appellant for the reason that his main subject in B.A. is History\n\n which is totally irrelevant for promotion to HSST from among\n\n HSAs. In G.O. dated 27.6.1990 the qualification prescribed is a\n\n second class Master's Degree in the concerned subject with\n\n B.Ed. It is relevant to point out that the appellant and the 5th\n\n respondent have obtained M.A. Degree from Mysore University\n\n and the 5th respondent took B.Ed with Social Studies. The other\n\n reason given by the Selection Committee for preferring 5th\n\n respondent is that he has proficiency in English, Kannada and\n\n Malayalam whereas the appellant has proficiency in English and\n\n Malayalam. As rightly pointed out by learned counsel appearing\n\n for the appellant, once the requirement of the prescribed\n\n qualification is satisfied, the selection must be made on the\n\n basis of the seniority and suitability and there is no scope for\n\n making comparison of qualifications or comparative assessment\n\n of suitability. The expression 'suitability' means that a person to\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:20:-\n\n be appointed shall be legally eligible and 'eligible' should be\n\n taken to mean 'fit to be chosen'.\n\n 14. In such circumstances, we are of the view that\n\n it was improper on the part of the Selection Committee to make\n\n selection taking into account the qualifications which are not\n\n prescribed in the G.Os and by giving weightage to such\n\n qualifications. The Selection Committee has also taken note of\n\n the suggestion of the Parents Teachers Association that persons\n\n having proficiency in Kannada should be preferred when there is\n\n no such condition in the Government Order. In other words,\n\n preference is to be given for proficiency in Kannada which is not\n\n a requisite qualification. In our view, ignoring the appellant who\n\n has been working as HSA in the very same school and selecting\n\n the 5th respondent by giving weightage for proficiency in\n\n Kannada which is not a condition prescribed in the relevant\n\n Govt. orders by the Selection Committee can not be sustained. It\n\n is based on extraneous/irrelevant considerations.\"\n\n 20. \nIn the case of \nRupa Rani Rakshit\n (supra)\n\nparagraphs 2, 7 and 8 are relevant. Their Lordships have in\n\ndetail referred to merit-cum-seniority and seniority-cum-merit in\n\nthe above said paragraphs.\n \nIn the case of \nRajendraKumar\n\nSrivastava v. Samyut Kshetriya Gramin Bank\n(supra) paragraphs\n\n2 to 4 and 8 to 12 are relevant which read as under:\n\n \"2. By Notification dated 28-9-1988, the Central\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:21:-\n\n Government in exercise of powers conferred under \nSection 17\n\n read with \nSection 29\n of the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976\n\n framed the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion of\n\n Officers and Other Employees) Rules, 1988 (\"the Rules\", for\n\n short). Rule 5 of the Rules provided that all vacancies should be\n\n filled up by deputation, promotion or direct recruitment, in\n\n accordance with provisions contained in the Second Schedule to\n\n the Rules. Entry 7 in the Second Schedule related to recruitment\n\n to the posts of Area Manager or Senior Manager (in Scale II). It\n\n provided that all the posts of Area Manager and Senior Manager\n\n should be filled by promotion from among the confirmed officers\n\n (in Scale I) working in the Bank on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\n merit. It prescribed the educational qualification (graduate) and\n\n minimum period of service in the feeder cadre (eight years as an\n\n officer in the Regional Rural Bank concerned). It also prescribed\n\n the mode of selection by promotion as \"interview and assessment\n\n of performance reports for the preceding three years period as\n\n officers\". Sub-rule (4) of Rule 10 provided that the Staff Selection\n\n Committee shall follow the procedure determined by the Board for\n\n selecting candidates for appointment or promotion, in accordance\n\n with the guidelines issued by the Central Government from time to\n\n time.\n\n 3. At the 131st meeting of the Board of Directors of the first\n\n respondent Bank held on 29-11-1996, the following procedure for\n\n promotion of officers from Scale I to Scale II was approved:\n\n \"After considering the guidelines contained in the Government of\n\n India's Letter dated 23-9-1988 and Letter No. 823 dated 7-10-\n\n 1996 of National Bank, the Board passed a resolution that sixty\n\n points be earmarked on the basis of work done during the\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:22:-\n\n previous three years in the selection procedure for promotion on\n\n the Scale II posts and forty points be given for interview and in\n\n this manner the promotion procedure should be completed. Also,\n\n an information in this behalf be given to National Bank.\"\n\n In pursuance of the above, the eligible candidates (Scale I\n\n officers), including the appellants were considered and\n\n interviewed on 16-12-1996 and 17-12-1996 and a select list was\n\n published on 20-12-1996 promoting 64 officers (Respondents 4 to\n\n 67) from Scale I to Scale II with effect from 20-12-1996.\n\n 4. Appellants 1 to 7 were not selected. Many who were selected,\n\n were their juniors. The appellants allege that their service and\n\n conduct were good and there were no adverse entries against\n\n them and therefore, they ought to have been promoted from\n\n officer Scale I to Scale II. They therefore filed a writ petition before\n\n the Allahabad High Court (WP No. 3151 of 1997), for quashing\n\n the entire promotion process of the first respondent Bank from\n\n Scale I to Scale II culminating in the order dated 20-12-1996 and\n\n for a direction to the first respondent Bank to undertake the\n\n promotion process afresh. The appellants also sought quashing of\n\n the resolution of the Board of Directors dated 29-11-1996\n\n prescribing the promotion procedure.\n\n xx xx xx xx\n\n 8. On the contentions urged, the following two questions\n\n arise for our consideration:\n\n (i) Whether minimum qualifying marks could be prescribed for\n\n assessment of past performance and interview, where the\n\n promotions are to be made on the principle of seniority-cum-\n\n merit?\n\n (ii) Whether the first respondent Bank was justified in fixing a high\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:23:-\n\n percentage (78%) as the minimum qualifying marks (minimum\n\n merit) for promotion?\n\n Re: Question (i)\n\n 9. \nIn \nState of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas3\n, a seven-Judge Bench of\n\n this Court defined the concept of \"seniority-cum-merit\". This Court\n\n held that: (SCC p. 335, para 38)\n\n \"38. ... `Seniority-cum-merit' means that given the minimum\n\n necessary merit requisite for efficiency of administration, the\n\n senior though the less meritorious shall have priority.\"\n\n 10. \nIn \nUnion of India v. Lt. Gen. Rajendra Singh Kadyan4\n this\n\n Court observed that \"seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the\n\n requirement of certain minimum merit or satisfying a benchmark\n\n previously fixed, and subject to fulfilling the said requirement, the\n\n promotion is based on seniority. It was pointed out that\n\n requirement of assessment of comparative merit was absent in\n\n the case of \"seniority-cum-merit\".\n\n 11. It is also well settled that the principle of seniority-cum-merit,\n\n for promotion, is different from the principle of \"seniority\" and the\n\n principle of \"merit-cum-seniority\". Where promotion is on the basis\n\n of seniority alone, merit will not play any part at all. But where\n\n promotion is on the principle of seniority-cum-merit, promotion is\n\n not automatic with reference to seniority alone. Merit will also play\n\n a significant role. The standard method of seniority-cum-merit is to\n\n subject all the eligible candidates in the feeder grade\n\n (possessing the prescribed educational qualification and period of\n\n service) to a process of assessment of a specified minimum\n\n necessary merit and then promote the candidates who are found\n\n to possess the minimum necessary merit strictly in the order of\n\n seniority. The minimum merit necessary for the post may be\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:24:-\n\n assessed either by subjecting the candidates to a written\n\n examination or an interview or by assessment of their work\n\n performance during the previous years, or by a combination of\n\n either two or all the three of the aforesaid methods. There is no\n\n hard-and-fast rule as to how the minimum merit is to be\n\n ascertained. So long as the ultimate promotions are based on\n\n seniority, any process for ascertaining the minimum necessary\n\n merit, as a basic requirement, will not militate against the principle\n\n of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n 12. In Sivaiah1, a three-Judge Bench of this Court held that while\n\n the principle of seniority-cum-merit laid greater emphasis on\n\n seniority, the principle of merit-cum-seniority laid greater\n\n emphasis on merit and ability, with seniority playing a less\n\n significant role. This Court held: (SCC p. 730, para 18)\n\n \"18. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the criterion of\n `seniority-cum-merit' in the matter of promotion postulates that\n given the minimum necessary merit requisite for efficiency of\n administration, the senior, even though less meritorious, shall\n have priority and a comparative assessment of merit is not\n required to be made. For assessing the minimum necessary\n merit, the competent authority can lay down the minimum\n standard that is required and also prescribe the mode of\n assessment of merit of the employee who is eligible for\n consideration for promotion. Such assessment can be made by\n assigning marks on the basis of appraisal of performance on the\n basis of service record and interview and prescribing the minimum\n marks which would entitle a person to be promoted on the basis\n of seniority-cum-merit.\"\n\n \n21. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents\n\nrelies upon \nB.V. Shivaiah & others v. K. Addanki Babu &\n\f\nWA No.\n 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:25:-\n\nothers [JT 1998 5 SC 96] in which paragraph No.18 is relevant.\n\nIn the case of \nUnion of India & others v. Lt.Gen.Rajendra\n\nSingh Kadyan and another\n [(2000) 6 SCC 698] the Hon'ble\n\nthree judges of the Apex Court have in fact considered the\n\nservice law with regard to promotion and criteria of a selection\n\nwhich fall into three categories; 1. seniority-cum-fitness, 2.\n\nseniority-cum-merit and 3. merit-cum-suitability with due regard\n\nto seniority. Paragraph Nos.11 and 12 in detail refer to these\n\naspects, which read as under:\n\n \"11. The hierarchy in the Army and the method of selection\n\n and promotion to various posts starting from the post of Lieutenant\n\n and going up to the post of the Chief of the Army Staff will clearly\n\n indicate that the posts of Lieutenant, Captain and Major are\n\n automatic promotion posts on passing the promotion examination\n\n irrespective of inter se merit, whereas the posts from Major to Lt.\n\n Colonel, Lt. Colonel to Colonel, Colonel to Brigadier, Brigadier to\n\n Major General and Major General to Lt. General are all selection\n\n posts filled up by promotion on the basis of relative merit assessed\n\n by the designated Selection Boards. From Lt. General (Corps\n\n Commander) to Army Commander is a non-selection post to which\n\n promotion is made subject to fitness. It is a promotion subject to\n\n fitness in all respects, although the rank remains the same. From\n\n the post of Army Commander to that of the Chief of the Army\n\n Staff, it is by promotion for which no specific criteria have been\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:26:-\n\n laid down. There have been precedents where the seniormost\n\n Army Commanders have not been appointed as the Chief of the\n\n Army Staff. Selection implies the right of rejection depending upon\n\n the criteria prescribed. Selection for promotion is based on\n\n different criteria depending upon the nature of the post and\n\n requirements of the service. Such criteria fall into three categories,\n\n namely,\n\n 1. seniority-cum-fitness,\n\n 2. seniority-cum-merit,\n\n 3. merit-cum-suitability with due regard to seniority.\n\n 12. Wherever fitness is stipulated as the basis of selection, it is\n\n regarded as a non-selection post to be filled on the basis of\n\n seniority subject to rejection of the unfit. Fitness means fitness in\n\n all respects. \"Seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the requirement of\n\n certain minimum merit or satisfying a benchmark previously fixed.\n\n Subject to fulfilling this requirement the promotion is based on\n\n seniority. There is no requirement of assessment of comparative\n\n merit both in the case of seniority-cum-fitness and seniority-cum-\n\n merit. Merit-cum-suitability with due regard to seniority as\n\n prescribed in the case of promotion to All-India Services\n\n necessarily involves assessment of comparative merit of all\n\n eligible candidates, and selecting the best out of them.\"\n\n 22. On reading of the above paragraphs it is very\n\nclear that there is a marginal difference in the meaning between\n\nseniority-cum-fitness and seniority-cum-merit, but, there is no\n\nrequirement of assessment of comparative merit both in the case\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:27:-\n\nof seniority-cum-fitness and seniority-cum-merit. So far as merit-\n\ncum-suitability, it necessarily requires assessment of comparative\n\nmerit of all eligible candidates and selection shall be made best\n\nout of them. The word 'fitness' means fitness in all respects. But\n\nthere is no requirement of assessment of comparative merit. In\n\nother words, merit is not the criterion in such cases. In view of\n\nthe above discussion and reasoning, there was justification on the\n\npart of learned Single Judge to hold that the very selection\n\nprocess was incorrect and therefore he was justified in quashing\n\nExts.P4, P5 and P13.\n\n 23. As we are dismissing the writ appeal on merits,\n\nRevision Petitions become infructuous as the whole selection\n\nprocess has to be re-scheduled in the light of the observations\n\nmade as above. Accordingly, the Writ Appeal is dismissed. CRPs\n\nare dismissed as infructuous.\n\n \nWe direct the respondent Board to appoint Principals in\n\nterms of the provisions of the respective University Act and also\n\nin the light of the principle enunciated in the judgments of the\n\f\nWA No. 975 of 2011 and\nC.R.P. Nos. 138 & 139 of 2011\n\n -:28:-\n\nApex Court and in the Full Bench decision of this Court in \nSuresh\n\nv. Manager, S.N.M. College\n(supra).\n\n Manjula Chellur,\n Ag.
