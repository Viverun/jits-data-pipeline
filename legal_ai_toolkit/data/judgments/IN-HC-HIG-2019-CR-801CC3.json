The main contention of the petitioners\n\nis that the complaint is filed in respect of\n\nviolation of the Minor and Minerals (Development\n\nand Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to\n\nas the 'Act, 1957 for brevity), the Karnataka Minor\n\nMineral Concession Rules, 1994 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the 'Rules, 1994' for brevity). The\n\nrespondent had no authority to register a\n\ncomplaint in respect of the said offences. The\n\ncomplaint could be filed only in accordance with\nSection 22\nof the Act, 1957 and the said\n\ncomplaint ought to have been filed before the\n\njurisdictional Court by a person authorized in this\n\nbehalf by the State or the Central Government.\n\nSection 22\nof the Act, 1957 is mandatory it cannot\n\nbe circumvented under any circumstances and\n\nmerely because provisions under the\nIndian Penal\n\nCode\nare invoked against the petitioners,\n\njurisdictional Court does not get jurisdiction to\n\ntry the offences in the absence of a formal\n\ncomplaint by the competent person authorized in\n\nthis behalf as the Act, 1957 is a special enactment\n\nand hence the very initiation of the proceedings\n\nhas to be quashed against these petitioners in\n\nview of non-compliance of\nSection 22\nof the Act,\n\n1957.\n\n7. The counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners in their arguments, vehemently\nreiterated the grounds urged in the petitions and\n\nfurther contended that the complaint is filed by\n\nthe incharge Revenue Inspector, ASI, PSI, PI and\n\nmahazar was conducted. It is also contended that\n\nthe offences invoked are not only under the\n\nMMRD Act, 1957\n, KMMC Rules, 1994 and\nIndian\n\nPenal Code\n, 1860, against the petitioners and\n\nfurther contended that the Court below has\n\nentertained the complaint even for the offences\n\nunder the special enactment and hence the\n\nproceedings is liable to be quashed. In support of\n\ntheir contentions, the counsels also relied upon\n\nthe judgment of this Court passed in\n\nCrl.Pet.No.200131/2014 connected with other\n\nmatters vide order dated 18th June, 2014 and\n\ncontended that those cases are arising out of the\n\nAct, 1957 and Rules, 1994 and also for the\n\noffences punishable under\nSection 379\nof IPC and\n\nalso\nSections 4(1)\nand\n4(1A)\nof the Act, 1957 and\ncontended that this Court quashed the initiation\n\nof the very proceedings however given the liberty\n\nto the State to proceed in accordance with law in\n\nrespect of the offences alleged against the\n\npersons.\n\n8. Per contra, the learned HCGP in his\n\nargument contends that in the present cases, the\n\noffences not only invoked under\nMMDR Act, 1957\n\nand the Rules, 1994 and also invoked under\n\nSection 379 read with\nsection 511\nof IPC and\n\nthere cannot be quashed by invoking\nSection 482\n\nof Cr.P.C. He also contends that the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the judgment reported in (2014) 9 SCC\n\n772 in the case of S tate (\nNCT of Delhi Vs. S\nanjay\n\nheld that both the offences are distinct and in a\n\ncase where there is theft of sand and gravel from\n\nthe Government land, the police can register a\n\ncase, investigate the same and submit a final\nreport under\nSection 173\nof Cr.P.C. before the\n\nMagistrate having jurisdiction for the purpose of\n\ntaking cognizance as provided in\nSection 190(1)(d)\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. The\n\ncontravention of terms and conditions of mining\n\nlease or doing mining activity in violation of\n\nSection 4\nof the Act is an offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 21\nof the Act, 1957, whereas\n\ndishonestly removing sand, gravel and other\n\nminerals from the river, which the property of the\n\nState, out of the State's possession without the\n\nconsent, constitute an offence of theft. Hence,\n\nmerely because initiation of proceeding for\n\ncommission of an offence under the Act, 1957 on\n\nthe basis of complaint cannot and shall not debar\n\nthe police from taking action against persons for\n\ncommitting theft of sand and minerals in the\n\nmanner mentioned above by exercising power\n\nunder the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\nand submit\na report before the Magistrate for taking\n\ncognizance against such persons and further held\n\nthat on receipt of the police report, the Magistrate\n\nhaving jurisdiction can take cognizance of the\n\nsaid offence without awaiting the receipt of the\n\ncomplaint that may be filed by the Authorized\n\nOfficer for taking cognizance in respect of the\n\nviolation of various provisions of the Act, 1957\n\nand hence prayed this Court to dismiss the\n\npetition.\n\n9. Having heard the arguments of the\n\npetitioners' counsel and the learned HCGP for the\n\nrespondent, this Court has to analyze and\n\nexamine what would be the course of action if\n\nboth the offences are invoked under the\nMMDR\n\nAct, 1957\nand under the KMMC Rules and any\n\nproceedings is initiated under the\nIPC\nand\n\nwhether this Court can exercise powers under\nSection 482\nof Cr.P.C. to quash the proceedings if\n\na case is registered by the Police both under the\n\nprovisions of the\nIPC\nas well as the provisions of\n\nthe\nMMDR Act, 1957\n.\n\nBefore adverting to the penal provisions\n\nand procedures to be adopted by the\n\nprosecuting agency, I would like to make a\n\nmention the very object of the\nMMDR Act\nand\n\nRules. The policy and object of the Mines and\n\nMinerals Act and Rules have a long history and\n\nare the result of an increasing awareness of the\n\ncompelling need to restore the serious\n\necological imbalance and to stop the damages\n\nbeing caused to the nature. At the same time,\n\nthe Court also cannot lose sight of the fact\n\nthat adverse and destructive environmental\n\nimpact of sand mining. The mining of\n\naggregates in rivers has led to severe damage\nto river, including pollution and changes in\n\nlevels of the river. Removing sediment from\n\nrivers causes the river to cut its channel\n\nthrough the bed of the valley floor, or channel\n\nincision, both upstream and downstream of the\n\nex traction site. Incision can also cause the\n\nalluvial aquifer to drain to a lower level,\n\nresulting in a loss of aquifer storage. It can\n\nalso increase flood frequency and intensity by\n\nreducing flood regulation capacity. In order to\n\ncombat the menace in the society, the very\n\nenactment was brought in keeping to protect\n\nthe natural resources which are public property\n\nand national assets. There should be a balance\n\nbetween the conservation of natural resources\n\nand urban development. The provisions of the\n\nRules also amended in respect of Rule 43 (5\n\nto 8) and made the owners of the vehicle to\n\nfurnish the bank guarantee double the value of\nthe vehicle in order to combat the menace of\n\nmining mafia.\n\n10. The very object and policy of the State\n\nhas to be taken care while dealing with the\n\nmatters under the special enactment and to serve\n\nthe very object and purpose and policy of the\n\nState, this Court would like to discuss the case on\n\nhand in order to safeguard the same and in order\n\nto avoid the anomalies and set-right the same to\n\nfollow the procedure in case of any offences are\n\ntaken place under the special enactment and also\n\nunder the\nIndian Penal Code\nand other laws.\n\n11. Before going to consider the grounds\n\nurged in the petition, this Court would like to\n\nmake a mention the very provision of the Act,\n\n1957 and the Rules, 1994. While setting the law\n\ninto motion by the concerned officer while\ninvoking\nSection 4(1)\n,\n4(1A)\n,\nand\nof the Act.\n\nThe same reads as follows:\n\n4.

After having considered the invoking of\n\npenal provision of the Act, 1957 and the\nKarnataka Minor Minerals Concession Rules 1994\n\nand offence under\nIPC\n, regarding setting the law\n\ninto motion, this Court would like to discuss with\n\nregard to the procedural aspects enumerated\n\nunder the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973.\nThe\n\nAct, 1957\n, does not define anything about the\n\nword 'complaint'. However, in\nsection 22\nof the\n\nAct, 1957, in order to take the cognizance of\n\nan offence punishable under the said Act, it is\n\nmentioned that, no Court shall take cognizance\n\nof any offence punishable under this Act or any\n\nRules made thereunder, ex cept upon complaint\n\nin writing made by a person authorized in this\n\nbehalf by the Central Government or the State\n\nGovernment.\n\n15. When there is no any definition in the\n\nspecial enactment, this Court has to in order to\n\nconsider the word 'complaint', consider the\ndefinition of complaint in\nCr.P.C\n.\nSection 2(d)\n\nof Cr.P.C. defines the word 'complaint', which\n\nmeans, any allegation made orally or in writing\n\nto a Magistrate, with a view to his taking\n\naction under this Code, that some person,\n\nwhether known or unknown, has committed an\n\noffence, but does not include a police report. It\n\nhas to be noted that the 'police report' is also\n\ndefined under\nsection 2(r)\nof Cr.P.C., which\n\nmeans, a report forwarded by a police officer to\n\na Magistrate under sub-section (2) of section\n\n173.\n\n16. This Court would like to mention in\n\nbrief here itself that the 'police report' is\n\nforwarded by a police officer to a Magistrate after\n\na complete investigation under sub-section (2) of\n\nsection 173 and thereafter, the concerned Court\n\nwould take cognizance based on the report. Now,\nin view of the special enactment, the concerned\n\nMagistrate has to take the cognizance based on\n\nthe complaint filed by the authorized person\n\ninvoking\nsection 22\nof the Act, 1957.\n\n17. Now the question remains before this\n\nCourt, if any cognizable offence has taken place in\n\nviolation of the Act, 1957, what has to be done,\n\nwhether the law has to be set in motion by filing\n\nonly a complaint by authorized person under\n\nsection 22\nof the special enactment or to set the\n\nlaw in motion irrespective of the offence under the\n\nspecial enactment or under penal law or under\n\nany other law.\n\n18. For the violation of\nsection 4\nand\n4(1A)\n\nof the Act, a special penal provision is made under\n\nthe special enactment under\nsection 21\nof the Act,\n\n1957, that whoever contravenes the provision of\n\nsub-section (1) or sub-section (1A) of\nsection 4\nshall be punishable with imprisonment for a term\n\nwhich may ex tend to five years and with fine\n\nwhich may extend to five lakh rupees per hectare\n\nof the area.\nSection 21(2)\nof the Act, 1957\n\nprovides, any rule made under any provision of\n\nthis Act may provide that any contravention\n\nthereof shall be punishable with imprisonment for\n\na term which may extend to two years or with fine\n\nwhich may extend to five lakh rupees or with both\n\nand in the case of continuing contravention, with\n\nadditional fine which may extend to fifty thousand\n\nrupees for every day during which such\n\ncontravention continues for such contravention.\n\n19. When the punishment is provided,\n\nwhich may extend to five years and if any\n\nviolation of the provisions of other laws in terms\n\nof the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, it is clear that\n\nif the punishment is more than three years, the\nsame is cognizable offence and non bailable and\n\nunder\nsection 21(6)\nof the Act the offence is\n\ncognizable.\n\n20. Now the question arises, whether any\n\ninformation is received with regard to the\n\ntransportation of sand, murrum, graval, whether\n\nthe Police officer in-charge of a police station can\n\ninvoke\nsection 154\nof Cr.P.C. This Court would\n\nlike to refer the proviso of\nsection 154\nof Cr.P.C.,\n\nwhich reads as follows:\n\n154. Inf ormation in cognizable\ncases.--(1) Every inf ormation relating to\nthe commission of a cognizable off ence,\nif given or ally to an off icer in charge of a\npolice station, shall be reduced to\nwr iting by him or under his direction,\nand be read over to the inf ormant; and\nevery such inf ormation, whe ther given in\nwr iting or reduced to wr iting as\naf oresaid, shall be signed by the person\ngiving it, and the substance thereof shall\nbe entered in a book to be kept by such\noff icer in such f orm as the S tate\nGovernment may prescr ibe in this behalf .\n(2) A copy of the inf ormation as\nrecorded under sub-section (1) shall be\ngiven f orth with, free of cost, to the\ninf ormant.\n\n(3) Any person, aggrieved by a\nref usal on the par t of an off icer in charge\nof a police station to record the\ninf ormation ref erred to in sub-section (1)\nmay send the substance of such\ninf ormation, in wr iting and by post, to\nthe Super intendent of Police concerned\nwho, if satisf ied that such inf ormation\ndiscloses the commission of a cognizable\noff ence, shall either investigate the case\nhimself or direct an investigation to be\nmade by any police off icer subordinate\nto him, in the manner provided by this\nCode, and such off icer shall have all the\npowers of an off icer in charge of the\npolice station in relation to that offence.\n\nIf it is the information in respect of\n\ncognizable cases, then the police officers\n\nhave power to investigate the cognizable\n\ncases under\nSection 156\nof Cr.P.C. and this\n\nCourt would like to mention a proviso to\n\nSection 156\nas hereunder:\n156. Police officer's power to\ninvestigate cognizable case.--(1) Any\noff icer in charge of a police station may,\nwithout the order of a Magistr ate,\ninvestigate any cognizable case which a\nCour t having jurisd iction over the local\narea within the limits of such station\nwould have power to inquire in to or try\nunder the provisions of Chapter XIII.\n\n(2) No proceeding of a police off icer\nin any such case shall at any stage be\ncalled in question on the ground that the\ncase was one which such off icer was no t\nempowered under this section to\ninvestigate.\n\n(3) Any Magistr ate empo wered\nunder section 190 may order such an\ninvestigation as above-mentioned.\n\n21. This Court also would like to refer\n\nSection 57\nand\nSection 167(1)\nof Cr.P.C. regarding\n\narrest of a person not to be detained for more\n\nthan 24 years and if an offence is reported under\n\nthe Act, 1957, for cognizable offence,\nSection 57\n\nand\nSection 167(1)\nof Cr.P.C. has come into\n\ncompliance and\nSection 57\nand\nSection 167(1)\nof\n\nCr.P.C. reads as follows:\n57. Person arrested not to be\ndetained more than twenty-four\nhours.--No police off icer shall detain in\ncustody a person arrested without\nwarr an t f or a longer period than under\nall the circumstances of the case is\nreasonable, and such period shall not, in\nthe absence of a special order or a\nMagistr ate under section 167, exceed\ntwen ty-f our hours exclusive of the time\nnecessary f or the journey, from the place\nof arrest to the Magistr ate's Cour t.\n\n167. Procedure when\ninvestigation cannot be completed in\ntwenty-four hours--(1) Whenever any\nperson is arrested and detained in\ncustody, and it appears that the\ninvestigation cannot be completed within\nthe per iod of twenty-f our hours fixed by\n\nSection 57\n, and there are grounds f or\nbelieving that the accusation or\ninf ormation is well-f ounded, the off icer-\n\nin-charge of the police station or the\npolice off icer making the investigation, if\nhe is not below the r ank of Sub-\n\nInspector, shall for th with tr ansmit to the\nnearest Jud icial Magistr ate a copy of the\nentr ies in the diary hereinaf ter\nprescr ibed relating to the case, and shall\nat the same time f orward the accused to\nsuch Magistr ate.\n\nNow, if the police officer cannot register the\n\ncase and investigate the matter when a cognizable\noffence is taken place and if the only authorized\n\nperson can invoke\nsection 22\nof the special\n\nenactment to file the complaint, what could be\n\ndone in such circumstances.\n\nThis Court also would like to refer the\n\nprovisions of the\nWild Life (Protection) Act, 1972\n.\n\nIn the said enactment also the Court can take\n\ncognizance only on a private complaint under\n\nsection 55\nof the said Act. However a handbook is\n\nreleased in order to investigate the crime under\n\nthe said Act in order to avoid the technicalities\n\nand a special provision is made to receive the\n\nreport by the Court and the same is called as\n\nWLOR report.\n\n22. This Court also would like to make a\n\nmention Chapter-3 of hand book, Registration of\n\nCases in case of Wildlife Crime Investigation and\n\nin the said chapter, it is mentioned that in\nconventional crimes, investigation starts with\n\nregistration of the case as First Information\n\nReport (FIR). Recovery of material evidence (stolen\n\nproperty, weapons, vehicles etc) takes place only\n\nafter registration of the case. However, in wildlife\n\ncrime cases, the seizure of the wildlife/wildlife\n\narticle or apprehension of the accused/suspect\n\nmay take place before registration of the case. In\n\nother words, in wildlife offences, investigation\n\nmay start with lodging of a seizure/apprehension\n\nreport or the offence report, in the jurisdictional\n\ncourt, by an authorized officer, who makes such\n\nseizure or arrest. In different States this report is\n\nknown by different names such as the Preliminary\n\nOffences Report (POR), H-2 Case, Offence Report,\n\nFirst Information Report (FIR), Seizure\n\nInformation etc. However, it has been observed\n\nthat some of the judicial officers who are new to\n\nwildlife crime cases doubt the legitimacy of such\nreports and insist on FIR/POR. There are some\n\nincidents where the jurisdictional magistrates\n\nrefused to accept such reports as they are not on\n\npar with the First Information Report (FIR) filed\n\nby the police. In order to avoid such technical\n\nproblems and to bring uniformity in practice, it is\n\nsuggested that the first report submitted in the\n\njurisdictional court in wildlife crime cases may be\n\nnamed as Wildlife Offence Report (WLOR). The\n\nWildlife Offence Report should be prepared under\n\nSection 50(4)\nof the Wild Life (Protection) Act,\n\n1972, and Check list also suggested for preparing\n\nWildlife Offence Report in Chapter 3.2 of the\n\nWildlife Crime Investigation and the details has\n\nbeen given in the said Chapter.\n\n23. Chapter 3.3 of the Wildlife Crime\n\nInvestigation says that Registration of FIR and\n\ninvestigation of offences under the Wild Life\n(Protection) Act, 1972, by police officer- Violation\n\nof the provisions of the Act are not specified as\n\ncognizable offence, therefore, police officers are\n\noften unwilling to lodge FIR and investigate\n\noffences reported under the provisions of the Act.\n\nIt is clarified that under Part-II of Schedule-I of\n\nthe\nCriminal Procedure Code\n, 1973, offences\n\nagainst other laws, if punishable with\n\nimprisonment for 3 years and upwards are\n\nclassified as cognizable. Most of the offences\n\nunder the act are punishable with imprisonment\n\nfor 3 or more years. Therefore, an Officer In\n\ncharge of a Police Station is bound to lodge an FIR\n\nand investigate the case like any other cognizable\n\noffence. However, courts shall take cognizance of\n\nany offence against the Act only on the complaint\n\nsubmitted any person specified under\nSection 55\n\nof the Act. Therefore, if Police Officers in the State\n\nconcerned are not authorized to file complaints\nunder\nSection 55\nof the Act, the Police report is\n\nsubmitted in the Court as complaint through an\n\nauthorized forest officer. Once a complaint is filed\n\nin Court, no further investigation will be\n\nconducted without the direction of the Court.\n\nFurther, there is no provision for filing\n\nsupplementary complaint once complaint is filed.\n\nTherefore, any subsequent discovery, seizure,\n\narrest etc. will be treated as fresh case and\n\nseparate complaint filed in the Court.\n\n24. This Court in keeping the above\n\nprovisions in mind analyse the case on hand in\n\nkeeping the practical difficulties faced by the\n\nconcerned Authorities to set the law in motion and\n\nproceed in the matter. The same analogy is\n\napplicable to crimes committed in respect of the\n\nAct and Rules in which cases to be filed.\n25. The main grounds urged by the\n\npetitioners in these petitions are that, when there\n\nis a specific bar under\nSection 22\nof the Act,\n\n1957, the police cannot register the case and\n\ninvestigate the matter and if any such procedure\n\nis adopted by the police, the same is in\n\ncontravention of\nsection 22\nof the Act, 1957.\n\n26. Before answering the said issues, it is\n\npertinent to refer the following judgments of this\n\nCourt and the Apex Court to answer the issues\n\nand hence referring the following judgments:\n\n27. This Court would like to refer the\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court reported in (2014)\n\n9 SCC 772, in S tate (\nNCT of Delhi) vs. Sanjay\n, the\n\nApex Court in the judgment elaborately discussed\n\nwith regard to the Minor Minerals are the assets\n\nof the State and also discussed with regard to\n\nprotect natural resources and also in this\njudgment the Apex Court categorically held that\n\nthe violation under the Act, 1957 and the penal\n\nprovision under\nsection 378\nand\nof Cr.P.C.\n\nare distinct.\n\nThis Court also would like to refer the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of the\n\nState of Karnataka vs. Linganagouda\netc.,.\n\ndated 12.10.2017. In this matter similar\n\nquestion aroused before the Supreme Court.\n\nSince this Court has quashed the proceedings\n\ninitiated under the Act, 1957, and the same\n\nwas questioned before the Apex Court and the\n\nApex Court in\nthe said judgment\ncategorically\n\nheld that the stage of cognizance will arise\n\nonly after investigation is completed and there\n\nis no bar, for investigation being carried out by\n\nthe Lokayukta Police on the complaint in\n\nquestion, particularly when the allegations\ninclude offences under the\nPrevention of\n\nCorruption Act, 1988\n, and hence held that the\n\nimpugned order of this Court quashing the\n\nregistration of the cases cannot be sustained.\n\n28. This Court would like to refer the\n\njudgment of the Karnataka High Court reported in\n\n2019(1) Kar.L.J. 149 in\nMs.Meghal J. Gandhi\n\nvs. State of Karnataka\n.\n\nThis Court while\n\nreferring the judgment of the Apex Court\nreferred\n\nabove\n, in\nLinganagouda\n's case, held that the\n\ncriminal action is initiated after due enquiry\n\nbased on the source report which prima facie\n\nmakes out serious violation and contravention of\n\nthe statutes. The Magnitude of the transactions\n\nand remification of the offences are required to be\n\nunearthed in a thorough and penetrating\n\ninvestigation. It is further observed that on\n\ncareful consideration of the allegations made in\nthe complaint, and the material produced by the\n\nrespondent before the Court, the Court do not find\n\nany justifiable reason to interfere with the FIR\n\nregistered against the petitioners and the\n\ninvestigation initiated thereon. The allegations\n\nmade in the FIR prima facie make out ingredients\n\nof the offences alleged against the petitioners. The\n\nSIT is duly authorized and competent to\n\ninvestigate into the matter. No prejudice would be\n\ncaused to the petitioners if the alleged violations\n\nare investigated by the respondent. The exact role\n\nplayed by each of the petitioners could be\n\nascertained only after investigation. If the\n\ninvestigation leads to the final opinion that the\n\nalleged offences are committed without the\n\nknowledge and connivance of the petitioner, the\n\ncharges against the petitioners would naturally be\n\ndropped. Therefore, the apprehension of the\n\npetitioners that the proceedings initiated against\nthe petitioners have resulted in abuse of process\n\nof Court is ill founded and the Court held that the\n\npetitions are liable to be dismissed.\n\n29. This Court also would like to refer the\n\nrecent judgment of the Apex Court reported in\n\n(2018) 3 SCC 104 in\nDineshbhai Chandubhai Patel\n\nvs. S\ntate of Gujarat and others. This judgment is\n\ndelivered with regard to the exercising of powers\n\nunder\nsection 482\nof Cr.P.C. and in this judgment\n\nit is held that, in order to examine as to whether\n\nfactual contents of FIR disclose any prima facie\n\ncognizable offence or not, High Court cannot act\n\nlike an investigating agency and nor can exercise\n\npowers like an appellate Court. The question is\n\nrequired to be examined, keeping in view,\n\ncontents of FIR and prima facie material, if any,\n\nrequiring no proof. At such stage, High Court\n\ncannot appreciate evidence nor can it draw its\nown inferences from contents of FIR and material\n\nrelied on. It is more so, when the material relied\n\non is disputed. In such a situation, it becomes the\n\njob of investigating authority at such stage, to\n\nprobe and then of the Court to examine questions\n\nonce the charge sheet is filed along with such\n\nmaterial as to how far and to what extent reliance\n\ncan be placed on such material.\nOnce the Court\n\nfinds that FIR discloses prima facie commission of\n\nany cognizable offence, it should stay its hand\n\nand allow investigation machinery to step in to\n\ninitiate the probe to unearth commission of\n\noffence in accordance with the procedure\n\nprescribed in Cr.P.C.\n\nThis Court would like to refer the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court reported in AIR\n\n2014 Supreme Court 187, in\nLalita Kumari vs.\n\nGovernment of U.P. and others\n. In the said case\nit is held that it is mandatory on the part of\n\nthe police officer to register the crime\n\ninvoking\nsection 154\nof Cr.P.C. if the\n\ninformation discloses the commission of a\n\ncognizable offence and no preliminary enquiry\n\nis permissible in such situation and if the\n\ninformation does not disclose a cognizable\n\noffence, but indicates the necessity for an\n\nenquiry, a preliminary enquiry may be\n\nconducted only to ascertain whether a\n\ncognizable offence is disclosed or not.\n\n30. This Court would also refer to the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nJeewan Kumar Raut and Ors. Vs. Central\n\nBureau of Investigation\n, reported in AIR 2009\n\nSC 2763, wherein the Apex Court by invoking\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973-\nSection 4-\n-\n\nTransplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994\n(TOHO)-Section 22-Complaint under TOHO-\n\nSections 13\nand 22-Investigation under TOHO-\n\nTOHO being special statute-\nSection 4\nof Code or\n\nother provisions may not be applicable-provisions\n\nof TOHO shall prevail over provisions of Code and\n\ndiscussed with regard to taking of cognizance by\n\nthe Court under the special enactment. At para-23\n\nof\nthe said judgment\n, the Hon'ble Apex Court has\n\nheld that a plain read ing of the above provision\n\nwill show that even though by\nSection 24\nall\n\noff ences under the Act are mad e cognizable, no\n\nCour t can take cognizance of the off ence except\n\nupon a wr itten complain t made by a person\n\nau thor ized in this behalf by the Government of the\n\nDistr ic t Collector. A 'complaint in wr iting' by the\n\nau thor ized off icer etc. is the only condition f or\n\ntaking cognizance as provided in\nSection 25\n. If a\n\npolice off icer is au thor ized by the Government, he\n\nmay also f ile a complain t on the basis of which the\nCour t may take cognizance. But, the Cour t canno t\n\ntake cognizance of any offence punishable under\n\nthe S and Act on a police repor t f iled under\nSection\n\n173(2)\nof the Cr.P.C. af ter investigation by police.\n\nThe Apex Court referring to the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Kerala in\n\nMoosakoya Vs. State of Kerala\nobserved in para-\n\n26 that Whereas the remand at a pre-cognizance\n\nstage is to be made in terms of Sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 167\nof the Code, an order of remand of an\n\naccused at post-cognizance stage can be eff ected\n\nonly in terms of Sub-section (2) of Section 309\n\nthereof . In para-28 also observed with regard to\n\nspecial enactment is concerned that we are,\n\nhowever, not oblivious of some decisions of this\n\nCour t where some special statu tory au thor ities like\n\nau thor ities under the\nCustoms Act\nhave been\n\ngr anted all the special powers of the investigating\n\noff icer under a special statu te like the\nNDPS Act,\nbut this Cour t has held that they cannot f ile charge\n\nsheet and to that exten t they would not be police\n\noff icers. Further observed in para-29 also in\n\nparticularly to that case, however, the respondent\n\nhaving specially been empowered both under the\n\n1946 Act as also under the Code to carry out\n\ninvestigation and file a charge sheet is precluded\n\nfrom doing so only by reason of\nSection 22\nof\n\nTOHO. It is doubtful as to whether in the event of\n\nauthorization of an officer of the department to\n\ncarry out investigation on a complaint made by a\n\nthird party, he would be entitled to arrest the\n\naccused and carry on investigation as if he is\n\npolice officer. We hope that the parliament would\n\ntake appropriate measures to suitably amend the\n\nlaw in the near future.\n\n31. By referring the special enactment and\n\nalso the other laws, and also the principles\nlaid\ndown in\nthe judgment rendered supra, now this\n\nCourt has to examine:\n\n(i) what would be the course if a\ncognizable offence is taken place?\n\n(ii) If an accused is apprehended\nwith regard to committing of cognizable\noffence and non bailable offence and\nSection 57 and 167(1) of Cr.P.C.\n\ncontemplates he has to be produced\nbefore the Court within 24 hours and\nwhether it is possible to complete the\ninvestigation in all cases to file a\ncomplaint as contemplated under\n\nSection 22\nof the Act, 1957, by an\nauthorized person within 24 hours.\n\n(iii) If an accused is apprehended,\nand vehicle is seized, and the same is\ninvolved in transportation of sand,\ngraval, murrum etc., and if the vehicle\nis not having its original records, and if\nall the vehicular documents are\ntampered, it is required a detailed\ninvestigation and whether it is possible\nto procure all the incriminating material\nof tampering of the documents of the\ngoods and vehicle and a complaint can\nbe filed within 24 hours and question of\nrelease of the vehicles also involves and\nif case is not registered what would be\nthe course open to stake holders.\n\n(iv) Does the law permits in case\nof complaint cases to file supplementary\ncomplaint.\n\n(v) If such practical difficulties\narise, what would be the course of\naction whether the first information\nreport has to be filed to the Court or the\nauthorized person has to proceed to\ninvoke\nSection 154\nof Cr.P.C. if any\ncognizable offence is taken place.\n\n32. In keeping the principles\nlaid down by\n\nthis Court also the Apex Court, first I would like\n\nto make a mention here that the offences invoked\n\nunder the special enactments in the cases on\n\nhand, the offences are cognizable.\nAs provided in\nSection 21(6)\nof the Act\n\n1957, an offence under sub-Section (1) of\n\nSection 21\nis cognizable and therefore, it is\n\nlawful for police to register a case as provided\n\nunder\nSection 154\nof Cr.P.C. to investigate the\n\nsame as per provisions of\nCr.P.C\n.\nSection 154\n\nof Cr.P.C. provides the officer of the police to\n\nregister the case when information is received\n\nin respect of the cognizable offence and the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the judgment of\nLalita\n\nKumari\n(supra) has categorically held that it is\n\nmandatory on the part of the police officer to\n\nregister the FIR when he receives the\n\ninformation in respect of the cognizable\n\noffences. It is further clarified that if in such\n\ninformation is received and if any doubt with\n\nregard to taking place of cognizable offence\n\nthen in order to confirm the same, the police\n\nofficer has got right to hold the preliminary\nenquiry and get it confirm, whether a\n\ncognizable offence is taken place, then register\n\nthe case after the satisfaction.\nThis aspect is\n\nalso discussed by this Court in the judgment of\n\nVivek and Another Vs. The State of Karnataka,\n\nby Kunigal Police Station, reported in ILR\n\n2018 Karnataka 1497. The other aspect I\n\nwould like to make a mention that with regard\n\nto search and seizure is also concerned, it is\n\nclear under the special statute in the Act 1957\n\nthat the procedure laid down under\nSection 102\n\nof Cr.P.C. has to be followed in respect of\n\nsearch and seizure and also\nCr.P.C\n. is\n\napplicable even in a case has been registered\n\nunder the special enactments.\n\n33. It is well settled principles of law that if\n\na special statute lays down the procedures, the\n\nlaw laid down under the general statutes shall not\nbe followed.\nIn a situation of this nature, the\n\npolice could carry out investigations in exercise of\n\nthe powers vested with them under\nsection 154\nof\n\nCr.P.C. since the offence is cognizable one and\n\nthis aspect has also been considered by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nJeewan Kumar\n\nRaut\n(supra) in considering the offence in\n\nexercise of its authorization under\nSection\n\n13(3)(iv)\nof TOHO.\nHowever, it is observed while\n\ndoing so, it could exercise such powers which are\n\notherwise vested in it.\n\n34. The Apex Court in the judgment of\n\nState (NCT of Delhi) vs. Sanjay\n(supra), with\n\nregard to offence in respect of\nSection 378\nof IPC\n\nand also the offence in respect of contraventions\n\nof the provisions of the Act 1957, has\n\ncategorically held that both offences are distinct\n\nand different.\n35. A cursory comparison of these two\n\nprovisions with\nSection 378\nof IPC would to go\n\nshow that the ingredients are totally different.\n\nThe contraventions of the terms and conditions of\n\nmining lease, etc. constitutes an offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 21\nof the Act 1957,\n\nwhereas dishonestly taking any movable property\n\nout of the possession of a person without his\n\nconsent constitutes theft. Thus, it is undoubtedly\n\nclear that the ingredients of an offence of theft as\n\ndefined in\nSection 378\nof IPC are totally different\n\nfrom the ingredients of an offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 21(1)\nread with Section 4(1) and\n\n4(1A) of the Mines and Minerals Act.\nIn such a\n\nview of the matter, it is my considered opinion as\n\nheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants Vs. Vimal\n\nKumar Surana\n's (AIR 2011 SC (Cri) 1 case, there\n\ncan well be a prosecution for an offence under\nSection 379\nof IPC as well as under\nSection 21\nof\n\nthe Act 1957 simultaneously and the principles of\n\ndouble jeopardy shall not be a bar for such\n\nsimultaneous prosecution.\n\n36. Now, let us turn to the conditions\n\nrequisite for initiation of proceedings as dealt with\n\nin Chapter XIV of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n.\n\nAn offence under\nSection 379\nof IPC is admittedly\n\ncognizable and, therefore, in respect of theft of\n\nsand from Government land, it will be lawful for\n\nthe police to register a case, investigate the same\n\nand to lay a final report under\nSection 173(2)\nof\n\nthe Code, upon which the jurisdictional\n\nMagistrate will be well within his jurisdiction to\n\ntake cognizance as provided in\nSection 190(1)(b)\nof\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure. To this extent, it\n\nis clear that there is no conflict between the Act\n\n1957 and the\nCr.P.C\n. and thus question of one\noverriding the other does not arise. Therefore, in\n\nsuch cases, where the cases have been registered\n\nonly under the provisions of\nIPC\n, more\n\nparticularly, under\nSection 379\nof IPC in respect\n\nof theft of sand, the question of quashing the FIRs\n\nor any subsequent proceedings does not arise at\n\nall.\n\n37. Now, there are cases before this Court\n\nwith regard to invoking of\nIPC\nSection and also\n\ninvoking of the offence under\nSection 21\nof the Act\n\n1957 and contravention of Rules of KMMC 1994,\n\nthe police not only registered the case under the\n\nIPC\nand also registered the case under the Act\n\n1957. I have already pointed out that the offence\n\ninvoking\nSection 21\nof the Act 1957 is also\n\ncognizable and therefore, the police can register\n\nthe case and investigate in terms of the paragraph\n\n28 of the judgment in Jeewan Kumar Raut as\nheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It is well settled\n\nthat in an occurrence from the offences which are\n\nnon-cognizable in nature, if, cognizable offences\n\nhave also been committed, it is absolutely\n\nnecessary for the police to register a case in\n\nrespect of the entire occurrence and to investigate\n\nthe case. This legal position has been made clear\n\nby\nSection 155(4)\nof the Code. Under Section 190\n\nof the Code, on a police report in respect of the\n\noffences of which some are cognizable and the\n\nothers are non-cognizable, the Magistrate may\n\ntake cognizance. As provided in\nSection 21(6)\nof\n\nthe Act 1957, an offence under sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 21\nis cognizable and therefore, it is lawful\n\nfor a police officer to register a case as provided in\n\nSection 154\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure and\n\nto investigate the same as per the provisions of\n\nthe\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. But, the\n\ndifficulty arises only in the matter of taking\ncognizance.\nSection 22\nof the Act 1957 prohibits\n\ntaking cognizance being taken except upon a\n\ncomplaint in writing made by a person authorized\n\neither by the Central Government or the State\n\nGovernment. If the act of the accused constitutes\n\nexclusively an offence under the Act 1957, it goes\n\nwithout saying that the police officer on\n\ncompleting the investigation, cannot lay a final\n\nreport because, on such report, the court cannot\n\ntake cognizance in view of the bar contained in\n\nSection 22\nof the Act. If the act of the accused\n\nmakes out an offence under\nIPC\nas well as an\n\noffence under\nSection 21\nof the Act 1957, the\n\nregistration of the case under both the\n\nenactments is not illegal and the police can\n\nfurther investigate into such cases and file a final\n\nreport confining to the offence under\nIPC\nalone.\n\nIn respect of the offence under\nSection 21\nof the\n\nAct 1957, it is for an authorized person to file a\ncomplaint after investigation before the\n\njurisdictional Magistrate, upon which, cognizance\n\ncan be taken.\n\n38. But in the cases before this Court, the\n\nconflict is between the Act 1957 and the\nIPC\n.\n\nWhen there is such a conflict between a special\n\nand a general law, indisputably, the special\n\nenactment will prevail over the general law. That\n\nis the reason why this Court inclined to hold that\n\nSection 22\nof the Act 1957 will override\nSection\nof Cr.P.C. and therefore, in respect of offence\n\nunder the Act 1957, cognizance can be taken only\n\non a complaint as provided in\nSection 22\nof the\n\nAct 1957, and not on a police report.\n\n39. Now, I would like to refer to the\n\nNotification issued by the Government of\n\nKarnataka dated 21.01.2014 and vide said\n\nnotification, the government has designated total\nfifteen officers/authorities and the jurisdiction\n\nand concerned departments authorizing the\n\npersons to initiate the proceedings.\n\n40. The other contention of the petitioners'\n\ncounsel is that the Authorized Officer means an\n\nofficer not below the rank of Group 'B' authorized\n\nby the State Government or Commissioner or\n\nDirector of Mines and Geology or Deputy\n\nCommissioner of the District to act for the specific\n\npurpose under these rules. The counsel relying\n\nupon these amendments taken place in 2017 and\n\nthis is with regard to authorized by the State\n\nGovernment for the specific purpose under these\n\nrules and the word used in the\nSection 22\nof the\n\nAct 1957, taking of cognizance upon complaint in\n\nwriting made by a person authorized in this behalf\n\nby the Central Government or the State\n\nGovernment and the notification is issued by the\nState Government by a notification dated\n\n21.01.2014 and under the said notification,\n\nauthorized persons are designated and they are\n\npermitted to initiate the proceedings and this\n\nCourt also discussed with regard to cognizable\n\noffence is taken place under\nSection 154\nof\n\nCr.P.C. The other contention of the petitioners'\n\ncounsel that the\nSection 23B\nof the Act, 1957 with\n\nregard to Power to search, is only by a gazetted\n\nofficer of the Central or a State Government\n\nauthorized by the Central Government or a State\n\nGovernment in case of contravention of provisions\n\nof this Act or rules made thereunder in relation to\n\nsuch mineral is secreted in any place (or vehicle),\n\nhe may search for such mineral, document or\n\nthing and the provisions of\nSection 100\nof Cr.P.C.\n\nshall apply to every search. There is no dispute\n\nwith regard to adding\nSection 23B\nof the Act,\n\n1957, the same is in respect of search is\nconcerned and also on going through\nSection 23B\n\nof the Act, 1957, it is clear that if any mineral is\n\nsecreted in any place or vehicle, the word used is,\n\nhe may search for such mineral and not word is\n\nemployed as he shall but the word used is he may,\n\nthat too in respect of where the mineral is\n\nsecreted and specific that the provisions of\n\nSection 100\nof Cr.P.C. shall apply for such search\n\nand hence, there cannot be a bar to other officer\n\nto make search when a cognizable office is taken\n\nplace and the notification dated 21.01.2014 and\n\nalso specifically provides the power to conduct the\n\nauthorized persons to initiate the proceedings and\n\nhence, the contention of the petitioners' counsel\n\ncannot be accepted.\n\n41. Regarding filing of complaint by\n\nauthorized person is concerned, while filing\n\nprivate complaint, law permits only to file\ncomplaint once and there is no provision to file\n\nsupplementary complaint and if Court is taking\n\ncognizance on police report, there is a provision\n\nunder\nSection 173(8)\nof Cr.P.C. and additional\n\ncharge sheet can be filed and the same can be\n\nconsidered, but no provision if it is on private\n\ncomplaint. Hence, it is impossible to file the\n\ncomplaint within 24 hours and hence, the\n\nAuthorized Officer as per the notification can\n\ninitiate the proceedings by setting the law in\n\nmotion against the persons who indulged in\n\ncommission of the offence under the general law\n\nand special law which are cognizable one and also\n\nunder Section 154 of Cr.P.C.\n\n42. This Court would also rely upon the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nState\n\nof Karnataka Vs. Linganagoud\netc., wherein it\n\nis categorically held that:\n\"taking of cognizance is only after completion\n\nof the investigation and when such principle is\n\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court that, stage of taking\n\ncognizance will arise only after investigation is\n\ncompleted and there is no bar to the investigation\n\nbeing carried out by the Lokayukta Police on the\n\ncomplaint in question particularly when the\n\nallegations include offence under the\nPrevention of\n\nCorruption Act, 1988\n. While saying so, set-aside\n\nthe impugned order passed by this Court\n\nquashing of the initiation of the proceedings by\n\nthe Police\".\n\n43. This Court has already discussed in\n\ndetail with regard to the provisions of Code under\n\nSection 154\nof Cr.P.C. The police officer is the\n\nauthorized officer to initiate the proceedings when\n\na cognizable offence is taken place and also\n\npointed out that under\nSection 21(6)\nof the Act\n1957, the offence is cognizable. If the offences\n\nunder the special enactments are cognizable\n\noffences, the police can register a case and\n\ninvestigate the matter, but the bar is with regard\n\nto filing of final report and there is categorical bar\n\nunder\nSection 22\nof the Act 1957 for taking\n\ncognizance by the Court and the Court can take\n\nonly cognizance based on the complaint filed by\n\nthe authorized person and there is no any bar to\n\ninvestigate the matter when the cognizable offence\n\nhas been taken place by the police officer, bar is\n\nonly with regard to filing of final report and it is\n\nmade clear that the police officer can file final\n\nreport in respect of offence under\nSection 379\nof\n\nIPC and in view of the bar as envisaged under\n\nSection 22\nof the Act 1957 and special enactment,\n\nthe complaint has to be filed by the authorized\n\nperson and Court can take cognizance only on the\n\ncomplaint filed by the authorized person. Hence,\nit is clear that the police can investigate the\n\nmatter if cognizable offence is taken place\n\nirrespective of penal provisions whether under the\n\nspecial enactment or general law and the same\n\ncan be made use of by the authorized person and\n\nstage of cognizance can only be taken after\n\ncompletion of the investigation as held by the\n\nApex Court, there cannot be any bar to the Police\n\nOfficer to initiate the proceedings and enquire\n\ninto the matter. In this regard, I would also like\n\nto refer the judgment of the Division Bench of\n\nthe Madras High Court reported in 2012\n\nCrl.L.J. 1705, similar question was arisen and\n\nthe matter was referred to the Division Bench and\n\nthe Division Bench also held that the Police\n\nOfficer can initiate the proceedings and\n\ninvestigate the matter but cannot file final report\n\nfor the offence punishable in respect of special\n\nenactments.\n44. In view of the discussions made above,\n\nit is clear that the registration of the FIR is only\n\nto set the law in motion and if it is cognizable\n\noffence,\nSection 154\ncome into the aid of police\n\nofficer to register the case. As I have already held\n\nthat\nSection 21(6)\nof the Act 1957, offence under\n\nSection 21(1)\nis cognizable and therefore, it is\n\nlawful for the police officer to register a case as\n\nprovided under\nSection 154\nof Cr.P.C. and\n\ninvestigate the same as per the provisions of\n\nCr.P.C\n. with respect to search and seizure under\n\nSection 102\nof Cr.P.C. and under Rule 43 sub\n\nclause (5) to (8) as Amended and only difficulty\n\narises only in taking cognizance in view of the bar\n\nunder\nSection 22\nof the Act 1957, which prohibits\n\ntaking cognizance except upon a complaint. In\n\nview of the same, if an act of the accused\n\nconstitutes offences under\nIPC\nas well as the\n\nprovisions of the Act 1957, the registration of a\ncase both under the provisions of\nIPC and the Act\n\n1957 is not illegal and the police may proceed\n\nwith the investigation. However, the police shall\n\nfile a police report only in respect of the offences\n\npunishable under the\nIPC\nand in respect of the\n\nAct 1957, the authorized person can file a\n\nseparate complaint. In any event, if the police\n\nofficer, files a final report in respect of the\n\noffences under\nIPC\nas well as under\nSection 21\nof\n\nthe Act 1957, the Magistrate may take cognizance\n\nof the offences under\nIPC\nalone and proceed with\n\nthe trial and not for the offence under\nSection 21\n\nof the Act. If the charge sheet filed for offence\n\nunder the\nMMDR Act\nand Rules, the Courts can\n\npermit the Authorised persons to file separate\n\ncomplaint before the Magistrate and Court can\n\ntake cognizance under\nSection 22\nof the MMDR\n\nAct 1957.\n45. In respect of offences under the Act\n\n1957, the Court shall take cognizance only on a\n\ncomplaint filed by a person authorized in that\n\nbehalf by the Central Government or State\n\nGovernment and not on a police report. Hence, I\n\nam of the view that if any cognizable offence is\n\ntaken place irrespective of whether the offences\n\nunder the General Act or Special enactment,\n\nunder\nSection 154\nof Cr.P.C., the Police Officer\n\nwho is authorized person is bound to register the\n\ncase and proceed with the investigation and\n\nhence, the question of quashing of registering the\n\ncases for both the Act and the special enactment\n\ndoes not arise and the same is only setting law in\n\nmotion and for investigation, the bar is specific\n\nunder\nSection 22\nof the Act 1957 is only for\n\ntaking cognizance in respect of offences under the\n\nspecial enactment. Hence, the contention of the\n\npetitioners who have urged in all the petitions\nthat there cannot be any registration of the case\n\nagainst both the offences cannot be accepted.\n\nThe cases registered by the police for the\n\nrespective offences as FIR cannot be quashed and\n\nthe cases which are registered as CC cases based\n\non the complaint as mentioned under\nSection 22\n\nof the Special Act and hence, the Court has taken\n\nthe cognizance based on the complaint.\n\n46. In view of the discussions made above,\n\nthis Court pass the following:\n\nORDER\n\ni) Criminal PetitionNos.101274 of 2018,\n102059 of 2018, 102060 of 2018,\n102061 of 2018, 102062 of 2018 and\n102126 of 2018 are dismissed.\n\nii) Criminal Petition Nos.101815 of\n2018, 101986 of 2018, 102023 of\n2018, 102107 of 2018, 102122 of\n2018 and 102281 of 2018 are\ndismissed since those crimes are\nregistered and based on the\n\ncomplaint, the cognizance is taken in\nrespect of the offences under the\n\nMMDR Act\nand Rules.\n\niii) In view of disposal of the petitions,\npending interlocutory applications, if\nany, do not survive for consideration,\nhence, they are also disposed of.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nSh/Mrk/JTR",
