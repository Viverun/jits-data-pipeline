During the course of investigation, petitioner was\n\narrested on 23.10.2023 and remanded to judicial custody. Bail\n\napplication filed by the petitioner before the jurisdictional\n\n-3-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:29916\n\nCRL.P No. 3155 of 2024\n\nSessions Court in Crl.Misc.No.1640/2023 was dismissed on\n\n10.11.2023.

The said criminal petition was dismissed\n\nas withdrawn with liberty to the petitioner to file fresh petition\n\nafter charge sheet is filed. Hence, petitioner is before this\n\nCourt in this successive bail application, after filing of charge\n\nsheet.\n\n5. Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\nthough F.I.R. was registered for the offences punishable under\n\n143, 147, 498-A, 302, 304B, 149 of\nIPC\nand\nSections 3\n&\nof\n\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961, charge sheet is now filed for the\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\nIPC and\n\nSections 3\n&\nof Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.

Accordingly, he prays to allow the petition.\n\n6. Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the bail\n\npetition and submits that, death has occurred within a span of\n\none year from the date of marriage. Therefore, there is a\n\npresumption as against the accused persons. In the first\n\n-4-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:29916\n\nCRL.P No. 3155 of 2024\n\ninformation, there are allegations with regard to the\n\nharassment of the deceased and she was being abused and\n\nassaulted in her matrimonial house. He accordingly, prays to\n\ndismiss the petition.\n\n7. Marriage of the deceased - daughter of the first\n\ninformant was solemnized with the petitioner herein on\n\n27.01.2023. In the first information, it is alleged that at the\n\ntime of marriage as per the demand made by the accused, the\n\nfamily members of deceased had given dowry and inspite of the\n\nsame, there was demand for payment of additional dowry and\n\nin this background Vinutha was harassed in her matrimonial\n\nhouse. It is alleged in the first information that petitioner\n\nherein had assaulted Vinutha with sickle on her head, but no\n\ncompliant was lodged since uncle of the petitioner had assured\n\nthat he would advice the petitioner. The dead body of\n\ndeceased-Vinutha was found in a lake in Chelur, Tumakuru\n\nDistrict. On the basis of the first information submitted, initially\n\nF.I.R. was registered against accused persons invoking\nSections\nand\n304B\nof IPC amongst other offences. After\n\ninvestigation, charge sheet has been now filed for offence\n\npunishable under\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\nof IPC and Sections\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:29916\n\nCRL.P No. 3155 of 2024\n\n3 & 4 of\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n. The offence under\n\nSection 302\nof IPC is dropped in the charge sheet. As per the\n\npostmortem report, death of deceased has occurred as a result\n\nof asphyxia due to drowning. Petitioner who has no criminal\n\nantecedents is in custody from 23.10.2023. Undisputedly all\n\nthe other accused are already enlarged on bail. Allegations\n\nagainst the petitioner is required to be proved in a full fledged\n\ntrial.
