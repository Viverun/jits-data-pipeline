Petitioners were initially appointed as Junior\n\nEngineers (Civil) in the Department of Public Works,\n\nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh on 8.9.1992 and\n\n16.5.1988, respectively. Petitioner No.1 qualified\n\nof\nBachelor of Engineering Course and petitioner No.2\n\nqualified AMIE course during service. Petitioner No.1\nrt\nalso completed his M.E. (Highway Engineering) Couse\n\nin March, 2003.\n\n3. Both the petitioners were promoted as\n\nAssistant Engineers (Civil) w.e.f. December, 2006.\n\nPetitioner No.1 was assigned the charge of Executive\n\nEngineer (Civil) in October 2016 and was substantially\n\npromoted to the said post in March, 2017. Petitioner\n\nNo.2 was promoted as Executive Engineer (Civil) in\n\nAugust, 2016.\n\n4. The case as set-up by the petitioners is that\n\ntill 30.05.2002, the service conditions to the post of\n\nAssistant Engineer (Civil) were governed by the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nRecruitment and Promotion Rules framed in the year\n\n1995. Amended Recruitment and Promotion Rules were\n\nnotified w.e.f. 01.06.2002. In 1995 Rules, the vacancy-\n\n.\n\nbased roster was maintained, whereas, on promulgation\n\nof 2002 Rules, the post-based roster was adopted.\n\n5. As per the petitioners, 21 clear cut vacancies\n\nof Assistant Engineers were available in April 2002 and\n\nof\n23 vacancies were anticipated upto 31.12.2002 due to\n\nretirement/promotion. In this manner, total 44 number\nrt\nof vacancies were available in the year 2002 for which\n\nDPC was to be convened. By application of vacancy-\n\nbased roster, two posts fell to the quota to which the\n\npetitioners belonged. The DPC was however convened\n\non 30.5.2003 and the promotions were made on the\n\nbasis of 2002 Rules by ignoring the vacancy position as\n\nin April 2002 i.e. before promulgation of 2002 Rules.\n\n6. It has further been submitted on behalf of the\n\npetitioners that review DPC was convened by the\n\nrespondent-department in 2013 in compliance to the\n\norders passed by this Court in CWP No. 1358 of 2008\n\ntitled\nS.S. Kutlehria and others Vs State of H.P and\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nothers\nand at that juncture also the case of the\n\npetitioners was not considered for review.\n\n7. The petitioners made repeated\n\n.\n\nrepresentations. The Department was convinced with\n\nthe injustice meted out to the petitioners and had\n\nwithheld its final decision on the representation of the\n\npetitioners on account of the various matters pending\n\nof\nbefore this Court. It is further submitted that even after\n\nthe embargo placed on the promotions of Assistant\nrt\nEngineers by this Court was lifted, justice was not done\n\nto the petitioners, rather the representation of petitioner\n\nNo.1, Annexure P-10, has been rejected on the ground\n\nthat the claim of the petitioner was stalled in case the\n\nsettled position was tinkered, it will open gates for\n\nunavoidable litigation and will create unrest and chaos\n\nin the service.\n\n8. The respondent in its reply has supported its\n\naction on the ground that the petitioners have\n\napproached this Court after a period of more than 15\n\nyears and their claim is barred by principle of delay and\n\nlaches. It is submitted that the petitioners had not\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\npreferred any representation whatsoever, even the\n\nrepresentation of petitioner No.1 was submitted at a\n\nbelated stage. The passing of order Annexure P-10 has\n\n.\n\nbeen justified on the ground that the representation of\n\npetitioner No.1 was not only devoid of merits, but was\n\nalso time barred.\n\n9.\nIn rejoinder, the petitioners have submitted\n\nof\nthat the seniority list of Assistant Engineers (Civil) in the\n\nDepartment of Public Works has been finalized and\nrt\ncirculated only recently after the judgment passed by\n\nthis Court on 24.4.2023 in CWP No.5718 of 2022 titled\n\nas\nAnkush Jamwal and others vs. State of H.P. and\n\nanother\nand hence, there is no question of unsettling\n\nthe seniority position. As per petitioners, the grant of\n\npromotion to the petitioners as Assistant Engineers\n\nw.e.f. 2002 will not change the equation in any manner.\n\n10. I have heard learned counsel for the parties\n\nand have also gone through the records of the case\n\ncarefully.\n\n11. The petitioners have based their claim on the\n\nprinciple of \"old post old rules\" as enunciated in\nY.V.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nRangaiah vs. J. Sreenivasa Rao\n, (1983) (3) SCC 284.\n\nHowever, the perception has undergone a sea change.\n\nIn\nUnion of India & others vs. Krishna Kumar\n&\n\n.\n\nOthers, Civil Appeal No.672 of 2019, reported in (2019)\n\n1 SCR 982, after discussing the fruition of law on the\n\nsubject from\nY.V. Rangiah\n(supra),\nDeepak Agarwal\n\nvs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n(\n2011) 6 SCC 725 and\n\nof\nState of Tripura vs. Nikhil Ranjan Chakraborty\n,\n\n(2017) 3 SCC 646, it has been held as under:\n\nrt \"It is well-settled that there is no vested right to\npromotion, but a right to be considered for promotion\n\nin accordance with the Rules which prevail on the date\non which consideration for promotion takes place. This\nCourt has held that there is no rule of universal\napplication to the effect that vacancies must\nnecessarily be filled in on the basis of the law which\n\nexisted on the date when they arose. The decision of\nthis Court in\nY.V. Rangaiah vs. Sreenivasa Rao\nhas\nbeen construed in subsequent decisions as a case\nwhere the applicable Rules required the process of\n\npromotion or selection to be completed within a\nstipulated time frame.\n\nHence, it has been held in\nH.S.\n\nGrewal vs. Union of India\nthat the creation of an\nintermediate post would not amount to an interference\nwith the vested right to promotion.\n\nOnce the structure of Assam Rifles underwent a\nchange following the creation of the intermediate post\nof Warrant Officer, persons holding the post of\nHavildar would be considered for promotion to the\npost of Warrant Officer. The intermediate post of\nWarrant Officer was created as a result of the\nrestructuring exercise. The High Court was in error in\npostulating that vacancies which arose prior to the\namendment of the Recruitment Rules would\nnecessarily be governed by the Rules which existed at\nthe time of the occurrence of the vacancies. As the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\ndecided cases noted earlier indicate, there is no such\nrule of absolute or universal application. The entire\nbasis of the decision of the High Court was that those\nwho were recruited prior to the restructuring exercise\nand were holding the post of Havildars had acquired\na vested right of promotion to the post of Naib\n\n.\n\nSubedar. This does not reflect the correct position in\n\nlaw. The right is to be considered for promotion in\naccordance with the Rules as they exist when the\nexercise is carried out for promotion.\n\n12. Recently a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nState of Himachal Pradesh and\n\nof\nothers vs. Raj Kumar and others\n, (2023) 3 SCC 773\n\nhas held as under:\n\nrt\n\"14. We have taken note of the fact that there are a\nlarge number of decisions that have either followed\n\nthe principle in Rangaiah or have distinguished it. The\nprinciple in\nRangaiah\n's case has given rise to a\nnumber of decisions, most of them have disapplied\nRangaiah and have in fact, watered-down the\nprinciple while distinguishing it. In this view of the\n\nmatter, and for clarity and certainty, it is necessary\nfor us to review the subject and restate the principle\nin simple and clear terms.\n\n15. We will first examine the principle\nlaid down in\n\nRangaiah itself. We will verify it in the context of the\n\nconstitutional position provided in Chapter XIV of the\nConstitution relating to services under the State.\nWe\nwill thereafter examine the decisions that followed\nRangaiah and also those that have distinguished it.\n\nAfter restating the principle, we will apply it to the\nfacts of the case for arriving at our decision.\n\nXXX XXX XXX\n\n28. In view of the above principles, flowing from the\nconstitutional status of a person in employment with\nthe State, we have no hesitation in holding that the\nobservations in Rangaiah that posts which fell vacant\nprior to the amendment of Rules would be governed\nby old Rules and not by new Rules do not reflect the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\ncorrect position of law. We have already explained\nthat the Syed Khalid Rizivi V Union of India 1993\nSupp (3) SCC 575 ; Hardev Singh v Union of India\n2011(10) SCC 121 Rajasthan Public Service\nCommission v. Chanan Ram, (1998) 4 SCC\n\n202. Status of a Government employee involves a\n\n.\n\nrelationship governed exclusively by rules and that\n\nthere are no rights outside these rules that govern the\nservices. Further, the Court in\nRangaiah\n's case has\nnot justified its observation by locating such a right on\nany principle or on the basis of the new Rules.28 As\n\nthere are a large number of judgments which followed\nRangaiah under the assumption that an overarching\nprinciple has been\nlaid down in\nRangaiah, we have to\nnecessarily examine the cases that followed\n\nof\nRangaiah. We will now examine how subsequent\ndecisions understood, applied or distinguished\nRangaiah.\n\nrt XXX XXX XXX\n\n84. The decision in\nDeepak Agarwal\n(supra) is a\ncomplete departure from the principle in Rangaiah, in\n\nas much as the Court has held that a candidate has a\nright to be considered in the light of the existing rule.\nThat is the rule in force on the date the consideration\ntakes place.\n\nThis enunciation is followed in many\nsubsequent decisions including that of\nUnion of India\n\nv. Krishna Kumar\n(supra). In fact, in Krishna Kumar\nCourt held that there is only a \"right to be considered\nfor promotion in accordance with rules which prevail\non the date on which consideration for promotion take\n\nplace.\"\n\n85. The consistent findings in these fifteen decisions\nthat\nRangaiah\n's case must be seen in the context of\nits own facts, coupled with the declarations therein\nthat there is no rule of universal application to the\n\neffect that vacancies must necessarily be filled on the\nbasis of rules which existed on the date which they\narose, compels us to conclude that the decision in\nRangaiah is impliedly overruled. However, as there is\nno declaration of law to this effect, it continues to be\ncited as a precedent and this Court has been\ndistinguishing it on some ground or the other, as we\nhave indicated hereinabove. For clarity and certainty,\nit is, therefore, necessary for us to hold;\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n85.1. The statement in\nY.V. Rangaiah v. J. Sreenivasa\nRao\nthat, \"the vacancies which occurred prior to the\namended rules would be governed by the old rules\nand not by the amended rules\", does not reflect the\ncorrect proposition of law governing services under the\nUnion and the States under part XIV of the\n\n.\n\nConstitution. It is hereby overruled.\n\n85.2. The rights and obligations of persons serving\nthe Union and the States are to be sourced from the\nrules governing the services.\"\n\n13. Thus, Y.V. Rangaiah, stands overruled and\n\nit is well settled that the Government servant has no\n\nof\nright to seek promotion and, therefore, the rules\n\nprevalent at the time of his consideration for promotion\nrt\nshall prevail.\n\n14. In the facts of the case in hand, the DPC was\n\nconvened on 31.5.2003 when 2002 Recruitment and\n\nPromotion Rules were in vogue. Admittedly, till the\n\navailability of 1995 Rules, the candidature of\n\nincumbents was not considered for promotion to the\n\npost of Assistant Engineer (Civil). That being so, the\n\nclaim of petitioners for considering them for promotion\n\nto the post of Assistant Engineer (Civil) for the year\n\n2002, is not tenable.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n15. Further, vide impugned Annexure P-10, the\n\nrepresentation of petitioner No.1 has been rejected\n\nprimarily on the ground that the same was belated\n\n.\n\nattempt and in case after a long lapse of time the\n\nseniority positions are disturbed, the entire services will\n\nbe affected.\n\nof\n\n16. Noticeably, petitioner No.2 has not made any\n\nrepresentation at any stage. There is no individual\nrt\nrepresentation of petitioner No. 2 on record. In the case\n\nof petitioner No.1 also, the first representation filed by\n\nhim was in the year 2014. Another representation was\n\nfiled by petitioner No.1 in 2021.\n\n17. The DPC was held on 31.5.2003 when the\n\npetitioners were denied their alleged right of\n\nconsideration against vacancies available in the year\n\n2002. Petitioners did not raise any grievance at that\n\nstage. In 2006, petitioners were promoted as Assistant\n\nEngineers (Civil), and they accepted such promotion\n\nwithout any reservation. Thereafter, till 2014, no issue\n\nwas raised by the petitioners and in 2014 also, it was\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\npetitioner No.1, who had submitted his first\n\nrepresentation. Thereafter, second representation was\n\nfiled by him in the year 2021, which was rejected vide\n\n.\n\nimpugned Annexure P-10. In these circumstances, the\n\nclaim of the petitioners is stale. The delay and laches\n\nstare at their face.\n\nof\n\n18.\nIn\nState of Uttaranchal and another vs.\n\nShiv Charan Singh Bhandari and others\n(2013) 12\nrt\nSCC 179, it has been held as under:\n\n\"17.\nIn\nC. Jacob vs. Director of Geology and Mining\n\n(2008) 10 SCC 115, a two-Judge Bench was dealing\nwith the concept of representations and the directions\n\nissued by the court or tribunal to consider the\nrepresentations and the challenge to the said rejection\nthereafter. In that context, the court has expressed\n\nthus: (SCC p.123, para 10)\n\n\"10. Every representation to the Government for\nrelief, may not be replied on merits.\n\nRepresentations relating to matters which have\n\nbecome stale or barred by limitation, can be\nrejected on that ground alone, without\nexamining the merits of the claim. In regard to\nrepresentations unrelated to the Department,\nthe reply may be only to inform that the matter\ndid not concern the Department or to inform the\nappropriate Department. Representations with\nincomplete particulars may be replied by\nseeking relevant particulars. The replies to such\nrepresentations, cannot furnish a fresh cause of\naction or revive a stale or dead claim.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\n18.\nIn\nUnion of India and others v. M.K. Sarkar\n, (2010)\n2 SCC 59, this Court, after referring to\nC. Jacob\n(supra)\nhas ruled that (SCC p.66, para 15)\n\n\"15. When a belated representation in regard to\n\n.\n\na \"stale\" or \"dead\" issue/dispute is considered\n\nand decided, in compliance with a direction by\nthe court/tribunal to do so, the date of such\ndecision cannot be considered as furnishing a\n\nfresh cause of action for reviving the \"dead\"\nissue or time-barred dispute. The issue of\nlimitation or delay and laches should be\nconsidered with reference to the original cause\nof action and not with reference to the date on\n\nof\nwhich an order is passed in compliance with a\ncourt's direction. Neither a court's direction to\nconsider a representation issued without\nexamining the merits, nor a decision given in\nrt compliance with such direction, will extend the\nlimitation, or erase the delay and laches.\n\n28. Remaining oblivious to the factum of delay and\nlaches and granting relief is contrary to all settled\nprinciples and even would not remotely attract the\nconcept of discretion. We may hasten to add that the\n\nsame may not be applicable in all circumstances\nwhere certain categories of fundamental rights are\n\ninfringed. But, a stale claim of getting promotional\nbenefits definitely should not have been entertained\n\nby the tribunal and accepted by the High Court.\"\n\n19.\nIn\nUnion of India and others vs. C. Girija\n\nand others\n(2019) 15 SCC 633, it has been held as\n\nunder:\n\n\"16. This Court had occasion to consider the question\nof cause of action in reference to grievances pertaining\nto service matters. This Court in\nC. Jacob Vs. Director\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nof Geology and Mining and Another\n, (2008) 10 SCC\n115 had occasion to consider the case where an\nemployee was terminated and after decades, he filed\na representation, which was decided. After decision of\n\n.\n\nthe representation, he filed an O.A. in the Tribunal,\n\nwhich was entertained and order was passed. In the\nabove context, in paragraph No.9, following has been\n\nheld: (SCC pp. 122-23)\n\n\"9. The courts/tribunals proceed on the\nassumption, that every citizen deserves a reply\n\nof\nto his representation. Secondly, they assume\nthat a mere direction to consider and dispose\nof the representation does not involve any\n\"decision\" on rights and obligations of parties.\nrt Little do they realise the consequences of such\na direction to \"consider\". If the representation\nis considered and accepted, the ex-employee\ngets a relief, which he would not have got on\n\naccount of the long delay, all by reason of the\ndirection to \"consider\". If the representation is\nconsidered and rejected, the ex-employee files\nan application/writ petition, not with reference\nto the original cause of action of 1982, but by\n\ntreating the rejection of the representation\ngiven in 2000, as the cause of action. A prayer\nis made for quashing the rejection of\nrepresentation and for grant of the relief\n\nclaimed in the representation. The\ntribunals/High Courts routinely entertain such\n\napplications/petitions ignoring the huge delay\npreceding the representation, and proceed to\nexamine the claim on merits and grant relief. In\nthis manner, the bar of limitation or the laches\n\ngets obliterated or ignored.\"\n\n17. This Court again in\nUnion of India and Others Vs.\nM.K. Sarkar\n, (2010) 2 SCC 59 on belated\nrepresentation laid down following, which is\nextracted below: (SCC p.66, para 15)\n\n\"15. When a belated representation in regard\nto a \"stale\" or \"dead\" issue/dispute is\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nconsidered and decided, in compliance with a\ndirection by the court/tribunal to do so, the\ndate of such decision cannot be considered as\nfurnishing a fresh cause of action for reviving\nthe \"dead\" issue or time-barred dispute.

Neither a\ncourt's direction to consider a representation\n\nissued without examining the merits, nor a\ndecision given in compliance with such\ndirection, will extend the limitation, or erase\nthe delay and laches.\"\n\nof\n\n18. Again, this Court in\nState of Uttaranchal and\nAnother Vs. Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and Others\n,\n(2013) 12 SCC 179 had occasion to consider question\nrt\nof delay in challenging the promotion. The\nCourt\nfurther held\nthat representations relating to a\n\nstale claim or dead grievance does not give rise to a\nfresh cause of action. In paras 19 and 23, following\nwas laid down: (SCC pp. 184-85)\n\n\"19. From the aforesaid authorities it is clear\nas crystal that even if the court or tribunal\ndirects for consideration of representations\n\nrelating to a stale claim or dead grievance it\ndoes not give rise to a fresh cause of action.\n\nThe dead cause of action cannot rise like a\nphoenix. Similarly, a mere submission of\nrepresentation to the competent authority\ndoes not arrest time.\n\n23.\nIn\nState of T.N. v. Seshachalam\n, (2007) 10\nSCC 137, this Court, testing the equality\nclause on the bedrock of delay and laches\npertaining to grant of service benefit, has\nruled thus: (SCC p. 145, para 16)\n\n\"16. ... filing of representations alone\nwould not save the period of limitation.\nDelay or laches is a relevant factor for a\ncourt of law to determine the question as\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nto whether the claim made by an\napplicant deserves consideration.

This Court referring to an earlier judgment\nin\nP.S. Sadasivaswamy Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n,\n(1975) 1 SCC 152 noticed that a person aggrieved\n\nof\nby an order of promoting a junior over his head\nshould approach the Court at least within six months\nor at the most a year of such promotion. In\nrt\nParagraph No. 26 and 28, following was laid down:\n\n(\nShiv Charan Singh Bhandari\ncase, SCC pp. 185-86)\n\n\"26.\n\nPresently, sitting in a time machine, we\nmay refer to a two-Judge Bench decision\nin\nP.S. Sadasivaswamy v. State of T.N.\n,\n(1975) 1 SCC 152, wherein it has been laid\n\ndown that: (SCC p. 154, para 2)\n\n\"2. ... A person aggrieved by an order of\npromoting a junior over his head should\n\napproach the Court at least within six\nmonths or at the most a year of such\n\npromotion.

But it would be a\nsound and wise exercise of discretion\nfor the courts to refuse to exercise their\nextraordinary powers under\nArticle\nin the case of persons who do not\napproach it expeditiously for relief and\nwho stand by and allow things to\nhappen and then approach the Court to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nput forward stale claims and try to\nunsettle settled matters.\"\n\n* * *\n\n28.

We may hasten to add that the\nsame may not be applicable in all\ncircumstances where certain categories of\nfundamental rights are infringed. But, a stale\n\nclaim of getting promotional benefits\ndefinitely should not have been entertained\nby the Tribunal and accepted by the High\nCourt.\"\n\nof\n\n20. Recently, in\nState of Uttar Pradesh vs.\n\nRajmati Singh\n(2022) SCC Online 1785, it has been\nrt\nheld as under:\n\n\"18.\nIn \"\nUnion of India v. Tarsem Singh\n\" (2008) 8\nSCC 652, this Court summarized the settled\n\nprinciples in the following manner:--\n\n\"7. To summarise, normally, a belated service\nrelated claim will be rejected on the ground of\n\ndelay and laches (where remedy is sought is\nsought by filing a writ petition) or limitation\n\n(where remedy is sought by an application to\nthe Administrative Tribunal). One of the\nexceptions to the said rule is cases relating to\na continuing wrong. Where a service related\n\nclaim is based on a continuing wrong, relief\ncan be granted even if there is a long delay in\nseeking remedy, with reference to the date on\nwhich the continuing wrong commenced, if\nsuch continuing wrong creates a continuing\nsource of injury. But there is an exception to the\nexception. If the grievance is in respect of any\norder or administrative decision which related\nto or affected several others also, and if the\nreopening of the issue would affect the settled\nrights of third parties, then the claim will not be\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nentertained. For example, if the issue relates to\npayment or refixation of pay or pension, relief\nmay be granted in spite of delay as it does not\naffect the rights of third parties. But if the claim\ninvolved issues relating to seniority or\npromotion, etc., affecting others, delay would\n\n.\n\nrender the claim stale and doctrine of\n\nlaches/limitation will be applied. Insofar as\nthe consequential relief of recovery of arrears\nfor a past period is concerned, the principles\nrelating to recurring/successive wrongs will\n\napply. As a consequence, the High Courts will\nrestrict the consequential relief relating to\narrears normally to a period of three years\nprior to the date of filing of the writ petition.\"\n\nof\n\n19. Close to the facts of this case, in \"\nC. Jacob v.\nDirector of Geology and Mining\n\" (2008) 10 SCC\n115, this Court, having found that the employee\nrt\nsuddenly brought up a challenge to the order of\n\ntermination of his services after 20 years and\nclaimed all consequential benefits, held that the\nrelief sought for was inadmissible. The legal\n\nposition in this regard was laid out in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\"10. Every representation of the Government\nfor relief, may not be applied on merits.\nRepresentations relating to matters which\n\nhave become stale or barred by limitation, can\nbe rejected on that ground alone, without\nexamining the merits of the claim. In regard to\n\nrepresentations unrelated to the Department,\nthe reply may be only to inform that the matter\ndid not concern the Department or to inform\nthe appropriate Department. Representations\nwith incomplete particulars may be replied by\nseeking relevant particulars. The replies to\nsuch representations, cannot furnish a fresh\ncause of action or revive a stale or dead claim.\n\n11. When a decision is issued by a\ncourt/tribunal to consider or deal with the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nrepresentation, usually the directee (person\ndirected) examines the matter on merits, being\nunder the impression that failure to do so may\namount to disobedience. When an order is\npassed considering and rejecting the claim or\nrepresentation, in compliance with direction of\n\n.\n\nthe court or tribunal, such an order does not\n\nrevive the stale claim, nor amount to some\nkind of \"acknowledgement of a jural\nrelationship\" to give rise to a fresh cause of\naction.\n\n12. When a government abandons service to\ntake alternative employment or to attend to\npersonal affairs, and does not bother to send\n\nof\nany letter seeking leave or letter of resignation\nor letter of voluntary retirement, and the\nrecords do not show that he is treated as\nbeing in service, he cannot after two decades,\nrepresent that he should be taken back to\nrt\nduty. Nor can such employee be treated as\nhaving continued in service, thereby deeming\nthe entire period as qualifying service for the\n\npurpose of pension. That will be a travesty of\njustice.\n\n13. Where an employee unauthorisedly\nabsents himself and suddenly appears\n\nafter 20 years and demands that he\nshould be taken back and approaches the\ncourt, the department naturally will not or\n\nmay not have any record relating to the\nemployee at that distance of time. In such\ncases, when the employer fails to produce\n\nthe records of the enquiry and the order of\ndismissal/removal, court cannot draw an\nadverse inference against the employer for\n\nnot producing records, nor direct\nreinstatement with back wages for 20\nyears, ignoring the cessation of service or\nthe lucrative alternative employment of the\nemployee. Misplaced sympathy in such\nmatters will encourage discipline, lead to\nunjust enrichment of the employee at fault\nand result in drain of public exchequer.\nMany a time there is also no application of\nmind as to the extent of financial burden,\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nas a result of a routine order for back\nwages.\"\n\n21. The aforesaid enunciation is clear and\n\ncategoric. The belated representation on behalf of\n\n.\n\npetitioner No.1, that too, after about 12 years will not\n\ncreate a fresh cause of action in favour of the\n\npetitioners.\n\nof\n\n22. It has been contended on behalf of the\n\npetitioners that the matters relating to seniority of\nrt\nAssistant Engineers (Civil) in the department of Public\n\nWorks, were pending before this Court. It was in the\n\nyear 2013 that review DPC was convened. It was\n\nthereafter that petitioner No.1 had submitted his\n\nrepresentation. The explanation rendered on behalf of\n\npetitioners does not appeal to reason. Even if, litigation\n\nwith respect to seniority of Assistant Engineers (Civil)\n\nwas pending, it would not have been an impediment for\n\nthe petitioners to have espoused their own cause, which\n\nprimarily related to the right of consideration for\n\npromotion against the vacancies available under 'Old\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS\nRules'. The seniority would have been an essential\n\nconsequence only.\n\n.\n\n23. Petitioners have also submitted that the\n\nrespondent had recognised their right to be promoted\n\nw.e.f. 2002. Reliance has been placed on office notes\n\ndealing with the representation of the petitioner No.1\n\nof\nand others. I have gone through the contents of office\n\nnotes as relied upon by the petitioners but in my\nrt\nconsidered view the petitioners still cannot succeed for\n\nthe reasons firstly that there was no categoric admission\n\nand secondly office recommendation(s) cannot bind the\n\nemployer more particularly when such\n\nrecommendation(s) are against law.\n\n24. In light of above discussion, there is no merit\n\nin the instant petition and the same is accordingly\n\ndismissed, so also the pending miscellaneous\n\napplication(s) if any.\n\n(Satyen Vaidya)\nJudge\n16th September, 2023\n(GR)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 16/09/2023 20:35:19 :::CIS",
