For the sake of brevity, the facts of \nWPMB\n\nNo. 75 of 2023 Babu Ram Kashyap Vs. Canara Bank\n\n(Erstwhile Syndicate Bank\n) are being taken-up for\n\nconsideration.\n\n 5\n\n 3. The petitioner has challenged the order dated\n\n29.11.2021 passed by the Appellate Authority / Deputy\n\nChief Labour Commissioner (Central), Dehradun under\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n (hereinafter referred to\n\nas the PG Act).\n\n4. The petitioner preferred a claim for grant of\n\nService Gratuity after seeking VRS on 10.11.2014 in\n\nterms of the Bank after completing active service of 36\n\nyears 3 months and 12 days, but his claim for gratuity\n\nwas not decided and he approached the Controlling\n\nAuthority for issuing appropriate direction to the Bank\n\nfor deciding the claim. The Bank decided the claim vide\n\norder dated 06.05.2019 (Annexure PA-1) and an\n\namount of Rs. 11,87,100.00 (Rs. Eleven Lacs Eighty\n\nSeven Thousand One Hundred Only) was granted as\n\nthe Service Gratuity. It was stated that it has been\n\ncalculated as per Syndicate Bank Officers Service\n\nRegulations, 1979 (for short \"SBOSR\"). The calculation\n\nof the gratuity has been done by observing in the order\n\ndated 06.05.2019 as under:-\n\n \"For purpose of calculating Gratuity as per\n Syndicate Bank Officers Service Regulation, the\n eligible component of pay are: Basic Pay +\n Stagnation Pay + Basic components of EPP + PQP\n + other allowances (ranking for PF only) shall be\n considered.\n\n 6\n\n Further we wish to inform you that \"The\n Regulation 46(2) of Syndicate Bank (Officers)\n Service Regulation, 1979, read as the amount of\n gratuity payable to Officer shall be one month\n \"pay\" for every completed year of service subject\n to maximum of 15 months of pay. Provided that\n where an officer has completed more than 30\n years of service, he shall be eligible by way of\n gratuity for additional amount @ on half of months\n pay for each completed year of service beyond 30\n years. Therefore, it is relevant to peruse the\n definition of \"Pay\" and \"salary\" which defines\n \"Pay\" as basic pay including stagnation increment\n and \"Salary\" means the aggregate of the pay and\n DA.\"\n\n5. The Bank has, vide impugned order dated\n\n06.05.2019, declined the claim of 45 days additional\n\namount of pension for each completed year of service\n\nafter completion of 30 years' service and has allowed\n\nonly 15 days additional amount for each completed\n\nyear of service after completion of 30 years' service by\n\nthe officer. Against the impugned order dated\n\n06.05.2019 (Annexure P-1), the petitioner approached\n\nthe Controlling Authority after registration. The\n\nregistered case number is Case No. D-36(32)/2019-\n\nALC.\n\n6. As per the order, the gratuity was awarded to\n\nthe tune of Rs. 15,22,042/-. The claim of the petitioner\n\nfor additional sum of 45 days for each completed year\n\nafter completion of service of 30 years was not allowed\n\n 7\n\n and a final order was passed by the Controlling\n\nAuthority, which is as under:-\n\n \"Final Order\"\n\n In view of the above mentioned legal points,\n I am of considered opinion that the appellant Sh.\n Babu Ram Kashyap is entitled to receive total\n gratuity of 15,22,042/- (Rupees Fifteen Lakh\n Twenty Two Thousand & Forty Two Only) as the\n higher amount of gratuity as per the service\n Regulations of the bank. As the applicant has\n already received Rs. 11,87,100/-, he need to be\n paid further amount of gratuity equivalent to Rs.\n 3,34,942/- (Rupees Three Lakh Thirty Four\n Thousand Thirty & Nine Hundred & Forty Two\n Only), by the Respondent (The General Manager,\n Syndicate Bank, Head Office, Manipal) within 30\n days from receipt of this order along with simple\n interest @ 7% p.a. from 12.10.2014.\"\n\n7. With respect to length of service, the gratuity\n\nwas calculated for a period of three years beyond 30\n\nyears i.e. till 33 years. The petitioner, in the present\n\ncase, has put in service of 36 years, three months and\n\ntwelve days. The petitioner is also aggrieved that the\n\nbenefit of six of years of service beyond thirty years\n\nhas been wrongly denied.\n\n8. The petitioner was communicated the claim\n\norder vide order dated 28th February, 2020 (Annexure\n\nPA-2). Against the order dated 28.02.2020, the\n\npetitioner filed an Appeal under Section 7(7) of PG Act\n\n(Annexure P-3). The Bank also filed an Appeal against\n\nthe order dated 28.02.2020 passed by the Controlling\n\n 8\n\n Authority. Both the Appeals were decided by the\n\nAppellate Authority by a common order dated\n\n29.11.2021 (Annexure P-4).\n\n9. In the impugned order, while interpreting\n\nClause-46 of SBOSR, the Appellate Authority held as\n\nunder:-\n\n \"Now after noting the above findings, I conclude\n that the respondent is entitled to be paid\n additional amount of gratuity over and above what\n has already been paid to him but not as per\n calculation arrived at by the CA. The CA should\n include the component of DA only with Basic Pay\n and calculate the amount of payable gratuity\n accordingly. The CA should further calculate\n interest @ 5% only upon the difference of amount\n of gratuity paid and payable.\"\n\n10. The Appellate Authority has not given the\n\nbenefit of calculation of gratuity beyond thirty years of\n\nservice i.e. 36 years three months and twelve days,\n\nwhich was given by the Controlling Authority as per\n\nRegulation 46 of Syndicate Bank (Officers') Service\n\nRegulations, 1979. Hence, this writ petition has been\n\nfiled now. The challenge has been made on two\n\ngrounds:-\n\n (I) The CA reduced the interest from 7% p.a. to\n\n 5% p.a. which is against the Circular of the\n\n Reserve Bank of India dated 6th March, 2020\n\n (Annexure No. 5 to the writ petition), which\n\n 9\n\n prescribes payment of interest at the rate of 10%\n\n till the date of making payment.\n\n (II) Clause 46 of SBOSR has been misread and\n\n misinterpreted by only including Dearness\n\n Allowance as part of pay and not including\n\n Emoluments as part of pay.\n\nINTEREST:-\n\n11. Counsel for the petitioner has referred to the\n\njudgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nY.K.\n\nSigla vs. Punjab National Bank & Ors. (Civil\n\nAppeal No.\n 9087 of 2012, decided on 14.12.2012)\n\nand D.D. Tiwari vs. Uttar Haryana Bizli Vitran\n\nNigam Ltd. (Civil Appeal No. 7113 of 2014),\n\nwherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that\n\nControlling Authorities (CA) have no discretion to award\n\ninterest on delayed payment other than the rate of\n\ninterest as is provided under the statute in terms of\n\nSub Section (3A) of \nSection 7\n of Payment of Gratuity\n\nAct, 1972.\n\n12. In another judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax\n\nDepartment, Works Contract & Leasing, Kota vs.\n\nShukla & Brothers (2010) 4 SCC 785, it has been\n\nheld that the rate of interest cannot be reduced by the\n\n 10\n\n Controlling Authority once it was granted as per the\n\nprevalent rules of banking.\n\nDEFINITION OF WORD 'PAY':-\n\n13. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nThe Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (II)\n\nW.B. vs. Vivekanand Vidhya Mandir & Ors. (Civil\n\nAppeal No. 6221 of 2011, decided on 28.02.2019)\n\nheld that the basic principle is where the wage is\n\nuniversally, necessarily and ordinarily paid to all\n\nemployees across the board, such emoluments are\n\nbasic wages. It is not denied by the respondent-Bank\n\nthat Special Allowance is being paid to all the officers\n\nworking in the Bank at the rate based on their scale of\n\npay. Therefore, exclusion of Special Allowance from\n\nthe component of Basic Pay is not permissible for the\n\npurpose of calculating gratuity. Therefore, the same\n\nshall be taken as part of basic pay for calculating the\n\ngratuity payable to the officers of the respondent-Bank\n\nbut no reason has been assigned by the learned AA\n\nwith regard to exclusion of Special Allowance. In the\n\nsaid judgment with regard to addition of Dearness\n\nAllowance, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as\n\nunder:-\n\n 11\n\n \"9. Basic wage, under the Act, has been defined\nas all emoluments paid in cash to an employee in\naccordance with the terms of his contract of\nemployment. But it carves out certain exceptions\nwhich would not fall within the definition of basic\nwage and which includes dearness allowance apart\nfrom other allowances mentioned therein. But this\nexclusion of dearness allowance finds inclusion in\n\nSection 6\n. The test adopted to determine if any\npayment was to be excluded from basic wage is\nthat the payment under the scheme must have a\ndirect access and linkage to the payment of such\nspecial allowance as not being common to all. The\ncrucial test is one of universality. The employer,\nunder the Act, has a statutory obligation to deduct\nthe specified percentage of the contribution from\nthe employee's salary and make matching\ncontribution. The entire amount is then required to\nbe deposited in the fund within 15 days from the\ndate of such collection. The aforesaid provisions\nfell for detailed consideration by this Court\nin Bridge & Roof (supra) when it was observed as\nfollows:-\n\n \"7. The main question therefore that falls for\n decision is as to which of these two rival\n contentions is in consonance with\n s. 2(b)\n.\n There is no doubt that \"basic wages\" as\n defined therein means all emoluments which\n are earned by an employee while on duty or\n on leave with wages in accordance with the\n terms of the contract of employment and\n which are paid or payable in cash. If there\n were no exceptions to this definition, there\n would have been no difficulty in holding that\n production bonus whatever be its nature\n would be included within these terms. The\n difficulty, however, arises because the\n definition also provides that certain things\n will not be included in the term \"basic\n wages\", and these are contained in three\n clauses. The first clause mentions the cash\n value of any food concession while the third\n clause mentions that presents made by the\n employer. The fact that the exceptions\n contain even presents made by the employer\n shows that though the definition mentions all\n emoluments which are earned in accordance\n\n 12\n\n with the terms of the contract of\nemployment, care was taken to exclude\npresents which would ordinarily not be\nearned in accordance with the terms of the\ncontract of employment. Similarly, though\nthe definition includes \"all emoluments\"\n\nwhich are paid or payable in cash, the\nexception excludes the cash value of any\nfood concession, which in any case was not\npayable in cash. The exceptions therefore do\nnot seem to follow any logical pattern which\nwould be in consonance with the main\ndefinition.\n\n8. Then we come to clause (ii). It excludes\ndearness allowance, house rent allowance,\novertime allowance, bonus, commission or\nany other similar allowance payable to the\nemployee in respect of his employment or of\nwork done in such employment. This\nexception suggests that even though the\nmain part of the definition includes all\nemoluments which are earned in accordance\nwith the terms of the contract of\nemployment, certain payments which are in\nfact the price of labour and earned in\naccordance with the terms of the contract of\nemployment are excluded from the main part\nof the definition of \"basic wages\". It is\nundeniable that the exceptions contained in\nclause (ii) refer to payments which are\nearned by an employee in accordance with\nthe terms of his contract of employment. It\nwas admitted by counsel on both sides before\nus that it was difficult to find any one basis\nfor the exceptions contained in the three\nclauses. It is clear however from clause (ii)\nthat from the definition of the word \"basic\nwages\" certain earnings were excluded,\nthough they must be earned by employees in\naccordance with the terms of the contract of\nemployment. Having excluded \"dearness\nallowance\" from the definition of \"basic\nwages\", s. 6 then provides for inclusion of\ndearness allowance for purposes of\ncontribution. But that is clearly the result of\nthe specific provision in\n s. 6\n which lays down\nthat contribution shall be 6-1/4 per centum\n\n 13\n\n of the basic wages, dearness allowance and\nretaining allowance (if any). We must\ntherefore try to discover some basis for the\nexclusion in clause (ii) as also the inclusion of\ndearness allowance and retaining allowance\n(for any) in\n s. 6\n. It seems that the basis of\ninclusion in\n s. 6\n and exclusion in clause (ii) is\nthat whatever is payable in all concerns and\nis earned by all permanent employees is\nincluded for the purpose, of contribution\nunder\n s. 6\n, but whatever is not payable by all\nconcerns or may not be earned by all\nemployees of a concern is excluded for the\npurpose of contribution. Dearness allowance\n(for examples is payable in all concerns\neither as an addition to basic wages or as a\npart of consolidated wages where a concern\ndoes not have separate dearness allowance\nand basic wages. Similarly, retaining\nallowance is payable to all permanent\nemployees in all seasonal factories like sugar\nfactories and is therefore included in\n s. 6\n; but\nhouse rent allowance is not paid in many\nconcerns and sometimes in the same concern\nit is paid to some employees but not to\nothers, for the theory is that house rent is\nincluded in the payment of basic wages plus\ndearness allowance or consolidated wages.\nTherefore, house rent allowance which may\nnot be payable to all employees of a concern\nand which is certainly not paid by all concern\nis taken out of the definition of \"basic\nwages\", even though the basis of payment of\nhouse rent allowance where it is paid is the\ncontract of employment. Similarly, overtime\nallowance though it is generally in force in all\nconcerns is not earned by all employees of a\nconcern. It is also earned in accordance with\nthe terms of the contract of employment; but\nbecause it may not be earned by all\nemployees of a concern it is excluded from\n\"basic wages\". Similarly, commission or any\nother similar allowance is excluded from the\ndefinition of \"basic wages\" for commission\nand other allowances are not necessarily to\nbe found in all concerns; nor are they\nnecessarily earned by all employees of the\n\n 14\n\n same concern, though where they exist they\n are earned in accordance with the terms of\n the contract of employment. It seems\n therefore that the basis for the exclusion in\n clause (ii) of the exceptions in\n s. 2(b)\n is that\n all that is not earned in all concerns or by all\n employees of concern is excluded from basic\n wages. To this the exclusion of dearness\n allowance in clause (ii) is an exception. But\n that exception has been corrected by\n including dearness allowance in\n s. 6\n for the\n purpose of contribution. Dearness allowance\n which is an exception in the definition of\n \"basic wages\", is included for the propose of\n contribution by\n s. 6\n and the real exceptions\n therefore in clause (ii) are the other\n exceptions beside dearness allowance, which\n has been included through\n S. 6\n.\"\n\n14. Original Pension Regulation of 1995 is still in\n\nforce and no amendment has yet been made in such\n\nRegulation regarding exclusion of Special Allowance.\n\nThe definition of 'Pay' as defined in Reg. 3(k) is\n\ninclusive definition, which means that the basic pay not\n\nonly includes stagnation increment, but also other\n\ncomponent of basic pay as held by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in Vivekanand Vidyamandir case (supra) and\n\nthe Madhya Pradesh High Court in \nMadhyanchal\n\nGramin Bank and others vs. All India Gramin Bank\n\nPensioners Organisation Unit (WA Nos\n. 1318 of\n\n2018, 1316 of 2018 & 1317 of 2018, decided on\n\n26.02.2019).\n\n 15\n\n 15. \nIn a recent judgment rendered by the High\n\nCourt of Kerala at Ernakulam in \nMuralee Mohanan\n\nK.T. and others vs. Corporation Bank and others\n\n(WP (C) No. 32386 of 2015 (W), decided on\n\n15.10.2019), the Kerala High Court condemned the\n\nexclusion of special allowance payable to bank\n\nemployees / officers. For ready reference, the relevant\n\nParagraphs 8 and 9 of \nthe said judgment\n are\n\nreproduced herein below:-\n\n \n\"8. However, in \nBank of Baroda v. G.Palani\n and others\n, the Apex Court drew a distinction\n where the aggrieved employees are officers who\n retired from the Bank in question. It was held that\n the provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n\n are not applicable to such officers. It was held that\n the Pension Regulations framed under \nSection 19\n\n of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and\n Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 are statutory\n in character. In the circumstances, in view of the\n definition of average emoluments at \nRegulation\n 2(d)\n, Pay at \nRegulation 2(s)\n and the provision for\n calculating pension at Regulation 35, it was held\n that employees are to be paid pension as provided\n in the Regulations and no reduction from the same\n is possible, relying on the provisions of a Joint\n Note, which has no statutory force, unless the\n Regulations are appropriately amended. It was\n held in paragraph 28 of the judgment as follows:-\n\n \"28. Thus joint note/agreement could not\n have been in derogation of the existing\n statutory Regulations and regulation 2(s)(c)\n could not have been given retrospective\n effect. It is also apparent from the decisions\n of this Court in P.Sadagopan vs.Food\n Corporation of India [(1997) 4 SCC 301],\n that executive instructions cannot be issued\n in derogation of the statutory Regulations.\n The settled position of law is that no\n\n 16\n\n Government Order, Notification or Circular\n can be a substitute of the statutory rules\n framed with the authority of law. \nIn\n \nDr.Rajinder Singh v. State of Punjab & Ors\n\n (2001) 5 SCC 482, this Court had reiterated\n that the settled position of law is that no\n government order, notification or circular can\n be a substitute of the statutory rules framed\n with the authority of law. In K.Kuppuswamy\n & Anr.v. State of Tamil Nadu (1998) 8 SCC\n 469, this Court has observed that statutory\n rules cannot be overriden by executive\n orders or executive practice. Merely because\n the Government had taken a decision to\n amend the rules, does not mean that the rule\n stood obliterated. Till the rule is amended,\n the rule applies.\"\n\n The amendment to \nRegulation 2(s)\n of the Pension\n Regulations was struck down as arbitrary and\n repugnant to \nRegulation 2(d)\n, 35 and 38(1) and\n (2).\n\n 9. In the above view of the matter, I am of the\n opinion that the prayers sought for in the writ\n petition are liable to be allowed. The petitioners\n are entitled to pension in terms of the Pension\n Regulations especially \nRegulation 2(d)\n and 35\n thereof. The respondents are directed to revise\n the basic pension of the petitioners in accordance\n with the provisions of the Corporation Bank\n (Employees) Pension Regulation, 1995 by taking\n into account the Special Allowances introduced in\n Exhibit P6 as part of pay for the purpose of Basic\n Pension. There will be a direction to the 2nd\n respondent to recalculate the commutation\n pension of the petitioners on the basis of the\n revised basic pension by including the special\n allowance introduced vide Exhibit P6 and to refund\n the pension arrears recovered from the petitioners\n as per Exhibits P5. P5(a),P5(b) and P5(c). The\n necessary shall be done within a period of three\n months from the date of receipt of a copy of this\n judgment.\"\n\n16. So far as inclusion of DA is concerned in the\n\ndefinition of 'Pay', both the CA as well as AA\n\n 17\n\n categorically held in view of binding precedents that DA\n\nshall be part of basic pay. There appears no illegality\n\nin such finding.\n\nHow the gratuity is to be calculated after serving\n\nfor a period beyond thirty years:-\n\n17. Recently, the High Court of Rajasthan in\n\nRajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank, Jodhpur vs.\n\nThe Appellate Authority (S.B. Civil Writ Petition\n\nNo. 7359 of 2019, decided on 16.10.2020) has\n\nconsidered this aspect of the matter and in the light of\n\nthe facts narrated in Paragraph 4 has made its\n\nobservation in Paragraph 22. Relevant Paragraphs 4\n\nand 22 read as under:-\n\n \"4. The brief facts of the case as noticed by this\n Court are that all these writ petitions relate to the\n dispute of computation of gratuity of the retired\n Bank Officers. The petitioner bank is a Regional\n Rural Bank which has been constituted by\n amalgamation of Marudhara Gramin Bank and\n Mewar Anchalik Gramin Bank on 01.04.2014. The\n retired Bank Officers-private respondents filed\n their respective applications before the Controlling\n Authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act,\n 1972\n claiming the differential amount of gratuity\n with interest with effect from 01.12.2017 based\n on the basic + dearness allowance + PQP + FPP\n components of the last pay drawn for the\n calculation of amount of gratuity payable to such\n officers. The petitioner-Bank vehemently objected\n their applications but the same were allowed and\n the petitioner-Bank was directed to pay the\n additional amount of gratuity along with simple\n interest at the rate of 10% with effect from\n\n 18\n\n 01.12.2017 till the date of payment made by the\npetitioner-Bank. The petitioner being aggrieved by\nthe order of the Controlling Authority filed appeals\nunder \nSection 7\n Sub-\nSection 7\n of the Payment of\nGratuity Act 1972, before the Appellate Authority\nunder the \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n and\nDeputy Chief Labour Commissioner (Central),\nAjmer. The petitioner being under a legal\nobligation deposited the difference of the amount\nto the Government before filing the appeals. The\nAppellate Authority partly allowed the appeals with\na direction to pay lesser amount along with\nsimple (31 of 83) [CW-7359/2019] interest at the\nrate of 10% per month with effect from\n01.12.2017 only on the ground of the ratio of the\nmonthly addition of gratuity after completion of 30\nyears while upholding the broader issue laid down\nby the Controlling Authority. The bank officers\nhave also made cross-objections against the\nAppellate Authority's order in certain writ petitions\nwhereby the calculations as per Clause 72(3) of\nthe regulation have been made and reduced by\nthe Appellate Authority and seeking of counting 30\ndays + 15 days i.e. one and a half months' salary\nfor the basic computation.\n\n22. In view of the above, the writ petitions are\nallowed. The impugned orders passed by the\nAppellate Authority are quashed and set aside and\nthe orders passed by the Controlling Authority in\nthe case of the contesting respondents are\nrestored. Accordingly, the petitioner Bank is found\nnot liable to pay any further amount towards\ngratuity to the contesting respondents as they\nadmittedly received the amount of Rs.10,00,000/-\nfrom the petitioner Bank immediately upon their\nsuperannuation.\" This Court is of the opinion that\nthe judgment in \nMadhyanchal Gramin\nBank\n (supra) rendered by the Hon'ble Madhya\nPradesh High Court and upheld by the Hon'ble\nApex Court is the correct view and also binding\nupon this Court on count of the same having been\nupheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Moreover, the\nRegulations of 2010 clearly define in Clause\n2(1)(i) that emoluments means aggregate of\nsalary and allowances and in Clause 2(1)(m) pay\nmeans basic pay drawn per month by the officer\n\n 19\n\n or employee in a pay scale including stagnation\nincrements and any part of the emoluments which\nmay specifically be classified as pay under these\nRegulations. As per the Clause 72(1) of the\nRegulations, for the purpose of gratuity, an officer\nor employee shall be eligible either as per the\nprovision of \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n or as\nper the Sub-Regulation (2), whichever is higher\nand thus, for the beneficial legislation of a welfare\nlaw, the benevolent connotation ought to have\nbeen accepted by this Court. There is no reason\nwhy this Court should take a different view than\nthe one taken by the Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh\nHigh Court and affirmed by the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt. The cross-objections made by the Officers\ndo not warrant any interference by this Court\nbecause on a bare reading (82 of 83) [CW-\n7359/2019] of Clause 72(3) of the Regulations, it\nis clear that the Statute required the petitioner to\npay half month's pay for each completed year of\nservice beyond 30 years. Clause 72(3) of the\nRegulations reads as follows:-\n\n \"(3) The amount of gratuity payable to an\n officer or employee shall be one months pay\n for every completed year of service or part\n thereof in excess of six months subject to a\n maximum of 15 month's pay:\n\n Provided that where an officer or\n employee has completed more than 30 years\n of service, he shall be eligible by way of\n gratuity for an additional amount at the rate\n of one half of a month's pay for each\n completed year of service beyond 30 years:\n\n Provided that in respect of an officer the\n gratuity is payable based on the last pay\n drawn:\n\n Provided also that in respect of an\n employee pay for the purposes of calculation\n of the gratuity shall be the average of the\n basic pay (100%), dearness allowance and\n special allowance and officiating allowance\n payable during the 12 months preceding\n death, disability, retirement, resignation or\n termination of service, as the case may be.\"\n\n 20\n\n Regulation 72(3) has an optimum gratuity\n prescribed upto maximum of 15 months' pay and\n the concession given is only for the officers who\n have completed more than 30 years of service by\n making them entitled for an additional amount of\n one half of month's pay for each completed year\n of service beyond 30 years, which is an exception\n to the maximum of 15 months' pay gratuity rule\n and thus, the exception has to be read strictly. It\n is thus clear that the Appellate Authority has\n rightly arrived at a conclusion that the Officers\n who have completed more than 30 years of\n service shall be eligible by way of gratuity for\n the (83 of 83) [CW-7359/2019] additional amount\n at the rate of one half month's pay for each\n completed service beyond 30 years. Thus, once\n the statute is clear, there is no question of\n expanding the meaning. It is one thing to choose\n one of the beneficial conditions amongst two and\n it is another thing to expand the ambit of benefits\n which are strictly prescribed. Accordingly, the\n cross objections are dismissed. In light of the\n aforementioned observations, the legal issues,\n facts and grounds raised by the petitioners do not\n call for interference by this Court. Accordingly, all\n these writ petitions are dismissed and the orders\n of the Appellate Authority are upheld. The\n consequential benefits shall be released to the\n respondent officers within a period of three\n months starting from 1st December, 2020. All\n pending applications stand dismissed accordingly.\n All the interim orders stand vacated.\"\n\n18. The judgment of the Rajasthan High Court\n\nhas been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n19. In the facts of the present case, as per\n\nproviso to Regulation 46(2) of the SBOSR, the\n\ncalculation of the gratuity is done. Regulation 46(2) of\n\nthe SBOSR reads as under:-\n\n 21\n\n \"Gratuity:\n\n 46.(2) The amount of gratuity payable to an\n officer shall be one month's pay for every\n completed year of service, subject to a\n maximum of 15 months' pay.\n\n Provided that where an officer has completed\n more than 30 years of service, he shall be\n eligible by way of gratuity for an additional\n amount at the rate of one half of a month's\n pay for each completed year of service\n beyond 30 years.\n\n Provided further that pay for the purpose of\n Gratuity for an officer who ceased to be in\n service during the period 1-7-1993 to 31-10-\n 1994 shall be with regard to scale of pay as\n specified in sub-regulation (1) of regulation 4.\n\n Provided also that pay for the purpose of\n Gratuity of an Officer who ceased to be in\n service during the period 1-4-1998 to 31-10-\n 1999 shall be with regard to scale of pay as\n specified in sub-regulation (2) of Regulation\n\n 4.\n\n Note:\n\n If the fraction of service beyond completed\n years of service is 6 months or more, gratuity\n will be paid pro-rata for the period.\"\n\n21. The judgment of Rajasthan High Court is\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case, which made\n\nit clear that for the purpose of calculation of gratuity\n\nbeyond thirty years, which is an exception, the\n\nadditional amount at the rate of one half month's pay\n\nfor each completed year of service beyond 30 years has\n\nto be calculated. The Rajasthan High Court has held\n\nthat the officers, who have completed more than thirty\n\n 22\n\n years of service, shall be eligible by way of gratuity for\n\nthe additional amount @ one half month's pay for each\n\ncompleted service beyond thirty years. Thus, once the\n\nstatute is very clear, there is no question of expanding\n\nthe meaning.\n\n22. In the present case as well, as per the\n\nproviso to Regulation 46(2) of the SBOSR, if an officer\n\nhas completed more than thirty years he is eligible by\n\nway of gratuity for an additional amount at the rate of\n\none half month's salary for each completed year of\n\nservice beyond thirty years. Hence, for the purpose of\n\ncalculation of gratuity, the salary of 45 days has to be\n\ntaken into account for each completed year beyond\n\nthirty years.\n\n23. \nIn the writ petitions filed by the Canara Bank,\n\ncounsel for the Bank has referred to the judgment of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nBeed\n\nDistrict Central Cooperative Bank Ltd. vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra and others\n (2006) 8 SCC 514 has\n\nbeen referred to on the preposition that when an\n\nScheme of employer has been offered, the workman\n\ncan opt for the best terms of Statute, and the nature of\n\ngratuity scheme and agreement of the parties cannot\n\n 23\n\n be changed subsequently to take better benefits under\n\nthe \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n.\n\n24. He has further referred to another judgment\n\nof the Calcutta High Court in \nPaschim Banga Gramin\n\nBank and others vs. Chinmay Majumdar & others\n\n(F.M.A. 657 of 2020, decided on 04.02.2021),\n\nwherein the Calcutta High Court has held that once the\n\nemployee has accepted the terms and conditions of the\n\nRegulations for the purpose of definition of the word\n\n'pay' and calculation of gratuity, then they are\n\nrestrained from seeking modification of definition of the\n\nword 'pay' and mode of calculation of gratuity.\n\n25. He further states that in this judgment, the\n\nrespondents were claiming the benefit of Dearness Pay\n\nto be treated as part of pay. However, the High Court\n\nallowed the appeal filed by the Bank and restricted the\n\nmeaning of the words as per the Regulations of the\n\nBank. The Regulation made a clear distinction between\n\nan officer and an employee and in the matter of\n\ncalculation of gratuity. Regarding the employees, the\n\n'basic pay' included only allowances and not 'dearness\n\nallowance' and the appeal of the Bank was allowed.\n\n 24\n\n 26. In the present case, as per the impugned\n\norder dated 17th December, 2021 (Annexure-4), the\n\nAppellate Authority had partly allowed the Appeal of\n\nShri Babu Ram Kashyap by including Basic Pay and\n\nDA for the purpose of calculation of gratuity and\n\nawarded 5% interest.\n\n27. In the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the Regional Provident Fund\n\nCommissioner (II) W.B. (supra), while dealing with\n\nthe employees of the Bank, it has been held that the\n\ndefinition of 'pay' was an inclusive definition, which\n\nmeans that the Basic Pay not only includes stagnation\n\nincrement but also other component of the Basic Pay,\n\ni.e. the Special Allowance. \nSimilarly, the Madhya\n\nPradesh High Court in \nMadhyanchal Gramin Bank\n\nand others\n (supra) and the Kerala High Court in\n\nMuralee Mohanan K.T. and others\n (supra) have held\n\nthat exclusion of Special Allowances payable to the\n\nbank employees / officers for calculating gratuity was\n\nnot correct, and the petitioners were held entitled to\n\npension in terms of the Pension Regulations by taking\n\ninto account the Special Allowances.\n\n 25\n\n 28. In the present case, as per the Regulations of\n\nthe Bank, the definition of 'emoluments' is in\n\nRegulation 3(e)\n, which reads as under:-\n\n \"e) \"Emoluments\" means the aggregate of salary\n and allowances if any.\"\n\n29. The definitions of words 'pay' and 'salary' are\n\ngiven in \nRegulation 3(k)\n and \nRegulation 3(l)\n of the\n\nRegulations of the Bank respectively, which read as\n\nunder:-\n\n \"k) \"Pay' means basic pay including stagnation\n increment.\n\n l) \"Salary\" means the aggregate of the pay and\n dearness allowance.\"\n\n30. Applying the ratio of the above said\n\njudgments, the definition of 'pay' is inclusive of special\n\nallowances, emoluments, dearness allowance and\n\nstagnation increments. Hence, the petitioners\n\n(employees) are entitled to include the Special\n\nAllowances as part of Pay for the purpose of calculation\n\nof gratuity by including Dearness Allowance as well.\n\n31. The second ground taken by the writ\n\npetitioner is that the payment of interest could not be\n\nreduced from 10% to 5%. Even on this aspect, the\n\n 26\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nY.K. Sigla vs. Punjab\n\nNational Bank & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.\n 9087 of\n\n2012, decided on 14.12.2012) and D.D. Tiwari vs.\n\nUttar Haryana Bizli Vitran Nigam Ltd. (Civil\n\nAppeal No. 7113 of 2014) and Assistant\n\nCommissioner, Commercial Tax Department,\n\nWorks Contract & Leasing, Kota vs. Shukla &\n\nBrothers (2010) 4 SCC 785, has consistently held\n\nthat the rate of interest cannot be reduced once it was\n\ngranted by the prevalent rules of banking. Hence, in\n\nthe present case, the petitioners (employees) are\n\nentitled for interest at the rate of 7%.\n\n32. The judgment, referred to by the counsel for\n\nthe Canara Bank, which is \nBeed District Central\n\nCooperative Bank Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra\n\nand others\n (2006) 8 SCC 514, will not be applicable\n\nto the facts of the present case as \nin that case\n the\n\nSupreme Court was not examining the definitions of\n\nspecial allowances, emoluments, pay and salary of the\n\nBank employees. It was examining the option exercised\n\nby an employee of the Bank. The Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt was examining the provisions of the Banking\n\nRegulations, which had been opted by the employee at\n\n 27\n\n the time of joining the Cooperative Bank. It was held\n\ntherein that the employees, thereafter, could not claim\n\nthe benefit of calculation of gratuity under the \nPayment\n\nof Gratuity Act, 1972\n.\n\n33. The Canara Bank, in the present case, is\n\nbound by their Regulations for the purpose of\n\ncalculation of gratuity and that is not being disputed by\n\nthe Bank employees.\n\n34. The judgment of the Calcutta High Court in\n\nPaschim Banga Gramin Bank and others vs.\n\nChinmay Majumdar & others\n (F.M.A. 657 of 2020,\n\ndecided on 04.02.2021) cannot be made applicable in\n\nthe facts of the present case as the Calcutta High Court\n\nin that case\n was dealing with the definition of 'pay' as\n\nper the Regulations with respect to officers and\n\nemployees in the matter of calculation of gratuity and it\n\nwas held that once the employee had accepted the\n\nentitlement under the Regulations\n, \nin that case\n, they\n\ncould not claim the benefit of definition of 'pay' which\n\nwas applicable to officers.\n \nEven this judgment is not\n\napplicable as in this judgment, the Calcutta High Court\n\nwas not examining the definition of 'pay' for the\n\npurpose of calculation of gratuity and this aspect has\n\n 28\n\n been considered in detail in the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in The Regional Provident\n\nFund Commissioner (II) W.B. vs. Vivekanand\n\nVidhya Mandir & Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 6221 of\n\n2011, decided on 28.02.2019), in the judgment of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court in \nMadhyanchal Gramin\n\nBank and others vs. All India Gramin Bank\n\nPensioners Organisation Unit (WA Nos\n.\n \n1318 of\n\n2018, 1316 of 2018 & 1317 of 2018, decided on\n\n26.02.2019), the SLP against which was dismissed by\n\nthe Supreme Court, and in the judgment of the Kerala\n\nHigh Court in \nMuralee Mohanan K.T. and others vs.\n\nCorporation Bank and others\n (WP (C) No. 32386\n\nof 2015 (W), decided on 15.10.2019).\n\n35. All the writ petitions, filed by the employees,\n\nare being allowed, and a direction is given to the Bank\n\nto recalculate their gratuity after calculating the pay,\n\nincluding Dearness Allowance and emoluments, along\n\nwith 7% interest. All the writ petitions filed by the\n\nCanara Bank are dismissed.\n\n ______________\n RITU BAHRI, C.J.\n\n __________________\n RAKESH THAPLIYAL, J.\n\nDt: 29th April, 2024\nRathour\n\n 29",

      "text": "Regulation 72(3) has an optimum gratuity\n prescribed upto maximum of 15 months' pay and\n the concession given is only for the officers who\n have completed more than 30 years of service by\n making them entitled for an additional amount of\n one half of month's pay for each completed year\n of service beyond 30 years, which is an exception\n to the maximum of 15 months' pay gratuity rule\n and thus, the exception has to be read strictly. It\n is thus clear that the Appellate Authority has\n rightly arrived at a conclusion that the Officers\n who have completed more than 30 years of\n service shall be eligible by way of gratuity for\n the (83 of 83) [CW-7359/2019] additional amount\n at the rate of one half month's pay for each\n completed service beyond 30 years. Thus, once\n the statute is clear, there is no question of\n expanding the meaning. It is one thing to choose\n one of the beneficial conditions amongst two and\n it is another thing to expand the ambit of benefits\n which are strictly prescribed. Accordingly, the\n cross objections are dismissed. In light of the\n aforementioned observations, the legal issues,\n facts and grounds raised by the petitioners do not\n call for interference by this Court. Accordingly, all\n these writ petitions are dismissed and the orders\n of the Appellate Authority are upheld. The\n consequential benefits shall be released to the\n respondent officers within a period of three\n months starting from 1st December, 2020. All\n pending applications stand dismissed accordingly.\n All the interim orders stand vacated.\""
