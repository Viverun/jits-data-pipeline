Further, Respondent No.1 was restrained from transferring,\n\nalienating, parting with possession or further encumbering any of its\n\nassets.\n\no) The Applicant, through its Advocates, addressed a letter dated 6 th\n\nApril 2021 to the Respondents invoking Arbitration under Clause (k)\n\nof the Sanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. The Applicant also\n\nsuggested two names for appointment as Arbitrators. The said letter\n\nwas duly served on all the Respondents. The Respondents replied to\n\nthe said letter dated 6 th April 2021 by their letter dated 20 th April 2021\n\nwhereby the Respondents refused to appoint an Arbitrator.\n\np) On 8th June 2021, the present Application was filed for\n\nappointment of an Arbitrator.\n\nq) On 4th August, 2021, this Court dismissed the Review Petition\n\nfiled by the Respondents seeking a review of the Order dated 12 th\n\nMarch 2021 passed in the\nSection 9\nPetition filed by the Applicant.\n\nr) On 19th August 2021, the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed an\n\nOrder in the SLP filed challenging the said Order dated 4 th August\n\nPage 7 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n2021 wherein it recorded that in view of the statement made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the Applicant (Respondent in the SLP) that they\n\nwould not press for the execution of the Order dated 12 th March 2021\n\ntill the next date, no interim orders were required to be passed in the\n\nmatter.\n\ns) On these facts, Mr.Rohan Savant, the learned counsel appearing\n\non behalf of the Applicant, submitted that there is a valid arbitration\n\nagreement between the parties as contained in Clause (k) of the\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019, that disputes and differences\n\nhave arisen between the parties and the Applicant has invoked the\n\narbitration agreement between the parties by its Advocates letter\n\ndated 6th April 2021.\n\nt) Mr.Rohan Savant further submitted that, in these circumstances,\n\nthe present Application ought to be allowed and an Arbitrator be\n\nappointed in order to arbitrate upon all the disputes and differences\n\narising between the parties under the said Sanction Letter dated 19 th\n\nAugust 2019.\n\nPage 8 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n3. The Respondents have filed an Affidavit in Reply dated 11 th September\n\n2023 opposing the present Application. On the basis of this Affidavit in\n\nReply, Mr.Pankaj Sawant, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Respondents, submitted that the disputes sought to be referred to\n\nArbitration by the present application are non-arbitrable as the same are\n\nbarred by the provisions of the\nSARFAESI Act\nand the Recovery of Debts due\n\nto Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (\"RDDB Act\"). In this context,\n\nMr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that the present Application was expressly\n\nbarred under\nSection 34\nof the SARFAESI Act. He submitted that the\n\nApplicant had already initiated proceedings under the\nSARFAESI Act\n, which\n\nprovides a statutory remedy for secured creditors. Upon invoking the\n\nremedies under the special statute, the Applicant cannot now resort to\n\nprivate adjudication by making an artificial bifurcation of the loan amounts\n\nto suit its convenience. Further, Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that, as per\n\nSection 13(10)\nof the SARFAESI Act, a secured creditor must exhaust the\n\nstatutory remedies available under the\nSARFAESI Act\n, and a secured creditor\n\ncan only initiate civil proceedings for any margin left recoverable after\n\nexhausting the remedies under the\nSARFAESI Act\n. Therefore, it was not\n\nopen for the Applicant to elect the remedies in any manner whatsoever.\n\nPage 9 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n4. Mr.Pankaj Sawant also submitted that the present Application is\n\nbarred by RDDB Act. He submitted that\nSection 18\nof the Act confers\n\nexclusive jurisdiction on the DRT for disputes involving debt recovery by the\n\nfinancial institutions. He submitted that the Applicant is a part of a\n\nconsortium and qualifies as a financial institution under the RDDB Act. As a\n\nconsortium member and a financial institution, the Applicant could have\n\nfiled an Application in the DRT under Sections 17 to 19 of the RDDB Act.\nIn\n\nsupport of his submissions, Mr.Pankaj Sawant relied upon the judgement of\n\nthe Division Bench of this Court in\nNaresh J. Doshi and Others vs. Reserve\n\nBank of India and Others1\n.\n\n5. Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the cause of action in the\n\nSummary Suit filed by the Applicant and in the present Application is the\n\nsame, and, by filing the Summary Suit, the Applicant had waived its right to\n\narbitration and the same is barred.\n\n6. In this context, Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that there is one loan\n\nagreement, namely the Working Capital Demand Loan Agreement dated 29 th\n\nNovember 2018, one loan account and only one demand notice was issued by\n\nthe Applicant. He submitted that the Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019\n\nrefers to the WCDL Agreement dated 29th November 2018 which is also the\n1 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 11655\n\nPage 10 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nsubject matter of the Summary Suit and states that all securities provided\n\nunder the loan agreements would stand as security for the repayment of One\n\nTime Temporary Limit Facility. Further, the Demand Notice is a composite\n\ndemand issued for both facilities wherein a single amount of\n\nRs.37,61,45,284/- is claimed and One-Time Temporary Limit Facility is also\n\nmentioned. He submitted that no bifurcation of the claim is made in the\n\nDemand Notice, demonstrating that the claims are identical and inseparable.\n\n7. Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the conjoint reading of the\n\naverments in the Summary Suit and the Application filed by the Applicant\n\nunder\nOrder II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908, demonstrates\n\nthat it is the Applicant's express case that the cause of action for the\n\nSummary Suit and the present Arbitration Application is the same.\n\n8. By initiating that Suit based on the same cause of action, the\n\nApplicant has waived its right to arbitration. In this context, Mr.Pankaj\n\nSawant relied upon the judgement of this Court in Onyx Musicabsolute com\n\nPvt.Ltd. &\nOrs. vs. Yash Raj Films Pvt. Ltd. And Ors2\n.\n\n9. Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the Applicant's attempt to\n\npursue SARFAESI proceedings, the Summary Suit and the Arbitration\n2 (2008) SCC OnLine Bom 636\n\nPage 11 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nconstitutes impermissible forum shopping and would lead to multiplicity of\n\nproceedings, resulting in conflicting judgements from different forums on\n\nthe same set of facts, which is against public policy and judicial propriety. He\n\nsubmitted that the Applicant, being part of the Consortium, cannot be\n\npermitted to bypass statutory remedies while others are following them as\n\nthis creates an uneven playing field.\n\n10. In response to these submissions, Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that\n\nnone of the issues raised by the Respondents can be gone into by the Court\n\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act as the scope of enquiry in an Application under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act is expressly limited and narrow. He submitted that, in\n\nan Application under\nSection 11\n, the Court only deals with the examination of\n\nthe existence of the Arbitration Agreement. This examination is also done\n\nonly on prima facie basis. No other contentions or issues are considered by\n\nthe Court at this stage. He submitted that even the issue concerning the\n\nvalidity of the arbitration agreement beyond formal validity, such as the\n\nagreement being in writing, cannot be dealt with by the Court while\n\nconsidering the Application under\nSection 11\nof the Act.\n\n11. Mr.Rohan Savant, further submitted that the test\nlaid down by\nthe\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nVidya Drolia and Others vs. Durga Trading\n\nPage 12 of 44\n\nOCTOBER\n03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nCorporation3, such as deadwood, ex facie frivolous and / or the test\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe Supreme Court in\nNTPC Limited vs. SPML Infra Limited\n4, being\n\nthe eye of the needle test, have now being rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in view of the judgement of the 7 Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nand\nStamp Act, 1899\n, In Re 5 and as\n\nexplained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI General Insurance Co.Ltd.\nvs.\n\nKrish Spinning,6 which specifically considers the effect of the decision in the\n\ncase of Interplay (Supra) on the scope of powers of the referral Court under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act.\n\n12. Without prejudice to this submission, as regards the contention of the\n\nRespondents with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute on account of\n\nthe fact that the Applicant had been notified as a financial institution under\n\nSection 2(1) (m)(iv)\nof the SARFAESI Act, Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that,\n\nmerely because the Applicant had been notified as a financial institution\n\nunder the\nSARFAESI Act\n, would not result in the claim being made by the\n\nApplicant becoming non-arbitrable. This was in view of the provisions of the\n\nSARFAESI Act\n, and more particularly\nSections 35\nand\nthereof. He\n\n3 (2021) 2 SCC 1\n4 (2023) 9 SCC 385\n5 (2024) 6 SCC 1\n6 (2024) SCC OnLine 1754\n\nPage 13 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nsubmitted that\nSection 37\nof the SARFAESI Act, in no uncertain terms,\n\nprovides that it is in addition to, and not in derogation of, other laws for the\n\ntime being in force. Hence, the proceedings under the Act can be continued\n\nby a financial institution even when the financial institution institutes or is\n\nentitled institute proceedings under the\nSARFAESI Act\n.\n\n13. Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that the issue of arbitrability and\n\nsimultaneous institution of proceedings under the Act and proceedings under\n\nthe\nSARFAESI Act\nby financial institutions have been dealt with by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of\nM.D.Frozen Foods Exports Pvt. Ltd.&\n\nOrs. vs. Hero Fincorp Ltd.7and India Bulls Housing Finance Ltd.\nvs. Deccan\n\nChronicle Holdings Ltd. & Ors.8 He further submitted that the aforesaid\n\njudgments had been considered by this Court in the case of\nTata Motors\n\nFinance Solutions Ltd. vs. Naushad Khan\n9.\n\n14. Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that the said judgements clearly\n\ndemonstrate that a financial institution is entitled to simultaneously proceed\n\nunder the\nSARFAESI Act and the Act\n.\n\n7 (2017) 16 SCC 41\n8 (2018) 14 SCC 783\n9 (2023) SCC OnLine BOM 2716\n\nPage 14 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n15. Mr.Rohan Savant further submitted that the Respondents have also\n\nsought to make reference to Transferred Original Application No.210 of\n\n2023 filed under the provisions of the RDDB Act before the DRT, Mumbai\n\nagainst the Respondents to contend that, in light of the said Application,\n\nArbitration Proceedings were not maintainable. Mr. Rohan Savant submitted\n\nthat this contention again is erroneous. The said Original Application has\n\nbeen filed by Union Bank of India, Cosmos Co-operative Bank Limited, Axis\n\nBank Ltd. and State Bank of India. The claim raised in the Original\n\nApplication is in respect of the claim made by the said Banks. This is\n\napparent from the particulars of claim at Annexure U of the Original\n\nApplication. He further submitted that the Original Application specifically\n\nmentioned that the Applicant was only a proforma party. He submitted that\n\nthe claims of the Applicant were not a part of the Original Application filed\n\nbefore the DRT, Mumbai.\n\n16. Further, Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that it is undisputed that the\n\nApplicant cannot take action under the RDDB Act. This is because the\n\nApplicant, as a Non Banking Financial Institution, is not notified under the\n\nRDDB Act. The notification under the\nSARFAESI Act\ndoes not entitle the\n\nApplicant to file proceedings before the DRT under the RDDB Act.\n\nPage 15 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n17. Mr Rohan Savant further submitted that the next contention raised\n\nby the Respondents was that the Applicant had relinquished / waived the\n\nArbitration Clause contained in the Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019.\n\nMr. Rohan Savant submitted that it is settled law that issues of waiver and\n\nacquiescence are issues on facts and such issues cannot be raised in an\n\nApplication under\nSection 11\nof the Act. Further, he submitted that the prior\n\nfiling of the Commercial Summary Suit would not, in any manner, entitle a\n\nwaiver or relinquishment of the Arbitration Clause in the present\n\nApplication. He submitted that this was because firstly, on facts, the claim\n\nmade in the said Commercial Summary Suit is distinct and separate from the\n\nclaim raised in the\nSection 11\nApplication. He further submitted that, even in\n\nlaw, merely because a party has filed a prior suit, would not disentitle such a\n\nparty from filing subsequent arbitration proceedings. In view of\nSection 8\nof\n\nthe Act, the Defendants in the Commercial Summary Suit are at liberty to file\n\nan Application for reference of the dispute to Arbitration. Equally, the\n\nPlaintiff was entitled to withdraw a Suit prior to the Defendants filing their\n\nfirst statement on the substance of the dispute.\nIn support of this submission,\n\nMr. Rohan Savant relied upon the judgement of this Court in\nPriya Rishi\n\nBhuta and Another vs. Vardhaman Engineers and Builders and Others\n10 .\n\n10 2022 SCC OnLine BOM 1136\n\nPage 16 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n18. Mr. Rohan Savant further submitted that, even on facts, the case of\n\nwaiver set up by the Respondents was completely misconceived and\n\nerroneous. The claim made in the Commercial Summary Suit No.87 of 2022\n\nagainst the Respondents pertained to a separate facility, i.e. the Working\n\nCapital Demand Loan Facility for a sum of Rs.30 crores. The said Suit does\n\nnot include the claim which would be made by the Applicant in the\n\nArbitration proceedings before the Arbitrator, which solely relates to the\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. He submitted that this is apparent\n\nfrom a bare perusal of the Plaint. He further submitted that the contents of\n\nthe Plaint in the said Suit make it apparent that the claim made in the said\n\nSuit is distinct and separate from the claim made in the present Arbitration\n\nApplication.\n\n19. In response to the submissions of Mr.Rohan Savant, Mr.Pankaj\n\nSawant, on behalf of the Respondents, submitted that this Court had the\n\njurisdiction to decide on the objection of non-arbitrability of claims at the\n\nstage of hearing of the\nSection 11\nApplication.\nIn support of his submissions,\n\nhe relied upon the judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nVidya Drolia\n\nand Others\n(Supra) and\nM.Hemalata Devi and Others vs. B. Udayasri\n.\nMr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the Applicant's reliance on the\n\njudgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra) and SBI\n11 (2024) 4 SCC 255\n\nPage 17 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nGeneral Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) was misplaced as the said judgments were\n\nbased on different facts.\n\n20. Mr. Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the Applicant's reliance on\n\nthe judgment of\nTata Motors Finance Solutions Ltd.\n(Supra) was misplaced\n\nas the said judgement was a judgement of a Single Judge of this Court and\n\ndid not take into consideration the judgement of the Division Bench of this\n\nCourt in\nNaresh J. Doshi and Others\n(Supra)12. He further submitted that,\n\neven otherwise,the judgement was distinguishable as, in the facts of that case,\n\nthere was no pending suit or consortium, as in the present case, and it was\n\nnot clear whether SARFAESI action was adopted.\n\nFurther, Mr.Pankaj Sawant\n\nalso submitted that, similarly, the reliance by the Applicant on\nIndiabulls\n\nHousing Finance Ltd.\n(Supra) was misplaced as the issue\nin that case\nwas\n\nentirely different and\n,\nin that case\n, the action under the\nSARFAESI Act\nwas\n\nchallenged because of arbitration proceedings. He submitted that a\n\ndistinction must be drawn between cases where arbitration proceedings were\n\ninitiated first, followed by actions under the\nSARFAESI Act\nby the banks, and\n\ncases where SARFAESI proceedings were initiated prior to arbitration. He\n\nsubmitted that, whilst there was no bar under the\nArbitration Act\nagainst the\n\napplication of the\nSARFAESI Act\nor any other statute,\nSection 34\nof the\n\nSARFAESI Act expressly barred the initiation of other proceedings, including\n12 (2021) SCC OnLine BOM 11655\n\nPage 18 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nthose before any Court or Tribunal in respect of matters which DRT is\n\nempowered to determine under the Act. Therefore, once proceedings under\n\nthe\nSARFAESI Act\nhad been initiated, the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts and\n\nArbitral Tribunal is ousted and the dispute must be adjudicated exclusively\n\nby the forum designated under the\nSARFAESI Act\n.\n\nMr.Pankaj Sawant\n\nfurther submitted that, whilst the Applicant relied on the judgement in the\n\ncase of\nM.D.Frozen Food Exports Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.\n(Supra) to argue that\n\nSARFAESI proceedings can continue alongside arbitration, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court, in\nVidya Drolia and Others\n(Supra), clarified that\nM. D.\n\nFrozen Food Exports Pvt. Ltd.\n(Supra) does not apply to the issue of non-\n\narbitrability under the\nSARFAESI Act\n. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n\nstatutory remedies under SARFAESI are non-arbitrable and that continuing\n\narbitration alongside SARFAESI proceedings would undermine the specific\n\nrights conferred under the\nSARFAESI Act\n.\n\n21. Further, as far as the judgement in\nPriya Rishi Bhuta and Another\n\n(Supra) relied upon by the Applicant was concerned, Mr. Pankaj Sawant\n\nsubmitted that\n,\nin that case\n, the cause of action in the civil proceedings and\n\nthe arbitral proceedings were different, whilst, in the present case, the cause\n\nof action and relief sought were inseparable and the same.\n\nPage 19 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nAnalysis and Findings\n\n22. I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and perused the\n\ndocuments on record.\n\n23. The issue that needs consideration first is whether this Court, in an\n\nApplication under\nSection 11\nof the Act, can go into the objections raised by\n\nthe Respondents.\n\n24. To consider this issue,\nSection 11(6A)\nof the Act is relevant and reads\n\nas under:\n\n\"(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while\nconsidering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-\n\nsection (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court,\nconfine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.\"\n\n25. It is pertinent to note that sub-\nsection 6(A)\nof\nSection 11\nwas omitted\n\nby\nSection 3(v)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019.\n\nHowever, the same has not been notified, and, therefore, subsection 6(A) of\n\nSection 11\ncontinues to remain in force.\n\n26. Further, to consider this issue, the judgements relied upon by the\n\nparties, in the context of this issue, would have to be considered.

Discussion under the heading \"Who Decides Arbitrability?\" can be\ncrystallised as under:\n\n154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. Ltd. on the scope of judicial review by\nthe court while deciding an application under\nSections 8\nor 11 of the\nArbitration\nAct\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with retrospective effect from 23-\n10-2015) and even post the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from\n9-8-2019), is no longer applicable.\n\n154.2. Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the court under\nSections 8\n\nand\nof the Arbitration Act is identical but extremely limited and restricted.\n\n154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the legislative mandate clear\nfrom Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of 2019, and the principle of severability and\ncompetence-competence, is that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first\nauthority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. The court\nhas been conferred power of \"second look\" on aspects of non-arbitrability post\nthe award in terms of sub-clauses ( i), (ii) or (iv) of\nSection 34(2)(a)\nor sub-\nclause (i) of\nSection 34(2)(b)\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at\nSection 8\nor 11 stage\nwhen it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration agreement is non-\nexistent, invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature and facet\nof non-arbitrability would, to some extent, determine the level and nature of\njudicial scrutiny. The restricted and limited review is to check and protect\nparties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably \"non-\narbitrable\" and to cut off the deadwood. The court by default would refer the\nmatter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly arguable;\nwhen consideration in summary proceedings would be insufficient and\ninconclusive; when facts are contested; when the party opposing arbitration\nadopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings. This is\nnot the stage for the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as to\nusurp the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity\nand efficacy of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.\"\n\nPage 21 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nb) Paragraph Nos.92 and 93 of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nIndian Oil Corporation Limited vs. NCC Limited\n13 are relevant and\n\nare set out here under:\n\n\"92. However, at the same time, we do not agree with the conclusion arrived at\nby the High Court that after the insertion of sub-section (6-A) in\nSection 11\nof\nthe Arbitration Act, scope of inquiry by the Court in\nSection 11\npetition is\nconfined only to ascertain as to whether or not a binding arbitration agreement\nexists qua the parties before it, which is relatable to the disputes at hand.\n\n93. We are of the opinion that though the Arbitral Tribunal may have\njurisdiction and authority to decide the disputes including the question of\njurisdiction and non-arbitrability, the same can also be considered by the Court\nat the stage of deciding\nSection 11\napplication if the facts are very clear and\nglaring and in view of the specific clauses in the agreement binding between the\nparties, whether the dispute is non-arbitrable and/or it falls within the excepted\nclause. Even at the stage of deciding\nSection 11\napplication, the Court may\nprima facie consider even the aspect with regard to \"accord and satisfaction\" of\nthe claims.\"\n\nc) Paragraph Nos.15 to 17 and 44 to 51 of the judgement of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nM.Hemalata Devi and Others\n(Supra) are relevant and are\n\nset out here under:\n\n\"15. Now before this Court, there is a long line of decisions, including the\ndecision which had come up post amendment to sub-section (1) of\nSection 8\n\nand post insertion of sub-section (6-A) to\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act,\n1996, where it has been held that in spite of sub-section (1) to\nSection 8\nthe\nCourt has to find out not only whether there is an arbitration clause in the\nagreement but whether the dispute is arbitrable or not.\n\n16. All disputes are not capable of being referred to arbitration [ \"Not all matters\nare capable of being referred to arbitration. As a matter of English law certain\nmatters are reserved for the court alone and if a tribunal purports to deal with\nthem the resulting award will be unenforceable. These include matters where\nthe type of remedy required is not one which an Arbitral Tribunal is empowered\n\n13 (2023) 2 SCC 539\n\nPage 22 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nto give.\" [Russel on Arbitration (22nd Edn.)]] . The nature of certain disputes\nmay be such that they should never be sent near an arbitration table. To give an\nillustration, there would be certain types of criminal matters, matters involving\npublic corruption, etc. This aspect has been well considered by this Court in\n\nBooz Allen & Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd.\nand it has been held as\nunder : (SCC pp. 546-47, paras 35-36)\n\n\"35. The Arbitral Tribunals are private fora chosen voluntarily by the parties\nto the dispute, to adjudicate their disputes in place of courts and tribunals\nwhich are public fora constituted under the laws of the country. Every civil or\ncommercial dispute, either contractual or non-contractual, which can be\ndecided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved\nby arbitration unless the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunals is excluded\neither expressly or by necessary implication. Adjudication of certain\ncategories of proceedings are reserved by the legislature exclusively for\npublic fora as a matter of public policy. Certain other categories of cases,\nthough not expressly reserved for adjudication by public fora (courts and\ntribunals), may by necessary implication stand excluded from the purview of\nprivate fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is inarbitrable, the court\nwhere a suit is pending, will refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, under\n\nSection 8\nof the Act, even if the parties might have agreed upon arbitration\nas the forum for settlement of such disputes.\n\n36. The well-recognised examples of non-arbitrable disputes are : ( i)\ndisputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of\ncriminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial\nseparation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody; ( iii) guardianship\nmatters; (iv) insolvency and winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters\n(grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate); and\n\n(vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the\ntenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified\ncourts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes.\"\n\n17. The exclusion of a dispute from arbitration may be express or implied,\ndepending again upon the nature of the dispute, and a party to a dispute cannot\nbe compelled to resort to arbitration merely for the reason that it has been\nprovided in the contract, to which it is a signatory. The arbitrability of a dispute\nhas to be examined when one of the parties seeks redressal under a welfare\nlegislation, in spite of being a signatory to an arbitration agreement. \"\nThe\nConsumer Protection Act\n\" is definitely a piece of welfare legislation with the\nprimary purpose of protecting the interest of a consumer. Consumer disputes\nare assigned by the legislature to public fora, as a measure of public policy.\nTherefore, by necessary implication such disputes will fall in the category of\nnon-arbitrable disputes, and these disputes should be kept away from a private\nfora such as \"arbitration\", unless both the parties willingly opt for arbitration\nover the remedy before public fora.\n\nPage 23 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n44. What were then the factors which necessitated an amendment, inter alia, in\n\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 and what was the purpose behind\nthese amendments? This aspect again has been examined in detail in Emaar-3.\nSuch amendments were recommended by the Law Commission in its 246th\nReport, para 33 of the 246th Report of the Law Commission stated as under:\n\n\"33. It is in this context, the Commission has recommended amendments to\n\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The scope of\nthe judicial intervention is only restricted to situations where the\ncourt/judicial authority finds that the arbitration agreement does not exist or\nis null and void. Insofar as the nature of intervention is concerned, it is\nrecommended that in the event the court/judicial authority is prima facie\nsatisfied against the argument challenging the arbitration agreement, it shall\nappoint the arbitrator and/or refer the parties to arbitration, as the case may\nbe. The amendment envisages that the judicial authority shall not refer the\nparties to arbitration only if it finds that there does not exist an arbitration\nagreement or that it is null and void. If the judicial authority is of the opinion\nthat prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, then it shall refer the\ndispute to arbitration, and leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to\nbe finally determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. However, if the judicial\nauthority concludes that the agreement does not exist, then the conclusion\nwill be final and not prima facie.\"\n\n45. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n(Amendment) Bill, 2015 reads as under:\n\n\"2.\nThe Act\nwas enacted to provide for speedy disposal of cases relating to\narbitration with least court intervention. With the passage of time, some\ndifficulties in the applicability of the Act have been noticed. Interpretation of\nthe provisions of the Act by courts in some cases have resulted in delay of\ndisposal of arbitration proceedings and increase in interference of courts in\narbitration matters, which tend to defeat the object of the Act.\n\n* * *\n\n6. (iv) to provide that while considering any application for appointment of\narbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme Court shall examine the existence\nof a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues;\"\n\nNotes on the Clauses on amendment in\nSection 8\nread as follows:\n\n\"Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend\nSection 8\nof the principal Act to specify\nthat the judicial authority shall refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds\n\nPage 24 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nthat prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. A proviso below sub-\nsection (2) is inserted to provide that where the original arbitration\nagreement or certified copy thereof is not available with the party who apply\nunder sub-section (1), and is retained by the other party, such party shall file\na copy of the arbitration agreement along with application under sub-section\n(1) praying to the court to call upon the other party to produce the original\narbitration agreement or its duly certified copy before the court.\"\n\nOn amendment to\nSection 11\nby inserting sub-section (6-A), the following\nwas stated:\n\n\"Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend\nSection 11\nof the principal Act to provide\nthat appointment of arbitrator shall be made by the Supreme Court or the\nHigh Court, as the case may be, instead of the Chief Justice of India or the\nChief Justice of the High Court. Sub-section (6-A) is inserted to provide that\nthe Supreme Court or the High Court while considering application under\nsub-sections (4) to (6) shall confine to the examination of an arbitration\nagreement.\"\n\n46. The amendment which was made in\nSection 8\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996\ncame up for consideration before this Court in Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh\nEnterprises [Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises, where in paras 28\nand 30, it was stated as under : (SCC pp. 697-98)\n\"28. 'Principally four amendments to\nSection 8(1)\nhave been introduced by\nthe 2015 Amendments -- ( i) the relevant \"party\" that is entitled to apply\nseeking reference to arbitration has been clarified/amplified to include\npersons claiming \"through or under\" such a party to the arbitration\nagreement; (ii) scope of examination by the judicial authority is restricted to\na finding whether \"no valid arbitration agreement exists\" and the nature of\nexamination by the judicial authority is clarified to be on a \"prima facie\"\n\nbasis; (iii) the cut-off date by which an application under\nSection 8\nis to be\npresented has been defined to mean \"the date of\" submitting the first\nstatement on the substance of the dispute; and ( iv) the amendments are\nexpressed to apply notwithstanding any prior judicial precedent. The proviso\nto\nSection 8(2)\nhas been added to allow a party that does not possess the\noriginal or certified copy of the arbitration agreement on account of it being\nretained by the other party, to nevertheless apply under\nSection 8\nseeking\nreference, and call upon the other party to produce the same.' [Ref. : Justice\nR.S. Bachawat's Law of Arbitration and Conciliation , Sixth Edn., Vol. I\n(\nSections 1\nto\n) at p. 695 published by Lexis Nexis.]\n\n30. The language of amendment to\nSection 8\nof the Act is clear that the\namendment to\nSection 8(1)\nof the Act would apply notwithstanding any\nprayer, judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any other court.\nThe High Court laid emphasis upon the word '... unless it finds that prima\nfacie no valid agreement exists'.

After referring to\n\nPage 25 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nSukanya Holdings [Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya\n, (2003) 5\nSCC 531] and the amended\nSection 8\nand\nSection 45\nof the Act, the High\nCourt pointed out the difference in language of\nSection 8\nand\nSection 45\nof\nthe Act.\n\nThe High Court distinguished between\nSukanya Holdings [Sukanya\nHoldings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya\n, (\n2003) 5 SCC 531] and Chloro\nControls [Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd. v. Severn Trent Water Purification\nInc.\n, (2013) 1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ) 689] and observed that\nSukanya\nHoldings [Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya\n, (2003) 5 SCC\n531] was not overruled by\nChloro Controls [Chloro Controls India (P) Ltd. v.\nSevern Trent Water Purification Inc.\n, (2013) 1 SCC 641 : (2013) 1 SCC (Civ)\n689] \"\n\n47. This Court ultimately held that the main purpose of bringing an amendment\ninter alia in\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 was to minimise the\nscope of judicial authority, which was to refuse reference to arbitration only on\nthe ground when it prima facie finds that there was no valid arbitration\nagreement. The legislative intent for the amendment was confined to limiting\njudicial intervention, and once the Court finds that there is a valid arbitration\nagreement, it has no option but to refer the matter for arbitration. But this\nwould not mean that where the matter itself is non-arbitrable, or is covered by a\nspecial legislation such as the\nConsumer Protection Act\n, it still has to be\nreferred for arbitration. In para 59 of Emaar-3, it was stated as under : (SCC pp.\n781-82)\n\n\"59. The amendment in\nSection 8\ncannot be given such expansive meaning\nand intent so as to inundate entire regime of special legislations where such\ndisputes were held to be not arbitrable. Something which legislation never\nintended cannot be accepted as side wind to override the settled law. The\nsubmission of the petitioner that after the amendment the law as\nlaid down\nby\nthis Court in\nNational Seeds Corpn. [National Seeds Corpn. Ltd. v. M.\nMadhusudhan Reddy\n, (2012) 2 SCC 506 : (2012) 1 SCC (Civ) 908] is no more\na good law cannot be accepted. The words 'notwithstanding any judgment,\ndecree or order of the Supreme Court or any court' were meant only to those\nprecedents where it was laid down that the judicial authority while making\nreference under\nSection 8\nshall be entitled to look into various facets of the\narbitration agreement, subject-matter of the arbitration whether the claim is\nalive or dead, whether the arbitration agreement is null and void. The words\nadded in\nSection 8\ncannot be meant for any other meaning.\"\n\nEmaar-3 though ends with a caveat, where it leaves the option with the party\nwho may have an option to choose between a public or private forum, may\nconsciously choose to go for private fora. This is what it says : (SCC p. 783,\npara 63)\n\nPage 26 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n\"63. We may, however, hasten to add that in the event a person entitled to\nseek an additional special remedy provided under the statutes does not opt\nfor the additional/special remedy and he is a party to an arbitration\nagreement, there is no inhibition in disputes being proceeded in arbitration.\nIt is only the case where specific/special remedies are provided for and which\nare opted by an aggrieved person that judicial authority can refuse to\nrelegate the parties to the arbitration.\"\n\n48. Thus, in our considered opinion in the case at hand, the Telangana High\nCourt had adopted the right approach in its two impugned orders, where it\ndeclined to interfere in the matter and appoint an arbitrator.\n\n49. True in Emaar-3 this Court had examined the scope of sub-section (1) to\n\nSection 8\nand not of sub-section (6-A) to\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996.\nAll the same, the reasoning given in the above judgment would be equally\napplicable to\nSection 11\napplication before the High Court. Both the provisions\nincorporated in\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 [i.e. sub-\nsection (1) and sub-section (6-A) respectively], seemingly restrict the scope of\nthe examination by the courts concerned, in their reference to arbitration, or\nappointment of arbitrator, as the case might be, and the language being\ncommon, \"notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\" places a similar\nquestion before the two courts.\n\n50. More importantly, when the Principal Civil Court or a judicial authority\nsuch as consumer redressal forum can have powers to dismiss a\nSection 8\n\napplication on the ground of arbitrability of a dispute, will such powers not be\navailable with the High Courts? In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., it was decided\nby this Court that both\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 are\ncomplementary provisions.\nThis position has been reiterated, in the post-\namendment context, in\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. [Vidya Drolia\nv.\nDurga Trading Corpn.\n\n51. The application under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 for\nappointment of an arbitrator, was not maintainable in the present case, and\nconsequently we uphold the impugned orders dated 19-5-2022 and 25-11-2022,\nwhich held this position. We refrain from saying anything further on the matter\nas the dispute is still sub judice before the State Consumer Forum (appellate\nauthority). The appeals are hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.\"\n\nd) Paragraphs Nos.24 to 28 of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nNTPC Limited\n(Supra) are relevant and are set out\n\nhereunder:\n\nPage 27 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n\"24. Following the general rule and the principle\nlaid down in\nVidya Drolia, this\nCourt has consistently been holding that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred\nfirst authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability.\n\nIn\n\nPravin Electricals (P) Ltd. v. Galaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd.\n, Sanjiv Prakash v.\n\nSeema Kukreja, and Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd.\n, the parties were\nreferred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in each of these cases on the\nobjection of non-arbitrability was found to be inconclusive.\nFollowing the\nexception to the general principle that the Court may not refer parties to\narbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-\narbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. (hereinafter \"Nortel\nNetworks\") and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah &\nSons, arbitration was refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably\ntime-barred.\n\nEye of the needle\n\n25. The abovereferred precedents crystallise the position of law that the pre-\nreferral jurisdiction of the Courts under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is very narrow\nand inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry as to the\nparties to the agreement and the applicant's privity to the said agreement.\nThese are matters which require a thorough examination by the Referral Court.\nThe secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect\nto the non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n26. As a general rule and a principle, the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first\nauthority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. As an\nexception to the rule, and rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject\nclaims which are manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable. Explaining this\nposition, flowing from the principles laid down in Vidya Drolia, this Court in a\nsubsequent decision in Nortel Networks held : (Nortel Networks case, SCC p.\n764, para 45)\n\n\"45. ... 45.1. ... While exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11\nas the judicial\nforum, the Court may exercise the prima facie test to screen and knockdown\nex facie meritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of\nthe Courts would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the referral\nstage. At the referral stage, the Court can interfere \"only\" when it is\n\"manifest\" that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no\nsubsisting dispute.\"\n\n27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of a claim is only\nprima facie. Referral Courts must not undertake a full review of the contested\nfacts; they must only be confined to a primary first review and let facts speak for\nthemselves. This also requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion on\narbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead\nto a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is\nnon-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if there is the slightest doubt, the rule is\nto refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\nPage 28 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is necessary and\ncompelling. It is intertwined with the duty of the Referral Court to protect the\nparties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-\narbitrable. It has been termed as a legitimate interference by Courts to refuse\nreference in order to prevent wastage of public and private resources . Further,\nas noted in Vidya Drolia, if this duty within the limited compass is not\nexercised, and the Court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine\nthe effectiveness of both, arbitration and the Court. Therefore, this Court or a\nHigh Court, as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\n\nof the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to deliver a purported\ndispute raised by an applicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator , as explained\nin\nDLF Home Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd\n.\"\n\ne) Paragraph Nos.150 to 169, 219, 220 and 222 of the judgement of the 7\n\nJudge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra) are\n\nrelevant and are set out hereunder:\n\n\"150.\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act deals with the appointment of arbitrators.\nIt recognises the autonomy of the parties to agree upon a procedure for\nappointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators.\nSection 11\nrequires the intervention\nof the Court only when there is a deadlock or failure of the parties to follow the\nappointment procedure. In the process,\nSection 11\nis meant to give effect to the\nmutual intention of the parties to settle their disputes by arbitration in\nsituations where the parties fail to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators. In an\narbitration with three arbitrators, each party is required to appoint one\narbitrator each, and subsequently the two arbitrators will appoint the third\narbitrator.\nSection 11(6)\nconfers powers on the Supreme Court and the High\nCourt, as the case may be, on the failure of the parties to comply with the agreed\narbitration procedure.\nSection 11(6)\nenlists three possible defects in the\nappointment procedure, namely : first, a party fails to act as required by the\nagreed procedure; second, the parties or the two appointed arbitrators fail to\nreach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or third, a person,\nincluding an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to them or\nunder the agreed procedure.\n\n151.\nSection 11(6)\nhas had a long and chequered history before this Court,\nparticularly in respect of the nature of function of the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate in the appointment of an arbitrator. In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,\na seven-Judge Bench of this Court held that the power exercised by the Chief\nJustice of India or a Chief Justice of the High Court under\nSection 11(6)\nis a\njudicial power. In the process, this Court analysed the scope of the powers and\nauthority of the Referral Court under\nSection 11(6)\n. Moreover, this Court noted\nthat\nSections 8\nand\nare complementary in nature. Consequently, if the\n\nPage 29 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\njudicial authority acting under\nSection 8\nhas to mandatorily decide the issue of\njurisdiction before referring the parties to arbitration, the same standard of\nscrutiny was also held to be applicable to the reference under\nSection 11\n. In\nconclusion, it was held that the Chief Justice or their designate at the referral\nstage under\nSection 11(6)\nhad the right to determine all preliminary issues :\n\n(SCC pp. 663-664, para 74)\n\"47. ... (iv) The Chief Justice or the designated Judge will have the right to\ndecide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this\njudgment. These will be his own jurisdiction to entertain the request, the\nexistence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live\nclaim, the existence of the condition for the exercise of his power and on the\nqualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief Justice or the\ndesignated Judge would be entitled to seek the opinion of an institution in\nthe matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of\nSection 11(8)\nof\nthe Act if the need arises but the order appointing the arbitrator could only\nbe that of the Chief Justice or the designated Judge.\"\n\n152. The extent of judicial interference at the referral stage was scrutinised by a\nBench of two Judges of this Court in\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara\nPolyfab (P) Ltd. This\nCourt held that when the intervention of the Court is\nsought under\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, the following categories of issues\nwill arise before the Referral Court:\n\n152.1. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to decide.\n\nThese issues were : first, whether the party making the application has\napproached the appropriate High Court; and second, whether there is a valid\narbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under\nSection 11\n\nof the Act, is a party to such an agreement;\n\n152.2. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate may choose to decide\nor leave them to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first,\nwhether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live claim; and second,\nwhether the parties have concluded the contract/transaction by recording the\nsatisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final\npayment without objection; and\n\n152.3. The issues which the Chief Justice or their designate should leave\nexclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first, whether a claim\nmade falls within the arbitration clause (as for example, a matter which is\nreserved for final decision of a departmental authority and excepted or excluded\nfrom arbitration); and second, merits or any claim involved in the arbitration.\n\n153. The decisions of this Court in Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab allowed for\ngreater judicial interference at the pre-arbitral stage. In effect, the Referral\nCourts were encouraged to conduct mini trials instead of summarily dealing\nwith the preliminary issues. This was also noted by the Law Commission of\nIndia, which observed that judicial intervention in the arbitral proceedings is a\npervasive problem in India leading to significant delays in the arbitration\nprocess. The Law Commission recognised that one of the problems plaguing\n\nPage 30 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nimplementation of the\nArbitration Act\nwas that\nSection 11\napplications were\nkept pending for years by the Courts. To remedy the situation, the Law\nCommission proposed changing the then existing scheme of the power of\nappointment being vested in the \"Chief Justice\" to the \"High Court\" and the\n\"Supreme Court\". It also clarified that the power of appointment of arbitrators\nought not to be regarded as a judicial act.\n\n154. Significantly, the Law Commission observed that there was a need to\nreduce judicial intervention at the pre-arbitral stage, that is, prior to the\nconstitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Accordingly, it proposed limiting the\nscope of the judicial intervention at the referral stage under\nSections 8\nand\nof\nthe Arbitration Act \"to situations where the Court/Judicial Authority finds that\nthe arbitration agreement does not exist or is null and void\". The Law\nCommission suggested insertion of sub-section (6-A) under\nSection 11\nwhich\nwould read:\"Any appointment by the High Court or the person or institution\ndesignated by it under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) shall\nnot be made only if the High Court finds that the arbitration does not exist or is\nnull and void.\" In light of the recommendations of the Law Commission,\nParliament passed the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n\n(\"the 2015 Amendment Act\") to incorporate\nSection 11\n(6-A).\n\n155. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act states\nthat sub-section (6-A) is inserted in\nSection 11\nto provide that the Supreme\nCourt or the High Court while considering application under sub-sections (4) to\n(6) \"shall confine to the examination of an arbitration agreement\". With the\ncoming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, the nature of preliminary\nexamination at the referral stage under\nSection 11\nwas confined to the existence\nof an arbitration agreement. It also incorporates a non obstante clause which\ncovers \"any judgment, decree or order of any court\". By virtue of the non\nobstante clause,\nSection 11\n(6-A) has set out a new position of law, which takes\naway the basis of the position\nlaid down by\nthe previous decisions of this Court\nin Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab. It is also important to note that Parliament\ndid not incorporate the expression \"or is null and void\" as was suggested by the\nLaw Commission. This indicates that Parliament intended to confine the\njurisdiction of the Courts at the pre-arbitral stage to as minimum a level as\npossible.\n\n156. The effect and impact of the 2015 Amendment Act was subsequently\nclarified by this Court.\nIn\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. Kurien\nJoseph, J.\nnoted that the intention of the legislature in incorporating\nSection\n(6-A) was to limit the scope of the Referral Court's jurisdiction to only one\naspect -- the existence of an arbitration agreement. To determine the existence\nof an arbitration agreement, the Court only needs to examine whether the\nunderlying contract contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining\nto the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. This\n\nCourt further held\nthat\nSection 11\n(6-A) incorporates the principle of minimal\njudicial intervention : (SCC p. 765, para 59)\n\n\"59.\nThe scope of the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act was\n\nPage 31 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nconsiderably wide in view of the decisions in SBP & Co. [SBP & Co. v. Patel\nEngg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab. This position continued\ntill the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all that the\nCourts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists-nothing more,\nnothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is essentially to minimise the\nCourt's intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator and this\nintention as incorporated in\nSection 11\n(6-A) ought to be respected.\"\n\n157. In 2017, the High-Level Committee to Review the Institutionalisation of\nArbitration Mechanism in India submitted a report noting that while the 2015\namendment facilitated the speedy disposal of\nSection 11\napplications, they failed\nto limit judicial interference in arbitral proceedings. Accordingly, the High-\nLevel Committee recommended the amendment of\nSection 11\nto provide for\nappointment of arbitrators solely by arbitral institutions designated by the\nSupreme Court in case of international commercial arbitrations or the High\nCourt in case of all other arbitrations. In view of the report of the High-Level\nCommittee, Parliament enacted the\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)\nAct, 2019\n(\"the 2019 Amendment Act\") omitting\nSection 11\n(6-A) so as to leave\nthe appointment of arbitrators to arbitral institutions.\nSection 1(2)\nof the 2019\nAmendment Act provides that amended provisions shall come into force on\nsuch date as notified by the Central Government in the official gazette.\nHowever,\nSection 3\nof the 2019 Amendment Act which amended\nSection 11\nby\nomitting\nSection 11\n(6-A) is yet to be notified. Till such time,\nSection 11\n(6-A) will\ncontinue to operate.\n\n158.\nIn\nMayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman\n, a three-Judge\nBench of this Court affirmed the reasoning in\nDuro Felguera [Duro Felguera,\nS.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] by\nobserving that the examination under\nSection 11\n(6-A) is \"confined to the\nexamination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be\nunderstood in the narrow sense\". Moreover, it held that the position of law\nprior to the 2015 Amendment Act, as set forth by the decisions of this Court in\nPatel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab, has been legislatively overruled. Thus, this\nCourt gave effect to the intention of the legislature in minimising the role of the\nCourts at the pre-arbitral stage to the bare minimum.\n\n159. Thereafter, in Vidya Drolia , another three-Judge Bench of this Court,\naffirmed the ruling in Mayavati Trading that Patel Engg. has been legislatively\noverruled. In Vidya Drolia, one of the issues before this Court was whether the\nCourt at the reference stage or the Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration\nproceedings would decide the question of non-arbitrability. This Court began its\nanalysis by holding that an arbitration agreement has to satisfy the mandate of\nthe\nContract Act\n, in addition to satisfying the requirements stipulated under\n\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act to qualify as an agreement.\n\n160. In the course of the decision, one of the questions before this Court in\nVidya Drolia was the interpretation of the word \"existence\" as appearing in\n\nSection 11\n. It was held that existence and validity are intertwined. Further, it\nwas observed that an arbitration agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does\nnot satisfy mandatory legal requirements. Therefore, this Court read the\n\nPage 32 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nmandate of valid arbitration agreement contained in\nSection 8\ninto the mandate\nof\nSection 11\n, that is, \"existence of an arbitration agreement\".\n\n161. At the outset, Vidya Drolia noted that \"\nSection 11\nhas undergone another\namendment vide Act 33 of 2019 with effect from 9-8-2019.\" The purport of the\nomission of the said clause was further explained in the following terms : (SCC\np. 115, para 145)\n\"145. Omission of sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was with the specific\nobject and purpose and is relatable to by substitution of sub-sections (12), (13)\nand (14) of\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide sub-\nsection (3-A) stipulates that the High Court and this Court shall have the power\nto designate the arbitral institutions which have been so graded by the Council\nunder Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral institution is not available,\nthe High Court concerned shall maintain a panel of arbitrators for discharging\nthe function and thereupon the High Court shall perform the duty of an arbitral\ninstitution for reference to the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, it would be wrong\nto accept that post omission of sub-section (6-A) of\nSection 11\nthe ratio in Patel\nEngg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] would become\napplicable.\"\n\n162.Vidya Drolia proceeds on the presumption that\nSection 11\n(6-A) was\neffectively omitted from the statute books by the 2019 Amendment Act. This is\nalso reflected in the conclusion arrived at by the Court, as is evident from the\nfollowing extract : (SCC p. 121, para 154)\n\n\"154. ... 154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. on the scope of judicial\nreview by the Court while deciding an application under\nSections 8\nor 11 of\nthe\nArbitration Act\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with\nretrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post the amendments vide\nAct 33 of 2019 (with effect from 9-8-2019), is no longer applicable.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n163. We are of the opinion that the above premise of the Court in Vidya Drolia is\nerroneous because the omission of\nSection 11\n(6-A) has not been notified and,\ntherefore, the said provision continues to remain in full force. Since\nSection\n(6-A) continues to remain in force, pending the notification of the Central\nGovernment, it is incumbent upon this Court to give true effect to the legislative\nintent.\n\n164. The 2015 Amendment Act has laid down different parameters for judicial\nreview under\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\n. Where\nSection 8\nrequires the Referral\nCourt to look into the prima facie existence of a valid arbitration agreement,\n\nSection 11\nconfines the Court's jurisdiction to the examination of the existence\nof an arbitration agreement. Although the object and purpose behind both\n\nSections 8\nand\nis to compel parties to abide by their contractual\nunderstanding, the scope of power of the Referral Courts under the said\nprovisions is intended to be different. The same is also evident from the fact\nthat\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration Act allows an appeal from the order of an\n\nPage 33 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nArbitral Tribunal refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under\nSection 8\n, but\nnot from\nSection 11\n. Thus, the 2015 Amendment Act has legislatively overruled\nthe dictum of Patel Engg. where it was held that\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nare\ncomplementary in nature. Accordingly, the two provisions cannot be read as\nlaying down a similar standard.\n\n165. The legislature confined the scope of reference under\nSection 11\n(6-A) to the\nexamination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The use of the term\n\"examination\" in itself connotes that the scope of the power is limited to a\nprima facie determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code,\nthe requirement of \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement draws effect from\n\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act. In Duro Felguera, this Court held that the\nReferral Courts only need to consider one aspect to determine the existence of\nan arbitration agreement -- whether the underlying contract contains an\narbitration agreement which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes\nwhich have arisen between the parties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of\nexamination under\nSection 11\n(6-A) should be confined to the existence of an\narbitration agreement on the basis of\nSection 7\n. Similarly, the validity of an\narbitration agreement, in view of\nSection 7\n, should be restricted to the\nrequirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement be in\nwriting. This interpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-\ncompetence by leaving the issue of substantive existence and validity of an\narbitration agreement to be decided by Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection 16\n. We\naccordingly clarify the position of law laid down in Vidya Drolia in the context\nof\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n166. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement generally lies\non the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In jurisdictions such as India,\nwhich accept the doctrine of competence-competence, only prima facie proof of\nthe existence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral\nCourt. The Referral Court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial\nby allowing the parties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of the existence and\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of evidence ought to be left to\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. This position of law can also be gauged from the plain\nlanguage of the statute.\n\n167.\nSection 11\n(6-A) uses the expression \"examination of the existence of an\narbitration agreement\". The purport of using the word \"examination\" connotes\nthat the legislature intends that the Referral Court has to inspect or scrutinise\nthe dealings between the parties for the existence of an arbitration agreement.\nMoreover, the expression \"examination\" does not connote or imply a laborious\nor contested inquiry. On the other hand,\nSection 16\nprovides that the Arbitral\nTribunal can \"rule\" on its jurisdiction, including the existence and validity of an\narbitration agreement. A \"ruling\" connotes adjudication of disputes after\nadmitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the Referral\nCourt is only required to examine the existence of arbitration agreements,\nwhereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction, including the\nissues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A\nsimilar view was adopted by this Court in\nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh\n\nPage 34 of 44\n\nOCTOBER\n03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nOptifibre Ltd.\n\n168.\nIn\nShin-Etsu [Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd.\n, (2005) 7\nSCC 234] , this Court was called upon to determine the nature of adjudication\ncontemplated by unamended\nSection 45\nof the Arbitration Act when the\nobjection with regards to the arbitration agreement being \"null and void,\ninoperative or incapable of being performed\" is raised before a judicial\nauthority. Writing for the majority, B.N. Srikrishna, J. held that Section 45 does\nnot require the judicial authority to give a final determination. The Court\nobserved that : (SCC p. 267, para 74)\n\n\"74. There are distinct advantages in veering to the view that Section 45 does\nnot require a final determinative finding by the Court. First, under the Rules\nof Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (as in force with\neffect from 1-1-1998), as in the present case, invariably the Arbitral Tribunal\nis vested with the power to rule upon its own jurisdiction. Even if the Court\ntakes the view that the arbitral agreement is not vitiated or that it is not\ninvalid, inoperative or unenforceable, based upon purely a prima facie view,\nnothing prevents the arbitrator from trying the issue fully and rendering a\nfinal decision thereupon. If the arbitrator finds the agreement valid, there is\nno problem as the arbitration will proceed and the award will be made.\nHowever, if the arbitrator finds the agreement invalid, inoperative or void,\nthis means that the party who wanted to proceed for arbitration was given an\nopportunity of proceeding to arbitration, and the arbitrator after fully trying\nthe issue has found that there is no scope for arbitration. Since the\narbitrator's finding would not be an enforceable award, there is no need to\ntake recourse to the judicial intercession available under Section 48(1)( a) of\nthe Act.\"\n\n169. When the Referral Court renders a prima facie opinion, neither the Arbitral\nTribunal, nor the Court enforcing the arbitral award will be bound by such a\nprima facie view. If a prima facie view as to the existence of an arbitration\nagreement is taken by the Referral Court, it still allows the Arbitral Tribunal to\nexamine the issue in depth. Such a legal approach will help the Referral Court in\nweeding out prima facie non-existent arbitration agreements. It will also protect\nthe jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunals to decide on issues\npertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement.\n\n219. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act are as\nfollows:\n\n\"6. (iii) an application for appointment of an arbitrator shall be disposed of\nby the High Court or Supreme Court, as the case may be, as expeditiously as\npossible and an endeavour should be made to dispose of the matter within a\nperiod of sixty days.\n\n(iv) to provide that while considering any application for appointment of\narbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme Court shall examine the existence\n\nPage 35 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nof a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues.\"\n\n220. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High Court at the\nstage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall \"examine the existence of a\nprima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues\". These other issues not\nonly pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also include any\nother issues which are a consequence of unnecessary judicial interference in the\narbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the \"other issues\" also include\nexamination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by the Referral\nCourt at the\nSection 8\nor\nSection 11\nstage. The process of examination,\nimpounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument under the\nStamp Act\n\nis not a time-bound process, and therefore does not align with the stated goal of\nthe\nArbitration Act\nto ensure expeditious and time-bound appointment of\narbitrators. Therefore, even though the Law Commission of India Report or the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act do not\nspecifically refer to SMS Tea Estates, it nevertheless does not make any\ndifference to the position of law as has been set out above.\n\n222. The scope of authority of an Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection 16\nis wide\nbecause it can deal with issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an\narbitration agreement. In his dissenting opinion in N.N. Global (2), Roy, J.\ncorrectly observes that since \"[s]ection 16 specifically deals with both existence\nand validity whereas\nSection 11\nonly deals with existence, the former should be\ngiven more weight.\" This observation comports with the stated goal of the\n\nArbitration Act\nto minimise the supervisory role of Courts in the arbitral\nprocess. Post the 2015 Amendment Act the Referral Courts are only required to\nprima facie determine the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement. The\nbasis for such prima facie determination lies in the fact that the Arbitral\nTribunal will later have the competence to rule on the issue of existence and\nvalidity of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the separability presumption\napplies at the referral stage.\n\nf) Paragraph Nos.110 to 114, 117, 118, 122 to 125 of the judgement of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in SBI General Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) are\n\nrelevant and are set out hereunder:\n\n\"110. The scope of examination under\nSection 11\n(6-A) is confined to the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of\nSection 7\n. The examination\nof validity of the arbitration agreement is also limited to the requirement of\nformal validity such as the requirement that the agreement should be in writing.\n\nPage 36 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n111. The use of the term 'examination' under\nSection 11\n(6-A) as distinguished\nfrom the use of the term 'rule' under\nSection 16\nimplies that the scope of\nenquiry under\nsection 11\n(6-A) is limited to a prima facie scrutiny of the\nexistence of the arbitration agreement, and does not include a contested or\nlaborious enquiry, which is left for the arbitral tribunal to 'rule' under Section\n\n16. The prima facie view on existence of the arbitration agreement taken by the\nreferral court does not bind either the arbitral tribunal or the court enforcing\nthe arbitral award.\n\n112. The aforesaid approach serves a two-fold purpose - firstly, it allows the\nreferral court to weed out non-existent arbitration agreements, and secondly, it\nprotects the jurisdictional competence of the arbitral tribunal to rule on the\nissue of existence of the arbitration agreement in depth.\n\n113. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and\nConciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it was observed in In Re : Interplay\n(supra) that the High Court and the Supreme Court at the stage of appointment\nof arbitrator shall examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement\nand not any other issues. The relevant observations are extracted hereinbelow:\n\n\"209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High Court at\nthe stage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall \"examine the existence of\na prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues\". These other issues\nnot only pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also include\nany other issues which are a consequence of unnecessary judicial\ninterference in the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the \"other issues\"\n\nalso include examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by\nthe referral court at the\nSection 8\nor\nSection 11\nstage. The process of\nexamination, impounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument under\nthe\nStamp Act\nis not a timebound process, and therefore does not align with\nthe stated goal of the\nArbitration Act\nto ensure expeditious and time-bound\nappointment of arbitrators.

In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re : Interplay (supra),\nit is clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of arbitrator is\nlimited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the arbitration agreement, and\nnothing else.\nFor this reason, we find it difficult to hold that the observations\nmade in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra) and adopted in\nNTPC v. SPML\n(supra) that the\njurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the issue of \"accord and\nsatisfaction\" under\nSection 11\nextends to weeding out ex-facie non-arbitrable\nand frivolous disputes would continue to apply despite the subsequent decision\nin In Re : Interplay (supra).\n\n117. By referring disputes to arbitration and appointing an arbitrator by exercise\n\nPage 37 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nof the powers under\nSection 11\n, the referral court upholds and gives effect to the\noriginal understanding of the contracting parties that the specified disputes\nshall be resolved by arbitration. Mere appointment of the arbitral tribunal\ndoesn't in any way mean that the referral court is diluting the sanctity of\n\"accord and satisfaction\" or is allowing the claimant to walk back on its\ncontractual undertaking. On the contrary, it ensures that the principal of\narbitral autonomy is upheld and the legislative intent of minimum judicial\ninterference in arbitral proceedings is given full effect. Once the arbitral\ntribunal is constituted, it is always open for the defendant to raise the issue of\n\"accord and satisfaction\" before it, and only after such an objection is rejected\nby the arbitral tribunal, that the claims raised by the claimant can be\nadjudicated.\n\n118. Tests like the \"eye of the needle\" and \"ex-facie meritless\", although try to\nminimise the extent of judicial interference, yet they require the referral court\nto examine contested facts and appreciate prima facie evidence (however\nlimited the scope of enquiry may be) and thus are not in conformity with the\nprinciples of modern arbitration which place arbitral autonomy and judicial\nnon-interference on the highest pedestal.\n\n122. Once an arbitration agreement exists between parties, then the option of\napproaching the civil court becomes unavailable to them. In such a scenario, if\nthe parties seek to raise a dispute, they necessarily have to do so before the\narbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal, in turn, can only be constituted as per\nthe procedure agreed upon between the parties. However, if there is a failure of\nthe agreed upon procedure, then the duty of appointing the arbitral tribunal\nfalls upon the referral court under\nSection 11\nof the Act, 1996. If the referral\ncourt, at this stage, goes beyond the scope of enquiry as provided under the\nsection and examines the issue of \"accord and satisfaction\", then it would\namount to usurpation of the power which the parties had intended to be\nexercisable by the arbitral tribunal alone and not by the national courts. Such a\nscenario would impeach arbitral autonomy and would not fit well with the\nscheme of the Act, 1996.\n\n123. The power available to the referral courts has to be construed in the light of\nthe fact that no right to appeal is available against any order passed by the\nreferral court under\nSection 11\nfor either appointing or refusing to appoint an\narbitrator. Thus, by delving into the domain of the arbitral tribunal at the\nnascent stage of\nSection 11\n, the referral courts also run the risk of leaving the\nclaimant in a situation wherein it does not have any forum to approach for the\nadjudication of its claims, if it\nSection 11\napplication is rejected.\n\n124.\nSection 11\nalso envisages a time-bound and expeditious disposal of the\napplication for appointment of arbitrator. One of the reasons for this is also the\nfact that unlike\nSection 8\n, once an application under\nSection 11\nis filed,\narbitration cannot commence until the arbitral tribunal is constituted by the\nreferral court. This Court, on various occasions, has given directions to the High\nCourts for expeditious disposal of pending\nSection 11\napplications. It has also\n\nPage 38 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\ndirected the litigating parties to refrain from filing bulky pleadings in matters\npertaining to\nSection 11\n. Seen thus, if the referral courts go into the details of\nissues pertaining to \"accord and satisfaction\" and the like, then it would become\nrather difficult to achieve the objective of expediency and simplification of\npleadings.\n\n27. A perusal of these judgements shows that, prior to the judgement of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), the scope of interference by\n\nthe Court in proceedings under\nSection 11\nof the Act was slightly wider.\n\nHowever, the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra)\n\nhas narrowed down the scope. In Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt has held that the scope of examination under\nsection 11 (6A)\nshould be\n\nconfined to the existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of\nSection 7\n\nof the Act. Similarly, the validity of an arbitration agreement, in view of\n\nSection 7\nof the Act, should be restricted to the requirement of formal validity\n\nsuch as the requirement that the agreement be in writing. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has held that this interpretation gives true effect to the\n\ndoctrine of competence - competence by leaving the issue of substantive\n\nexistence and validity of an arbitration agreement to be decided by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal under\nSection 16\nof the Act.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nInterplay (Supra) accordingly clarified the position of law laid down in\nVidya\n\nDrolia and Others\n(Supra) in the context of\nSection 8\nand\nSection 11\nof the\n\nAct in the aforesaid terms.\nFurther, in Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held that, in jurisdictions such as India, which accept the\n\nPage 39 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\ndoctrine of competence - competence, only prima facie proof of the\n\nexistence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral\n\nCourt. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Referral Court is not the\n\nappropriate forum to conduct a mini trial by allowing the parties to adduce\n\nevidence in regard to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement.\n\nThe determination of the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement\n\non the basis of evidence ought to be left to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n28. Further, in Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n\nSection 11 (6A)\nuses the expression \"examination of the existence of an\n\narbitration agreement\". The purpose of using the word \"examination\"\n\nconnotes that the legislature intended that the Referral Court had to inspect\n\nor scrutinize the dealings between the parties for the existence of an\n\narbitration agreement. Moreover, the expression \"examination\" does not\n\nconnote or imply a laborious or contested inquiry. On the other hand,\n\nSection 16\nprovided that the Arbitral Tribunal can 'rule' on its jurisdiction,\n\nincluding the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court further held that a 'ruling' connotes adjudication of disputes\n\nafter admitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the\n\nReferral Court was only required to examine the existence of arbitration\n\nagreements, whereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction,\n\nPage 40 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nincluding the issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration\n\nagreement.\n\n29. The aforesaid position in law laid down by Interplay (Supra) has been\n\nconfirmed by the subsequent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI\n\nGeneral Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) referred to hereinabove.\n\n30. In my view, in the light of the aforesaid position in law laid down by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), the objections raised by the\n\nRespondents cannot be gone into by this Court in the present Application\n\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n31. The objections of the Respondents, namely (i) that the disputes\n\nraised by the Applicant are not non-arbitrable as they are barred by the\n\nprovisions of the SARFAESI Act and the RDDB Act, (ii) that the Applicant\n\nhad waived its right to arbitration by filing a Summary Suit in this Court and\n\n(iii) that allowing of this Application would lead to multiplicity of\n\nproceedings, are not objections regarding the existence of an arbitration\n\nagreement, on the basis of\nSection 7\nof the Act nor are they objections\n\nregarding the validity of the arbitration agreement. In view of\nSection 7\nof the\n\nAct, objections as to validity should be restricted to the requirements of\n\nPage 41 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\nformal validity such as the requirement that the agreement be in writing.\n\nTherefore on the basis of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nInterplay (Supra), I hold that the objections raised by the Respondents\n\ncannot be gone into by this Court in this Application under\nSection 11\nof the\n\nAct.\n\n32. As laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), in\n\nan Application under\nSection 11\nof the Act, this Court has only to prima facie\n\ndetermine whether an Arbitration Agreement exists as required by the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 7\nof the Act. In the present case, there exists an\n\nArbitration Agreement between the parties as contained in clause (k) of the\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. The correspondence between the\n\nparties shows that disputes and differences have arisen between the parties.\n\nThe Applicant has invoked the arbitration agreement contained in the said\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019 by its Advocate's letter dated 6 April\n\n2021. In these circumstances, I hold that an arbitration agreement exists\n\nbetween the parties and an Arbitrator would have to be appointed in order to\n\narbitrate upon all disputes and differences arising between the parties under\n\nthe said Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019. Needless to add, that the\n\nRespondents will be at liberty to raise the objections raised by them to the\n\npresent Application before the Arbitrator.\n\nPage 42 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n33. In light of the aforesaid discussion, and for the aforesaid reasons, the\n\nfollowing order is passed:\n\n(a) Mr. Shanay Shah, an Advocate practising in this Court, is\nappointed as the Arbitrator to arbitrate upon all the disputes\nand differences between the parties under the said Sanction\nletter dated 19th August 2019. Details of Mr. Shanay Shah, who is\nappointed as an Arbitrator, are as under:-\n\nName :- Mr. Shanay Shah (Advocate)\nMobile No. :- 9987483450\nEmail :-\n[email protected]\n\nAddress :- Office No.17-A, 4th Floor, Surya Mahal,\nBurjorji Bharucha Marg, Fort,\nMumbai 400 023.\n\n(b) The Advocates for the Applicant shall intimate the\n\nArbitrator about his appointment within a period of one\nweek from the date of uploading of this order;\n\n(c) In addition, the Office of the Prothonotary and Senior\nMaster of this Court shall also intimate the Arbitrator\nabout his appointment within a period of one week from\nthe date of uploading of this order.\n\n(d) The Arbitrator so appointed to make the disclosure as\nrequired under the provisions of the Act within a period\nof one week from the date of intimation of his\nappointment;\n\nPage 43 of 44\n\nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\ncarap168-23.doc\n\n(e) The Arbitrator shall charge fees as per the Rules framed by\nthis Court in that regard;\n\n34. The Arbitration Application is accordingly disposed of.\n\n35. It is made clear that the Respondents will be at liberty to raise the\n\nobjections raised by them to the present Application before the arbitrator.\n\n[FIRDOSH P.
