The petitioners have filed this petition seeking the following\n\nrelief(s):-\n\n\"10.1 \"The Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ncall for the entire records pertaining to the promotion\ncase of the petitioners for its kind perusal.\n10.2 The Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to set\naside the order impugned dated 01.02.2014\n(Annexure P/1) issued by the respondent No.2.\n10.3 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ndirect the respondent authorities, particularly the\nrespondent No.2 to consider the name of the\npetitioners for their next promotion to the post of\nSubedar (M) w.e.f. 2005 instead of 2009 with all\nconsequential benefits.\n\n10.4 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ndirect the respondent authorities, particularly the\nrespondent No.2 to recall the gradation list issued for\nthe year 2013(Annexure P/8) and place the name of\nthe petitioners in pursuance to the gradation list of\n2003 (Annexure P/7).\n\n10.5 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ndirect the respondent authorities, particularly the\nrespondent No.2 place the name of respondents No.4\n& 5 at the fag end of the gradation list in view of GOP\nNo.55 (Annexure P/2) and Rule 2005 (Annexure P/4).\n10.6 That, the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ngrant any other relief, as if may deem fit and\nappropriate.\n\n10.7 Cost of the petition may also be given.\"\n\n2. Mr. Kar, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\n\nsubmitted that the petitioners were holding the post of Sub-\n\nInspector (M) under the Police Head Quarter, General Branch,\n\nRaipur in the year 2005. He further submitted that respondents No.\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n4 & 5 were juniors to the petitioners who were promoted to the\n\npost of Subedar (M) and the candidature of the petitioners was not\n\nconsidered by the Departmental Promotion Committee for the\n\nreasons best known to it. He also submitted that the petitioners\n\nwere promoted to the post of Subedar (M) in the year 2009 and a\n\nseniority list was published in the year 2013, then they came to\n\nknow that they had been placed below respondents No. 4 & 5 in\n\nthe gradation list. He further argued that the petitioners are entitled\n\nto get the seniority and consequential benefits from the year 2005\n\nwhen respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted.\n\n3. On the other hand, Ms. Sonkar, the learned Panel Lawyer\n\nappearing for the State would oppose the submissions made by\n\nMr. Kar. Ms. Sonkar submitted that respondents No. 4 & 5 were\n\ntransferred to the State of Chhattisgarh on the mutual ground and\n\nthereafter, the seniority list was published. She further submitted\n\nthat respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted to the post of Subedar\n\n(M) in the year 2005 but no action was taken by the petitioners. In\n\nthe year 2009, the petitioners were also promoted to the post of\n\nSubedar (M). She also submitted that the gradation list was\n\npublished in the year 2005 and thereafter, in the year 2009, and\n\nthe subsequent gradation list was published in the year 2013. She\n\nfurther argued that the petitioners have approached this Court\n\nclaiming therein seniority from the year 2005 when respondents\n\nNo. 4 & 5 were promoted. She also stated that the claim of the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\npetitioners is stale as the instant petition has been filed after a\n\nlapse of nine years without explaining the reasons for the delay.\n\n4. I have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and\n\nperused the documents placed on record.\n\n5. In the present petition, the petitioners have not pleaded when they\n\nwere appointed and when respondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted\n\nto the post of Subedar (M). Even the date of the meeting of DPC\n\nhas not been pleaded in the instant writ petition. Admittedly,\n\nrespondents No. 4 & 5 were promoted to the post of Subedar (M)\n\nin the year 2005. It is pleaded that respondents No. 4 & 5 were\n\ntransferred to the State of Chhattisgarh after the reorganization of\n\nthe State of Chhattisgarh by mutual consent, therefore, they\n\nshould have been placed below the petitioners in the gradation list.\n\nThe contention raised by the learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners appears to be reasonable but the petitioners failed to\n\nchallenge the gradation list as well as the order of promotion which\n\nwas passed in the year 2005. After the year 2005, the petitioners\n\nwere promoted to the post of Subedar (M) in the year 2009. In the\n\nyear 2014, the present petition was filed claiming therein seniority\n\nfrom the year 2005.\n\n6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of\nChennai\n\nMetropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board and Others\n\nVs. T.T. Murali Babu\nreported in (2014) 4 SCC 108 held as\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\nunder:-\n\n'17. In the case at hand, though there has been four\nyears' delay in approaching the court, yet the writ court\nchose not to address the same. It is the duty of the court\nto scrutinize whether such enormous delay is to be\nignored without any justification. That apart, in the\npresent case, such belated approach gains more\nsignificance as the respondent employee being\nabsolutely careless to his duty and nurturing a\nlackadaisical attitude to the responsibility had remain\nunauthorizedly absent on the pretext of some kind of ill\nhealth. We repeat at the cost of repetition that remaining\ninnocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the\ncause of justice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for\nit is likely to affect others. Such delay may have impact\non others' ripened rights and may unnecessarily drag\nothers into litigation which in acceptable realm of\nprobability, may have been treated to have attained\nfinality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such\nindolent persons -who compete with \"Kumbhakarna\" or\nfor that matter \"Rip Van Winkle\" . In our considered\nopinion, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and\non the said ground alone the writ court should have\nthrown the petition overboard at the very threshold.\n\n7. Recently, the Apex Court in the matter of\nRushibhai\n\nJagdishbhai Pathak Vs. Bhavnagar Municipal Corporation\n\nreported in 2022 SCC Online SC 64 held as under:-\n\n'9. The doctrine of delay and laches, or for that matter\nstatutes of limitation, are considered to be statutes of\nrepose and statutes of peace, though some contrary\nopinions have been expressed (in Nav Rattanmal Vs.\nstate of Rajasthan, AIR 1961 SC 1704). The courts have\nexpressed the view that the law of limitation rests on the\nfoundations of greater public interest for three reasons,\nnamely, (a) that long dormant claims have more of\ncruelty than justice in them; (b) that a defendant might\nhave lost the evidence to disapprove a stale claim; and\n\n(iii) that persons with good causes of action (who are\nable to enforce them) should pursue them with\nreasonable diligence (\nState of Kerala Vs. V.R.\nKalliyanikutty\n, (1999) 3 SCC 657 relying on Halsbury's\nLaws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 28, para 605; Halsbury's\nLaws of England , Vol. 68 (2021) para 1005. Equally,\nchange in de facto position or character, creation of third\nparty rights over a period of time, waiver, acquiesce, and\nneed to ensure certitude in dealings, are equitable public\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\npolicy considerations why period of limitation is\nprescribed by law. Law of limitation does not apply to\nwrit petitions, albeit the discretion vested with a\nconstitutional court is exercised with caution as delay\nand laches principle is applied with the aim to secure the\nquiet of the community, suppress fraud and perjury,\nquicken diligence, and prevent oppression.\n(see\nPopat\nand Kotecha Property Vs. State Bank of India Staff\nAssociation\n(2005) 7 SCC 510).Therefore, some\ndecisions and judgments do not look upon pleas of delay\nand laches with favour, especially and rightly in cases\nwhere the persons suffer from adeptness, or incapacity\nto approach the courts for relief. However, other\ndecisions, while accepting the rules of limitation as well\nas delay and laches, have observed that such rules are\nnot meant to destroy the rights of the parties but serve a\nlarger public interest and are founded on public policy.\n\nThere must be a lifespan during which a person must\napproach the court for their remedy. Otherwise, there\nwould be unending uncertainty as to the rights and\nobligations of the parties. (See\nN. Blarkrishnan Vs. M.\nKrishnamurthy\n, (1998)7 SCC 123.\nReferring to the\nprinciple of delay and laches, this Court, way back in\nMoons Mils Ltd Vs. M.R. Mehar, President, Industrial\nCourt, Bombay AIR 1967 SC 1450, had referred to the\nview expressed by Sir Barnes Peacock in The Lindsay\nPetroleum Company and Prosper Armstrong Hurd,\nAbram Farewell, and John Kemp, (L.R.) 5 P.C.221 in the\nfollowing words:\n\n\" Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an\narbitrary or a technical doctrine, Where it would be\npractically unjust to give a remedy, either because the\nparty has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be\nregarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by this\nconduct and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving\nthat remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in\nwhich it would not be reasonable to place him if the\nremedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of\nthese cases, lapse of time and delay are most material.\nBut in every case,if an argument against relief, which\notherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay,\nthat delay of course not amounting to a bar by any\nstatute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be\ntried upon principles substantially equitable. Two\ncircumstances, always important in such cases, are, the\nlength of the delay and the nature of the acts done\nduring the interval, which might affect either party and\ncause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one\ncourse or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.\"\n\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\n8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of\nBichitrananda\n\nBehera Vs. State of Orissa and others\nreported in 2023 Livelaw\n\n(SC) 883, under relevant para 21 held as under:-\n\n\"21. Profitably, we may reproduce relevant\npassagesfrom certain decisions of this Court:\n\n(\nA) Union of India v Tarsem Singh\n, (2008) 8 SCC 648:\n\n\"To summarise, normally, a belated service related claim\nwill be rejected on the ground of delay and laches\n(where remedy is sought by filing a writ petition) or\nlimitation (where remedy is sought by an application to\nthe Administrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions to\nthe said rule is cases relating to a continuing wrong.\nWhere a service related claim is based on a continuing\nwrong, relief can be granted even if there is a long delay\nin seeking remedy, with reference to the date on which\nthe continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing\nwrong creates a continuing source of injury. But there is\nan exception to the exception. If the grievance is in\nrespect of any order or administrative decision which\nrelated to or affected several others also, and if the\nreopening of the issue would affect the settled rights of\nthird parties, then the claim will not be entertained. For\nexample, if the issue relates to payment or refixation of\npay or pension, relief may be granted in spite of delay\nas it does not affect the rights of third parties. But if the\nclaim involved issues relating to seniority or promotion,\netc., affecting others, delay would render the claim stale\nand doctrine of laches/limitation will be applied. Insofar\nas the consequential relief of recovery of arrears for a\npast period is concerned, the principles relating to\nrecurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a\nconsequence, the High Courts will restrict the\nconsequential relief relating to arrears normally to a\nperiod of three years prior to the date of filing of the writ\npetition.\" (emphasis supplied)\n(B) Union of India v N Murugesan, (2022) 2 SCC 25:\n\n\"Delay, laches and acquiescence\n\n20. The principles governing delay, laches, and\nacquiescence are overlapping and interconnected on\nmany occasions. However, they have their distinct\ncharacters and distinct elements. One can say that\ndelay is the genus to which laches and acquiescence\nare species. Similarly, laches might be called a genus to\na species by name acquiescence. However, there may\nbe a case where acquiescence is involved, but not\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\nlaches. These principles are common law principles,\nand perhaps one could identify that these principles find\nplace in various statutes which restrict the period of\nlimitation and create non consideration of condonation\nin certain circumstances. They are bound to be applied\nby way of practice requiring prudence of the court than\nof a strict application of law. The underlying principle\ngoverning these concepts would be one of estoppel.\nThe question of prejudice is also an important issue to\nbe taken note of by the court.\n\nLaches\n\n21. The word \"laches\" is derived from the French\nlanguage meaning \"remissness and slackness\". It thus\ninvolves unreasonable delay or negligence in pursuing\na claim involving an equitable relief while causing\nprejudice to the other party. It is neglect on the part of a\nparty to do an act which law requires while asserting a\nright, and therefore, must stand in the way of the party\ngetting relief or remedy.\n\n22. Two essential factors to be seen are the length of\nthe delay and the nature of acts done during the\ninterval. As stated, it would also involve acquiescence\non the part of the party approaching the court apart from\nthe change in position in the interregnum. Therefore, it\nwould be unjustifiable for a Court of Equity to confer a\nremedy on a party who knocks its doors when his acts\nwould indicate a waiver of such a right. By his conduct,\nhe has put the other party in a particular position, and\ntherefore, it would be unreasonable to facilitate a\nchallenge before the court. Thus, a man responsible for\nhis conduct on equity is not expected to be allowed to\navail a remedy.\n\n23. A defence of laches can only be allowed when there\nis no statutory bar. The question as to whether there\nexists a clear case of laches on the part of a person\nseeking a remedy is one of fact and so also that of\nprejudice. The said principle may not have any\napplication when the existence of fraud is pleaded and\nproved by the other side. To determine the difference\nbetween the concept of laches and acquiescence is\nthat, in a case involving mere laches, the principle of\nestoppel would apply to all the defences that are\navailable to a party. Therefore, a defendant can\nsucceed on the various grounds raised by the plaintiff,\nwhile an issue concerned alone would be amenable to\nacquiescence.\n\nAcquiescence\n\n24. We have already discussed the relationship\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\nbetween acquiescence on the one hand and delay and\nlaches on the other.\n\n25. Acquiescence would mean a tacit or passive\nacceptance. It is implied and reluctant consent to an\nact. In other words, such an action would qualify a\npassive assent. Thus, when acquiescence takes place,\nit presupposes knowledge against a particular act. From\nthe knowledge comes passive acceptance, therefore\ninstead of taking any action against any alleged refusal\nto perform the original contract, despite adequate\nknowledge of its terms, and instead being allowed to\ncontinue by consciously ignoring it and thereafter\nproceeding further, acquiescence does take place. As a\nconsequence, it reintroduces a new implied agreement\nbetween the parties. Once such a situation arises, it is\nnot open to the party that acquiesced itself to insist\nupon the compliance of the original terms. Hence, what\nis essential, is the conduct of the parties. We only dealt\nwith the distinction involving a mere acquiescence.\nWhen acquiescence is followed by delay, it may\nbecome laches. Here again, we are inclined to hold that\nthe concept of acquiescence is to be seen on a case-to-\ncase basis.\" (emphasis supplied)\n(C) Chairman, State Bank of India v M J James, (2022)\n2 SCC 301:\n\n\"36. What is a reasonable time is not to be put in a\nstraitjacket formula or judicially codified in the form of\ndays, etc. as it depends upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. A right not exercised for a\nlong time is nonexistent. Doctrine of delay and laches\nas well as acquiescence are applied to non-suit the\nlitigants who approach the court/appellate authorities\nbelatedly without any justifiable explanation for bringing\naction after unreasonable delay. In the present case,\nchallenge to the order of dismissal from service by way\nof appeal was after four years and five months, which is\ncertainly highly belated and beyond justifiable time.\nWithout satisfactory explanation justifying the delay, it is\ndifficult to hold that the appeal was preferred within a\nreasonable time. Pertinently, the challenge was\nprimarily on the ground that the respondent was not\nallowed to be represented by a representative of his\nchoice. The respondent knew that even if he were to\nsucceed on this ground, as has happened in the writ\nproceedings, fresh inquiry would not be prohibited as\nfinality is not attached unless there is a legal or statutory\nbar, an aspect which has been also noticed in the\nimpugned judgment. This is highlighted to show the\nprejudice caused to the appellants by the delayed\nchallenge. We would, subsequently, examine the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\nquestion of acquiescence and its judicial effect in the\ncontext of the present case.\n\nXxx\n\n38.\nIn\nRam Chand v. Union of India [Ram Chand\nv.\nUnion of India, (1994) 1 SCC 44] and State of U.P. v.\nManohar [State of U.P. v. Manohar, (2005) 2 SCC 126]\nthis Court observed that if the statutory authority has not\nperformed its duty within a reasonable time, it cannot\njustify the same by taking the plea that the person who\nhas been deprived of his rights has not approached the\nappropriate forum for relief. If a statutory authority does\nnot pass any orders and thereby fails to comply with the\nstatutory mandate within reasonable time, they normally\nshould not be permitted to take the defence of laches\nand delay.\n\nIf at all, in such cases, the delay furnishes a\ncause of action, which in some cases as elucidated in\n\nUnion of India v. Tarsem Singh [Union of India\nv. Tarsem\nSingh, (2008) 8 SCC 648 : (2008) 2 SCC (L&S) 765]\nmay be continuing cause of action.The State being a\nvirtuous litigant should meet the genuine claims and not\ndeny them for want of action on their part. However, this\ngeneral principle would not apply when, on\nconsideration of the facts, the court concludes that the\nrespondent had abandoned his rights, which may be\neither express or implied from his conduct.\n\nAbandonment implies intentional act to acknowledge,\nas has been held in para 6 of Motilal Padampat Sugar\nMills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. [Motilal Padampat Sugar\nMills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., (1979) 2 SCC 409 : 1979\nSCC (Tax) 144] Applying this principle of acquiescence\nto the precept of delay and laches, this Court in U.P. Jal\nNigam v.Jaswant\nSingh [U.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant\nSingh\n, (2006) 11 SCC 464 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 500]\nafter referring to several judgments, has accepted the\nfollowing elucidation in Halsbury's Laws of England :\n\n(\nJaswant Singh\ncase [\nU.P. Jal Nigam v. Jaswant Singh\n,\n(2006) 11 SCC 464 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 500] , SCC\npp. 470-71, paras 1213)\n\"12. The statement of law has also been summarised in\nHalsbury's Laws of England, Para 911,p. 395 as follows:\n\n'In determining whether there has been such delay as to\namount to laches, the chief points to be considered are:\n\n(i) acquiescence on the claimant's part;and\n\n(ii) any change of position that has occurred on the\ndefendant's part.\n\nAcquiescence in this sense does not mean standing by\nwhile the violation of a right is in progress,but assent\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\nafter the violation has been completed and the claimant\nhas become aware of it. It is unjust to give the claimant\na remedy where, by his conduct, he has done that\nwhich might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver\nof it; or where by his conduct and neglect, though not\nwaiving the remedy, he has put the other party in a\nposition in which it would not be reasonable to place\nhim if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted. In\nsuch cases lapse of time and delay are most material.\nUpon these considerations rests the doctrine of laches.'\n\n13. In view of the statement of law as summarised\nabove, the respondents are guilty since the respondents\nhave acquiesced in accepting the retirement and did not\nchallenge the same in time. If they would have been\nvigilant enough, they could have filed writ petitions as\nothers did in the matter. Therefore, whenever it appears\nthat the claimants lost time or whiled it away and did not\nrise to the occasion in time for filing the writ petitions,\nthen in such cases, the court should be very slow in\ngranting the relief to the incumbent. Secondly, it has\nalso to be taken into consideration the question of\nacquiescence or waiver on the part of the incumbent\nwhether other parties are going to be prejudiced if the\nrelief is granted. In the present case, if the respondents\nwould have challenged their retirement being violative\nof the provisions of the Act, perhaps the Nigam could\nhave taken appropriate steps to raise funds so as to\nmeet the liability but by not asserting their rights the\nrespondents have allowed time to pass and after a\nlapse of couple of years, they have filed writ petitions\nclaiming the benefit for two years. That will definitely\nrequire the Nigam to raise funds which is going to have\nserious financial repercussions on the financial\nmanagement of the Nigam. Why should the court come\nto the rescue of such persons when they themselves\nare guilty of waiver and acquiescence?\"\n\n39. Before proceeding further, it is important to clarify\ndistinction between \"acquiescence\" and \"delay and\nlaches\". Doctrine of acquiescence is an equitable\ndoctrine which applies when a party having a right\nstands by and sees another dealing in a manner\ninconsistent with that right, while the act is in progress\nand after violation is completed, which conduct reflects\nhis assent or accord. He cannot afterwards complain.\n[See\nPrabhakar v. Sericulture Deptt.\n, (2015) 15 SCC 1 :\n\n(2016) 2 SCC (L&S) 149. Also, see\nGobinda Ramanuj\nDas Mohanta v. Ram Charan Das\n, 1925 SCC OnLine\nCal 30 : AIR 1925 Cal 1107] In literal sense, the term\nacquiescence means silent assent, tacit consent,\nconcurrence, or acceptance, [See Vidyavathi Kapoor\nNeutral Citation\n2024:\nCGHC:26151\nTrust v. CIT\n, 1991 SCC OnLine Kar 331 : (1992) 194\nITR 584] which denotes conduct that is evidence of an\nintention of a party to abandon an equitable right and\nalso to denote conduct from which another party will be\njustified in inferring such an intention.\n\n[See\nKrishan Dev\nv. Ram Piari\n, 1964 SCC OnLine HP 5 : AIR 1964 HP 34]\nAcquiescence can be either direct with full knowledge\nand express approbation, or indirect where a person\nhaving the right to set aside the action stands by and\nsees another dealing in a manner inconsistent with that\nright and in spite of the infringement takes no action\nmirroring acceptance. [See \"Introduction\", U.N. Mitra,\nTagore Law Lectures -- Law of Limitation and\nPrescription, Vol. I, 14th Edn., 2016.] However,\nacquiescence will not apply if lapse of time is of no\nimportance or consequence.\n\n40. Laches unlike limitation is flexible. However, both\nlimitation and laches destroy the remedy but not the\nright. Laches like acquiescence is based upon equitable\nconsiderations, but laches unlike acquiescence imports\neven simple passivity. On the other hand, acquiescence\nimplies active assent and is based upon the rule of\nestoppel in pais. As a form of estoppel, it bars a party\nafterwards from complaining of the violation of the right.\n\nEven indirect acquiescence implies almost active\nconsent, which is not to be inferred by mere silence or\ninaction which is involved in laches. Acquiescence in\nthis manner is quite distinct from delay. Acquiescence\nvirtually destroys the right of the person. [See\n\nVidyavathi Kapoor Trust v. CIT\n, 1991 SCC OnLine Kar\n331 : (1992) 194 ITR 584] Given the aforesaid legal\nposition, inactive acquiescence on the part of the\nrespondent can be inferred till the filing of the appeal,\nand not for the period post filing of the appeal.\nNevertheless, this acquiescence being in the nature of\nestoppel bars the respondent from claiming violation of\nthe right of fair representation.\"\n\n9. It is the duty of the court to scrutinize whether such enormous\n\ndelay is to be ignored without any justification. Remaining\n\ninnocuously oblivious to such delay does not foster the cause of\n\njustice. On the contrary, it brings in injustice, for it is likely to affect\n\nothers. Such delay may have impact on others' ripened rights and\n\nmay unnecessarily drag others into litigation which in acceptable\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:26151\nrealm of probability, may have been treated to have attained\n\nfinality. A court is not expected to give indulgence to such indolent\n\npersons, such delay does not deserve any indulgence and on the\n\nsaid ground alone this Court deems it appropriate to dismiss this\n\npetition at the very threshold. The doctrine of delay and laches, or\n\nfor that matter statutes of limitation are considered to be statutes of\n\nrepose and statutes of peace. There must be a lifespan during\n\nwhich a person must approach the court for their remedy.\n\nOtherwise, there would be unending uncertainty as to the rights\n\nand obligations of the parties.\n\n10.Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case in\n\nlight of the judgments passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\nmatters of\nChennai Metropolitan Water Supply\n(supra),\n\nRushibhai Jagdishbhai Pathak\n(supra) and\nBichitrananda\n\nBehera\n(supra), it is quite vivid that the petitioners have\n\napproached this Court after a delay of 9 years and in para 7 of the\n\nwrit petition, they have stated that there is no delay in filing the\n\ninstant petition. The petitioners utterly failed to explain the delay\n\ncaused in filing the instant petition, therefore, in the considered\n\nopinion of this Court, this petition is liable to be and is hereby\n\ndismissed on account of delay and laches.
