The\n Payment of Gratuity is more beneficial under the\n \nGratuity Act\n has been concurrently found on facts.\n Thus, in our opinion, the orders passed by the\n Controlling Authority and the Appellate Authority\n are proper.\n\n 6. The petitioner counsel was unable to point\n out any provision in pension rules that in case\n gratuity is availed under the \nPayment of Gratuity\n Act\n benefit of pension would be available. The\n petitioner's counsel has relied on DTC Retired\n Employees' Association (supra); it was a case with\n regard to the applicability of the Pension Scheme\n and applicability of Provident Fund Scheme.

The question referred though is confined only to the\n\naspect as to whether an order passed by quasi-judicial\n\nauthority of conferring certain service benefits under 1972 Act\n\ncould be retrospectively taken away. In other words, whether\n\nsuch a quasi-judicial pronouncement tantamount to accrual of\n\nright in favour of such employees or class of employees and the\n\nright so accrued can be taken away by effecting an exemption\n\nfrom 1972 Act from retrospective date. And, whether the choice\n\nof date can be beyond the date from which the corporate entity\n\nhas come into existence.\n\n13. The answer could have been short had the question\n\nreferred was the only issue, the reason being that, though all\n\nthese five corporate entities were reconstituted and\n\nrestructured with effect from 1.6.2005 yet, in TRANSCO, the\n\nexemption has been made effective from 16.9.1972 i.e. from\n\nthe date when Act of 1972 came into existence.

The contentions on behalf of petitioners to the validity of\n\nnotification is that it is beyond the powers of the appropriate\n\nGovernment to review the notification earlier issued and make\n\nit effective from retrospective date and grant exemption from a\n\nretrospective effect thereby taking away the right of gratuity\n\naccrued under 1972 Act and thereby, creating a class within a\n\nclass. And that subjecting the class to be exempted to the\n\nprovisions less favourable than the benefits conferred under\n\n1972 Act. It is also the contention that the right accrued in\n\nfavour of the employees has been taken away from a\n\nretrospective date without affording an opportunity of hearing.\n\nIn substantiation of these submissions, learned counsel for the\n\nemployees have led us through the benefit towards gratuity\n\ncomputed as per \nSection 4\n of 1972 Act being more beneficial\n\nthan the gratuity payable under the Pension Rules 1976.\n\nFormula provided under the Act of 1972 and one under 1976\n\nRules for computation of gratuity has been commended at to\n :: 18 ::\n\n \nW.P.

In other words, the powers to make the notification\n\neffective from a retrospective date does not get exhausted\n\nmerely because it does not find mention in a notification issued\n\nunder sub-section (1) or (2) of \nSection 5\n, as the case may be.\n\nThus, to exempt the establishment or the employee or class of\n\nemployees from retrospective date not earlier than the date of\n\ncommencement of Act of 1972 conferred upon the appropriate\n\nGovernment is supplementary to and additional constituent of\n\npower of exemption as conferred under sub-section (1) and (2)\n\nof \nSection 5\n.

It\n\ncan be argued that since the power vests with the appropriate\n\nGovernment to even exempt the employee(s) from the\n\nprovisions of 1972 Act and since liability to pay pension to\n\nexisting pensioners has been conferred on Madhya Pradesh\n\nPower Transmission Company Limited after the dissolution of\n\nerstwhile Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board, the\n\nnotification in respect of this Company be construed as being\n\nissued in purported exercise of powers conferred under sub-\n\nsection (2) of \nSection 5\n of 1972 Act. Quite true it may be,\n\nbecause of the settled principle that, in case if an order passed\n\nin exercise of power, the sources of power is not quoted, it will\n\nnot invalidate the order if the power can be referred to a\n\njurisdiction which confers validity upon it (for an authority\n\nplease see \nM.T. Khan v. State of A.P.\n (2004) 2 SCC 267 at\n\npage 273). However, even if it is to be construed to be a\n\ncomposite notification, under \nSection 5\n of 1972 Act\n, \nin that\n\ncase\n, it must meet two requirements, viz. (i) the gratuity or\n\npensionary benefit already available to the employees are not\n\nless favourable than the benefit conferred by the Act of 1972\n :: 27 ::\n\n W.P.

Coming to the case at hand, it is not being disputed that,\n\nfinding the provisions of Act of 1972 more beneficial than the\n\nexisting gratuity provisions contained in 1976 Rules, the\n\nControlling Authority has been allowing the claim and directing\n\nfor computation of gratuity in consonance with \nSection 4\n of\n\n1972 Act. That being so, there is accrual of right in the\n\nemployees/existing pensioners who have been held entitled for\n\nthe gratuity under 1972 Act as could be taken away from the\n\nretrospective date.\n\n26. This issue can be analysed from another angle. The\n\nimpugned notification exempting the corporate entities from\n\nretrospective effect has been issued on the bedrock that the\n\nprovisions of 1976 Rules were made applicable to erstwhile\n\nMadhya Pradesh State Electricity Board and the gratuity and\n\npension component were more beneficial than the gratuity\n\nunder 1972 Act. However, as noticed above, the aspect as to\n\nwhether the gratuity under 1976 Rules are more beneficial than\n\nunder 1972 Act has been the subject matter of scrutiny before\n\nthe Controlling Authority and the Appellate Authority in\n\numpteen number of cases in past where on adjudication it has\n :: 28 ::\n\n W.P.

As evident, comparison has been drawn in case\n\nof an employee governed by Rules, 1976.\n\n29.

No.17407/15\n\n Jain that gratuity has to be taken as a part of\n pension, to support which contention our attention\n has been invited to this Court's judgment in \nJarnail\n Singh\n case'. Perusal of that judgment shows that\n gratuity was taken to be a part of pension because of\n the definition of \"pension\" as given in clause (o) of\n sub-rule (i) of Rule 3 of Central Civil Services\n (Pension) Rules, 1972.\n \nIt is because of this definition\n that the case of \nD.V. Kapoor v. Union of India\n [(1990)\n 4 SCC 314] in which it had been held that gratuity\n was not a part of pension, was not followed, as the\n Bench which decided that case had not been referred\n to the aforesaid definition of pension.\n Similar\n observation was made in Jarnail Singh case'\n regarding F.R. Jesuratnam v. Union of India [1990\n Supp SCC 640] wherein also gratuity was not\n regarded as part of pension without noting the\n abovenoted definition.\n\n 14. To buttress his aforesaid submission, Shri Jain\n also refers to clause (17) of \nArticle 366\n of the\n Constitution which has defined pension to include\n gratuity. Merely because what has been stated in\n clause (17) it cannot be held that gratuity has to be\n taken always and for all purposes as part of pension,\n because this definition apparently has enlarged the\n meaning of the word \"pension\" by stating that this\n would include gratuity. It is well known that\n legislature very often wants to give enlarged meaning\n :: 36 ::\n\n W.P.

We, therefore, state that either because of\n what was stated in \nJarnail Singh\n case or the way\n \"pension\" has been defined in the Constitution, it\n cannot be held that pension and gratuity are\n conceptually same, as stated in paragraph 9 of \nJarnail\n Singh\n case' to which our attention is invited by Shri\n Jain. According to us, this Court took the view in\n question in Jarnail Singh because of the definition of\n the word \"pension\" in the concerned rule; otherwise,\n what was held in D. V. Kapoor and F.R.

No.17407/15\n\n is not possible for us to hold that the respondent is\n not entitled to the gratuity under the \nPayment of\n Gratuity Act\n. The only provision which was pointed\n out is the definition of \"employee\" in \nSection 2 (e)\n\n which excludes the employees of the Central\n Government and State Governments receiving\n pension and gratuity under the Pension Rules but\n not an employee of the MCD. The MCD employee,\n therefore, would be entitled to the payment of\n gratuity under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. The\n mere fact that the gratuity is provided for under the\n Pension Rules will not disentitle him to get the\n payment of gratuity under the \nPayment of Gratuity\n Act\n. In view of the overriding provisions contained\n in \nSection 14\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the\n provision for gratuity under the Pension Rules will\n have no effect. Possibly for this reason, \nSection 5\n of\n the Payment of Gratuity Act has conferred authority\n on the appropriate Government to exempt any\n establishment from the operation of the provisions\n of the Act, if in its opinion the employees of such\n establishment are in receipt of gratuity or\n pensionary benefits not less favourable than the\n benefits conferred under this Act. Admittedly MCD\n has not taken any steps to invoke the power of the\n Central Government under Sectopm 5 of the\n \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. In the aforesaid premises,\n we are of the considered opinion that the\n employees of the MCD would be entitled to the\n payment of gratuity under the \nPayment of Gratuity\n Act\n notwithstanding the fact that the provisions of\n the Pension Rules have been made applicable to\n them for the purpose of determining the pension.\n\n Needless to mention that the employees cannot\n claim gratuity available under the Pension Rules. .\"\n\n39.

And since by\n\nvirtue of \nSection 14\n of 1972 Act the provisions therein have an\n\noverriding effect, the accrual of right to receive gratuity under\n\n1972 Act cannot be taken away from the existing pensioners\n\neven if it is within the powers of the appropriate government to\n\ncause exemption from a retrospective date.\n\n40.
