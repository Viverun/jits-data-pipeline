On 9 May 2023, the petitioner addressed a Notice of Default to\nboth the respondents. In view of the fact that the leased area had been\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 5 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nfurther sold by Ambience to Tutelage, the notice stated that it was\nbeing addressed to both the respondents. The notice alleged that the\nleased area was not habitable and that the columns in the leased area\ndid not possess the requisite compressive strength and would require\nrepair. As neither Ambience nor Tutelage took any steps in this\nregard, the notice alleged that the petitioner had to spend considerable\namounts in attempting to make the leased area habitable. It was further\npointed out that the Enforcement Directorate had also issued a Public\nNotice stating that the entire building at Commercial Plot No.10 had\nbeen attached by it in relation to an investigation into the affairs of the\nAmbience Group. In these circumstances, the notice alleged that the\npetitioner was not in a position to enjoy the leased area. The\npetitioner, therefore, invoked Clause 18.2 of the lease deed which\nentitled the petitioner to terminate the lease deed, if the leased area\nbecame unusable for the petitioner. Alleging that Ambience was in\nfundamental breach of its obligations under the lease deed, and had\nfailed to provide the usable leased area to the petitioner despite\nrepeated representations in that regard, the petitioner stated that it\nintended to terminate the lease deed. The respondents were therefore\ncalled upon to cure the defaults in the leased area within 60 days, by\nproviding a habitable and usable access to the leased area and\nreimbursing to the petitioner the amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90, stated to\nhave been incurred by the petitioner in executing the repairs in the\nleased area. Failure, on the part of the respondents, to cure the\ndefaults within 60 days, it was said, would constrain the petitioner to\nissue a notice for cancellation of the lease deed.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 6 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n7. The period of 60 days, provided in the notice, expired on 9 July\n2023. Neither of the respondents, however, took any step towards\ncuring the defaults indicated by the petitioner. The petitioner,\ntherefore, addressed a second communication to both the respondents\non 10 July 2023, alleging that the respondents continued to be in\nbreach of their obligations to provide a habitable and usable access to\nthe leased area to the petitioner and to reimburse the amounts spent by\nthe petitioner in repairing the premises. The respondents were,\ntherefore, put on notice that failure, on their part, to cure the notified\ndefects within 30 days would result in ipso facto\ncancellation/termination of the Lease Deed. The notice also asserted\nthat the petitioner was entitled to recover, from the respondents, the\nsecurity deposit of ₹ 1,92,48,300/-, maintenance security deposit of ₹\n47,05,140/- and any other amounts due to the petitioner, apart from ₹\n1,29,01,487.90 incurred by the petitioner in repairing the leased area.\n\n8. According to the petitioner, as the notified defects were not\ncured by the respondents, the lease deed stood terminated on 10\nAugust 2023. The petitioner in the circumstances, addressed a\ncommunication dated 10 August 2023 to Tutelage, handing over\nthereunder the vacant, physical and actual possession of the leased\narea to Tutelage.\n\n9. Simultaneously, the petitioner addressed a Notice of Demand to\nboth the respondents, calling upon them to pay, to the petitioner, a\ntotal amount of ₹ 14,63,44,072.29 towards cost of repairs and reworks\ncarried out by the petitioner and agreed to be repaid by Ambience, as\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 7 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nwell as other costs incurred by the petitioner, and compensation for\nthe losses suffered by the petitioner. The respondents were called\nupon to pay the aforesaid amount within 30 days, failing which the\npetitioner stated that it would seek recourse to appropriate legal\nremedies.\n\n10. Ambience responded on 11 September 2023, denying all\nliabilities in the matter in view of the sale of the leased area to\nTutelage on 18 November 2022, with concomitant transfer of all its\nrights and obligations. The situation thus reached a stage, according to\nthe petitioner, where it was left with no option but to seek recourse to\nthe remedies available in law.\n\n11. In accordance with the protocol envisaged by Clause 26.1 of the\nLease Deed, the petitioner addressed a notice to the respondents on 12\nSeptember 2023 calling upon them to settle the matter amicably.\n\n12. This attempt also failed. The petitioner, thereupon, issued a\nnotice to the respondents under Section 214 of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 19965 on 3 October 2023, proposing resolution of\nthe disputes between the petitioner and respondents by arbitration.\nThe petitioner suggested the name of Hon'ble Ms. Justice R.\nBanumathi, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India, to arbitrate\non the issue.\n21. Commencement of arbitral proceedings. - Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral\nproceedings in respect of a particular dispute commence on the date on which a request for that dispute to be\nreferred to arbitration is received by the respondent.\n\"The 1996 Act\", hereinafter\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 8 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n13. On 2 November 2023, Ambience replied, denying all liability in\nthe matter. There has been no response from Tutelage to the Notice of\nArbitration dated 3 October 2023.\n\n14. It is in these circumstances that the petitioner has approached\nthis Court under Section 11(6)6 of the 1996 Act, requiring the Court to\nappoint an Arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes between the\npetitioner and respondents.\n\n15. Both the respondents have filed counter-affidavits by way of\nresponse to the writ petition and the petitioner has filed rejoinders\nthereto.\n\nRival Submissions\n\n16. I have heard lengthy arguments from both sides. The petitioner\nwas represented by Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned Senior Counsel\nassisted by learned Counsel Mr. Sidharth Sethi, Ms. Pragya Chauhan,\nMr. Kunal Saini and Ms. Meherunissa Anand. Mr. V. Anush Raajan\nappeared for Ambience and Mr. Hitesh Sachar represented Tutelage.\n\nOpening submissions of Mr. Raj Shekhar Rao\n(6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,--\n\n(a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n\n(b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them\nunder that procedure; or\n\n(c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it\nunder that procedure,\nthe appointment shall be made, on an application of the party, by the arbitral institution designated by the\nSupreme Court, in case of international commercial arbitration, or by the High Court, in case of arbitrations\nother than international commercial arbitration, as the case may be to take the necessary measure, unless the\nagreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 9 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n17. Mr. Rao submits that Clause 23.1 of the Lease Deed dated 15\nJanuary 2021 releases Ambience only from \"further liability\".\nMoreover, Clause 23.1 recorded the consent of Ambience to attorn the\nlease to Tutelage provided Tutelage honoured the terms of the Lease\nDeed. He submits that no such document, attorning the lease to\nTutelage, was ever signed by his client. Ambience, therefore,\ncontinues to remain liable to the petitioner.\n\n18. At the same time, possession of the leased area was handed over\nby Ambience to Tutelage. Ambience also transferred the security\ndeposit paid by the petitioner to Tutelage. Any direction for refund of\nthe security deposit would, therefore, have to be issued to Tutelage.\nMoreover, inasmuch as the petitioner continued to remain in the\nleased area for nearly 9 months after the sale thereof to Tutelage, the\nissue of the extent to which Ambience, or Tutelage, or both, would be\nliable to the petitioner, also fell for determination.\n\n19. Thus, submits Mr. Rao, both respondents have necessarily to be\nimpleaded as parties in the arbitral proceedings, and it would be for\nthe learned arbitrator to adjudicate on the situs of liability.\n\nSubmissions of Mr. Raajan in reply\n\n20. Mr. V. Anush Raajan, appearing for Ambience, draws my\nattention to paras 2.5 and 2.6 of the present petition, which read thus:\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 10 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\"2.5 Subsequent to the execution of the Lease Deed, the\nPetitioner was informed on 5 December 2022 that Respondent No\n1 had sold the Leased Area to Respondent No 2 in November 2022\nand that:\n\n(i) all payments on deposits made by the Petitioner\nunder and in terms of the Lease Deed had been transferred\nby Respondent No. 1 to Respondent No. 2;\n\n(ii) Respondent No. 1 had assigned all its rights and\nobligations under the Lease Deed to Respondent No. 2.\n\n2.6 As such, the Respondent No. 2 stepped into the shoes of\nRespondent No. 1 with effect from November 2022 and became\nthe successor in interest to the Respondent No. 1. Respondent No.\n2 is entitled to all rights which were enforceable by the Respondent\nNo. 1 under the Lease Deed and is bound by all obligations that\nRespondent No. 1 was bound by, without any further act or deed.\nBeing the assignee and successor interest of Respondent No. 1,\nRespondent No. 2 is also bound by the arbitration clause contained\nin the Lease Deed and is a necessary party for the proper, fair and\nfinal adjudication of the disputes between the parties.\"\n\nMr. Raajan submits that the petitioner was, therefore, always aware of\nthe sale of the leased area to Tutelage. No live dispute, therefore, he\nsubmits, survives between the petitioner and Ambience. The\npetitioner cannot, therefore, forcibly involve Ambience in the\nproposed arbitral proceedings. He relies on paras 25 and 28 of\n\nN.T.P.C. Ltd v. SPML Infra Ltd7\nto submit that a Court which is\nseized with an application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act has\nalso to examine whether a live arbitral dispute exists between the\nparties.\n\nSubmissions of Mr. Hitesh Sachar\n\n21. Mr. Hitesh Sachar, appearing for Tutelage, on the other hand,\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 11 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nechoes Mr. Rao's submission that Clause 23.1 of the Lease Deed only\ninsulates Ambience from \"further liability\". Inasmuch as the\nallegation of the petitioner against Ambience relates to a period prior\nto the sale of the leased area to Tutelage, Mr. Sachar submits that\nAmbience continues to remain liable towards the petitioner and, in\nfact, Tutelage has no liability in that regard. He also draws attention\nto paras 3, 4 and 11 of the Legal Notice dated 9 May 2023 addressed\nby the petitioner to the respondents, which read thus:\n\n\"3. As per the terms of the Lease Deed, Ambience was obliged to\nprovide the Leased Area to ESRI in a habitable, accessible\ncondition to enable ESRI to be able to use it for its activities.\nAmbience had also represented that the Leased Area was\nstructurally sound and in good condition. Even otherwise, in law\nalso, providing habitable access to the leased area is a fundamental\nobligation of the lessor.\n\n4. However, it is an admitted fact and a matter of record that till\ndate (i.e. even after 2.5 years of execution of the Lease Deed),\nAmbience/Tutelage has failed to provide a habitable or usable\nLeased Area to ESRI. This fact has been documented in various\ncommunications, photographs and reports of third-party\nvendors/consultants. Pertinently, on 29 August 2022, Ambience\nhad categorically acknowledged that the compressive strength on\nall columns in the Leased Area and Building failed to meet the\nappropriate requirements which would require repair.\n\n11. Therefore, by way of this notice, ESRI is notifying the\ndefaults/breaches of Ambience/Tutelage and as a last opportunity,\ncalling upon Ambience/Tutelage to cure the defaults within a\nperiod of 60 days by:\n\na. Providing a habitable and usable access to the Leased\nArea to ESRI;\n\nb. Reimbursing the amount of INR 1,29,01,487.90 incurred\nby ESRI in executing repair works for water leakage and\naccommodating Landlord's structural remediation work\nwithin the Leased Area.\"\n\nMr. Sachar points out that, in para 3 of the Legal Notice, the\n(2023) 9 SCC 385\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 12 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\npetitioner's clear allegation was against Ambience, in failing to\nprovide the leased area to the petitioner in a habitable and accessible\ncondition. Even in paras 4 and 11, he submits that the petitioner's\nallegation continues to remain against Ambience. The claims of the\npetitioner in para 11, he submits, have also to be met by Ambience,\nnot by Tutelage.\n\n22. Mr. Sachar also places reliance on para 15, 16 and 19 of the\nreply tendered by Ambience to the Notice of Demand dated 10\nAugust 2023 of the petitioner:\n\n\"15. As per the terms of the lease deed, ESRI is liable to pay\nAmbience INR 5,77,44,900/- towards arrears of Rent between May\n2021 and November 2022, Late Charges for each month of delay\napplied to every month between May 2021 to November 2022\napplicable to rent arrears up to the date of issuance of the present\nletter in terms of Clause 2.4., in the amount of INR 2, 19,43,062/-,\nMaintenance charges amounting to INR 1,41,15,420/-. Our Client\nhas several times passed on the relevant information regarding\noutstanding payments to ESRI, however, the same have not been\npaid till date is admitted.\n\n16. The present letter may be treated as a notice issued in terms\nof Clause 14.1.1 of the Lease Deed and you are hereby called upon\nto forthwith pay INR 9,38,03,382/- as of 15th August 2023. You\nwill note that the above demanded amount will carry interest@\n18% per annum up to the date of payment, if the demanded amount\nis not paid within the 30 days of receipt of the present letter and a\ncure period of 30 days.\n\n*****\n\n19. On several occasions, including but not limited to the\nemails from Sim Saran, Senior Real Estate Attorney of 01.11.2022\nand emails from Mr. Rohit Singh of India Operations, ESRI that\nESRI even as of November 2022 was in occupation of the Leased\nArea and was running its operations from the premises. All the\nrequests of ESRI to delay the rent commencement on one pretext\nor the other, viz. water seepage in July 2022 or the structural\nintegrity improvements and reports, were denied by Ambience and\ndemands were raised on several occasions. However, ESRI on one\nhand occupying the Leased Area merely used the reason of\nimprovement works to be done by Ambience in terms of the\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 13 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nLeased Deed refused to pay the Rent, Maintenance and Other\nCharges.\"\n\nThe counter claims of Ambience, therefore, he submits, are also\nagainst the petitioner. The contractual liability, if any, therefore, is\nbetween the petitioner and Ambience. He further submits that there\nhas never been any attornment of the lease by the petitioner to\nTutelage.\n\n23. Mr. Sachar therefore submits that it is not Ambience, but\nTutelage, which is being unnecessarily dragged into arbitral\nproceedings.\n\nMr. Rao's submissions in rejoinder\n\n24. Advancing submissions by way of rejoinder to the submissions\nof Mr. Raajan and Mr. Sachar, Mr. Rao submits that, inasmuch as the\nleased area was sold by Ambience to Tutelage on 18 November 2022,\nand, on 10 August 2023, possession of the leased area was handed\nover by the petitioner to Tutelage, both respondents have necessarily\nto be made parties in the arbitral proceedings, and it would be for the\narbitrator to adjudicate as to the actual situs of liability.\n\n25. Mr. Rao alludes to the following e-mail dated 29 August 2022\naddressed by Ambience to the petitioner, to submit that Ambience\ncannot seek to escape its liability merely on the ground that it had sold\nthe leased area to Tutelage along with all rights and obligations:\n\n\"Dear Sim,\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 14 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nPlease find attached the structural report for ND testing done by\nTPC, Structural consultants and structural designers of the\nAmbience Tower Shalimar Bagh Building.\n\nTo our astonishment the compressive strength of some columns on\nthe eighth floor is not at par as per the latest design parameters.\nTPC on the basis of the ND test and the design analysis have\nsuggested certain strengthening and retrofitting details which are to\nbe followed from ground up.

This is why the petitioner\nwas compelled to issue a Notice of Default to the respondents to\nterminate the lease. Mr. Rao points out that, in the Notice of Default\naddressed by the petitioner to the respondents on 9 May 2023, the\npetitioner had claimed not only provision of a habitable and usable\naccess to the leased area but also reimbursement of the amount of ₹\n1,29,01,487.90 spent by the petitioner in executing repair of the leased\narea. Inasmuch as Tutelage had purchased the leased area with all\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 15 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nrights and obligations, the question would fall for consideration as to\nthe extent to which Tutelage would be liable for the monetary claim of\nthe petitioner. It would be for the learned arbitrator to adjudicate on\nthis issue. For this purpose, Mr. Rao further refers me to the\nfollowing paras from the Notice of Demand sent by the petitioner to\nthe respondents on 10 August 2023:\n\n\"3. In terms of clause 18.2 of the Lease Deed,\nAmbience/Tutelage is obliged to refund the following refundable\ndeposits to ESRI within 30 days of the termination of the Lease\nDeed (i.e. by 9 September 2023):\n\n3.1 Interest free refundable security deposit equivalent to 6\nmonths' rent amounting to ₹ 1,92,48,300; and\n\n3.2 Maintenance Security Deposit amounting to ₹ 47,05,140.\n\n4. In addition to the above, in view of the fundamental\nbreaches/defaults committed by Ambience/Tutelage, ESRI is also\nentitled to receive the below amounts incurred by:\n\n4.1 Cost of Repairs and Reworks carried out by ESRI and\nagreed to be reimbursed by Ambience\n\n4.1.1 It is an admitted fact that ESRI has spent\nconsiderable amounts in attempting to make the Leased\nArea habitable and usable. An amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90\nwas incurred by ESRI in executing repair works for water\nleakage and to accommodate structural remediation work\nwithin the Leased Area. Though Ambience had admitted\nits liability to reimburse such amount to ESRI, it has failed\nto do so to date, despite repeated requests.\n\n4.2 Other costs incurred by ESRI\n\n4.2.1 ESRI had installed certain enhancements and fit\nouts over the Leased Area and had to expend substantial\namounts towards the same. On termination of the Lease\nDeed, whatever could be removed, has been removed by\nESRI with a view to mitigate its losses. However, it is not\npossible and/or feasible to remove certain enhancements\nmade to the Leased Area by ESRI. An indicative (and not\nexhaustive) list of the enhancements that cannot be\nremoved from the Leased Area is set out in Annexure-1 to\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 16 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nthe present notice. At the same time, since these are being\nleft behind, Ambience/Tutelage will obviously benefit from\nthese enhancements that have been installed at ESRI's cost.\n\nHowever, for ESRI, these are sunk costs, attributable solely\nto the breaches by Ambience/Tutelage. Consequently,\nAmbience/Tutelage is also liable to pay these sunk costs to\nESRI. ESRI is in the process of quantifying the exact sunk\ncosts incurred by it towards the enhancements that cannot\nbe removed and the quantification will be submitted in due\ncourse.\n\n27. Mr. Rao also refers me to the reply dated 11 September 2023 by\nAmbience to the said notice, and points out that though, in the said\nreply, Ambience has disowned all liabilities vis-a-vis the petitioner\nregarding determination of lease and its sequelae, it has nonetheless\nanswered the claim of damages for the period during which the\nownership of the property continued to be with Ambience, i.e. prior to\nsale of property to Tutelage. Thus, he submits that Ambience cannot\ncompletely disclaim liability in the transaction. Mr. Rao has also\nplaced reliance on para 163 of the judgment of the Constitution Bench\nof the Supreme Court in\nCox and Kings Ltd v. SAP India Pvt Ltd8\n.\n\n28. Mr. Rao submits that, in view of Section 16(1)9 of the 1996\nAct, which incorporates the kompetenz-kompetenz doctrine, the issue\nof the relevant parties to an arbitral dispute goes to the very root of the\ncompetence of the Arbitral Tribunal, and must be left to the Arbitral\nTribunal.\n(2024) 4 SCC 1\n16.

Prior to the insertion of sub section (6A) in\nSection 11\n, the view\nof the Supreme Court with respect to the issues which could be\nexamined by a referral court, seized with a petition for referring a\ndispute to arbitration, was more expansive.\nIn\nNational Insurance\nCo.

Master\nConstruction Co.15\n, that where reliance was placed on a discharge\nvoucher, no claim certificate or settlement agreement as evidence of\ndischarge of the claim, the referral court had to prima facie examine\nthe credibility of the allegations before referring the dispute to\narbitration.\n\nFurther in\nNew India Assurance Co.

This position was explicitly elucidated, by\nthe Supreme Court, in\nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port\nLtd17\n, by ruling that the jurisdiction of the referral court was,\nfollowing the insertion of\nSection 11(6A)\n, \"limited to examining\nwhether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties - nothing\nmore, nothing less\".\n\n33. A two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in\nUnited India\nInsurance Co Ltd v. Antique Art Exports Pvt. Ltd18\n, even after the\nintroduction of\nSection 11(6A)\nand the decision in Duro Felguera\nheld, nonetheless, that a plea of discharge of the debt by accord and\nsatisfaction, if urged, would have to be examined by the referral court\nunder\nSection 11(6)\n.\n\nThis view was, however, reversed by a Bench of\nthree Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court in\nMayawati Trading Pvt\nLtd v.

Another Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court,\nin\nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation20\n, examined the entire\nlegal position and held thus:\n\n\"133. Prima facie case in the context of\nSection 8\nis not to be\nconfused with the merits of the case put up by the parties which\nhas to be established before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is restricted to\nthe subject-matter of the suit being prima facie arbitrable under a\nvalid arbitration agreement. Prima facie case means that the\nassertions on these aspects are bona fide. When read with the\nprinciples of separation and competence-competence and\nSection\nof the Arbitration Act, the referral court without getting bogged\ndown would compel the parties to abide unless there are good and\nsubstantial reasons to the contrary.\n\n134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a primary\nfirst review to weed out manifestly and ex facie non-existent and\ninvalid arbitration agreements and non-arbitrable disputes. The\nprima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood\nand trim off the side branches in straightforward cases where\ndismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law\nthe litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the court is\ncertain that no valid arbitration agreement exists or the\ndisputes/subject-matter are not arbitrable, the application\nunder\nSection 8\nwould be rejected. At this stage, the court should\nnot get lost in thickets and decide debatable questions of facts.\nReferral proceedings are preliminary and summary and not a mini\ntrial......\n\n*****\n\n138. ......On the other hand, issues relating to contract\nformation, existence, validity and non-arbitrability would be\nconnected and intertwined with the issues underlying the merits of\nthe respective disputes/claims. They would be factual and disputed\nand for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.\n\n139. We would not like to be too prescriptive, albeit observe that\nthe court may for legitimate reasons, to prevent wastage of public\n(2021) 1 SCC 1\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 21 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nand private resources, can exercise judicial discretion to conduct an\nintense yet summary prima facie review while remaining conscious\nthat it is to assist the arbitration procedure and not usurp\njurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. Undertaking a detailed full\nreview or a long-drawn review at the referral stage would obstruct\nand cause delay undermining the integrity and efficacy of\narbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Conversely, if the\ncourt becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine\neffectiveness of both the arbitration and the court. There are certain\ncases where the prima facie examination may require a deeper\nconsideration. The court's challenge is to find the right amount of\nand the context when it would examine the prima facie case or\nexercise restraint. The legal order needs a right balance between\navoiding arbitration obstructing tactics at referral stage and\nprotecting parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\nclearly non-arbitrable.\n\n140. Accordingly, when it appears that prima facie review\nwould be inconclusive, or on consideration inadequate as it\nrequires detailed examination, the matter should be left for final\ndetermination by the Arbitral Tribunal selected by the parties by\nconsent. The underlying rationale being not to delay or defer and to\ndiscourage parties from using referral proceeding as a ruse to delay\nand obstruct. In such cases a full review by the courts at this stage\nwould encroach on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and\nviolate the legislative scheme allocating jurisdiction between the\ncourts and the Arbitral Tribunal. Centralisation of litigation with\nthe Arbitral Tribunal as the primary and first adjudicator is\nbeneficent as it helps in quicker and efficient resolution of\ndisputes.\n\n*****\n\n153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression \"existence of an\narbitration agreement\" in\nSection 11\nof the Arbitration Act, would\ninclude aspect of validity of an arbitration agreement, albeit the\ncourt at the referral stage would apply the prima facie test on the\nbasis of principles set out in this judgment. In cases of debatable\nand disputable facts, and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the\ncourt would force the parties to abide by the arbitration agreement\nas the Arbitral Tribunal has primary jurisdiction and authority to\ndecide the disputes including the question of jurisdiction and non-\narbitrability.\n\n154.

Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the\ncourt under\nSections 8\nand\nof the Arbitration Act is\nidentical but extremely limited and restricted.\n\n154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the\nlegislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of\n2019, and the principle of severability and competence-\ncompetence, is that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred\nfirst authority to determine and decide all questions of non-\narbitrability. The court has been conferred power of\n\"second look\" on aspects of non-arbitrability post the\naward in terms of sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of\nSection\n34(2)(a)\nor sub-clause (i) of\nSection 34(2)(b)\nof the\nArbitration Act.\n\n154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere\nat\nSection 8\nor 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie\ncertain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent,\ninvalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature\nand facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent,\ndetermine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The\nrestricted and limited review is to check and protect parties\nfrom being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\ndemonstrably \"non-arbitrable\" and to cut off the deadwood.\nThe court by default would refer the matter when\ncontentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly\narguable; when consideration in summary proceedings\nwould be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are\ncontested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts\ndelaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration\nproceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into\na mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the\njurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and\nuphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative\ndispute resolution mechanism.\"\n\nThe decision in NTPC\n\n35.

SPML Infra Ltd21\n, on which Mr.\nSachar places reliance. The appeal in NTPC arose from a decision\nrendered by this Court. NTPC and SPML Infra22 executed a contract\nfor installation services in a power project situated at\nVishakhapatnam. SPML furnished bank guarantees to the tune of ₹\n14,96,89,136/- to secure NTPC. NTPC issued a Completion\nCertificate on 27 March 2019, but withheld the bank guarantees. On\nSPML inquiring about the reasons for withholding the bank\nguarantees, NTPC referred to certain pending liabilities and disputes\nwith SPML with respect to other projects. SPML protested, stating\nthat NTPC had no jurisdiction to link the bank guarantees to other\nliabilities of SPML. Following this, SPML raised a demand of ₹\n72,01,53,899/- on NTPC. NTPC, naturally, did not release the bank\nguarantees, resulting in SPML filing WP (C) 7213/2019 before this\nCourt for a direction to NTPC to release the bank guarantees\nforthwith.\n\n36. Pending the writ petition, NTPC and SPML entered into a\nsettlement agreement on 27 May 2020, whereunder NTPC agreed to\nrelease the withheld bank guarantees and SPML agreed to withdraw\nWP (C) 7213/2019 and also not to initiate any other proceedings,\nincluding arbitration. The bank guarantees were, therefore, released\nby NTPC on 30 June 2020, and SPML withdrew WP (C) 7213/2019\non 21 September 2020.

It was alleged, in the said\npetition, that SPML had been forced to enter into the settlement\nagreement dated 27 May 2020 by duress and coercion. It was alleged\nthat the retention of the bank guarantees by NTPC had left SPML with\nno option but to agree to sign the settlement agreement. Submitting\nthat NTPC had failed to appoint an arbitrator despite repeated requests\nby SPML, SPML requested this Court to step in and appoint an\narbitrator in exercise of its power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act.\n\n37. Responding to the writ petition, NTPC submitted, inter alia,\nthat no dispute survived between the parties in view of the settlement\nagreement dated 27 May 2020, in compliance of which NTPC\nreleased, to SPML, the bank guarantees and SPML withdrew WP(C)\n7213/2019. The claim of SPML, therefore, stood discharged by\naccord and satisfaction. The allegations of duress and coercion were\ncategorically denied as false and attempt to wriggle out of the\nsettlement agreement. NTPC, therefore, prayed that SPML's petition\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act be rejected outright.\n\n38. This Court held, on SPML's plea of duress and coercion and\nNTPC's response thereto, that it was unable to accept NTPC's\ncontention that the dispute as to whether the contract between NTPC\nand SPML stood discharged/novated by the settlement agreement\ndated 27 May 2020 was untenable, insubstantial, or frivolous. This\nCourt, therefore, allowed SPML's petition and appointed a retired\nJudge of this Court to arbitrate on the disputes.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 25 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n39. NTPC appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n40. The Supreme Court took note of the decisions already cited\nhereinabove, upto Vidya Drolia, as well as a subsequent decision of\nthe Supreme Court in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd23.\nHaving examined all these decisions, the Supreme Court held the\nposition of law to be thus:\n\n\"25. Eye of the Needle: The above-referred precedents\ncrystallise the position of law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of\nthe courts under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is very narrow and\ninheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence\nand the validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an\ninquiry as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant's\nprivity to the said agreement. These are matters which require a\nthorough examination by the referral court. The secondary inquiry\nthat may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect to the\nnon-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n26. As a general rule and a principle, the arbitral tribunal is the\npreferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of\nnon-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule, and rarely as a\ndemurrer, the referral court may reject claims which are manifestly\nand ex-facie non-arbitrable...\n\n27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of\na claim is only prima facie. Referral courts must not undertake a\nfull review of the contested facts; they must only be confined to a\nprimary first review and let facts speak for themselves. This also\nrequires the courts to examine whether the assertion on\narbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the\nfacts must lead to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige\nof doubt that the claim is non-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if\nthere is the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to\narbitration.\n\n28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is\nnecessary and compelling.

It has been\ntermed as a legitimate interference by courts to refuse reference in\norder to prevent wastage of public and private resources31.\n\nFurther, as noted in\nVidya Drolia\n(supra), if this duty within the\nlimited compass is not exercised, and the Court becomes too\nreluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both,\narbitration and the Court32.\n\nTherefore, this Court or a High Court,\nas the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to\ndeliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of\nthe chosen arbitrator, as explained in\nDLF Home Developers\nLimited v. Rajapura Homes Pvt\n. Ltd24.\"\n\n41. The Supreme Court went on, thereafter, to apply these\nprinciples to the facts before it and held on facts thus:\n\n\"44. A simple narration of the bare facts, as indicated above,\nleads us to conclude that the allegations of coercion and economic\nduress are not bona fide, and that there were no pending claims\nbetween the parties for submission to arbitration. The\nRespondent's claim fits in the description of an attempt to initiate\n\"ex facie meritless, frivolous and dishonest litigation\". We will\nendeavour to give reasons for our conclusion.\n\n45. The whole dispute revolves around the solitary act of the\nAppellant, NTPC, in not returning the Bank Guarantees despite the\nsuccessful completion of work. This continued even after SPML\nissued the No-Demand Certificate and NTPC released the final\npayment. These undisputed facts led to the institution of the Writ\nPetition before the Delhi High Court. There were no allegations of\ncoercion or economic duress compelling SPML to withdraw any\npending claims under the subject contract as a condition for the\nreturn of the Bank Guarantees. On the contrary, the only allegation\nby SPML was with respect to NTPC's \"illegal\" action of\ninterlinking the release of the Bank Guarantees with some other\ncontracts. This was precisely the argument before the High Court,\nand, in fact, this submission is recorded by the High Court while\nissuing notice and injuncting NTPC. This fact clearly indicates that\nthe plea of coercion and economic duress leading to the Settlement\nAgreement is an afterthought.\n\n46. We will now examine whether the allegations of coercion\nand economic duress in the execution of the Settlement Agreement\n(2021) 16 SCC 743\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 27 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nare bona fide or not. This inquiry has a direct bearing on the\narbitrability of the dispute. It was during the subsistence of the\nWrit Petition and the High Court's interim order, when SPML had\ncomplete protection of the Court, that the parties entered into the\nSettlement Agreement. This agreement was comprehensive. It inter\nalia provided for (i) the release of Bank Guarantees by NTPC, (ii)\nthe withdrawal of SPML's Writ Petition, (iii) restraining NTPC\nfrom filing contempt proceedings against SPML for letting the\nBank Guarantees expire, and finally, (iv) restraining SPML from\ninitiating any proceedings under the subject contract, including\narbitration. The Settlement Agreement also recorded that there\nwere no subsisting issues pending between the parties.\n\n47. The plea of coercion and economic duress must be seen in\nthe context of the execution of the Settlement Agreement not being\ndisputed, and its implementation leading to the release of the Bank\nGuarantees on 30.06.2020 also not being disputed. Almost three\nweeks after the release of the Bank Guarantees, a letter of\nrepudiation was issued by SPML on 22.07.2020. This letter was\nissued about two months after the Settlement Agreement was\nexecuted and in fact during the subsistence of the Writ Petition.\n\nAfter reaping the benefits of the Settlement Agreement, the Writ\nPetition was withdrawn on 21.09.2020. It is thereafter that the\npresent application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act was filed. The\nsequence of events leads us to conclude that the letter of\nrepudiation was issued only to wriggle out of the terms of the\nSettlement Agreement.\n\n48. The foregoing clarifies beyond doubt that the claims sought\nto be submitted to arbitration were raised as an afterthought.\nFurther, SPML's allegations of coercion and economic duress in\nthe execution of the Settlement Agreement lack bona fide. They\nare liable to be knocked down as ex facie frivolous and untenable.\n\n49. In view of the above-referred facts, which speak for\nthemselves, we are of the opinion that this is a case where the High\nCourt should have exercised the prima facie test to screen and\nstrike down the ex-facie meritless and dishonest litigation. These\nare the kinds of cases where the High Court should exercise the\nrestricted and limited review to check and protect parties from\nbeing forced to arbitrate.\"\n\n42.

The scope of examination by the Court in the light of\nSection\n11(6A)\nand the law that has developed in that regard was also\nexamined by various other decisions, which are not, however, of\nparticular significance to the present case, but may be noticed.\nIn\n\nMagic Eye Developers Pvt Ltd v. Green Edge Infrastructure Pvt\nLtd25\n, a Bench of two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court examined\nthe extent to which a\nSection 11(6)\nreferral court could examine the\nplea of existence of validity of the arbitration agreement. The\nSupreme Court noted the introduction of\nSection 11(6A)\nand the\nprinciple stated therein, that the Court could only examine whether an\narbitration agreement exists between the parties; nothing more,\nnothing less. Thereafter, however, the Supreme Court reiterated the\nview expressed in para 25 of NTPC that the referral court was\nrequired to enquire as to the parties to the agreement and the\napplicant's privity to the agreement, and conclusively decide this issue\nat the referral stage itself. Similarly, held the Supreme Court in para\n12 of the report in Magic Eye Developers, the dispute regarding the\nexistence of the validity of the arbitration agreement has also to be\nconclusively determined by the referral court, and cannot be left for\ndecision by the Arbitral Tribunal. Paras 9 to 13 of Magic Eye\nDevelopers may be reproduced, thus, in this context:\n(2023) 8 SCC 50\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 29 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\"9. Thus, post-\nArbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act,\n, the jurisdiction of the court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is\nlimited to examining whether an arbitration agreement exists\nbetween the parties - \"nothing more, nothing less\". Thus, as per\nthe\nSection 11(6A)\nof the Act, it is the duty cast upon the referral\ncourt to consider the dispute/issue with respect to the existence of\nan arbitration agreement.\n\n10. At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the settled\nposition of law, pre-referral jurisdiction of the court under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act is very narrow and inheres two\ninquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry\nas to the parties to the agreement and the applicant's privity to the\nsaid agreement. The said matter requires a thorough examination\nby the referral court. [para 25 of the decision in NTPC] The\nSecondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is\nwith respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. Both are\ndifferent and distinct.\n\n11. So far as the first issue with respect to the existence and the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement is concerned, as the same goes\nto the root of the matter, the same has to be to conclusively decided\nby the referral court at the referral stage itself. Now, so far as the\nnon-arbitrability of the dispute is concerned, even as per the law\nlaid-down by this Court in the case of\nVidya Drolia\n(supra), the\ncourt at prereferral stage and while examining the jurisdiction\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act may even consider prima facie\nexamining the arbitrability of claims. As observed, the prima facie\nreview at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood and trim off\nthe side branches in straightforward cases where dismissal is\nbarefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation\nmust stop at the first stage.\n\n12. However, so far as the dispute with respect to the existence\nand validity of an arbitration agreement is concerned and when the\nsame is raised at pre-referral stage, the referral court has to decide\nthe said issue conclusively and finally and should not leave the\nsaid issue to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. The reason is\nthat the issue with respect to the existence and validity of an\narbitration agreement goes to the root of the matter.\n\n13. As observed by the Constitution Bench in the case of N.N.\nGlobal Mercantile Pvt. Ltd.26, sans an agreement, there cannot be\nany reference to the arbitration.\nIn\nthe said decision\nthis Court has\nN.N. Global Mercantile (P) Ltd v.

We are of the opinion that\ntherefore, if the dispute/issue with respect to the existence and\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement is not conclusively and finally\ndecided by the referral court while exercising the pre-referral\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nand it is left to the arbitral tribunal,\nit will be contrary to\nSection 11(6A)\nof the Arbitration Act. It is the\nduty of the referral court to decide the said issue first conclusively\nto protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when there\ndoes not exist any arbitration agreement and/or when there is no\nvalid arbitration agreement at all.\"\n\n44. Another Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court\nin\nLombardi Engineering Ltd v. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam\nLtd27\n, reiterated the legal position emerging from Duro Felguera and\nVidya Drolia, after referring to the relevant passages from the said\ndecisions:\n\n\"29. Following the general rule and the principle\nlaid down\nin\n\nVidya Drolia\n(supra), this Court has consistently been holding\nthat the arbitral tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine\nand decide all questions of non-arbitrability.\n\nIn\nPravin Electricals\n(P) Ltd v. Galaxy Infra\nand\nEngineering Private Ltd28, Sanjiv\nPrakash v. Seema Kukreja29\nand\nIndian Oil Corpn Ltd v. NCC\nLtd30\n, the parties were referred to arbitration, as the prima facie\nview in each of these cases on the objection of non-arbitrability\nwas found to be inconclusive. Following the exception to the\ngeneral principle that the court may not refer parties to arbitration\nwhen it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-\n\narbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks India Pvt Ltd,\n\nSecunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah\nand\n\nSons31 and B & T AG v.

A deeper analysis into the aspect of the parties to arbitration,\nand the extent to which this could be decided by a referral court under\n\nSection 11(6)\nwas undertaken by a constitution Bench of the Supreme\nCourt in Cox and Kings, before which the issue which had arisen for\nconsideration was thus delineated:\n\n\"2. Five Judges of this Court are called upon to determine the\nvalidity of the \"Group of Companies\" doctrine in the jurisprudence\nof Indian arbitration. The doctrine provides that an arbitration\nagreement which is entered into by a company within a group of\ncompanies may bind non-signatory affiliates, if the circumstances\nare such as to demonstrate the mutual intention of the parties to\nbind both signatories and non-signatories. This doctrine is called\ninto question purportedly on the ground that it interferes with the\nestablished legal principles such as party autonomy, privity of\ncontract, and separate legal personality. The challenge before this\nCourt is to figure out whether there can be a reconciliation between\nthe Group of Companies doctrine and well-settled legal principles\nof corporate law and contract law.\"\n\n46. The following question of law had been referred by a Bench of\nthree Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court, for determination by a\nLarger Bench, in Cox and Kings:\n\n\"5.1. (a) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be read\ninto\nSection 8\nof the Act or whether it can exist in Indian\njurisprudence independent of any statutory provision;\n\n5.2. (b) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should continue\nto be invoked on the basis of the principle of \"single economic\nreality\";\n\n5.3. (c) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be\nconstrued as a means of interpreting implied consent or intent to\narbitrate between the parties; and\n\n5.4. (d) Whether the principles of alter ego and/or piercing the\ncorporate veil can alone justify pressing the Group of Companies\ndoctrine into operation even in the absence of implied consent.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 32 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n47. After considering a veritable plethora of decisions not only by\nthe Supreme Court of India, but also the law as it exists in France,\nSwitzerland, England, Singapore and the US, the Supreme Court\nexamined in detail the circumstances in which a party who was not a\nsignatory to the arbitration agreement could nonetheless be made a\nparty to the proceedings. The conclusion of the Supreme Court on\nthis issue is to be found in paras 83, 84 and 86 of the report, which\nread thus:\n\n\"83. Reading\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act in view of the\nabove discussion gives rise to the following conclusions : first,\narbitration agreements arise out of a legal relationship between or\namong persons or entities which may be contractual or otherwise;\nsecond, in situations where the legal relationship is contractual in\nnature, the nature of relationship can be determined on the basis of\ngeneral contract law principles; third, it is not necessary for the\npersons or entities to be signatories to the arbitration agreement to\nbe bound by it; fourth, in case of non-signatory parties, the\nimportant determination for the Courts is whether the persons or\nentities intended or consented to be bound by the arbitration\nagreement or the underlying contract containing the arbitration\nagreement through their acts or conduct; fifth, the requirement of a\nwritten arbitration agreement has to be adhered to strictly, but the\nform in which such agreement is recorded is irrelevant; sixth, the\nrequirement of a written arbitration agreement does not exclude the\npossibility of binding non-signatory parties if there is a defined\nlegal relationship between the signatory and non-signatory parties;\nand seventh, once the validity of an arbitration agreement is\nestablished, the Court or tribunal can determine the issue of which\nparties are bound by such agreement.\n\n84. It is presumed that the formal signatories to an arbitration\nagreement are parties who will be bound by it. However, in\nexceptional cases persons or entities who have not signed or\nformally assented to a written arbitration agreement or the\nunderlying contract containing the arbitration agreement may be\nheld to be bound by such agreement. As mentioned in the\npreceding paragraphs, the doctrine of privity limits the imposition\nof rights and liabilities on third parties to a contract. Generally,\nonly the parties to an arbitration agreement can be subject to the\nfull effects of the agreement in terms of the reliefs and remedies\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 33 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nbecause they consented to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\nTherefore, the decisive question before the Courts or tribunals is\nwhether a non-signatory consented to be bound by the arbitration\nagreement. To determine whether a non-signatory is bound by an\narbitration agreement, the Courts and tribunals apply typical\nprinciples of contract law and corporate law. The legal doctrines\nprovide a framework for evaluating the specific contractual\nlanguage and the factual settings to determine the intentions of the\nparties to be bound by the arbitration agreement.\n\n*****\n\n86. Courts and tribunals across the world have been applying\ntraditional contractual and commercial doctrines to determine the\nconsent of the non-signatory parties to be bound by the arbitration\nagreement. Generally, consent-based theories such as agency,\nnovation, assignment, operation of law, merger and succession,\nand third-party beneficiaries have been applied in different\njurisdictions. In exceptional circumstances, non-consensual\ntheories such as piercing the corporate veil or alter ego and\nestoppel have also been applied to bind a non-signatory party to an\narbitration agreement. The Group of Companies doctrine is one\nsuch consent-based doctrine which has been applied, albeit\ncontroversially, for identifying the real intention of the parties to\nbind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement.\"\n\n48. In para 97, the Supreme Court advocated the interpretation of\ncommercial contracts in a pragmatic manner, keeping in mind\ncommercial realities:\n\n\"97....... The Courts must interpret contracts in a manner that\nwould give them a sense of efficacy rather than invalidating the\ncommercial interests of the parties. The meaning of the contract\nmust be gathered by adopting a common sense approach, which\nshould \" not be allowed to be thwarted by a narrow, pedantic and\nlegalistic interpretation\". Therefore, there is a need to adopt a\nmodern approach to consent, which takes into consideration the\ncircumstances, apparent conduct, and commercial facets of\nbusiness transactions.\"\n\n49. The position which emerges where there are multiple\nagreements was also examined thus, in paras 121 and 122 of the\nreport:\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 34 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\"121. In case of a composite transaction involving multiple\nagreements, it would be incumbent for the Courts and tribunals to\nassess whether the agreements are consequential or in the nature of\na follow-up to the principal agreement. This Court in Canara\nBank33observed that a composite transaction refers to a situation\nwhere the transaction is interlinked in nature or where the\nperformance of the principal agreement may not be feasible\nwithout the aid, execution, and performance of the supplementary\nor ancillary agreements.\n\n122. The general position of law is that parties will be referred\nto arbitration under the principal agreement if there is a situation\nwhere there are disputes and differences \"in connection with\" the\nmain agreement and also disputes \"connected with \" the subject-\n\nmatter of the principal agreement. In Chloro Controls34, this Court\nclarified that the principle of \"composite performance\" would have\nto be gathered from the conjoint reading of the principal and\nsupplementary agreements on the one hand, and the explicit\nintention of the parties and attendant circumstances on the other.\nThe common participation in the commercial project by the\nsignatory and non-signatory parties for the purposes of achieving a\ncommon purpose could be an indicator of the fact that all the\nparties intended the non-signatory party to be bound by the\narbitration agreement. Thus, the application of the Group of\nCompanies doctrine in case of composite transactions ensures\naccountability of all parties who have materially participated in the\nnegotiation and performance of the transaction and by doing so\nhave evinced a mutual intent to be bound by the agreement to\narbitrate.\"\n\n50. The threshold standard was thus explained:\n\n\"127. In Cox & Kings35, Surya Kant, J. observed that Reckitt\nBenckiser36 fixed a higher threshold of evidence for the\napplication of the Group of Companies doctrine as compared to\nearlier decisions of this Court. This Court's approach is Reckitt\nBenckiser is indicative of the fact that the mere presence of a\ngroup of companies is not the sole or determinative factor to bind a\nnon-signatory to an arbitration agreement. Rather, the Courts or\ntribunals should closely evaluate the overall conduct and\ninvolvement of the non-signatory party in the performance of the\ncontract.

In other words, the test is to\ndetermine whether the non-signatory has a positive, direct, and\nsubstantial involvement in the negotiation, performance, or\ntermination of the contract. Mere incidental involvement in the\nnegotiation or performance of the contract is not sufficient to infer\nthe consent of the non-signatory to be bound by the underlying\ncontract or its arbitration agreement. The burden is on the party\nseeking joinder of the non-signatory to the arbitration agreement to\nprove a conscious and deliberate conduct of involvement of the\nnon-signatory based on objective evidence.\n\n128. An arbitration agreement is a distinct and separate\nagreement from the substantive commercial contract which\ncontains the arbitration agreement. An arbitration agreement is\nindependent of the other terms of the contract, to the extent that\nnullification of the contract will not lead to invalidation of the\narbitration agreement. The concept of separability of the arbitration\nagreement from the underlying contract ensures that the intention\nof the parties to resolve the disputes through arbitration does not\nvanish merely because of a challenge to the legal validity of the\nunderlying contract.al. To join a non-signatory to arbitration, the\ndecisive question that has to be answered is whether a non-\nsignatory consented to the arbitration agreement, as distinct from\nthe underlying contract containing the arbitration agreement.\n\n*****\n\n132. We are of the opinion that there is a need to seek a balance\nbetween the consensual nature of arbitration and the modern\ncommercial reality where a non-signatory becomes implicated in a\ncommercial transaction in a number of different ways. Such a\nbalance can be adequately achieved if the factors laid down under\nDiscovery Enterprises37 are applied holistically. For instance, the\ninvolvement of the non-signatory in the performance of the\nunderlying contract in a manner that suggests that it intended to be\nbound by the contract containing the arbitration agreement is an\nimportant aspect. Other factors such as the composite nature of\ntransaction and commonality of subject-matter would suggest that\nthe claims against the non-signatory were strongly interlinked with\nthe subject-matter of the tribunal's jurisdiction. Looking at the\nfactors holistically, it could be inferred that the non-signatories, by\nvirtue of their relationship with the signatory parties and active\ninvolvement in the performance of commercial obligations which\nare intricately linked to the subject-matter, are not actually\nONGC Ltd v.

Thereafter, the Supreme Court went into the aspect of the\nstandard of determination by a referral court, which was the last issue\narising for consideration before it. In para 161, the Supreme Court\nnoted the insertion of sub section (6A) in\nSection 11\nof the 1996 Act\nby the 2015 Amendment Act, as well as the omission of the said\ninserted sub section (6A) by the 2019 Amendment Act, and observed\nthat, as the amendment to\nSection 11\nby the 2019 Amendment Act\nhave yet to be notified,\nSection 11(6A)\ncontinues to remain in force.\nThereafter comes para 163, on which Mr. Rao relies:\n\n\"163.\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration Act enshrines the principle of\ncompetence-competence in Indian arbitration law. The provision\nempowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction,\nincluding any ruling on any objections with respect to the existence\nor validity of arbitration agreement.\nSection 16\nis an inclusive\nprovision which comprehends all preliminary issues touching upon\nthe jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. The doctrine of\ncompetence-competence is intended to minimise judicial\nintervention at the threshold stage. The issue of determining parties\nto an arbitration agreement goes to the very root of the\njurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunal.\"\n\n52. Following this, in para 166, the Constitution Bench held that, at\nthe referral stage, a Court has only to determine prima facie existence\nof an arbitration agreement and if the issue could not be determined\nby the referral court, it has to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. It\nwas emphasized that \"referral court\" should not unnecessarily\ninterfere with the arbitral proceedings and, rather, show allow the\nArbitral Tribunal to exercise its primary jurisdiction.\n\n53. On the aspect of inclusion of a non-signatory to the arbitral\nproceedings, the Constitution Bench holds in para 169 thus:\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 37 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\"169. In case of joinder of non-signatory parties to an arbitration\nagreement, the following two scenarios will prominently emerge:\n\nfirst, where a signatory party to an arbitration agreement seeks\njoinder of a non-signatory party to the arbitration agreement; and\nsecond, where a non-signatory party itself seeks invocation of an\narbitration agreement. In both the scenarios, the referral court will\nbe required to prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration\nagreement and whether the non -signatory is a veritable party to\nthe arbitration agreement. In view of the complexity of such a\ndetermination, the referral court should leave it for the Arbitral\nTribunal to decide whether the non-signatory party is indeed a\nparty to the arbitration agreement on the basis of the factual\nevidence and application of legal doctrine. The Tribunal can delve\ninto the factual, circumstantial, and legal aspects of the matter to\ndecide whether its jurisdiction extends to the non-signatory party.\nIn the process, the Tribunal should comply with the requirements\nof principles of natural justice such as giving opportunity to the\nnon-signatory to raise objections with regard to the jurisdiction of\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. This interpretation also gives true effect to\nthe doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of\ndetermination of true parties to an arbitration agreement to be\ndecided by the Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection 16\n.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n54. Following the above discussion, in para 170 and in its various\nsub-paras, the Supreme Court has laid down determinative\nconclusions, of which the following are relevant for the present\ndispute:\n\n\"170.1. The definition of \"parties\" under\nSection 2(1)(h)\nread with\n\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration Act includes both the signatory as well\nas non-signatory parties;\n\n170.2. Conduct of the non-signatory parties could be an indicator\nof their consent to be bound by the arbitration agreement;\n\n170.3. The requirement of a written arbitration agreement under\n\nSection 7\ndoes not exclude the possibility of binding non-signatory\nparties;\n\n170.4.\nUnder the Arbitration Act\n, the concept of a \"party\" is\ndistinct and different from the concept of \"persons claiming\nthrough or under\" a party to the arbitration agreement;\n\n170.5. The underlying basis for the application of the Group of\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 38 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nCompanies doctrine rests on maintaining the corporate\nseparateness of the group companies while determining the\ncommon intention of the parties to bind the non-signatory party to\nthe arbitration agreement;\n\n*****\n\n170.12. At the referral stage, the referral court should leave it for\nthe Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory is bound\nby the arbitration agreement; and\"\n\n55. The resultant position that emerges from a consolidated reading\nof all these decisions is that, while the legal position as it existed prior\nto 2015 empowered - rather, required - the referral court could enter\ninto several aspects such as existence of fraud, validity of the contract,\ndischarge of liability by accord and satisfaction and the like, this\nposition does not continue after the insertion of sub section (6A) in\n\nSection 11\nby 2015 Amendment Act. Inasmuch as the omission of\n\nSection 11(6A)\nby the 2019 Amendment Act is yet to be notified, the\nsub-section continues to remain in force.\nSection 11(6A)\nconsiderably\nrestricts the scope of inquiry by the referral court under\nSection 11(6)\n.\nThe referral court is essentially to concern itself with the existence\nand validity of the arbitration agreement. Peripheral, but connected,\nissues such as the aspect of limitation, and whether non-signatories to\nan arbitration agreement can be bound by it, would also fall for\ndetermination by the referral court. While examining these issues, the\nreferral court has to adopt a prima facie approach and is not to arrive\nat a conclusive determination. The final arbiter on these issues is, by\noperation of\nSection 16\n, the Arbitral Tribunal, and the jurisdiction of\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in that regard has to be respected. The referral\ncourt, however, cannot completely distance itself, while examining\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 39 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nthe existence of validity of an arbitration agreement, from the aspect\nof whether parties, who are being sought to be included in the arbitral\nproceedings, are or are not required to be included. If, however, it is\nnot possible from the material on record to arrive at a prima facie\nfinding in this regard, then, applying the kompetenz kompetenz\nprinciple and in view of\nSection 16\nof the 1996 Act, the matter has to\nbe left for determination by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n56. It is in the backdrop of these principles and standards that the\nrival contentions of learned Counsel have to be examined.\n\nOn merits\n\n57. If the contention of learned Counsel for both the respondents\nwere to be accepted, the sequitur would be that the petitioner's claims\ncould never be arbitrated, and that is obviously not acceptable. Every\narbitrable dispute must be arbitrated, if the arbitral institution is to\nretain any validity and legitimacy. It is not open to the Court to hold\nthat there exists an arbitral dispute, but it cannot be arbitrated.\n\n58. Indeed, neither of the respondents contends that there is no\narbitrable dispute. Each of the respondents contends that the dispute\nis solely between the petitioner and the other respondent. Ambience\ncontends that the dispute is between the petitioner and Tutelage,\nwhereas Tutelage contends that the dispute between the petitioner and\nAmbience. The petitioner contends, on the other hand, that the\ndispute is with both Respondents 1 and 2. The only issue before the\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 40 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nCourt is whether one, or the other, or both the respondents, have to be\nmade parties to the arbitration.\n\n59. In exercise of its jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nand in the\nlight of\nSection 11(6A)\nand the law that has developed in that regard,\nwhich reached its high watermark in Cox and Kings, the Court can\nexamine this issue only on a prima facie basis. If, prima facie, the\nCourt is able to arrive at a conclusion that either Ambience or\nTutelage - but not both - cannot be impleaded in the proposed\narbitration, the Court must so hold. While examining the issue,\nhowever, the Court must be conscious of the autonomy that vests in\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in this regard. As Cox and Kings holds, it is\nfundamentally for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide who should, or\nshould not, be a party before it. It is always open to a party before the\nArbitral Tribunal to contend that it has been unnecessarily roped in,\nand to seek deletion from the array of parties. It is not, therefore, as\nthough any permanent prejudice results to either of the parties, even if\nthis Court were to refer the dispute between the petitioner and both the\nrespondents to arbitration. The only situation in which any lasting\nprejudice may result is if the Court were to affirmatively hold that one\nor the other respondent cannot be impleaded in the arbitral\nproceedings. If this Court so holds, even prima facie, it is bound to\ninhibit the discretion vested in the Arbitral Tribunal in that regard. Of\ncourse, that said, the Court must, while referring the dispute to\narbitration, ensure that parties, who are clearly not necessary parties,\nand are not roped in. This is also a pre-eminent consideration. The\nCourt cannot blindly accept the stand of either party and refer the\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 41 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\ndispute to arbitration, where one or the other party contests its liability\nto be subjected to arbitral proceedings.\n\n60. The present controversy at hand, has to be examined keeping in\nmind all these factors.\n\n61. The claims that the petitioner proposes to refer to arbitration\nincluded providing of a habitable and usable access to the petitioner to\nthe leased area and reimbursement of the amount incurred by the\npetitioner in executing repair works in the leased area, apart from\ncompensation for the losses incurred by the petitioner. Paras 3, 4.1,\n4.2 and 4.3 of the Notice of Demand dated 10 August 2023 addressed\nby the petitioner to the respondents involves both the respondents\nwithin the ambit of the disputes. Para 4.1 flags a claim of ₹ 1,\n29,01,487.90, which is stated to have been spent by the petitioner in\nmaking the leased area habitable and usable. The petitioner claims the\nsaid amount from Ambience. Para 4.2 includes other costs incurred\nby the petitioner. The petitioner points that, as this included\nenhancement made by the petitioner to the leased area which cannot\nbe removed, Tutelage would continue to benefit from the said\nenhancement installed at the petitioner's costs. The amounts incurred\ntowards these enhancements are, therefore, being sought both from\nAmbience and Tutelage. As Mr. Rao points out, even after Tutelage\npurchased the leased area on 18 November 2022, nearly nine months\nelapsed before the leased area was handed over by the petitioner to\nTutelage. During this period, the prejudice to the petitioner\ncontinued, and Tutelage made no efforts to redress it. According to\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 42 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nthe petitioner, it continued to be prejudiced by having to hold\npossession of an inhabitable and unusable area. It had, in the process,\nto incur expenses towards transportation, loading and unloading fee,\nmoving fee, storage fee, rent, security deposit, incidental expenses and\nexpenses towards architectural services, design services, fit outs,\nconstruction registration, installation, structural assessment, security\nservices and transit insurance, apart from other costs. Both the\nrespondents, according to Mr. Rao, would be liable to reimburse these\nexpenses and costs, to one extent or the other, and the extent to which\neither petitioner would be liable, would have to be arbitrated.\n\n62. It cannot be said, at this prima facie stage, without a\ncomprehensive examination of the entire dispute and possibly by\nleading of evidence, that all these expenses would, if they were found\nto be payable to the petitioner, have to be borne either by Ambience or\nby Tutelage, to the exclusion of the other.\n\n63. Inasmuch as the petitioner's primary contention is that\nAmbience was in breach of its liability to provide, to the petitioner, a\nleased area in a habitable and usable form, and Clause 23.1 of the\nLease Deed dated 15 January 2021 specifically insulates Ambience\nfrom \"further liability\", it would require consideration as to whether,\nif the alleged breach of the lease agreement is found to have actually\ntaken place, Ambience can claim immunity from liability in that\nregard on the ground that it had sold the leased area to Tutelage on 18\nNovember 2022. This would have to be decided keeping in mind the\ncovenants of the Lease Deed and the terms of sale of the leased area\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 43 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\nfrom Ambience to Tutelage. It would further have to be examined\nwhether the sale of the leased area by Ambience to Tutelage\ntransferred all obligations by Ambience to Tutelage including the\nobligations relating to a period prior to 18 November 2022. The\neffect of the email 29 August 2022 from Ambience to the petitioner,\nwhich acknowledges the fact that the compressive strength of certain\ncolumns from the eighth floor is not as per the latest design\nparameters and assures the petitioner that Ambience aligning its teams\nto have changes executed at the site, would also have to be\nconsidered. Inasmuch as the petitioner is seeking damages, and had to\ncontinue to remain in possession of the leased area for a considerable\nperiod even after 18 November 2022, the extent to which these\ndamages, if payable to the petitioner, would have to be apportioned\nbetween Ambience and Tutelage, would also fall for determination.\n\n64. In my opinion, these are all intricate mixed issues of fact, which\nhave to be determined keeping in mind all the attendant facts and\ncircumstances and may require a detailed analysis of the material on\nrecord, perhaps by requiring evidence to be led. Applying the\nprinciple in the judgments cited earlier, these are not aspects on which\nthis Court can, even prima facie, arrive at a conclusion, which would\nbind the Arbitral Tribunal. The cumulative effect of Clauses 3, 8 and\nsub clauses (xv), (xxiv) of Clause 9(a) and Clause 9(b) of the Sale\nDeed dated 18 November 2022, as well as Clause 23.1 of the Lease\nDeed dated 15 January 2021 would also be required to be examined.\n\n65.

The very fact\nthat each respondent is seeking to palm off the liability on the other\ngives rise to disputed and triable factual issues, which would fall\nwithin the exclusive province of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n66. I cannot, therefore, concur with the submission either of Mr.\nRaajan or Mr. Sachar that either of the respondents has unnecessarily\nbeen dragged into the arbitral proceedings. While it would be open to\nboth the respondents to convince the learned Arbitral Tribunal that it\nshould be deleted from the array of parties, I am of the opinion that\nsuch a request, if made, should be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal,\nand that within the limited scope of\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act, this\nCourt should not pronounce on this issue.\n\nConclusion\n\n67. For all the aforesaid reasons, the objections of Ambience and\nTutelage, to their proposed inclusion in the arbitral proceedings, are\nrejected. This shall, however, not inhibit either of the respondents\nfrom raising the issue before the learned Arbitral Tribunal. If it is so\nraised, it shall be decided in accordance with law, uninhibited by any\nobservations in this judgment, which have been made solely for\ndisposing of the present petition under\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act.\n\nSignature Not Verified Signature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed ARB.P. 1268/2023 Page 45 of 46 Digitally Signed\nBy:AJIT KUMAR By:CHANDRASHEKHAR\nAN HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Signing Date:07.07.2024\nDate:07.07.2024 23:51 23:50\n\n68.
