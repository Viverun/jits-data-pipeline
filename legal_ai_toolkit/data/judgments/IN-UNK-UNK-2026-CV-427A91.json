To issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus directing the respondent\n Nos.1 to 7 to immediately produce the baby by name i.e.,\n Aditri before this Hon'ble Court.\n\n ii. To direct respondents to production of the baby named\n i.e., Aditri aged about two and half year, before this Hon'ble\n Court and hand over the detenue to the legal custody of the\n petitioner.\n\n iii. To Direct respondent No.3 to take action against the\n complaint filed by petitioner.\n\n d) And grant such other further reliefs as this Hon'ble\n Court deems fit to grant under circumstance of the case.\n\n 2. It is the case of the petitioner that he has\n\nmarried the daughter of respondent Nos.6 and 7, namely\n\nNityashree on 09.10.2019, in accordance with Hindu\n\nrituals and customs. Out of the said wedlock, they have a\n\nfemale baby by name 'Aditri R' who is born on\n\n13.08.2020. The said child was looked after by her\n\n -4-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nmother-Nityashree, till her death. Smt.Nityashree had\n\ncommitted suicide by hanging, on 22.10.2021. The\n\nrespondent Nos.6 and 7 has lodged complaint against the\n\npetitioner and members of his family to the jurisdictional\n\npolice. On that basis, Girinagar Police registered a case in\n\nCr.No.187/2021 against the petitioner and members of his\n\nfamily for the offence punishable under \nSections 498A\n,\n\n304B\n of Indian Penal Code R/W \nSection 3\n and \n4\n of the\n\nDowry Prohibition Act.\n\n 3. It is further case of petitioner that the\n\npetitioner was arrested in Cr.No.187/2021 and he was in\n\njudicial custody till he was released on bail on 15.07.2022,\n\nby the Sessions Court, Bengaluru. When the petitioner\n\nwas in judicial custody, respondent Nos.6 and 7 have\n\ntaken custody of daughter of petitioner Kum. Aditri aged\n\nabout 2 ½ years. After the release of the petitioner from\n\nthe judicial custody on bail, the petitioner lodged\n\ncomplaint in the jurisdictional Police Station against\n\nrespondent Nos.6 and 7 in Cr.No.384/2022 for the custody\n\n -5-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nof his child. However, they did not take any action to\n\nsecure the custody of minor baby of petitioner. In view of\n\nthese reasons, he is forced to file writ of Habeas Corpus to\n\nproduce the child from the custody of respondent Nos. 6\n\nand 7. It is also the contention of the petitioner that\n\nrespondent Nos.6 and 7 with an intention to grab the\n\nproperties have filed suit in O.S.No.4633/2022 on the file\n\nof Additional City Civil and Session Judge, Bengaluru for\n\nthe relief of partition.\n\n 4. It is the further case of petitioner that the\n\npetitioner is the natural father of minor girl and he is\n\nlegally entitled for the custody of the said minor girl under\n\nthe \nHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956\n. He is an\n\nadvocate and serving in Muthoot Fincorp, Bengaluru and\n\nearning sufficient income to maintain the minor child. The\n\npetitioner is emotionally attached to his daughter and he\n\nwould do anything and everything to protect the interest\n\nof the minor. Moreover respondent Nos.6 and 7 are not\n\n -6-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nthe legal guardian of Kum.Aditri. With these reasons,\n\nprayed to allow the petition.\n\n 5. It is the case of Respondent Nos.6 and 7 that\n\ndue to torture and harassment, their daughter Smt.\n\nNithyashree, wife of petitioner had committed suicide on\n\n22.10.2021. After her death, they filed complaint against\n\nthe petitioner and others. In the said case, petitioner and\n\nmember of his family were arrested and detained in the\n\njudicial custody. The relatives and well wishers of both\n\nthe petitioner and respondent Nos.6 and 7 requested\n\nrespondent Nos.6 and 7 to look after the minor daughter\n\nof the petitioner. Accordingly, respondent Nos.6 and 7\n\ntook the custody of their minor grand daughter, Kum.\n\nAditri. Now they have also admitted the child Kum.Aditri\n\nto Anganavadi Centre in their native place. Both\n\nrespondent Nos.6 and 7 are taking care and welfare of\n\nKum. Aditri.\n\n 6. It is the further case of respondent Nos.6 and 7\n\nthat the petitioner along with his brother and sisters have\n\n -7-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nbeen trying to dispose of the joint family property in order\n\nto deprive the legitimate share of the minor baby Aditri.\n\nTherefore, helplessly, on behalf of Kum. Aditri, respondent\n\nNo.6 has filed O.S.No.4633/2022 for partition and\n\nseparate possession of joint family property of petitioner\n\nbaby Aditri. In the said suit, they have also obtained\n\ninterim relief of temporary injunction restraining the\n\npetitioner and others from alienating the said property.\n\n 7. The petitioner ignoring all these facts, and\n\nsuppressing real facts, has filed a false complaint,\n\ncontending that respondent Nos.6 and 7 have kidnapped\n\nthe said minor from his custody. The petitioner was in\n\njudicial custody from October, 2021 till 17.05.2022,\n\nbetween the said period none of the relatives of the\n\npetitioner came forward to look after the Kum.Aditri. The\n\npetitioner being ungracious person, made false allegations\n\nagainst respondent Nos.6 and 7 that they have taken\n\nforceful custody of the Kum. Aditri. They also\n\napprehended that petitioner and members of his family\n\n -8-\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nmay not look after Kum. Aditri properly. With malafide\n\nintention, this petition is filed. With these reasons, prayed\n\nto reject the application.\n\n 8. We have heard the arguments of learned Senior\n\nCounsel Sri. D.R. Ravishankar, for the petitioner and Sri.\n\nH.C. Shivaramu, learned counsel for respondent Nos.6 and\n\n7 so also learned High Court Government Pleader on\n\nbehalf of the State. Both side advocate for petitioner and\n\nRespondents No.6 and 7 have urged grounds made out in\n\nthe petition and counter in their respective arguments.\n\n 9. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner has\n\nrelied on the following judgments:\n\n Criminal appeal No.838/2019\n\n \nTejaswini Gaud & others Vs Shekahar Jagadish\n Prasad\n.\n\n \nKm.

The following points are not in dispute:\n\n That the daughter of respondent Nos.6 and 7\n\n Smt. Nityashree was married petitioner and the\n said marriage was performed on 09.10.2019.\n From the said wedlock Kum. Aditri was born on\n 13.09.2020. Smt. Nityashree died unnatural\n death on 22.10.2021 and in this regard, the\n criminal case was registered against the\n petitioner on the complaint of respondent Nos.6\n and 7.\n\n Petitioner was arrested and detained in the\n judicial custody in Crime No.384/2022 at\n Girinagara Police Station from the date of his\n arrest till 15.07.2022.\n\n When the petitioner was in custody, none of\n the relatives of petitioner came forward to take\n custody of the minor child Kum.Aditri, who was\n aged 2 ½ years.\n\n This petition is filed on 07.06.2023 nearly\n about a year after petitioner was released from\n judicial custody.\n\n Respondent Nos.6 and 7 are grandparents of\n Kum. Aditri and after the death of Smt.\n Nityashree, she has been in custody of\n respondent Nos.6 and 7.\n\n - 11 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\n Respondent No.7 is acting as a guardian on\n behalf of Aditri and filed a suit in\n O.S.NO.4633/2022 in the Court of City civil and\n Sessions Judge, Bengaluru for relief of partition\n in respect of joint family property, which is said\n to be belonging to the petitioner and also\n challenged the Gift Deed dated 29.03.2021\n executed by deceased B. Puttegowda and his\n wife in favour of their son Kiran Kumar and the\n order of Temporary Injunction was also\n obtained in the said case.\n\n Respondent Nos.6 and 7 have filed petition in\n the Civil Court under the provisions of the\n \nHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956\n\n seeking custody of Kum.Aditri and said petition\n is pending consideration before the competent\n Court. Petitioner herein did not appear in the\n said case though notice was duly served and he\n has knowledge of pendency of the said case.\n\n 11. In this writ petition, it is contended by the\n\npetitioner that respondent Nos.6 and 7 have illegally\n\nobtained the custody of his child Kum. Aditri and illegally\n\ndetained her in their custody. During the course of the\n\narguments, it is not in dispute that since petitioner was in\n\njudicial custody and there were nobody to look after the\n\nminor child and hence respondent Nos.6 and 7 on the\n\nadvice of well wishers ready to take the responsibility of\n\n - 12 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nthe child and took her to their custody. It is not the\n\ncontention of the petitioner that respondent Nos.6 and 7\n\nare not looking after Kum.Aditri properly and they have no\n\nmeans to look after the minor. No allegation is made\n\nagainst them regarding care and custody of the minor.\n\nEven the minor is admitted to the School (Anganavadi). It\n\nis clear from the contention of both the parties that\n\nKum.Aditri is not illegally detained by respondent Nos.6\n\nand 7.\n\n 12. In this Habeas Corpus petition filed under\n\nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of Indian Constitution, this Court\n\ncannot decide the issue of right of the party to have\n\ncustody of minor child or to decide the said rights. A\n\ndetailed trial has to be conducted by recording the\n\nevidence of the parties etc., and to ascertain as to who is\n\nthe competent person to take custody of the minor and to\n\nprotect the interest of the minor. It is settled law that in\n\nany such dispute, more than the rights of the parties,\n\nwelfare of the minor is utmost important.\n\n - 13 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\n 13. It is not in dispute that respondent Nos.6 and 7\n\nhave already filed a petition before the competent court,\n\nclaiming the custody of the minor. The petitioner should\n\nhave appeared in the said case and contested the matters\n\nand claimed the custody of the minor or he himself would\n\nhave filed the petition before the competent court, seeking\n\ncustody of the minor. He did not approach the Civil\n\nCourt/Family Court seeking the custody of the minor and\n\napproached this Court under the extra-ordinary\n\njurisdiction of \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of Indian Constitution\n\nseeking relief of Habeas Corpus.\n\n 14. It is not disputed by the petitioner that his wife\n\nand mother of Kum.Aditri, died unnatural death. After her\n\ndeath, the petitioner was arrested and detained in the\n\njudicial custody till 15.07.2022 in a criminal case\n\nregistered on the basis of complaint lodged by respondent\n\nNo.6. It is not the case of the petitioner that when he was\n\nin judicial custody, some of his relatives were taking care\n\nof the minor child Kum. Aditri. Nothing is mentioned in\n\n - 14 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nthe petition regarding the custody of minor child\n\nKum.Aditri, when petitioner was in judicial custody. It is\n\nnot in dispute that Kum. Aditri has been in care and\n\ncustody of respondent Nos.6 and 7 after arrest and\n\ndetention of the petitioner in judicial custody, till this day.\n\nIt is also not the contention of petitioner that he has been\n\npaying any amount to respondent Nos.6 and 7 for looking\n\nafter Kum.Aditri or to meet the expenses of his daughter.\n\n 15. In the petition, petitioner has not disclosed as\n\nto whether there is anybody in his house or any female\n\nmember of his family, who could take care of the minor\n\nchild Kum.Aditri. According to his contention, he is\n\nserving in Muthoot Fincorp. If he is attending to his office\n\nwork, then who would look after and take care of the said\n\nminor, who is hardly aged 2 ½ years, is not explained. It\n\nis not disclosed in the petition regarding health condition\n\nof mother of the petitioner and whether she is in a\n\nposition to take care of Kum.Aditri. If there is nobody to\n\nlook after the said minor child, aged about 2 ½ years,\n\n - 15 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nthen how far the petitioner is able to look after the said\n\nminor daughter, is not explained in the petition or by filing\n\nan affidavit in this regard.\n\n The said minor Kum. Aditri has been in the custody\n\nof respondent Nos.6 and 7 for past about two years and\n\nshe has been adjusted to the company of her maternal\n\ngrand parents. If she is suddenly withdrawn from the said\n\ncompany, it may cause depression in the mind of the said\n\nminor girl. In view of the said reason, it is very much\n\nnecessary for the petitioner to disclose as to how he would\n\ntake care of his minor daughter. These facts need to be\n\ndecided after recording the evidence of both the parties, in\n\nthe pending G&WC proceedings before the Civil Court\n\nunder the \nHindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956\n.\n\n 16. It is contended by the petitioner that he is\n\nhaving lucrative income by working in the said Muthoot\n\nFincorp, Bengaluru, but mere having funds is not\n\nsufficient. The child aged about 2 ½ years needs love,\n\naffection and care through out the day. Respondent Nos.6\n\n - 16 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nand 7 are none other than the maternal grand parents of\n\nKum. Aditri. She was said to be admitted to Anganavadi\n\nCentre and they are also ready to take care of the said\n\nminor.\n\n 17. It is not in dispute that after death of wife of\n\npetitioner, respondent Nos.6 has lodged complaint against\n\nthe petitioner for which criminal case has been registered\n\nagainst the petitioner and his family members. They were\n\narrested. They were in judicial custody. Due to the same,\n\nit appears relationship between them may not be cordial.\n\nThereafter, on behalf of Kum. Aditri, respondent No.6 has\n\nfiled suit O.S.No.4633/2022 for partition, on the ground\n\nthat to defeat the rights of minor daughter, petitioner and\n\nthe members of his family are trying to alienate/transfer\n\nproperty belonging to joint family. It might have added\n\nsalt to injury to the relationship between petitioner and his\n\nfamily with respondent Nos.6 and 7. Under these\n\ncircumstances, how the members of the family of the\n\npetitioner would receive the minor girl is also difficult to\n\n - 17 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nassess. If custody of the minor is given without detail\n\nassessment of facts and circumstances, then petitioner,\n\nwho is a natural guardian of the minor may withdraw suit\n\nfiled on behalf of minor in O.S.No.4633/2022 and\n\nmembers of his family may dispose of the property.\n\nLooking to all these facts and circumstances, it is just and\n\nnecessary that parties shall approach the Civil Court,\n\nwherein G&WC case is pending and seek the custody of\n\nminor child. In the writ proceedings, all these facts\n\ncannot be decided, since it is summary trial proceedings.\n\n 18. Let us scan the judgments relied by the learned\n\nadvocate for petitioner:\n\n \nIn the case of \nTEJASWINI GAUR VS. SHEKHARA\n\nJAGADISH PRASAD TIWARI AND OTHERS1, In\n this\n\ncase, wife of the petitioner died due to cancer and\n\npetitioner was suffering tuberculosis. He was admitted in\n\nthe hospital and was taking treatment for the said disease.\n\nDuring the said period, appellant was taking care of the\n\n1\n\n Judgment of Apex Court in Crl.A.No.838/2019 dt: 06.05.2019\n\n - 18 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nchild. Father of the minor child sought for the custody of\n\nminor child by filing criminal writ petition(Habeas Corpus)\n\nbefore the Bombay High Court, directing the appellant's to\n\nhandover minor child to the father. The Bombay High\n\nCourt considered the said writ petition and allowed the\n\nsame. The said order was challenged before the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court by the custodian of the child and the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court confirmed the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble High Court and directed the appellants to\n\nhandover the custody of the child to its father.\n\n 19. \nIn the case of \nRajeswari Chandrashekar\n\nGanesh Vs State of Tamil Nadu & Others2\n, this case is\n\nalso pertaining to child's custody. In this case, it is held\n\nthat the employment of the writ of Habeas Corpus in child\n\ncustody cases is not pursuant to, but independent of any\n\nstatute. The jurisdiction exercised by Courts, , rests in\n\nsuch a cases, on its inherent equitable powers and exerts.\n\nThe force of the State, as parent, patriae, for protection of\n\n2\n\n 2022 Live Law (SC) 605\n\n - 19 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nits minor ward and the very nature and scope of inquiry\n\nand the results sought to be accomplished call for the\n\nexercise of the jurisdiction of the Court of equity. The\n\nprimary object of the Habeas Corpus petition as applied to\n\nminor children, is to determine in whose custody the best\n\ninterest of the child will probably be advanced.\n\n 20. In the case of KM. SUNITHA AND OTHERS\n\nVS SMT. SHYAM KALI3. In this case two minor sons\n\nrepresented by their father, filed custody of the children\n\nfrom step mother of deceased mother of minors and the\n\nfather had also married for second time after death of his\n\nwife (mother of minors). The High Court of Allahabad\n\nconsidering facts in detail and law on the subject, allowed\n\nthe petition and directed respondents of that case to hand\n\nover the custody of minors to their father.\n\n 21. \nIn the case of \nSRI. O. ULAGANATHAN VS.\n\nK.R.G. CHANDRASHEKAR & OTHERS\n, in this case father\n\n3\n\n AIR 1982 ALL Page 1\n\n - 20 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nhad filed writ of Habeas Corpus, directing Parents-In-Law\n\nto handover the custody of the minor to the father and the\n\nmother died due to accidental burn injuries and the father\n\nwas under treatment. Thereafter, Parents-In-Law of the\n\npetitioner had taken the custody of the minors from the\n\nparents of the petitioners, when the petitioner was under\n\nthe treatment. The Madras High Court, relying on various\n\njudgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court and also the High\n\nCourt, held that father is entitled for custody of the\n\nminors. In all the above decisions cited at the Bar by the\n\nlearned counsel appearing for petitioner, the welfare and\n\nparamount interest of the minors alone are considered in\n\ndeciding the issue in question.\n\n 22. In the remaining decisions \nreferred above\n,\n\nrelied by learned counsel for the petitioner, rendered by\n\nthe other High Courts, are in the similar lines. In all the\n\nabove said cases, custody of the minor children were\n\nordered to be given to natural guardian in the petition\n\n - 21 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nfiled under Habeas Corpus. There is no need to mention\n\nthem in detail.\n\n 23. In the above said cases, relied by the learned\n\nadvocate for petitioner, the question involved in those\n\ncases is who is legally entitled for the custody of the minor\n\nchild? Looking to the peculiar facts and circumstances of\n\nthe present case, there are certain complications, which\n\nare narrated supra recording of evidence of both the\n\nparties is necessary to ascertain in which hands the minor\n\nis safe and her interest would be protected. That cannot\n\nbe decided in this petition. Already petition is said to be\n\nfiled under \nHindu Minority and Guardianship Act\n by\n\nrespondent Nos.6 and 7. In such petition, both the parties\n\ncould agitate their rights. In view of peculiar facts and\n\ncircumstances involved in this case, the principle of law\n\nlaid down in\n the aforesaid judgment is not applicable.\n\n \n24. The learned counsel for respondent relied on the\n\njudgment reported in 2006 (2) MLJ Crl.82 in the case of\n\nR. SURESH KUMAR VS. K.A. KALAVATHI\n. In this case,\n\n - 22 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nit is held by Madras High Court, Habeas Corpus is not\n\nmaintainable seeking custody of the minor child. The\n\nfacts are different in the said case. Because the dispute\n\nbetween the husband and wife and minor children were in\n\nthe custody of the mother. Therefore, it is held that, such\n\ndispute should be decided by the competent Civil Court\n\nand not under the Habeas Corpus, that is not the fact in\n\nthe present case.\n\n 25. AIR 1992 Patna, 76 in the case of VIMALA\n\nDEVI VS. SUBHAS CHANDRA YADAVA. In the said\n\ncase, it is held that if the father was alleged to be\n\nmurdered mother of the minor and in that event normal\n\nrule that father is a guardian need not be followed.\n\nAppreciating the evidence available on record, the Patna\n\nHigh Court found that welfare of the minor daughter would\n\nnot be protected by the father, therefore, held that he is\n\nnot entitled for the custody.\n\n \n26. AIR 2002 Rajasthan Page No.148 in the case of\n\nGOVARDHAN LAL AND OTHERS VS. GAJENDRA\n\n - 23 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nKUMAR AND OTHERS. In this case, father sought for\n\ncustody of minor boy aged 14 years, who was in the\n\ncustody of grandparents. After the death of his mother,\n\nwhen he was just 3 months old; his maternal\n\ngrandparents have taken him and have been looking after\n\nhim. When Court enquired the said boy, he inclined live\n\nwith his maternal grandparents. Father contacted second\n\nmarriage and out of the said marriage he has a daughter.\n\nConsidering these facts, the Court upheld the opinion of\n\nthe minor and permitted him to be in the custody of his\n\nmaternal grandparents.\n\n 27. Kum. Aditri is in custody of respondents No.6\n\nand 7 for last about two years and minor is said to be\n\ncomfortable in their hands. Hence, it is not proper to\n\nconsider and decide all these facts, in this proceedings. In\n\nthe interest of the minor, she shall continue to be in\n\ncustody of the respondent Nos.6 and 7 till rights of both\n\nthe parties are decided by the competent Civil Court.\n\nHowever, petitioner being the natural father of minor, has\n\n - 24 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\nlove and affection towards his daughter. Therefore, he\n\nshall have visitation rights to meet Kum. Aditri, once in a\n\nweek on every Sunday, between 9.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m.\n\n 28. Considering the contentions of both side, we\n\ndeem it appropriate to direct the Civil Court, wherein\n\nG&WC is pending, to expedite disposal of the same,\n\nuninfluenced by the observations made in this order.\n\n 29. For the aforesaid discussions, we pass the\n\nfollowing:\n\n ORDER\n\n i. The petition is dismissed.\n\n ii. The custody of minor child Kum. Aditri,\n aged about 2 ½ years shall be continued\n with respondent Nos.6 and 7 till the said\n right is decided by the competent Civil\n Court, wherein the petition has been filed by\n respondent Nos.6 under \nHindu Minority and\n Guardianship Act, 1956\n. Petitioner is given\n visitation right once in a week on every\n\n - 25 -\n\n NC: 2024:KHC:7731-DB\n\n WPHC No. 47 of 2023\n\n Sunday between 9.00. a.m to 7.00 p.m., till\n disposal of the said petition.\n\n iii. Both the parties are directed to co-\n operate for the early disposal of petition filed\n under the \nHindu Minority and Guardianship\n Act, 1956\n, pending before competent Civil\n Court. The said Court is directed to expedite\n disposal of this case at the earliest,\n uninfluenced by the observations made in\n this order.\n\n Sd/-\n\n JUDGE\n\n Sd/-\n\n JUDGE\n\nAG\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 18",
