FACTS :\n\n2.1. The appellant is a Co-operative Housing Society\nregistered under the \nGujarat Co-operative Societies Act,\n1961\n and the respondent is a Partnership Firm. As per the\nplaint, the respondent is in the business of buying and\nselling of land and development.\n\n2.2. The respondent had filed Special Civil Suit No.272 of\n2013 before the learned Principal Senior Civil Judge,\nMirzapur, Ahmedabad, against the present appellant inter\nalia seeking specific performance of an Agreement-to-sell\n(\"ATS\" for short) dated 22/12/2006 and an undated\nMemorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\" for short) allegedly\nexecuted between the parties. Along with the suit, the\nrespondent had also filed an application for interim\ninjunction. Thereafter, the suit was transferred to the\nlearned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Sanand and\nrenumbered as Special Civil Suit No.407 of 2017.\n\n2.3. On 11/06/2013, the learned Principal Senior Civil\nJudge, Mirzapur issued summons to the appellant and\nimmediately on receipt of the summons, within 30 days, on\n29/6/2013 the appellant preferred an application under\n\n Page 2 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\n inter-alia on the ground that\nnotice under \nsection 167\n of the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act was not issued by the respondent to the\nregistrar. The respondent filed its reply to the application\nunder \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\n.\n\n2.4. During the pendency of the suit, as there was\npossibility of settlement, on 16/7/2018, the appellant filed\na purshis before the learned trial court indicating its\nwillingness to settle the entire dispute.\n\n2.5. In 2020, the appellant and Radhe Developers (India)\nLtd. filed Special Civil Suit No.51 of 2020 before the\nAdditional Senior Civil Judge, Sanand against the\nrespondent inter-alia praying to declare the ATS, MOU and\nbooking letters are unenforceable.\n\n2.6. Thereafter, the respondent after a period of 9 years,\nmoved an application on 22/6/2022 before the learned trial\ncourt below inter-alia praying that the application Ex.Nos.5\nand 15 be heard together and to also close the appellant's\nright to file a written statement and reply to the Ex.No.5.\n\nThe learned trial court partly allowed the respondent's\napplication on the very day and closed the appellant's right\nto file a written statement and reply to the application Ex.5.\n\n2.7. On 06/07/2022, the learned trial court rejected the\nSuit under \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\n, against which the\nrespondent preferred First Appeal No.2320 of 2022 on\n16/07/2022 before this Hon'ble Court. On 08/08/2022, the\n\n Page 3 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nco-ordinate Bench of this Court passed the following order:\n\n \"2. Learned advocate Mr. D.C. Dave assisted by\n learned advocate Mr. Saurabh Amin insisted\n for interim relief. According to learned Counsel\n many parcels of the land have already been\n purchased in the interregnum and, therefore,\n there shall be need for some protective order.\n\n 3. Mr. Pandya, since has filed his appearance\n today he requires time of nearly two weeks to\n take instructions and file his affidavit-in-reply.\n However, in the meantime, he has on\n instructions stated that no change will be\n effected presently whatever is the status shall\n continue. He shall provide the details of the\n status of these lands as on today in writing\n and there shall be no change effected till the\n next date of hearing. On the next date of\n hearing, concerned authorized person shall be\n present and apprise this Court about the\n present status of the property in question.\"\n\n2.8. This interim arrangement made on the appellant's\nstatement above came to be extended from time to time\nuntil the disposal of the First Appeal.\n\n2.9. On 06/10/2022, co-ordinate Bench of this Court\nallowed the First Appeal. However, insofar as the interim\narrangement was concerned, this Court observed as follows\nbased on the appellant's statement: -\n\n \"17. So far as Annexure-B (from page 134 to\n\n 141) is concerned, those are the original\n allottees. Any transfer in the interregnum to\n\n Page 4 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n them shall be accounted separately.\n\n Considering the fact that there is a serious\n dispute in relation to the list from page 142\n to 145 it is volunteered by the learned\n advocate, Mr.Bhadrish Raju on getting\n instructions that the respondent shall not be\n dealing with the said list for a fortnight for\n the purpose of transfer or otherwise in any\n mode or manner.\n\n 18. Both the parties to co-operate with the\n trial Court which shall initiate the hearing\n of Exh.5 within a period of two weeks from\n the date of receipt of a copy of this order and\n shall decide the same within a period of four\n weeks thereafter\n\n 19. Without prejudice to the rights and\n contentions as may be raised by the parties\n that this arrangement has been made which\n shall be also subject to the order that would\n be passed by the trial Court concerned after\n hearing both the sides on merits of\n injunction application. None of the\n observations made by this Court in this\n order, while considering the matter on merit,\n shall in any manner prejudice the rights of\n either side.\"\n\n2.10. On 18/10/2022, the respondent moved a speaking to\nminutes application, inter alia, on the following ground: -\n\n \"At the time of pronouncement of judgment,\n the Hon'ble Court had been pleased to frame\n a time schedule for deciding injunction\n application below Exh 5 application (4 weeks\n from the commencement of hearing). Your\n lordship bad been further pleased to extend\n the interim arrangement (recorded in Para-\n\n Page 5 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n 17) to operate till the Ld. Trial Court decides\n the Ex. 5 application. It appears that\n inadvertently, the said aspect is not reflected\n in the final order dated 06.10.2022 and\n hence this note.\"\n\n2.11. On 19/10/2022, the appellant made a statement\nbefore this Hon'ble Court that the interim arrangement\nconcerning the list from page number 142-145 of the\nappellant's affidavit dated 01/09/2022 filed in the First\nAppeal may continue until four weeks from the date of the\ninitiation of the hearing of the interim injunction application\nEx.5 by the learned trial court or until an order on merits is\npassed, whichever is earlier. This Court passed an order\nrecording the appellant's above statement on 19/10/2022\nand modified the order dated 06/10/2022 accordingly.\n\n2.12. Thereafter, on 20/10/2022, the Suit was restored.\nThe learned trial court thereafter passed an order on\n20/10/2022 laying out a time schedule to complete hearing\nthe of the application Exh.5. On 01/11/2022, the appellant\nmoved an application to re-open its right to file a written\nstatement and reply to the interim injunction application\nalong with the written statement and reply to the interim\ninjunction application, production application, and\nsupporting documents requesting that its right to file a\nwritten statement and reply to the interim injunction\napplication be re-opened in light of the direction by this\n\n Page 6 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nCourt to decide the interim injunction application within a\nspan of 4 weeks and also in the interest of justice to ensure\nthat all the appellant's defenses are bought on record. On\nthe very day, the respondent filed its written objections to\nthe appellant's application.\n\n2.13. The learned trial court rejected the appellant's\napplication to re-open its right to file a written statement\nand reply to the application Exh.5 on 01/11/2022 against\nwhich the appellant preferred Special Civil Application\nNo.22297 of 2022 and this Court was pleased to allow the\nSpecial Civil Application and re-open the appellant's right to\nfile a written statement and reply to the Application Exh.5\nvide order dated 09/11/2022. That inadvertently in para\n27(E) of the order dated 09/11/2022 in Special Civil\nApplication No. 22297 of 2022, passed by this Court, it has\nbeen mentioned that \"Interim arrangement as noted by the\nDivision Bench of this Court vide order dated 19/10/2022\nshall continue for a period of three weeks from the date this\norder is submitted to the learned Civil Judge concerned.\".\n\n2.14. On 12/11/2022, the appellant challenged the\norder dated 06/10/2022 (as modified by the order dated\n19/10/2022) passed by this Court in First Appeal No. 2320\nof 2022 before the Hon'ble Apex Court vide SLP(C) No.\n20976 of 2022.\n\n Page 7 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n2.15. Thereafter, as the appellant's request to file an\nadditional written statement was allowed by this Court in\nSpecial Civil Application No. 22297/2022, on 17/11/2022,\nan additional written statement was filed before the learned\ntrial court and even the order dated 09/11/2022 was served\non the learned trial court. The respondent thereafter filed its\nreply to the written statement and additional written\nstatement along with documents to be relied upon on.\n\n2.16. On 25.11.2022, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased\nto issue notice in SLP(C) No. 20976 of 2022 and also\nobserved that no final judgment may be passed in the Suit.\nThe Hon'ble Apex Court also recorded in its order that \"...\nTill the disposal of the said interim injunction, status quo\nwith respect to the property in dispute shall be maintained\nby the parties. However, the appellant submits that it has\nbeen inadvertently recorded by the Hon'ble Apex Court that\nstatus quo has to be maintained by the parties till disposal\nof the interim injunction, because on 25/11/2022, the\nHon'ble Apex Court had only directed that the interim\narrangement between the parties shall continue till disposal\nof the Exh.5 application and also because there was no\norder of status quo existing qua the Suit lands. The\nappellant submits that the appellant has filed IA No.\n193876 of 2022 to modify the above order.\n\n2.17. That on 29/11/2022, the appellant and respondent\n\n Page 8 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ncompleted their oral arguments with respect to the\napplication Exh.5 and the appellant even submitted its\nwritten submissions. The learned trial court allowed the\napplication Exh.5 vide order dated 30/11/2022. That after\npronouncement of the Impugned Order, the appellant\nmoved an application before the learned trial court praying\nthat the Impugned Order may be stayed to exercise its\nstatutory remedy of challenging the Impugned Order. The\nrespondent filed its objections to the above application.\nThereafter, the application for stay came to be rejected by\nthe learned trial court vide order order dated 30/11/2022.\n\n2.18. The appellant, being aggrieved and dissatisfied by\nthe aforesaid Impugned Order dated 30/11/2022 passed\nbelow application Ex.5 in Special Civil Suit No.407 of 2017,\nhas preferred the present Appeal From Order.\n\n3. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT :\n\n3.1. Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas mainly based his arguments on the points of [1]\nlimitation [2] novation [iii] non-joinder of parties [iv]\nunamended \nsections 13\n, \n14\n and \n16(1)(c)\n of the Specific\nRelief Act [v] bar of \nsection 167\n of the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act and [vi] \nSection 10\n of the Specific Relief Act.\n\nBased upon those points, Mr.Soparkar, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant has argued on the principle of\ninjunction and argued on the finding of the learned trial\n\n Page 9 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ncourt.\n\n Whereas, on the other-hand, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned\nsenior advocate for the respondent has based his\ncontentions and arguments in reply to all the contentions\nraised by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant.\n\n4. LIMITATION :-\n\n4.1. Submission of appellant on limitation:\n\n On the point of Limitation, Mr.Soparkar, learned\nsenior advocate for the appellant has contended that the\nappellant is a registered co-operative housing society and\nas per the ATS, the appellant was required to execute sale\ndeed for the suit land in favour of the respondent upon\npayment of 50% of the total consideration and as according\nto the ledger amount submitted by the respondent, they\nhave paid 50% of the amount of total consideration of\nRs.15,80,08,800/- on 28/8/2007. Since the 50% of the\namount has been paid on 28/8/2007, and the suit is filed\nin 2013, as per Part 1 of \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act\n, the\nsuit is beyond 3 years.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas submitted that as per the rejoinder filed by the\nrespondent, it is the case of the respondent that execution\nof the sale deed were refused after the payment of 50% of\nconsideration, which has taken place in the year 2007 and\n\n Page 10 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ntherefore, the trial court has erred in not believing the issue\nof limitation.\n\n4.2. Submission of the respondent on Limitation:\n\n Per contra, on the point of Limitation, it has been\ncontended by Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for\nthe respondent that ATS does not provide for any calendar\ndate for executing sale deed and when there is no specific\ndate mentioned, Part 1 of \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act\n\ndoes not apply. It is contended that ATS fixes time for\npayment only and even that is not essence of the contract.\nATS clause 3 provides for fulfillment of reciprocal\nobligations by the defendant society, namely (i) obtaining\nclear title (ii) giving possession of land. Clause 4 and 5\nfurther provide that seller shall obtain Income Tax clearance\ncertificates by 15.01.2007 and shall obtain all necessary\npermissions for sale. It is further contended that the society\nwas not in a position to perform its part of obligation. As\nsuch, till 2013, only two survey numbers were owned by the\nappellant society and in May, 2013, though the society\ncleared title of survey Nos.227 and 228, the society refused\nto perform according to the terms of the ATS and the suit\nwas immediately filed and the suit does no barred by law of\nlimitation.\n\n4.3. Finding of the Court on Limitation:-\n\nHaving heard the learned advocates for the respective\n\n Page 11 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nparties, the issue which is in dispute between the parties is\nas to, from which date the period of limitation starts for\nfiling of the suit. Admittedly, ATS and MOU are the main\ndocuments relied upon by both the parties and there is no\ndispute regarding the date of MOU. There is dispute with\nrespect to the date of MOU. Here in this case, the\nrespondent - plaintiff filed the suit for specific performance\nof the ATS which is executed in the year 2006 and also\nMOU which according to the case fo the appellant is\nexecuted in the year 2007 and as per the case of the\nrespondent, it is executed in the year 2011. No doubt, the\nlearned trial court in the finding regarding limitation has\ngiven finding that the execution of MOU is in the year 2011\nand it has been considered to be the extension of time for\nthe purpose of ATS and the payment of Rs.11,49,60,600/-\nhas been given on 25/5/2011 as per the ledger which is\nproduced in the trial court's record vide Ex.3/22.\n\n As such, the contention of both the parties on the\npoint of limitation depends upon the appreciation of the\ndate of MOU. There is no dispute regarding the date of ATS,\nwhich is in the year 2006 but the MOU which is placed on\nrecord is without date and as per the respondent, it is of\n2011. It depends upon the books of accounts - ledger which\nis produced through which contention regarding payment as\nto upto which date the payment has been made can be\ndecided. Under the circumstances, this Court is of the\nopinion that as the issue of limitation is of a nature\n\n Page 12 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwherein there is disputes regarding dates and payments\nand hence the issue of limitation can be decided by the trial\ncourt as a preliminary issue taking upon preliminary\nevidence regarding execution of the MOU and the payment\nmentioned.\n\n5. BAR OF SECTION 167 :\n\n5.1. Submission of appellant on bar of section 167:\n\nSo far as contention regarding question of bar under \nsection\n157\n of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act is concerned,\nit is submitted by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for\nthe appellant that the suit is not maintainable for non-\n\ncompliance of \nsection 167\n of the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act. As the suit touches the business of the\nsociety, notice is required under \nsection 167\n of the Gujarat\nCo-operative Societies Act and notice was required to be\nserved at the registered address and admittedly the\nrespondent failed to serve such notice.\n\n5.2. Submission of respondent on bar of \nsection 167\n:\n\nPer contra, it is vehemently opposed by Mr.Minir Joshi,\nlearned senior advocate for the respondent that the order by\nwhich the trial court has rejected the plaint in exercise of\nOrder 7 Rule 11 on the point of non-compliance of issuance\nof notice under \nsection 167\n of the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act, in the said order, the learned trial court has\ndealt with the judgement of the Division Bench of this Court\n\n Page 13 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrendered in First Appeal No.2320 of 2022 and considering\nthe dispute between the parties, in para 15.6 it has been\nheld as under :-\n\n \"15.6. Thus, considering the complexity of\n the transactions involved the Court notices\n that though the focal point of dispute\n revolves around the suit lands of which the\n Cooperative Housing society claims to have\n right, based on which agreement to sell and\n MOU have been executed in favour of plaintiff\n firm, however, at this stage of order 7 rule\n 11, where one is required to look into the\n pleadings only, it would be unjust to go to\n hold as \"touching the business of the\n society\"....,\n\n It has been observed in para 15.6 of the order of the\nDivision Bench in First Appeal No.2320 of 2012 that, this is\nnot a matter which can be permitted to be dismissed on the\npoint of \nsection 167\n of the Act. Thereafter the Division\nBench considered the issue of maintainability of the suit.\nHowever, the said order passed by the Division Bench in\nFirst Appeal No.2320 of 2022 has been challenged before\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court and the SLP is pending. However, at\npresent, as per the order of the Division Bench in First\nAppeal No.2320 of 2012, the bar of \nsection 167\n, as it has\nbeen directed to be decided as preliminary issue by the trial\ncourt in accordance with law at the time of hearing.\n\n6. NOVATION :\n\n6.1. Submission of appellant on novation:\n\n Page 14 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant has\ncontended that the respondent - plaintiff in the suit has\nprayed for specific performance of the ATS and MOU. It is\nvehemently submitted that in the rejoinder filed by the\nrespondent - plaintiff in para 5, condition Nos.B and C of\nATS were reproduced and it was specifically stated that as\nper the new conditions laid down in the MOU, there was a\nnovation in the agreement. It is further submitted that as\nper \nsection 62\n of the Indian Contract Act, the original ATS\nin this case, does not need to be performed and it is the\ncase of the respondent. It is further submitted that in the\nMOU, clause Nos.7C and 7D came to be inserted, which\nhas changed the nature of the agreement. Clause 7C\nindicates new party Mr.Ashish Patel holds 25% in the suit\nland and clause 7D states that the appellant and\nrespondent will jointly sell, mortgage and deal with the suit\nland. As such, the agreement for sale has been converted\ninto a joint-selling agreement/joint development agreement\nand hence, the suit for specific performance is not\nmaintainable. It is also contended that specific\nperformance of the MOU also prayed for and the\nrespondent has also prayed in the plaint that sale deeds in\nthe suit lands may be executed in favour of anyone\nproposed by the respondent which indicates that the\nnature of the agreement between the parties has ceased to\nbe an agreement for sale to that of an understanding of\ndevelopment of the land, as it novated the original ATS.\n\n Page 15 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n \nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n In support of above submission, Mr.Soparkar, learned\nsenior advocate for the appellant has placed reliance on the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the of \nManoj Kumar\nAgrawal v. Dulari Bai\n 2006 SCC OnLine Chapter 15 para\n5, wherein the Hon'ble Court has held and observed as\nfollows:\n\n \"....It indicates that on the wishes or choice\n of appellant the sale deed is to be executed\n even in the name of third person whether\n such an agreement can be treated as\n agreement to sale is a question debatable.\"\n\n6.2. Submission of respondent on novation :\n\nPer contra regarding contention of the appellant on novation\nis concerned, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for\nthe respondent has submitted that the contention of\nnovation is not raised in the in Written Statement and said\ncontention of novation was never raised before the learned\ntrial court. However, the plaintiff has prayed for specific\nperformance of the ATS as well as MOU on the issue of\nnovation being academic and suit will not fail on the ground\nthat ATS did not survive. It is further contended that even\notherwise, the MOU has to be read as a whole. In the MOU\nall the terms of the ATS are reproduced in paragraph Nos. 1\nto 6 and in 7(a) to 7(f) conditions are laid down regarding\nIncome Tax clearance. It is contended that all essential\nconditions of ATS remained the same in MOU and in law\n\n Page 16 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthere is no novation and the parties never understood it to\nbe so. It is submitted that all the obligation of the society to\nsell the lands to the respondent - plaintiff remain the same\nand therefore the arrangement between respondent -\nplaintiff and Mr.Ashish Patel, which was contained in 7(c)\nand 7(d), which becomes effective, after the land is sold by\nsociety, and so it does not amount to a new agreement with\nthe society and it is to be interpreted accordingly. It is also\nsubmitted that the phrase \"banne-taraf-wala\" used in\nclause 7(d) of the MOU is to be read with clause 7(c) of the\nMOU which meant the plaintiff and Mr.Ashish Patel and\nnot the plaintiff and the society and as per the MOU,\nobligation of the society is to convey the agreed land to the\nrespondent - plaintiff for agreed consideration and\nthereafter the respondent plaintiff can deal with the land\nwith Mr.Ashish Patel or anyone else.\n\n6.3. Finding on Novation :\n\nSo far as the contentions of the parties with regard to the\nissue of novation is concerned, \nsection 62\n of the Indian\nContract Act is required to be considered, which reads thus:\n\n \"62. Effect of novation, rescission, and\n alteration of contract.--\n\n If the parties to a contract agree to\n substitute a new contract for it, or to\n rescind or alter it, the original contract,\n need not to be performed.\n\n Page 17 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n Here in this case, it appears that the respondent -\nplaintiff has argued in a contradictory manner regarding\nsubmission of novation, it has been submitted that all the\nconditions of ATS remain the same in the MOU and MOU is\nnever considered to be novation and clause 7(c) and 7(d)\nclearly which meant the respondent - plaintiff and\nMr.Ashish Patel and not the plaintiff and the society and\nhence it is not a new agreement with the society. However,\nin the opinion of this Court, the respondent cannot contend\nboth the contentions. If the respondent seeks specific\nperformance of the ATS as well as MOU, it is evident that\nthere is change in the ATS and which can be termed to be\nnovation of the ATS by insertion of clause 7(c) and 7(d). If it\nis believed that the clause 7(c) and 7(d) were between the\nrespondent plaintiff and Mr.Ashish Patel, then the\ninterpretation of phrase \"banne taraf wala\" alleviates\nMr.Ashish Patel to the signatory of the MOU on behalf of\nthe Chairman of the society as well as in his individual\ncapacity, as he has been given 25% in the land and if that\nis the case, right of Mr.Ashish Patel are also to be decided\nwhile granting performance of the MOU and there is no\nreason for not impleading Mr.Ashish Patel as a party to the\nsuit. The respondent plaintiff is seeking 100% performance\nof the MOU and rights of Mr.Ashish Patel are going to be\naffected and hence the respondent cannot take\ncontradictory stand especially considering the fact that\nthere is no other development agreement between the\n\n Page 18 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrespondent and Mr.Ashish Patel.\n\n \nEven if it is considered that clause 7(d) is not between\nMr.Ashish Patel and the respondent - plaintiff, then it has\nto be appellant society and the respondent. Hence, it can be\nconsidered that Mr.Ashish Patel has right without he being\na party or clause 7(c) and 7(d) is between the appellant and\nthe respondent. Hence, making the MOU is a novation\nversion of ATS in the form of joint development agreement,\nwhich cannot be termed to be specific agreement to sell. It is\nnot specific agreement to sell, however, if it is proved by\nleading cogent and convincing evidence that the insertion of\nclause 7(c) is a novation on the basis of evidence, the\noriginal ATS, which is to be enforced, will go away and\nhence in the light of the observations made in the case of\n\nManoj Kumar Agrawal\n (supra) as such an agreement can\nbe treated as agreement to sell in is a question which is\ndebatable, this issue of novation is left open to be decided\nby the learned trial court but at the same time as observed,\nnew insertion of clause 7(c) and 7(d), right of Mr.Ashish\nPatel is also to be affected if on the point of novation is to be\ndecided by the trial court, eitherway.\n\n7. NON-JOINDER OF PARTIES:\n\n7.1. Submission of appellant on non-joinder of parties:\n\nIt is vehemently submitted by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant that the suit is bad for non-\njoinder of necessary parties. It is admitted position that the\n\n Page 19 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nappellant has filed the litigation against the original owners\nof the suit, additionally, clause 5 of the ATS specifically\nrecords that earlier allotment made to the allottees /\nmembers of the society have to be cancelled. In such\ncircumstances, it is submitted that without adding either\nthe original owners of the suit land or the allottees /\nmembers, as party to the suit, the suit is not maintainable,\nas it is apparent on record that the rights of third parties\nwill be adversely affected, in case they are not heard. As\nstated above, the MOU also reveals that 75% of the land\nbelongs to the respondent - plaintiff and 25% of the land\nbelongs to Mr.Ashish Patel. It is also submitted that in the\nrejoinder before the learned trial court, the respondent -\nplaintiff has admitted that they will be joining necessary\nparty to the suit. However, the respondent - plaintiff has\ncontended that the original owners, allottees / members or\nMr.Ashish Patel need not to be included as party to the\nsuit., whereas the respondent himself has admitted that\nthey are going to add necessary parties to the suit, this is\nnot the case where the principles of Dominus Litus will\napply.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned advocate for the appellant has\nplaced reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nthe case of Mashkoor Hasan Khan vs. Zila Parishad, 1977\nSCC OnLine All 185, paragraph Nos. 2 & 3 of which read\nas follow:\n\n Page 20 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n \"2. lt may be noted that the actual bidders\n or the persons in whose favour the rights\n have now been granted by the Zila Parishad\n were not implemented as parties to the suit\n nor in Parishad wean interim injunction\n made in the suit. They are not implemented\n in this appeal either. In the counter\n affidavit filed on behalf of the Zila Parishad\n it has been stated that written contracts\n had already been entered into by the Zila\n Parishad for collection of carcass, bones\n and hides etc. with third parties who are\n not parties to the suit or to this appeal.\n\n 3. It is thus obvious that in case any\n injunction is granted it will adversely affect\n the interest of third parties who are not\n present before this Court. In these\n circumstances the interim injunction was\n not in fact maintainable and it was not\n necessary for the court below to go into the\n merits of the application.\"\n\n \n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant, has also placed reliance on the decision of the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nMumbai International\nAirport Private Limited Vs. Regency Convention Centre\nand Hotels Private Limited and others\n, reported in\n(2010) 7 SCC 417 on the aspect of proper and necessary\nparty. Para 15 of \nthe said decision\n reads as follow :\n\n \"A `necessary party' is a person who ought to\n have been joined as a party and in whose\n\n Page 21 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n absence no effective decree could be passed\n at all by the Court. If a `necessary party' is\n not impleaded, the suit itself is liable to be\n dismissed. A `proper party' is a party who,\n though not a necessary party, is a person\n whose presence would enable the court to\n completely, effectively and adequately\n adjudicate upon all matters in disputes in\n the suit, though he need not be a person in\n favour of or against whom the decree is to be\n made. If a person is not found to be a proper\n or necessary party, the court has no\n jurisdiction to implead him, against the\n wishes of the plaintiff. The fact that a\n person is likely to secure a right/interest in\n a suit property, after the suit is decided\n against the plaintiff, will not make such\n person a necessary party or a proper party\n to the suit for specific performance.\"\n\n \nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant, has also placed reliance on the decision in the\ncase of \nSajli Kishku vs. Talamoyee Kishku and Ors.\n\nreported in MANU/WB/2023/2019.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas further submitted that Mr.Ashish Patel admittedly being\n25% of the co-owner of the suit land, would even otherwise\nis a necessary party to the suit and the relief are clearly\nevidently against him. It is the case of the respondent that\nthe phrase \"banne tarafwala\" used in clause 7(d) would\ninclude only Mr.Ashish Patel and the respondent, meaning\nthereby condition to sell the land would be limited to them\n\n Page 22 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nonly, as such, Mr.Ashish Patel becomes a party to the MOU,\neven otherwise, Mr.Ashish Patel cannot be termed as\n\"banne tarafwala\". It is also submitted by Mr.Soparkar,\nlearned senior advocate for the appellant that specific\nperformance of the contract cannot be sought without\nimpleading all the parties to the contract and since the\nrespondent has sought specific performance of the MOU in\nwhich Mr.Ashish Patel is having right to the extent of 25%\nof land, as per becomes bad for non-joinder of parties and\nthe phrase \"banne tarafwala\" clearly shows admission that\nMr.Ashish Patel is a party to the MOU.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\non the point of non-joinder of parties has submitted that\nthere are allottees in the suit land who have been allotted\nplots in the land after the society came into existence and\nthey are having Allotment Letters to that effect and\nadmittedly the plaintiff was knowing this aspect, as it is\nmentioned in the ATS regarding removal of the allottees\nfrom the suit land. It is also submitted that some of the\nallottees have filed application for leave to appeal being\nMisc. Civil Application No.34 of 2023, which states that the\nallottees are the owners of the land allotted to them and the\nundivided share of the common amenities and services as\nmembers of the societies. The allotment Dastavej, which is\nproduced, pertains to plot No.15 of the appellant society in\nthe leave to appeal specifically states that apart from the\n\n Page 23 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nplot, the members have undivided rights in the common\nroads and common amenities of the appellant society, which\nhas spread across the entire appellant society including the\nsuit land against which valuable consideration has been\npaid by the allottees / members. Therefore, even the\nallottees / members are the necessary parties to the suit as\nthey have interest in the suit land.\n\n \nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nthe case of Shivali (Vejalpur) Co-Op.Hosg. \nSociety Ltd. v.\nState of Gujarat\n, reported in 2009 SCC OnLine Guj\n11322.\n\n7.2. Submission of the respondent on non-joinder of\nparties:\n\n Per contra, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate\nfor the respondent on the point of non-joinder of parties has\ncontended that the parties to the agreement to sell are\nnecessary parties, only parties to the contract can be joined,\nno party claiming individual right can be joined as it would\nchange the nature of the suit. \nIn support of his submission,\nMr.Mihir Joshi has relied on the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of \nGurmit Singh Bhatia v. Kiran\nKant Robinson\n, reported in (2020) 13 SCC 773]. Para 5 of\nthe said judgement reads thus:\n\n Page 24 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n \"5. We have heard the learned counsel for the\n respective parties at length.\n\n 5.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the\n original plaintiffs filed the suit against the original\n owner - vendor - original defendant no.1 for specific\n performance of the agreement to sell with respect to\n suit property dated 3.5.2005. It is an admitted position\n that so far as agreement to sell dated 3.5.2005 of\n which the specific performance is sought, the appellant\n is not a party to the said agreement to sell. It appears\n that during the pendency of the aforesaid suit and\n though there was an injunction against the original\n owner - vendor restraining him from transferring and\n alienating the suit property, the vendor executed the\n sale deed in favour of the appellant by sale deed dated\n 10.07.2008. After a period of approximately four years,\n the appellant filed an application before the learned\n trial Court under \nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\n for his\n impleadment as a defendant. The appellant claimed\n the right on the basis of the said sale deed as well as\n the agreement to sell dated 31.3.2003 alleged to have\n been executed by the original vendor. The said\n application was opposed by the original plaintiffs. The\n learned trial Court despite the opposition by the\n original plaintiffs allowed the said application which\n has been set aside by the High Court by the impugned\n judgment and order. Thus, it was an application under\n \nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\n by a third party to the\n agreement to sell between the original plaintiffs and\n original defendant no.1 (vendor) and the said\n application for impleadment is/was opposed by the\n original plaintiffs. Therefore, the short question which\n is posed for consideration before this Court is, whether\n the plaintiffs can be compelled to implead a person in\n the suit for specific performance, against his wish and\n more particularly with respect to a person against\n whom no relief has been claimed by him?\n\n 5.2 An identical question came to be considered before\n this Court in the case of Kasturi vs. Iyyamperumal,\n reported in (2005) 6 SCC 733 and applying the\n principle that the plaintiff is the dominus litis, in the\n similar facts and circumstances of the case, this Court\n observed and held that the question of jurisdiction of\n\n Page 25 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n the court to invoke \nOrder 1 Rule 10 CPC\n to add a party\n who is not made a party in the suit by the plaintiff\n shall not arise unless a party proposed to be added has\n direct and legal interest in the controversy involved in\n the suit. It is further observed and held by this Court\n that two tests are to be satisfied for determining the\n question who is a necessary party. The tests are - (1)\n there must be a right to some relief against such party\n in respect of the controversies involved in the\n proceedings; (2) no effective decree can be passed in the\n absence of such party. It is further observed and held\n that in a suit for specific performance the first test can\n be formulated is, to determine whether a party is a\n necessary party there must be a right to the same relief\n against the party claiming to be a necessary party,\n relating to the same subject matter involved in the\n proceedings for specific performance of contract to sell.\n\n It is further observed and held by this Court that in a\n suit for specific performance of the contract, a proper\n party is a party whose presence is necessary to\n adjudicate the controversy involved in the suit. It is\n further observed and held that the parties claiming an\n independent title and possession adverse to the title of\n the vendor and not on the basis of the contract, are not\n proper parties and if such party is impleaded in the\n suit, the scope of the suit for specific performance shall\n be enlarged to a suit for title and possession, which is\n impermissible. It is further observed and held that a\n third party or a stranger cannot be added in a suit for\n specific performance, merely in order to find out who is\n in possession of the contracted property or to avoid\n multiplicity of the suits. It is further observed and held\n by this Court that a third party or a stranger to a\n contract cannot be added so as to convert a suit of one\n character into a suit of different character.\n\n 5.3. In the case of Kasturi (supra) in paragraphs 15\n and 16, this Court observed and held as under:\n\n \"15. As discussed hereinearlier, whether Respondents 1\n and 4 to 11 were proper parties or not, the governing\n principle for deciding the question would be that the\n presence of Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 before the court\n would be necessary to enable it effectually and\n completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the\n\n Page 26 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n questions involved in the suit. As noted hereinearlier,\n in a suit for specific performance of a contract for sale,\n the issue to be decided is the enforceability of the\n contract entered into between the appellant and\n Respondents 2 and 3 and whether contract was\n executed by the appellant and Respondents 2 and 3 for\n sale of the contracted property, whether the plaintiffs\n were ready and willing to perform their part of the\n contract and whether the appellant is entitled to a\n decree for specific performance of a contract for sale\n against Respondents 2 and 3. It is an admitted position\n that Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 did not seek their\n addition in the suit on the strength of the contract in\n respect of which the suit for specific performance of\n the contract for sale has been filed.\n\n Admittedly, they based their claim on independent title\n and possession of the contracted property. It is,\n therefore, obvious as noted hereinearlier that in the\n event, Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 are added or\n impleaded in the suit, the scope of the suit for specific\n performance of the contract for sale shall be enlarged\n from the suit for specific performance to a suit for title\n and possession which is not permissible in law. \nIn the\n case of \nVijay Pratap v. Sambhu Saran Sinha\n [(1996) 10\n SCC 53] this Court had taken the same view which is\n being taken by us in this judgment as discussed above.\n This Court in that decision clearly held that to decide\n the right, title and interest in the suit property of the\n stranger to the contract is beyond the scope of the suit\n for specific performance of the contract and the same\n cannot be turned into a regular title suit. Therefore, in\n our view, a third party or a stranger to the contract\n cannot be added so as to convert a suit of one\n character into a suit of different character. As\n discussed above, in the event any decree is passed\n against Respondents 2 and 3 and in favour of the\n appellant for specific performance of the contract for\n sale in respect of the contracted property, the decree\n that would be passed in the said suit, obviously, cannot\n bind Respondents 1 and 4 to 11. It may also be\n observed that in the event, the appellant obtains a\n decree for specific performance of the contracted\n property against Respondents 2 and 3, then, the Court\n shall direct execution of deed of sale in favour of the\n appellant in the event Respondents 2 and 3 refusing to\n\n Page 27 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n execute the deed of sale and to obtain possession of the\n contracted property he has to put the decree in\n execution. As noted hereinearlier, since Respondents 1\n and 4 to 11 were not parties in the suit for specific\n performance of a contract for sale of the contracted\n property, a decree passed in such a suit shall not bind\n them and \nin that case\n, Respondents 1 and 4 to 11\n would be at liberty either to obstruct execution in\n order to protect their possession by taking recourse to\n the relevant provisions \nof CPC\n, if they are available to\n them, or to file an independent suit for declaration of\n title and possession against the appellant or\n Respondent 3. On the other hand, if the decree is\n passed in favour of the appellant and sale deed is\n executed, the stranger to the contract being\n Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 have to be sued for taking\n possession if they are in possession of the decretal\n property.\n\n 16. That apart, from a plain reading of the expression\n used in sub-rule (2) \nOrder 1 Rule 10 CPC\n \"all the\n questions involved in the suit\" it is abundantly clear\n that the legislature clearly meant that the\n controversies raised as between the parties to the\n litigation must be gone into only, that is to say,\n controversies with regard to the right which is set up\n and the relief claimed on one side and denied on the\n other and not the controversies which may arise\n between the plaintiff-appellant and the defendants\n inter se or questions between the parties to the suit and\n a third party. In our view, therefore, the court cannot\n allow adjudication of collateral matters so as to\n convert a suit for specific performance of contract for\n sale into a complicated suit for title between the\n plaintiff-appellant on one hand and Respondents 2 and\n 3 and Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 on the other. This\n addition, if allowed, would lead to a complicated\n litigation by which the trial and decision of serious\n questions which are totally outside the scope of the\n suit would have to be gone into. As the decree of a suit\n for specific performance of the contract for sale, if\n passed, cannot, at all, affect the right, title and\n interest of Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 in respect of the\n contracted property and in view of the detailed\n discussion made hereinearlier, Respondents 1 and 4 to\n 11 would not, at all, be necessary to be added in the\n\n Page 28 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n instant suit for specific performance of the contract for\n sale.\"\n\n That thereafter, after observing and holding as above,\n this Court further observed that in view of the principle\n that the plaintiff who has filed a suit for specific\n performance of the contract to sell is the dominus litis,\n he cannot be forced to add parties against whom, he\n does not want to fight unless it is a compulsion of the\n rule of law.\n\n 5.4. In the aforesaid decision in the case of Kasturi\n (supra), it was contended on behalf of the third parties\n that they are in possession of the suit property on the\n basis of their independent title to the same and as the\n plaintiff had also claimed the relief of possession in\n the plaint and the issue with regard to possession is\n common to the parties including the third parties, and\n therefore, the same can be settled in the suit itself. It\n was further submitted on behalf of the third parties\n that to avoid the multiplicity of the suits, it would be\n appropriate to join them as party defendants. This\n Court did not accept the aforesaid submission by\n observing that merely in order to find out who is in\n possession of the contracted property, a third party or\n a stranger to the contract cannot be added in a suit for\n specific performance of the contract to sell because\n they are not necessary parties as there was no\n semblance of right to some relief against the party to\n the contract. It is further observed and held that in a\n suit for specific performance of the contract to sell the\n lis between the vendor and the persons in whose favour\n agreement to sell is executed shall only be gone into\n and it is also not open to the Court to decide whether\n any other parties have acquired any title and\n possession of the contracted property.\n\n 5.5. It is further observed and held by this Court in\n the aforesaid decision that if the plaintiff who has\n filed a suit for specific performance of the contract to\n sell, even after receiving the notice of claim of title\n and possession by other persons (not parties to the\n suit and even not parties to the agreement to sell for\n which a decree for specific performance is sought)\n\n Page 29 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n does not want to join them in the pending suit, it is\n always done at the risk of the plaintiff because he\n cannot be forced to join the third parties as party-\n defendants in such suit. The aforesaid observations\n are made by this Court considering the principle that\n plaintiff is the dominus litis and cannot be forced to\n add parties against whom he does not want to fight\n unless there is a compulsion of the rule of law.\n\n 5.6. Therefore, considering the decision of this\n Court in the case of Kasturi (supra), the appellant\n cannot be impleaded as a defendant in the suit filed\n by the original plaintiffs for specific performance of\n the contract between the original plaintiffs and\n original defendant no.1 and in a suit for specific\n performance of the contract to which the appellant is\n not a party and that too against the wish of the\n plaintiffs. The plaintiffs cannot be forced to add party\n against whom he does not want to fight. If he does so,\n in that case, it will be at the risk of the plaintiffs.\"\n\n Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has further submitted that if the original owners\nare joined, nature of the suit will be converted into the suit\nfor enforcement of the ATS between the farmers and the\nsociety and even otherwise, as per ATS, onus is on the\nsociety to get the sale deeds executed from the farmers.\n\n The appellant has stated that in the suit filed by the\nappellant against the original owners of the land, it has\nbeen stated that the appellant has right in the suit land by\nvirtue of ATS, power of attorney, development agreement\nwith the original owners and it has paid full consideration to\nthe original owners and they have transferred the\npossession to the society and therefore, when the purchaser\n\n Page 30 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nhas right to compel the defendant society to procure the\nconcurrence and decree against the present appellant with a\ndirection to get the conveyance from the original owners and\nexecute in favour of the respondent can be passed.\n\n Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent on the point of non-joinder of allottees has\nsubmitted that the so-called allottees are strangers to the\nATS and MOU and they are not proper and necessary. It is\nsubmitted that there is no pleadings by the appellants -\ndefendants as to who were the allottees in the suit land\nprior to 22/12/1960 and no documents of allotment of\nsociety were produced and only list of allottees has been\nproduced on record which is a typed list prepared by the\nsociety, which is false and has inherent contradictions and\nis not supported by any evidence and the said list does not\nprovide any particulars of the allottees and shows old and\nnew plot numbers and as such, the allotment letters do not\ncreate any right in the suit land.\n\n It is also contended by Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior\nadvocate for the respondent that the society has filed Civil\nSuit No.941 of 2011 against the allottees and the society\nhas stated that the allottees are provisional allottees and\nnot accepted as members by the society, as they have not\npaid the land contribution and allottees are mere allottees\nand not the members of the society and they are not\nnecessary parties and if the allottees are the members of the\n\n Page 31 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nsociety, then they are not necessary parties. As the\nmembers of the society have not individual right and they\nare required to be represented through the society. If they\nare nominal members/nominal allottee than under the ATS,\nit is the obligation undertaken by the society to compensate\nthem and clear the title and sell the land to the plaintiff.\n\n \nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of \nState of U.P. Vs. C.O.D. Chheoki\nEmployees Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. and\nothers\n, reported in (1997) 3 SCC 681. Paragraph Nos.16,\n17 and 18 of the said judgements are as under:-\n\n \"16. Thus, it is settled law that no citizen has\n an fundamental right under \nArticle 19(1)(c)\n to become a\n member of a Co-operative Society. His right is governed\n by the provisions of the statute. So, the right to become\n or to continue being a member of the society is a\n statutory right. On fulfilment of the qualifications\n prescribed to become a member and for being a member\n of the society and on admission, he becomes a member.\n His being a member of the society is subject to the\n operation of the Act, rules and bye-laws applicable\n from time to time. A member of the Society has no\n independent right qua the Society and it is the society\n that is entitled to represent as the corporate aggregate.\n No individual member is entitled to assail the\n constitutionality of the provisions of the Act, rules and\n the bye-laws as he has his right under the Act, rules\n and bye-laws and is subject to its operation. The stream\n cannot rise higher than the source.\n\n 17. So, the society having been formed is governed\n by the provisions of the Act. The individual members do\n not have any fundamental right to the management of\n the Committee except in accordance with the provisions\n\n Page 32 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n of the Act, rules and bye-laws. The management of the\n Committee is regulated by \nSection 29\n of the Act. The\n composition thereof is also regulated by the Act and\n has to be in accordance with the Rules and the bye-\n laws. The Rules referred to here in before have to be in\n furtherance of and in conformity with the provisions\n contained in \nSection 130(2)(xii)\n and (xii-A) and the Rules\n providing for reservation in the election of the\n committee or for nomination to the Management\n Committee of the members belonging to the weaker\n sections and women should be to effectuate socio-\n economic and political justice assured by the Preamble,\n \nArticles 38\n and \n46\n of the Constitution.\n\n \n18. Shri Raju Ramachandran, relying upon the\n judgment of this Court in \nDamyanti Naranga vs. The\n Union of India & Ors.\n [(1971) 1 SCC 678], has contended\n that in view of the ration \nlaid down by\n this Court, the\n Government is devoid of power to make law unless any\n of the restrictions as controlled by clause (4) of \nArticle\n 19\n of the Constitution of India are infringed. The\n Government has no power to enact a law incorporating\n the reservation to the members of weaker sections and\n women thereof. We find no force in the contention. It\n could be seen that therein, the Government had enacted\n the \nSahitya Sammelan Act\n exercising the power under\n Entry 63, List I of the Seventh Schedule to the\n Constitution. This Court pointed out that the Act did\n not envisage that the Samiti is of national importance.\n Therefor, it was held that the Parliament had lacked\n power to enact the law incorporating the society and\n inducting outside members against the wishes of the\n founder members of the Society registered under the\n \nSocieties Registration Act\n. This Court also held that the\n properties belonging to the original Society stood\n vested in the Society incorporated under \nSection 4\n of\n the Act without any compensation. Therefore, it was\n violative of \nArticle 31\n of the Constitution of India, as it\n stood then. The ratio therein has no application to the\n facts in this case. He then contended that \"Other\n Backward Classes\" defined under the State Public\n Services Reservation Act applicable to and covering the\n public services, they are being inducted as members of\n the society which are otherwise not eligible and,\n therefore, the induction of them by amendment of Rules\n made on 15.7.1994 is unconstitutional. In support\n\n Page 33 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n thereof, he contends that though \nArticle 15(4)\n of the Act\n provides that it is subject to \nArticles 15(2)\n and \n29(2)\n of\n the Constitution, it does not envisage that it is also\n subject to \nArticle 19(1)(c)\n of the Constitution. Therefore,\n the reservation provided to the weaker sections is\n unconstitutional. We find no force in the contention.\n The object of \nArticle 15(4)\n is to lift the prohibition of\n general equality guaranteed in \nArticle 15(2)\n and \n29(2)\n\n of the Constitution dealing with the right to admission\n into an educational institution maintained by the State\n or receiving aid from the State. Therefore, their object\n is distinct and different from \nArticle 19(1)(c).\n Though\n \nArticle 19(1)(c)\n gives freedom to form association, it is\n controlled by the provisions of the Act. As held by this\n Court, once a society has been registered under the Act,\n the management of the society through \nSection 29\n and\n the Rules made thereunder, is regulated by duly elected\n members. In the democratic set up, all eligible persons\n are entitled to contest the election, as held, according\n to the provisions of the Act and Rules. In the absence of\n elected members belonging to the weaker sections and\n women elected, nomination of them by the Government\n is the alternative dispensation envisaged as one of the\n policies of the Act. Therefore, the Court cannot\n interfere with the policy and declare it is\n unconstitutional violating \nArticle 19(1)(c)\n of the\n Constitution.\n\n \nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has also relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of \nDaman Singh & Ors vs State Of\nPunjab & Ors.\n, reported in (1985) 2 SCC 670.\n\n7.3 Finding on the point of non-joinder of the parties :\n\n So far as the submission of the respective parties on\nthe point of non-joinder of the parties is concerned, here in\nthis case, considering the submissions of both the sides, the\nrectal in the ATS clearly provides that the allottees are to be\n\n Page 34 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nremoved from the land. Thus, it is apparent that at the time\nof ATS, allottees were in the suit land, which was in the\nknowledge of the respondent - plaintiff.\n\n It is admitted fact on record and it cannot be disputed\nthat the transfer or the enforcement of the ATS was based\nupon the conveyance of the land from the original owners to\nthe appellant plaintiff. The owners was to convey the land\nand those lands were to be handed over to the respondent.\nIt is also made out that the lands were allotted to other\npersons who are third party or non-members, however,\nwhether they are legal members of the society or not, it is a\nquestion apart but they were allottees on the land. It is also\nadmitted fact that the appellant - original defendant has\nfiled suit against the original owners of the land, which is\npending and it has not attained finality. Admittedly, the\nMOU which is to be enforced also clarifies that 75% of the\nland will be of the respondent and 25% shall belong to\nMr.Ashish Patel.\n\n In the case of Mashkoor Hasan Khan (supra), in para\n1, 2, & 3, it has been held and observed as follows:\n\n \"2. lt may be noted that the actual bidders or\n the persons in whose favour the rights have\n now been granted by the Zila Parishad were not\n implemented as parties to the suit nor in\n Parishad wean interim injunction made in the\n suit. They are not impleaded in this appeal\n either. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf\n of the Zila Parishad it has been stated that\n\n Page 35 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n written contracts had already been entered\n into by the Zila Parishad for collection of\n carcass, bones and hides etc. with third parties\n who are not parties to the suit or to this\n appeal.\n\n 3. It is thus obvious that in case any injunction\n is granted it will adversely affect the interest\n of third parties who are not present before this\n Court. In these circumstances the interim\n injunction was not in fact maintainable and it\n was not necessary for the court below to go\n into the merits of the application.\"\n\n \n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n Similarly, in the case of \nSajli Kishku\n (supra), it has\nbeen observed as under:-\n\n \"...In the absence of a necessary party the suit\n is not maintainable unless the defect is cured.\n\n 16. It is a settled principle of law that an order\n of injunction like all interim orders is passed\n only in aid of the final order that may be\n passed in the suit. But where as here the suit\n itself is not maintainable the court should\n restrain itself from passing any interim order.\"\n\n It is on record that the allottees / members whether\nthey are legal or illegal, is yet to be decided but prima facie,\nthere are allotments in the name of other persons.\n\n The owners against whom the suit is filed are also not\njoined. No doubt, it is an obligation on the society to get the\nland conveyed in favour of the society by the original owner\n\n Page 36 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nfor which the suit is also filed, but if the appellant fails to\nget the conveyance of the land from the original owners,\nrights of the respondent cease to exist. On the contrary, if\nthe owners were joined, they could have come before the\ntrial court and have cleared the obligation of the appellant -\ndefendant. There appears to be some hinch between the\nappellant and the original owners which would have given\nrise to the cause of action to file the suit against the\noriginal owners. As such the original owners unless and\nuntil they do not convey the land, there is no possibility of\nreconveyance of land to the respondent.\n\n So far as contention of the respective parties with\nrespect to non-joinder of Mr.Ashish Patel is concerned, as\nper the MOU Mr.Ashish Patel has 25% share in the land. As\nstated above, the respondents' case is that there is no\nnovation and clause 7(d) is between Mr.Ashish Patel and the\nrespondent and not the appellant and the respondent and\nhence there is no change in the ATS between the parties.\nBut as Mr.Ashish Patel has not signed individually, as share\nof Mr.Ashish Patel to the extent of 25% in the MOU, cannot\nbe conveyed to the respondent without joining Mr.Ashish\nPatel, as he is also an affected party to the suit. By virtue of\nphrase \"banne tarafwala\", Mr.Ashish Patel becomes one of\nthe parties of the said phrase. Hence, the performance of\nthe MOU, which is sought by the respondent, cannot be\ndecided without having Mr.Ashish Patel as party.\n\n Page 37 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n So far as the allotments are concerned, in 2006 itself,\nthe allottees were there to whom allotment letters have been\nissued, however, it is an admitted fact that the allotment\ndastavej to all the members are not executed. Though it is\ncontended by Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned counsel for the\nrespondent that the allottees are not the members of the\nsociety and if they are members of the society, the society\nwill take care of their rights and interest. But this fact also\ncannot be denied that a list of the allottees has been placed\non record by the society. Whether the allottees are legally or\nillegally on the land is a question which cannot be decided\nby this Court, but when the ATS says that allottees are to\nbe removed or the allotments are to be cancelled, it becomes\nan act which affects the rights of the allottees, who are on\nthe land since long and they are waiting for getting their\nallotment dastavaj. It also reveals that common amenities\nhave been provided on the land, brochure of the society is\nalso placed on record and so the allotttes who are members\nor non-members of the land, they have right in the land in\nthe common amenities and hence they have undecided\nrights in the suit land. If they are removed without any legal\naction, it will be hardship to the allottees and they cannot\nbe removed without following process of law and admittedly\n\nin that case\n the allottees have to agitate their grievance in\nthe suit.\n\n \nIn the case of Shivali (Vejalpur) Co-Op.Hosg. \nSociety\nLtd.\n (supra), in paragraph Nos. 9 & 10, it has been observed\n\n Page 38 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nand held as under :-\n\n \"9 In my opinion when a housing society\n issues the allotment letters in favour of its\n members with reference to its respective\n units/shares an interest in the same will be\n said to have been created in favour of its\n members. Even in the case of a tenant\n copartnership society or a tenant\n coownership society, where the land is\n supposed to be owned by the society and\n upon which houses are constructed by the\n society for the benefit of its members or by\n the members themselves, as the case may be\n and when allotment letter is issued in favour\n of an individual member, in such cases also,\n interest in the immovable property to be\n occupied is always created.\n\n 10. A letter of allotment is an an areement to\n sell immovable ' property as the possession\n of the property is transferred to the\n purchaser before or at the time of or\n subsequent to the execution letter of\n allotment of the society is a transfer of\n interest of the society to a third party who,\n subsequently, becomes a member. In the case\n of a housing society, the right of occupation\n and enjoyment of the plot allotted to the\n member is vested to him. Under the\n provisions of the \nGujarat Co-operative\n Societies Act\n a society and its member/s are\n independent of each other. Both are mutually\n exclusive. A society can exist even in the\n absence of its members and it can include an\n y personas its members.

Therefore\n there is no substance in the contention\n raised by the petitioners that a society and\n its members are not independent of each\n other.\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n So far as the contention raised by Mr.Mihir Joshi,\nlearned counsel for the respondent that the appellant\nsociety has filed the suit against some of the allottees in\norder to argue that the appellant does not recognize the\nrights or interest of the allottees, it is made out from the\nplaint itself that the appellant has reframed its obligation to\nexecute allotment dastavej in favour of the allottees, once\nthe remaining balance consideration is paid. Hence, the suit\nwhich is filed by the society against the allottees also reveals\nthe fact that the allottees are on the land prior to filing of\nthe present suit and the society was keen to confirm its\nobligation to execute dastavej on payment of remaining\nbalance consideration and so those allottees who are there\non the land, if removed without due process of law, it will be\nbased upon ATS and it will be hardship to the allottees and\nwho will be affected by the order of this Court and the\nallottees will not be able to use their amenities accordingly\nand so it will be affecting their rights in their absence.\n\n \nMr.Joshi, learned senior advocate has relied on the\ndecision in the case of \nGurmit Singh Bhatia\n (supra),\nwherein the vendee and the subsequent purchaser claimed\n\n Page 40 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrights on the basis of different agreements with the vendor.\nAs the agreements were different and also because the\nsubsequent purchaser was claiming independent title\nadverse to the vendor, the subsequent purchaser was not\nimplemented at the risk of the vendee, hence the facts of the\ncase cited by the learned senior advocate for the respondent\nare different, whereas in this case, the rights of the\nrespondent depends on the agreement that the appellant\nhas with the original owners and as stated above, if the\nappellant's suit against the original owners fails, the alleged\nright of the respondent will also ceased to exist and \nin that\ncase\n also the owners becomes necessary party and as\nmentioned above, if they are brought as owners on record, it\nwould have been convenient for the respondent to get\nconveyance in their favour through the appellant.\n\n \nIn the case of \nC.O.D. Chheoki Employees'\nCooperative Socieety Limited and others\n (supra), and in\nthe case of \nDaman Singh\n (supra) it is laid down that the\nmembers of the society do not have any independent right\nin the co-operative society or the appointment of the\nchairman was being challenged and the Hon'ble Apex Court\nobserved that the members cannot challenge the Act or bye-\nlaws or the rules by which they exist and they do not have\nany independent rights in the society.\n \nParagraph 11 of\nDaman Singh\n (Supra) states that members under the\nrelevant \nCo-operative Societies Act\n in the case, are also\n\n Page 41 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ngiven the chance to be heard if they wish to be heard,\nindicating that persons do not lose their individuality after\nbecoming a member.\n\n8.1. Finding on readiness and willingness\n u/s 16\n of the\nSpecific Relief Act:\n\n So far as the contentions of both the parties with\nrespect to the readiness and willingness\n u/s 16\n of the\nSpecific Relief Act is concerned, it is the issue wherein the\nplaintiff and the respondent has to discharge their duties to\nprove readiness and willingness to perform their part of the\ncontract by adducing cogent and convincing evidence\nbefore the learned trial court and resultantly, if the plaintiff\nis unable to prove readiness and willingness on his part,\nthere will be no order of specific performance of contract in\nfavour of the plaintiff. As such the contents of \nsection 16(1)\n\n(c) pertains to the specific performance. Readiness and\nwillingness is a question of facts and hence, the said\nquestion is kept open to be decided by the learned trial\ncourt and this Court has not dealt with the same.\n\n9. UNAMENDED SECTIONS 13 AND 14 OF THE\nSPECIFIC RELIEF ACT :\n\n9.1 Submission of the appellant on \nSecs.13\n and \n14\n of\nSpecific Relief Act:\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\n\n Page 42 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nappellant, on the point of unamended \nsections 13\n and \n14\n of\nthe Specific Relief Act has submitted that the specific\nperformance of the ATS is not possible under \nsections 13\n\nand \n14\n of the Specific Relief Act.\n\n It is submitted that there are three parties in this case\nhaving their rights and interest in the suit land, namely,\nthe original owners, Mr.Ashish Patel and allottees /\nmembers of the society. It is submitted that as per \nsection\n13(1)(b)\n of the Specific Relief Act neither of the three parties\nare \"bound to concur\" or \"bound to convey\" at the request of\nthe appellant society and therefore ATS cannot be\nperformed under \nsection 13\n of the Specific Relief Act.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant has further submitted that where compensation is\nadequate relief, specific performance of the contract is not\nenforceable and that under \nsection 41(h)\n of the Specific\nRelief Act, an injunction cannot be granted when\nequally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by\nany other usual mode of proceedings.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant has further submitted that the respondent has\nadmitted in the plaint itself that the respondent is having\nbusiness of selling, purchasing and developing the land\nrelated activities. It is also admitted in the plaint that even\nin the past, the respondent had purchased the property\nfrom Mr.Ashish Patel. Furthermore, in the suit itself, the\nrespondent has prayed that the sale deed of the suit land\n\n Page 43 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nmay be executed in favour of any one proposed by the\nrespondent, which indicates that the respondent is satisfied\nwith compensation and is not concerned with the suit land\nfor his own use.\n\n Clause 7(d) also states that the suit land is to be\njointly sold by the appellant and the respondent to third\nparty. As such the agreement by way of MOU is an\nagreement for developing the land and selling it to the third\nparty and therefore, injunction cannot be granted for such\nan agreement in such a situation. If the suit land will have\nto be \"merchandise\" or \"stock-in-trade\" of the respondent, in\nwhich case, presumption will not be available to the\nrespondent and in such a case, the respondent can be\ncompensated in terms of money, as the respondent is\nconcerned with profit after selling the land. It is apparent,\nthat the compensation in form of money would suffice. The\nrespondent is concerned with profit and therefore,\npresumption is also not applicable to the facts of the\npresent case and injunction ought not to have been granted.\n\n Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of Hari Krishna Agarwala Vs. k.c.

Rights of purchaser or lessee against\n person with no title or imperfect title.--(1)\n Where a person contracts to sell or let certain\n immovable property having no title or only an\n imperfect title, the purchaser or lessee (subject\n to the other provisions of this Chapter), has\n the following rights namely:-\n\n (a) xxx xxx xxx\n\n Page 48 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n (b) where the concurrence of other persons is\n necessary for validating the title, and they are\n bound to concur at the request of the vendor or\n lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel\n him to procure such concurrence, and when a\n conveyance by other persons is necessary to\n validate the title and they are bound to convey\n at the request of the vendor or lessor, the\n purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure\n such conveyance;\"\n\n It is submitted that in view of the above, specific\nperformance of the ATS is not possible.\n\n9.2 Submission of the respondent on unamended\n\nsections 13\n and \n14\n of the Specific Relief Act :\n\n Per contra, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for\nthe respondent, on the point of unamended sections of\n\nsections 13\n and \n14\n of the Specific Relief Act, has contended\nthat no individual concurrence of the allottees is required\nover and above the concurrence of Mr.Ashish Patel is also\nnot required because he has 25% share in the land, only\nafter the society as well as land to the respondent and right\nof Mr.Ashish Patel flows from the respondent and not from\nthe society. It is also submitted that the owners are bound\nto sell the land to the society and concur and as per the\nATS, owners are bound to concur on demand of the society\nas the society has paid the entire sale consideration. It is\nsubmitted that the society who has filed the suit against the\nallottees have prayed for injunction regarding non-transfer\n\n Page 49 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nof the suit land in favour of third party. As such there is no\nrequirement for the allottees also to validate the title.\n\n Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent, on the point of \nsection 14(1)(a)\n, has submitted\nthat \nsection 14(1)(a)\n applies to general contract like contract\nfor movable properties and so far as immovable properties\nare concerned, \nsection 10\n specifically provides that unless\nand until contradictory is proved, general presumption that\nbreach of contract of transfer of immovable property cannot\nbe adequately relief by compensation and this presumption\ncan be rebutted only if contrary is proved in the trial, decree\nof possession of exception to the general rule and here in\nthis case, as the dispute is with respect to immovable\nproperty and therefore, such a contention is not there. It is\nalso submitted that the party coming to the Court for\nspecific performance of the contract of sale of immovable\nproperty need not prove anything unless the otherside is\nremoved the presumption. After evidence is led to remove\nthe presumption, the plaintiff is still in a position to prove\nby other evidence in case that payment that payment of\nmoney does nto compensate him adequately. It is also\nsubmitted that \nsection 14(1)(d)\n is not applicable to the facts\nof the case and does not run into minute details and does\nnot involve personal qualification or volition of the parties.\nSimilarly, it does not involve continuous duties which Court\ncannot supervise. The transaction is simple in nature for\nwhich \nsection 14(1)(d)\n is not applicable and is raised only to\n\n Page 50 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\navoid the obligation.\n\n \nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has placed reliance on the decision of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nM.L. Devender Singh\nand others vs. Syed Khaja\n, reported in (1973) 2 SCC 515,\nwherein in para 21 it has been observed and held as\nunder :-\n\n \"21. The second assumption underlying\n the contentions on behalf of the\n Defendants-appellants is that, once the\n presumption, contained in explanation to\n \nSection 12\n of the old Act, is removed, the,\n bar contained in \nSection 21\n of the old Act,\n against the specific enforcement of a\n contract for which compensation in money\n is an adequate relief, automatically\n operates, over-looks that the condition for\n the imposition of the bar is actual proof\n that compensation in money is adequate on\n the facts and circumstances of a particular\n case before the Court. The effect of the\n presumption is that the party coming to\n Court for the specific performance of a\n contract for sale of unmovable property\n need not prove anything until the other\n side has removed the presumption. After\n evidence is led to remove the presumption,\n the plaintiff may still be in a position to\n prove, by other evidence in the case, that\n payment of money does not compensate\n him adequately.\"\n\n9.3. Finding on the aspect of unamended \nsections 13\n\n Page 51 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nand 14 of the \nSpecific Relief Act\n :\n\n Hearing both the sides on the point of concurrence and\nconveyance under \nsection 13\n of the Specific Relief Act, it is\nnot only the person who can transfer his right / title is\nrelevant but also the person who can validate the title is\nalso important. Admittedly, the allottees / members who are\non the land have their valuable rights in the suit land\nincluding the ownership over the plot and undivided share\nin the basic amenities and services of the society, their\nconcurrence is required to validate the title to passed on to\nthe respondent. The allottees / members who are on the\nsuit land are not bound to concur at the request of the\nappellant and hence \nsection 13(1)(b)\n comes into picture\nunless and until the allottees / members themselves come\nforward to validate the title, ATS cannot be enforced and as\nstated above, without due procedure of law, the allottees /\nmembers cannot be removed from the land. Regarding\nconcurrence of Mr.Ashish Patel is concerned, as per MOU\nwhich is subsequent even taken place after execution of the\nATS, Mr.Ashish Patel has become owner of the suit land to\nthe extent of 25% and in the opinion of this Court,\nconcurrence is required of Mr.Ashish Patel to validate the\nappellant's title to be passed to the respondent and it\ncannot be denied that Mr.Ashish Patel also is not bound to\nconcur at the request of the appellant.\n\n Moreover, so far as 25% and 75% share, as per MOU is\nconcerned, which part of the land is of the respondent and\n\n Page 52 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwhich part is of MOU is also not clarified. The concurrence\nto that effect for demarcation of the land is also required\nand here also \nsections 13\n and \n14\n comes into picture.\n\n As per submission of Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant, it is open for the appellant to get\nconcurrence and in that manner indirectly it is a statement\nregarding appellant's right to sue against all the person\nfrom whom concurrence is required.\n\n If the respondent is having ATS which is to be enforced\nwhether the Court can issue the decree compelling the\nappellant to obtain concurrence from the persons who are\nbound to concur as per the say of the respondent?. and if\nthat is so, the appellant will have to initiate litigation\nagainst the original owners which is subject to their\npersonal volition of the appellant. In that sense, \nsection\n14(d)\n of the Specific Relief Act comes into picture, where the\nCourt is to issue a decree compelling the appellant to\npursue litigation, it would involve numerous details and\nperformance of the continuous which court cannot\nsupervise continuously. Assuch, it will be a chaos on record\ncompelling the appellant to get enforcement of the ATS of\nthe respondent by suing the owners, allottees and original\nowners of the land which again cannot be specific\nenforcement under \nsection 14(1)(d)\n.\n\n Considering the submissions of both the sides and as\nstated above, three parties in total are affected in this case,\n\n Page 53 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nnamely original owners, Mr.Ashish Patel and the allottees\nand as per \nsection 13(1)(b)\n, as mentioned, bound to\nconcurrence cannot be said to be a ground for right to sue\nagainst all the persons and create litigations and also as\nstated above, it will cast obligation where the Court will not\nbe able to issue decree which will compel the appellant to\nobtain concurrence without legal procedure of law and if\nthat is so, the court issue decree compelling the appellant to\npursue litigation it will involve numerous details and\npurpose of a continuous duty, which will have to be\nsupervised and which can be said to be against \nsection 14\n\nof the Specific Relief Act, as the Court will have to supervise\non one side conveyance of the deed from the allottees to the\nappellant, owners' conveyance towards the appellant and\nthereafter all the lands if is vested in the appellant it shall\nbe conveyed to the respondent. As such \nsection 14\n also, as\nstated above has a role to play.\n\n10. CAN COMPENSATION BE AN ADQUATE REMEDY:\n\n So far as the submission regarding compensation\nbeing adequate remedy is concerned, the respondent\nhimself has admitted in the plaint that the respondent is in\nthe business of purchasing, selling and developing the land.\nThe MOU which is produced on record, clause 7(d) also\nstates that the land is to develop jointly by Mr.Ashish Patel\nand the respondent and so MOU becomes impliedly a joint\ndevelopment agreement between the parties. It has come on\n\n Page 54 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrecord that the respondent has not asked the land for his\nown use but he is asking the land exclusively for selling\nahead, which cannot be denied. It is a business of\npurchasing, selling and developing of the land of the\nrespondent.\n\n This court is in complete agreement with the\nproposition of law that under \nsection 10\n of the Specific\nRelief Act which shows that unless and until contrary is\nproved, Court shall presume that the breach of a contract to\ntransfer immovable property cannot be adequate relief by\ncompensation in money. Here in this case, when the\nrespondent has admitted that they are dealing in\npurchasing, selling and developing the land activities and\nwhen they do not require the land for their own, but it is\nonly for the merchandise, this admission itself need not to\nbe proved. In these circumstances, if specific performance is\ndenied, apparently the respondent is entitled for\ncompensation which can be calculated in terms of money.\nThe admission of the respondent itself shows that the\nrespondent is only concerned with the profit after selling\nthe land and when the respondent is not using the land for\nhis own purpose and will be selling and developing the land\nfor profit, presumption cannot be made applicable.\n\n \nSo far as the decision in the case of \nSyed Khaja\n\n(supra) is concerned\n, \nin that case\n the defendant relied on a\nclause in the contract providing for liquidated damages in\ncase of breach for presumption. Here in this case,\n\n Page 55 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\npresumption shall not apply on account of admission of the\nrespondent. In the present proceedings regarding their\nbusiness of purchasing, selling and developing the land\nactivities and their intention is on record to sell and develop\nthe suit land and that also for profit.\n\n Now a days it cannot be ruled out that in such\nproceedings, when the land is agreed to be sold and\nagreement is executed but is never concurred to be enforced\nupon and thereafter, due to some dispute between the\nparties, litigation takes place, the main dispute is hike in\nthe price of the land.\n\n The respondent has invested money and the return of\nmoney is sufficient which cannot be termed to be their\nprofit. This court do agree with the submission of\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant that\ncompensation can be adequately given to the respondent.\n\n \nBased upon the case of \nDave Ramshankar\n (supra),\nwhen the facts indicated that the plaintiff No.1 did not\nrequire suit land for her own use and she only wanted to\nreconvey the property, compensation of money is adequate\nrelief. In such a case, contract cannot be specifically\nenforced.\n\n10. PRINCIPLES OF GRANT OF INJUNCTION :\n\n So far as the principles of grant of injunction is\nconcerned, it is submitted by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant that the impugned order is\n\n Page 56 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nagainst the settled principles for grant of injunction. It is\nsubmitted that in case the impugned order is not vacated,\nthe appellant will face criminal and civil proceedings filed by\nthe allottees / members of the appellant society, who have\nbeen allotted plots way back in the year 1996, as many\nallotment dastavej are yet to be executed in favour of the\nallottees and therefore, irreparable loss or injury will be\ncaused to the appellant rather than the respondent. It is\nalso submitted that the allottees / members of the society\nhave also initiated proceedings against the appellants and\neven the respondent has also initiated proceedings, which\nultimately resulted into the cancellaton of the sale deed for\nsurvey nos.227 and 228. It is also submitted that the\nrespondent never agitated and neither sought to agitate the\ninjunction application for 9 years and therefore, the\nrespondent cannot contend now that irreparable injury will\ncause to it and for that balance of convenience lies in\nfavourof the respondent. It is the case of the respondent\nthat application under \nOrder 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure\n was pending and hence there is no delay on the\npart of the respondent. However, it cannot be denied that\nthe respondent was aware that the suit land was being\nallotted to the allottees and subsequent allotment dastavej\nwere being executed, which reveals from the list which has\nbeen produced on record by the appellant and the\nrespondent never requested the court to agitate the\ninjunction application. The conduct of the respondent\n\n Page 57 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nshows that the respondent was never interested in\ninjunction but the respondent was interested with sharing\nprofit only.\n\n It is also submitted by Mr.Soparkar that in the year\n2021-2022, as per the say of the respondent, as the original\nowners of some of the suit land, began executing sale deeds\nin favour of the appellant, the respondent did not seek any\norder for injunction since 2013. However, it was in the\nknowledge of the respondent that survey nos.227 and 228\nwere in the ownership of the appellant but no urgency was\nshown for those 2 survey numbers. Even as on today, the\nrespondent has sought injunction of 100% land though the\nrespondent is not in possession and ownership of 100%\nland. So, the conduct of the respondent is of a nature which\nshows that there is no irreparable injury to the respondent\nfor 9 years and hence there was also not balance of\nconvenience lies in favour of the respondent and as\nsubmitted earlier, when the respondent is having business\nof purchasing, selling and developing the land, they are\nconcerned with the profit and hence no irreparable injury\ncan be caused to them and they can be compensated\nadequately, if the injunction is vacated.\n\n \nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of \nMandali Ranganna and others vs. T.\nRamachandra and others\n, reported in (\n2008) 11 SCC 1\nand Kishorsinh Ratansinh Jadeja vs. Maruti Corpn\n.\n\n Page 58 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n(2009) 11 SCC 229, wherein the principles of considering\nthe conduct of the parties while exercising its discretionary\njurisdiction is discussed.\n\n11.2. Submission of the respondent on the principle\nof grant of injunction :\n\n Per contra, Mr.Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has submitted that the suit was filed in the year\n2013. It is the case of the respondent that the application\nunder \nOrder 7 Rule 11 of the CPC\n was pending and it was\nto be heard before the injunction application and\nsubsequently the suit was also transferred from the court of\nAhmedabad to the Court of Sanand. From 2013 to 2020, the\nsociety had no other land and the defendant society got 8\nsurvey numbers in the year 2020, 2021 and 2022 and at\nthis stage, the plaintiff immediately moved an application\nfor hearing of the injunction application and thereafter\nthesuit was dismissed under \nOrder 7 Rule 11 of the CPC\n,\nwhich was challenged by the respondent before this Court\nby way of First Appeal No.2320 of 2022 and thereafter the\napplication was heard and decided and thus, as such, there\nis no delay on the part of the plaintiff.\n\n Mr.Joshi, learned advocate for the respondent, on the\npoint of balance of convenience and irreparable injury, has\nsubmitted that there are no allottees / members in the suit\nland and it was the obligation of the society to compensate\nthem and remove them and the society cannot be permitted\n\n Page 59 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nto avoid obligation which is accepted. It is also submitted\nthat the society has not executed convenience in favour of\nthe allottees from 1996 to 2022 for their plots. The allottees\nhave also not preferred any civil or criminal proceedings\nfrom the year 1996 to 2022, which shows that there are no\nallotteees in the society and so the balance of convenience\nand irreparable injury are also in favour of the appellant.\n\n Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has relied on the case of Maharwal Khewaji\nTrust (regd) vs. Baldev Dass, reported in (2004) 8 SCC\n\n488. Para 10 of \nthe said decision\n is reproduced as under :-\n\n \"10. Be that as it may, Mr. Sachhar is right\n in contending that unless and untill a case of\n irreparable loss or damage is made out by a\n party to the suit, the court should not permit\n the nature of the property being changed which\n also includes alienation or transfer of the\n property which may lead to loss or damage\n being caused to the party who may ultimately\n succeed and may further lead to multiplicity of\n proceedings. In the instant case no such case of\n irreparable loss is made out except contending\n that the legal proceedings are likely to take a\n long time, therefore, the respondent should be\n permitted to put the scheduled property to\n better use. We do not think in the facts and\n circumstances of this case, the lower appellate\n court and the High Court were justified in\n permitting the respondent to change the nature\n of property by putting up construction as also\n by permitting the alienation of the property,\n whatever may be the condition on which the\n same is done. In the event of the appellant's\n\n Page 60 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n claim being found baseless ultimately, it is\n always open to the respondent to claim\n damages or, in an appropriate case, the court\n may itself award damages for the loss suffered,\n if any, in this regard. Since the facts of this\n case do not make out any extraordinary ground\n for permitting the respondent to put up\n construction and alienate the same, we think\n both the courts below, namely, the lower\n appellate court and the High Court erred in\n making the impugned orders. The said orders\n are set aside and the order of the trial court is\n restored.\"\n\n11.3. Finding on the principle of grant of\ninjunction, prima facie case, balance of convenience and\nirreparable loss and conduct of the respondent :\n\n Upon hearing the submissions of both the sides on\nprinciple of grant of injunction, prima facie case, balance of\nconvenience and irreparable loss and conduct of the\nrespondent, here in this case, it cannot be disputed that\nthe allottes were allotted plots from the year 1996, whether\nthey are legally members of the society or illegally, is a\nquestion which cannot be decided at this stage, however, it\ncannot be denied that the government record i.e. report of\nthe society conveys that if the submission of the respondent\nis that there were 24 members of the society and four on the\nsuit land, then also, the allottees are there, who are\nmembers. Moreover, as per the say of the appellant, till the\nsuit was filed, 69 registered dastavej have been executed in\n\n Page 61 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nfavour of the appellant, out of 69 allottees, 54 allotment\ndastavejs are of the suit land and after the suit was filed till\n2022, 51 allotment dastavej have been executed, out of\nwhich 35 pertains to the suit land. It is also submitted that\non the suit land bungalows have been constructed and\nmany bungalows are under construction and even a temple\nis also under construction in survey no.218. No doubt, the\nfacts which are narrated in the submissions by the learned\nadvocate for the appellant but no documents are placed on\nrecord by way of evidence and the same can be proved by\nthe appellant in the trial, but baseline cannot be denied\nthat the allottees were there on the land. It can also not be\ndenied that they have been given rights of using common\namenities and other parcels of land. Even for the sake of\narguments, if it is believed that only 24 members were there\nin the society as per the record and only 4 are there in the\nsuit land, but it cannot be denied that the land surrounding\nthe suit land are parcel of the entire suit land and the\nmembers who ever may be in the suit land or other land are\nentitled for the enjoyment of the amenities which cannot be\ndenied. It also cannot be denied that the third party rights\nexists on the suit land, as recorded by the learned trial\ncourt in the impugned order. It is also concluded in the\nimpugned order that the interest of third parties have been\ncreated in the suit land. It is also observed by the learned\ntrial court in the impugned order that the appellant has\nnot acted bonafide with the plaintiff and the allottees of the\n\n Page 62 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nland. If that is so, then it becomes clear that there are\nallottees on the land and the injunction will create a\nsituation wherein the appellant will have to face civil and\ncriminal litigation from the allottees. As such the\ncontentions raised by the learned advocate for the appellant\nthat here is construction on the land by the allottees and as\nper the submission of he learned advocate for the\nrespondent that there are 24 members in the land and 4\nmembers are there in the suit land, then also if any action\nis taken against the legal allottees, it will be a situation for\nthe appellant for facing civil and criminal litigation from the\nallottees which cannot be denied, as it is an admitted fact\nthat in the year 2010 some of the original allottees had\ninitiated legal proceedings against the appellant and the\nrespondent for survey nos.227 and 228 and thereafter,\npartners of the respondent firm in whose favour the land\nwas transferred, decided to cancel sale deed for survey\nnos.227 and 228, considering this aspect also though the\nconveyance for survey nos.227 and 228 were executed in\nfavour of the respondent when the respondent was\ncompelled to cancel those sale deeds at the instance of the\nallottees, it had become a case for agitating dispute by way\nof suit by the respondent. It is also not in dispute that one\nof the partners of the respondent firm signed as a witness in\nallotment dastavaj for plot Nos.15 and 17 which were part\nof extended Radhe Acres Scheme and in the list, serial\nnumber was mentioned which included the suit land and\n\n Page 63 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nallotment dastavej also stated that allottee members owned\ncommon rights and amenities provided by the appellant\nwhich has stated in the suit land.\n\n Over and above, it is required to be noted that in First\nAppeal No.2320 of 2022 vide order dated 6/10/2022, the\nDivision Bench of this Court while allowing the appeal of the\nrespondent and reviving the suit, has observed that so far\nas Annexure-B (from page 134 to 141) is concerned,\nthose are the original allottees. Any transfer in the\ninterregnum by them shall be counted separately. As\nthere is serious dispute in relation to the list 142 to\n\n145. It is volunteered by the learned advocate on\ninstruction that the respondent shall not deal with the\nsaid list for the purpose of transfer of otherwise. It\nbecomes clear that the Division Bench of this Court has\nalso recognized that there are original allottees of the suit\nland who have rights. An arrangement was also proposed\nallowing the appellant to transfer the suit land by\nmaintaining the accounts. Even the Division Bench has\nalso taken into considered the position of allottees and their\nallotments. As such, if the status-quo is continued, it\nwould result into multiplicity of litigation and which will\nresult into irreparable injury to the appellant rather than\nthe respondent in whose knowledge, the fact of allotment\nwas there and who has remained silent.\n\n Considering overall facts of the case which has not\n\n Page 64 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nbeen considered by the learned trial court, it appears that if\nthe injunction is continued, the allottees have paid their\nconsideration towards their land and allotment dastavej is\nalready executed, which becomes a irreversible situation for\nthe appellant for cancelling the allotments by compensating\nthe rights and taking back the possession without any due\nprocess of law. At the same time, the appellant will have to\nface litigation to that effect against one person i.e.\nrespondent. So considering the balance of convenience and\nirreparable injury, this Court is of the opinion that it\ncoveys more in favour of the appellant rather than\nrespondent, who has a business of selling, purchasing and\ndeveloping the land and has pursue the litigation for profit\nand who can be adequately compensated in terms of\nmoney. At the same time, conduct of the respondent stated\nhereinabove, also tilts the balance of convenience and\nirreparable injury in favour of the appellant who in the\nknowledge of the respondent at the time of executing ATS\nhad allotted some plots to the allottees and it cannot be\ndenied that during the pendency of the suit and till hearing\nof the application, plots were not allotted and till then for 9\nyears when the respondent has remained silent in agitating\nthe injunction application, it appears from the conduct of\nthe respondent that the respondent was concerned about\nagitating the litigation wherein even as per his own say, has\ninvested around Rs.11,49,00,000/-, however, the\nrespondent waited patiently for 9 years and as submitted by\n\n Page 65 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthe learned advocate for the appellant, there are\nconstructions which are carried out in the suit land during\nthese years, which is though not on the record, but cannot\nbe disbelieved as there is already a list of allottees on record\nand so after flowing of much water, if the injunction is\ngranted, it will affect the rights of those persons and it\nwould cause irreparable injury to the appellant and the\nappellant will have to face a lot of hardship. At the same\ntime, balance of convenience is also in favour of the\nappellant rather than the respondent.\n\n \nAs held in the case of \nMandali Ranganna\n (supra),\nCourt must also take into consideration the conduct of the\nparties while exercising its discretionary jurisdiction while\nconsidering an application for grant of injunction, the court\nwill not only take into consideration the basic elements in\nrelation thereto viz. existence of a prima facie case, balance\nof convenience and irreparable injury. In \nthe said decision\n,\nit is also further held that grant of injunction is an equitable\nrelief and a person who had kept quite for a long time and\nallowed another to deal with the properties exclusively,\nordinarily would not be entitled to an order of injunction.\n\n \nRelevant paragraph Nos.21, 22 and 26 of the decision\nin the case of \nMandali Ranganna\n (supra) reads thus:\n\n \"21. While considering an application for grant\n of injunction, the court will not only take into\n\n Page 66 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n consideration the basic elements in relation\n thereto, viz., existence of a prima facie case,\n balance of convenience and irreparable injury,\n it must also take into consideration the\n conduct of the parties.\n\n 22. Grant of injunction is an equitable relief.\n A person who had kept quiet for a long time\n and allowed another to deal with the\n properties exclusively, ordinarily would not be\n entitled to an order of injunction. The court\n will not interfere only because the property is a\n very valuable one.....\n\n 26. Rightly or wrongly constructions have\n come up. They cannot be directed to be\n demolished at least at this stage. Respondent\n 7 is said to have spent three crores of rupees.\n If that be so, in our opinion, it would not be\n proper to stop further construction.\"\n\n \nIn the case of \nRamji v. Rao Kishoresingh\n, reported in\n1929 SCC OnLine PC 40, the Hon'ble Court has observed\nand held as follows:\n\n \"It is necessary to refer to two other\n findings of the learned District Judge -\n\n namely : (1) that damages would have been an\n adequate relief to the plaintiff, and (2) that\n such damages should be Rs.20,000.\n\n In dealing with this question, learned\n judge said as follows:\n\n \"No special damages have been proved\n by the plaintiff. He simply invested money and\n a return of money should normally be\n\n Page 67 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n sufficient. It is not shown that he had any\n pressing need for land. On the contrary, from\n the very nature of the contract, it is evident\n that there was no hurry at all, and that not\n only might plaintiff fail to get the land but in\n any case, he could not expect to get it for\n several years. Indeed, the only reason for\n insisting upon specific performance is that the\n value of the village now is probably more than\n the money advanced plus reasonable interest.\n Plaintiff can certainly say that he took a risk\n and that he should be compensated for such\n risk. But compensation could be given in\n money. This ground of appeal must fail.\"\n\n In the case of Maharwal Khewaji Trust (regd.)\n(supra), relied upon by the learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent, it is held that unless and until a case of\nirreparable loss or damage is made out by a party to the\nsuit, court should not permit a change of the said status-\nquo which may lead to loss or damage, if caused to the\nparty who may ultimately succeed and may further lead to\nmultiplicity of proceedings. In any event, it is open to the\neither party to claim damages if ultimately the case of the\nother party is found baseless and Court may award\ndamages for the loss suffered, if any.\n\n Considering the aforesaid observations, when a case\nof irreparable injury is made out, status-quo can be\neffected, is the principle laid down. In the present case,\n\n Page 68 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwhen the respondent is agitating the suit or the injunction\napplication for 9 years, irreparable injury or balance of\nconvenience does not lie in favour of the respondent when\nthere are alienation and allotment in the land prior to filing\nof the suit and after filing of the suit which will affect the\nrights of the allottees as well as will encourage multiplicity\nof litigation against the appellant by the allottees. So far as\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable\nloss are concerned, in the opinion of this Court, it tilts in\nfavour of the appellant rather than the respondent.\n\n \nConsidering the basic principle of law as \nlaid down in\n\nthe case of \nWander Ltd. And another vs. Antox India P.\nLtd.\n, reported in (1990) Suppl. SCC 727, more particularly\npara 14, as relied upon by Mr.Mihir Joshi, the learned\nadvocate for the respondent, appellate court would\nnormally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of\ndiscretion under appeal solely on the ground that it had\nconsidered the matter at the trial stage, it would have come\nto a contrary conclusion, if the discretion has been\nexercised by the trial court in a reasonable and in a judicial\nmanner, the fact that appellate court would have taken a\ndifferent view may not justify the interference. This court is\nin complete agreement with this principle of law. But it is\nopen for every court to interfere with the impugned order if\nthe findings are found to be non-judicial or perverse, which\ncannot be denied. Here in this case, considering the\n\n Page 69 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nimpugned order, the learned trial court has not considered\nthe facts of the dispute between the parties and therefore,\nthis court has re-examined the facts of the case. The\nlearned trial court has not considered the fact that the\ninjunction ought to have granted when all the three criteria\nare found in favour of the plaintiff namely prima facie case,\nbalance of convenience and irreparable loss, which cannot\nbe compensated in terms of money. At the same time, the\nlearned trial court ought to have come to the conclusion\nthat granting injunction based on the principle that equity\nhelps the person who does equity. Here in this case, the\nlearned trial court has failed to take into consideration the\nfact that even the ATS is there and there was no need for\nMOU to be executed. The fact that the ATS was executed in\nthe year 2006 and though conditions mentioned in the ATS\nand MOU were not fulfilled, how the cause of action arose in\nthe year 2013. The learned trial court also failed to\nconsidered the conduct of the respondent though written\nsubmissions were submitted. The finding that after filing of\nthe suit new allotments have been given, no evidence to that\neffect was brought on record by the respondent and if there\nwas finding that there exists right of third parties in the\nsuit land, the court should have vigilant enough to opine\nclearly upon the balance of convenience and irreparable loss\nwhen there are allottees or third parties rights are existing\nin the suit land, they will be affected by the order of\ninjunction which in enjoying their properties along with\n\n Page 70 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ncommon amenities. At the same time, it cannot be ruled\nout that if the injunction is operated, it will cause hardship\nto the appellant herein and the appellant will face hardship\nand litigation from the allottees and the same would result\ninto multiplicity of proceedings. The trial court erred that\nthe respondent - plaintiff has prima facie case on the basis\nof ATS only and as the appellant has sought injunction\nagainst the allottees / members in the suit filed by the\nappellants against the allottees and the respondent is\nseeking injunction, court has not taken into consideration\nthe fact that the appellant has reaffirmed the obligation\ntowards the allottees members and when the allottees /\nmembers pay balance of consideration to the appellant,\nallotment dastavej will be executed in their favour and\nrestrain order would cause hardship to the appellant herein\nin not conveying the allotment dastavej, it will result into\nmultiplicity of proceedings to be faced by the appellant\nherein and same would hardship to the appellant herein.\nEven for the sake of argument, if the prima facie\nobservations of the learned trial court is believed that the\nrespondent is having a prima facie case, but the trial court\nhas erred in erroneous observation regarding the\nrespondent having irreparable loss and balance of\nconvenience in favour of the respondent. Based upon the\nfindings in the impugned order, the learned trial court has\ngranted injunction over the entire suit land wherein MOU\nwhich is to be enforced as a recital to the fact that 75% of\n\n Page 71 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthe land will be of the respondent and 25% would be of\nMr.Ashish Patel. It is also on record that the legal\nproceedings initiated against the appellant wherein deeds\nfor survey nos.227 and 228 were executed and the trial\ncourt's own finding that there exists rights of the members,\nthe finding that no irreparable injury to the appellant and\nbalance of convenience is not in favour of the appellant\nherein, is erroneous.\n\n In the entirety, this Court is of the opinion that the\nentire facts of the case reveals that it becomes an\nirreversible situation for the appellant to reverse and to\ncancel the allotment of the members by compensating the\nrights and take back possession of the plots. In fact, it will\nbe a irreparable injury to the members / allottees and rights\nwhich are not being brought on record by the respondent,\nwho admitted them to be brought on record in the rejoinder\nand this fact also cannot be denied that the allottees are\nmore in number and who are bonafide purchasers of the\nland, rightly or wrongly which is yet to be decided and they\nwill initiate litigation against the appellant herein and the\nappellant will face hardship. Whereas, on the other hand,\nthe respondents, who are concerned with their business of\npurchasing, selling and developing the land activities, can\nbe adequately compensated in terms of money. As such, all\nthe three principles of injunction are not proved. In entirety\nprima facie case does not help the plaintiff to get the order\nof injunction but at the same time, the plaintiff should also\n\n Page 72 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nshow balance of convenience and irreparable loss is in his\nfavour and unless and until all the three ingredients\nnamely prima facie case, balance of convenience and\nirreparable loss, are tilted in favour of the plaintiff, the\nCourt should be slow in granting injunction. Here also,\nprima facie case of the plaintiff depends upon the agreement\nto sell and MOU and both the documents are contradictory\nand are disputed. At the same time, as stated hereinabove,\nbalance of convenience and irreparable loss is in favour of\nthe defendant rather than the plaintiff. Under the\ncircumstances, the impugned order is not just, legal and the\nfindings are not on the basis of the facts and evidence on\nrecord and hence the impugned order cannot sustain in the\neye of law.\n\n12. In the result, present Appeal From Order is allowed.\nThe impugned injunction order passed by the learned\nPrincipal Senior Civil Judge, Sanand below Ex.5 in Special\nCivil Suit No.407 of 2017 (Old Special Civil Suit No.272 of\n2013) dated 30/11/2022 is hereby quashed and set aside.\n\n Considering the nature of the dispute between the\nparties, the learned trial court is hereby directed to expedite\nthe hearing of the suit and decide and dispose of the suit, in\naccordance with law, subject to result of the SLP(C) No.\n20976 of 2022, pending before Hon'ble the Apex Court,\nwithin a period of four months from the date of receipt of\nthis order.\n\n Page 73 of 74\n\n Downloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\n C/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n Parties are directed to co-operate the learned trial\ncourt in early disposal of the suit, as aforesaid\nNo costs.\n\n In view of disposal of the main Appeal From Order,\nCivil Application No.1 of 2022 and Civil Application No.1 of\n2023, do not survive and they stand disposed of\naccordingly.\n\n In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall\nbe no order as to costs.\n\n Sd/-\n\n (RAJENDRA M. SAREEN,J)\n\n After pronouncement of the judgement and order, the\nMr.Jigar Raval, learned advocate for the respondent submits\nthat so as to approach the learned Apex Court, the execution,\noperation and implementation of the present judgement and\norder may be stayed for a period of eight weeks.\n\n Mr.Raju, learned advocate appearing for the appellant\nobjected the request of stay of the order made by the learned\nadvocate for the respondent. He has submitted that the\nappellant has faced a great hardship and inconvenience till today\nand if the order is stayed, the appellant will face more hardship.\n\n Here in this case, right from the order passed below Exh.5,\nthe status quo is directed to be maintained by the trial court\nwhich is continued till today. Therefore, to enable the respondent\nto challenge the present judgement and order before the Hon'ble\nApex Court, the execution, operation and implementation of the\nabove impugned judgement and order pronounced today is\nhereby stayed for a period of six weeks from today.\n\n Sd/-\n\n (RAJENDRA M.

At the outset, it is required to be noted that the\n original plaintiffs filed the suit against the original\n owner - vendor - original defendant no.1 for specific\n performance of the agreement to sell with respect to\n suit property dated 3.5.2005. It is an admitted position\n that so far as agreement to sell dated 3.5.2005 of\n which the specific performance is sought, the appellant\n is not a party to the said agreement to sell. It appears\n that during the pendency of the aforesaid suit and\n though there was an injunction against the original\n owner - vendor restraining him from transferring and\n alienating the suit property, the vendor executed the\n sale deed in favour of the appellant by sale deed dated\n 10.07.2008. After a period of approximately four years,\n the appellant filed an application before the learned\n trial Court under \nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\n for his\n impleadment as a defendant. The appellant claimed\n the right on the basis of the said sale deed as well as\n the agreement to sell dated 31.3.2003 alleged to have\n been executed by the original vendor. The said\n application was opposed by the original plaintiffs. The\n learned trial Court despite the opposition by the\n original plaintiffs allowed the said application which\n has been set aside by the High Court by the impugned\n judgment and order. Thus, it was an application under\n \nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\n by a third party to the\n agreement to sell between the original plaintiffs and\n original defendant no.1 (vendor) and the said\n application for impleadment is/was opposed by the\n original plaintiffs. Therefore, the short question which\n is posed for consideration before this Court is, whether\n the plaintiffs can be compelled to implead a person in\n the suit for specific performance, against his wish and\n more particularly with respect to a person against\n whom no relief has been claimed by him?"
