The informant is herself present in the Court and on the\n\nrequest of learned counsel for the informant, she has also been\n\nallowed to make her submissions.\n\n3. Records have been placed before this Court to consider\n\nthe prayer of the appellant for suspension of his sentence and release\n\non bail during pendency of the appeal.\n\n4. The appellant has been convicted vide judgment dated\n\n27.04.2024 and sentenced vide order dated 01.05.2024 by learned\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Sheikhpura for the offence under\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n2/7\n\nSections 376(D)\n/\n,\n/\n,\n/\n,\n/\n,\n/\nand\n/\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code (in short '\nIPC\n') in Sessions Trial No. 19 of\n\n2023 arising out of Sheikhpura Mahila P.S. Case No. 16 of 2022. He\n\nhas been ordered to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 20 years with\n\na fine of Rs.15,000/- for the offence under\nSection 376(D)\nIPC and in\n\ndefault of payment of fine, he shall further undergo three months\n\nrigorous imprisonment. For brevity sake, sentences under other\n\nsections are not being mentioned.\n\n5. As per the prosecution case, the appellant and co-\n\naccused persons, who are also appellants in the connected appeal\n\nbeing Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 663 of 2024 and Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 679\n\nof 2024 have committed rape upon the informant/victim.\n\n6. Learned senior counsel for the appellant submits that\n\nearlier this Court had occasion to hear the identical prayer of the\n\nappellants, namely, Chandan Kumar and Laxman Yadav in the\n\nabove-mentioned two appeals and after hearing learned counsel for\n\nthe parties and learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State,\n\nthis Court has been pleased to grant them privilege of suspension of\n\nsentence and release on bail during pendency of the appeal. A copy of\n\nthe order dated 04.10.2024 passed in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 663 of\n\n2024 has been placed before this Court.\n\n7. Learned senior counsel submits that the victim in this\n\ncase has stated that she happened to be a student of B.A.-1st Part in\n\nMahila College, Sheikhpura and on the date of occurrence i.e.\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n3/7\n\n13.12.2021, she was going to collect her admit card of Alim Part-I\n\nfrom Biharisharif college. She had left her house at 6:00 AM in the\n\nmorning. It was winter season. In course of investigation, however,\n\nno material could be collected that the victim girl was a student of\n\nAlim Part-I. The victim has herself deposed in course of trial in the\n\nyear 2023 that she had done her graduation from Sanjay Gandhi\n\nMahila College, Sheikhpura but on the date of occurrence, she had\n\nalso registered herself in the graduation course of Urdu from Urdu\n\nBoard. Though she claimed that she can produce the paper but no\n\nsuch paper could be produced. The submission is that the fact that the\n\nprosecutrix had left her house at 6:00 AM for collecting her admit\n\ncard has not been proved by any cogent evidence and in the same\n\nyear, she could not have been a student of two graduation courses\n\nfrom two different Boards.\n\n8. Learned senior counsel further submits that it is very\n\nsurprising that the victim alleged that she was raped by five named\n\naccused persons on 13.12.2021 near the Government School,\n\nBangalipar. The said occurrence was never disclosed to anyone and\n\nno FIR was lodged in that connection.\n\n9. Learned senior counsel further submits that according\n\nto the victim, while committing rape, the accused persons had made\n\nher video and that her physical as well as mental condition had gone\n\nweak, for this reason she was not going to her college being afraid\n\nthat she may be murdered but the falsity of her statement may be\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n4/7\n\nfound from the fact that after the occurrence, she continued with her\n\ncollege for next two years and passed her graduation examination\n\nfrom Sheikhpura college itself. The so-called video which was\n\nallegedly made by the accused persons has never been found in the\n\nmobile phone of the accused and there is no evidence to this effect.\n\n10. Learned senior counsel has shown from paragraph '8'\n\nof the deposition of the victim that the victim had lodged another\n\ncase being Sheikhpura Mahila P.S. Case No. 31 of 2022. Initially,\n\nwhen she was asked that she had lodged two other cases, she denied\n\nthe same but then she was shown the FIR of Mahila P.S. Case No.31\n\nof 2022 in which she and her mami had lodged the case, then the\n\ninformant has stated that she and her mami had lodged the said case\n\nbecause they were finding a lot of misgivings and rumours in the\n\nmedia that she and her mami were indulging in wrong act.\n\n11. It has further been submitted that the falsity of the\n\nstatement of the victim may be found from the fact that even as she\n\nalleges rape had been committed by five named accused persons,\n\nshe did not go to any doctor and there is no evidence that she was\n\never treated for that so-called rape. In her 164\nCr.P.C\n. statement\n\nwhich was recorded on the very next day of the lodging of the FIR,\n\nshe did not mention the name of any of the accused persons. She\n\nclaimed that 20 days ago, one boy had called her over telephone by\n\nthreatening her to make her video viral and when she went there,\n\nshe was raped. Again about this occurrence, she had not reported to\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n5/7\n\npolice and she had not named the said boy and it is apparent that in\n\norder to save her from the media reports about her wrong acts, she\n\nhad come out with these allegations. In her statement before the\n\nlearned Magistrate, she claimed that she identified two boys and she\n\nfurther claimed that she can identify the others but in her deposition,\n\nshe has stated that prior to the occurrence, she did not know Chandan\n\nand other accused persons and after lodging of the FIR, she was\n\nseeing the accused persons only in the court. During the period of\n\ninvestigation, no TIP was conducted to ensure the identification of\n\nthe accused persons.\n\n12. It has further been pointed out to this Court that the\n\nvictim was subjected to the medical examination on 26.04.2022 in\n\nwhich the doctor had not found any injury on her private parts but\n\nfrom the overall findings, it would only appear that sexual\n\nintercourse had been done. She being an adult, the finding of the\n\ndoctor that sexual intercourse has been done with her would not be a\n\nproof that these accused persons had committed rape on her on\n\n13.12.2021, particularly, when she herself admits that there were\n\nmedia reports about her wrong acts.\n\n13. In course of submissions, learned Additional Public\n\nProsecutor for the State as well as learned counsel for the informant\n\ndo not controvert the submission of learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellant that his case would be standing on identical footing with\n\nthe appellants, namely, Chandan Kumar and Laxman Yadav in Cr.\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n6/7\n\nAppeal (DB) No. 663 of 2024 and Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 679 of 2024\n\nrespectively. In fact, learned counsel for the informant had only one\n\nprayer that this Court may direct the local administration to provide\n\nsecurity to the informant but at the same time, he accepts that till\n\ndate, the informant has not applied for any security with the local\n\npolice and no apparent cause has been shown to the competent\n\nauthority who are dealing with the safety and security of a citizen.\n\n14. It is not disputed that the victim was aged about 21\n\nyears at the time of alleged occurrence and the occurrence was not\n\nreported to the police and she had not received any treatment by any\n\ndoctor.\n\n15. Having regard to the submissions noted hereinabove\n\nand the materials which we have gone into for purpose of forming a\n\nprima-facie view, we notice that the victim has herself stated that the\n\noccurrence is of 13.12.2021 but she had lodged this case only on\n\n25.04.2022, thus, the FIR has been lodged after more than four\n\nmonths. The occurrence had not been reported to anyone and she had\n\nnot gone to any doctor if she had been a victim of a gang rape. We\n\nhave also noticed that she has not been able to prove that she was a\n\nstudent of Urdu Board for graduation and at the same time, she was\n\ngraduating from Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College, Sheikhpura. In\n\ncourse of trial, even it has not been proved prima-facie that on the\n\ndate of occurrence, she had left her house at 06:00 AM in the\n\nmorning. This Court has also noticed that the immediate cause for\nPatna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.652 of 2024(4) dt.26-11-2024\n\n7/7\n\nlodging of the FIR is the so-called media reports in which there were\n\nrumours that she and her mami were being involved in committing\n\nwrong act, considering these aspects of the matter and the\n\nuncontroverted submission of learned senior counsel for the appellant\n\nthat the case would stand on identical footing with the other\n\nappellants who have been granted the same privilege, we direct\n\nsuspension of sentence and release of the above-named appellant on\n\nbail during pendency of the appeal on furnishing bail bond of Rs.\n\n25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two sureties of the\n\nlike amount each to the satisfaction of learned District and\n\nSessions Judge, Sheikhpura in connection with Sessions Trial No. 19\n\nof 2023 arising out of Sheikhpura Mahila P.S. Case No. 16 of 2022.\n\n16. Fine, if any, imposed as part of sentence shall remain\n\nsuspended during pendency of the appeal.\n\n17. It is clarified that the observations made hereinabove\n\nare only prima-facie and tentative in nature for purpose of\n\nconsideration of the prayer for bail which would not cause prejudice\n\nto either of the parties.\n\n18. List this appeal for hearing on it's turn.\n\n(Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J)\n\n( Jitendra Kumar, J)\nSUSHMA2/-\n\nU T",
