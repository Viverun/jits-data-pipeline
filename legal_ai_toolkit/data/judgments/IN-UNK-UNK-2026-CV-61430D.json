SREENIVAS RAO\n\n CRIMINAL PETITION No. 1343 of 2021\n\nORDER:\n\n This Criminal Petition has been filed under \nSection\n\n482\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, by the\n\npetitioners/accused Nos.1 to 3 seeking to quash the\n\nproceedings in C.C.No.17248 of 2019 on the file of the XII\n\nAdditional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad, for\n\nthe offences punishable under \nSections 406\n, \n420\n and \n120B\n\nof the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, 'the \nIPC\n') by\n\nsetting aside the orders, dated 19.02.2020, in\n\nCrl.R.P.No.259 of 2019passed by the learned I Additional\n\nMetropolitan Sessions Judge, Hyderabad.\n\n2. Brief facts of the case:\n\n2.1. Respondent No.2/de facto complainant filed a private\n\ncomplaint on 13.04.2017 on the file of the XII Additional\n\nChief Metropolitan Magistrate, Nampally, Hyderabad,\n\nstating that petitioner No.1, Grandhe Developers Private\n\nLimited, being represented by its Directors, i.e., petitioner\n\nNos. 2 and 3, entered into an agreement of sale with him on\n\n12.03.2013 for the sale of open plots for a total sale\n\n 3\n\nconsideration of Rs.1,70,00,000/-. At the time of the\n\nagreement, an amount of Rs.91,55,000/- was paid as\n\nadvance and the agreement was reduced into writing at the\n\nRegistrar Office of the company situated at Narayanaguda,\n\nHyderabad. Subsequently, he paid further amount of\n\nRs.7,00,000/- on 13.03.2013, Rs.10,00,000/- on\n\n15.03.2013 and Rs.5,45,000/- on 03.04.2013, totalling Rs.\n\n22,45,000/- through RTGS to petitioner No.2. As per the\n\nterms of the agreement, the balance amount of\n\nRs.73,45,000/- was to be paid within eight months and the\n\nfinal balance amount of Rs.5,00,000/- was to be paid at the\n\ntime of registration of the plots. On the instructions of\n\npetitioner Nos.2 and 3, he transferred the balance\n\nconsideration directly to the accounts of accused Nos.4 to\n\n11, who were described as sleeping partners of the\n\ncompany. Despite receiving the entire sale consideration,\n\npetitioner Nos. 2 and 3 failed to perform their part of the\n\ncontract and on one pretext or another, deliberately\n\npostponed the registration of the plots and they\n\nmisrepresented him that the plots were falling under FTL\n\nand that they were in the process of getting the land\n\ncleared by the Revenue Authorities. Believing their\n\nassurance, he waited for several months. However, to his\n\n 4\n\nutter surprise, he subsequently realized that the petitioners\n\nand other accused persons had cheated him with a\n\ndishonest intention from the inception. Having been vexed\n\nwith their evasive conduct, he issued a legal notice to the\n\npetitioner and accused Nos.4 to 11. Accused Nos.6, 7, 9\n\nand 11 were received the notices and the notices in respect\n\nof remaining accused were returned un-served. In spite of\n\nservice of the legal notice, the petitioners and accused\n\nNos.4 to 11 did not come forward to execute the registered\n\nsale deed in his favour. Left with no alternative, he\n\napproached the Hon'ble Court and lodged the present\n\ncomplaint against the petitioner and accused Nos.4 to 11\n\nand the same was referred to the Central Crime Station,\n\nHyderabad. Pursuant to the same, Crime No.98 of 2017\n\nwas registered. The Investigating Officer after conducting\n\ninvestigation filed a final report on 28.05.2018 referred the\n\nmatter as 'false'. Thereafter, respondent No.2 filed protest\n\npetition and the learned Magistrate taken cognizance\n\nagainst the petitioner and issued summons, by its order\n\ndated 19.11.2019. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner\n\nfiled Criminal R.P.No.259 of 2019 and the learned\n\nI Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge at Hyderabad,\n\n 5\n\ndismissed the same, by its order dated 19.02.2020. Hence,\n\nthis criminal petition.\n\n3. Heard Mr. T. Chandra Shekhar, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioners, Mr. Gaddam Srinivas, learned counsel for\n\nrespondent No.2, and Mr. M. Vivekananda Reddy, learned\n\nAssistant Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of\n\nrespondent No.1-State.\n\n4. Submissions of learned counsel for the petitioners:\n\n4.1. Learned counsel submitted that the petitioners have\n\nnot committed any offence. However, the petitioners were\n\nfalsely implicated as accused in the present crime. Even\n\naccording to the allegations made in the complaint, the\n\ningredients under \nSections 406\n, \n420\n and \n120B\n of the IPC\n\ndoes not attract. Respondent No.2 filed a private complaint\n\non the file of the XII Additional Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate at Hyderabad on 13.04.2017 and the same was\n\nreferred to the police. Basing on the said complaint, Crime\n\nNo.98 of 2017 was registered. The Investigating Officer,\n\nduring the course of enquiry, sent the agreement of sale\n\ndated 12.03.2013 to the Forensic Science Laboratory and\n\nthe Government of Telangana, Telangana State Forensic\n\n 6\n\nScience Laboratories issued report dated 28.04.2021\n\nopining that the person who wrote the red enclosed\n\nsignatures marked A1 to A5 and S1 to S30 did not write the\n\nred enclosed signatures marked Q1 to Q6 and further, the\n\nperson who wrote the red enclosed signatures marked A6 to\n\nA10 and S31 to S60 did not write the red enclosed\n\nsignatures marked Q7 to Q9. Basing on the F.S.L. report,\n\nthe Investigating Officer filed the final report on\n\n28.05.2018, stating that as 'false'. In the said final report,\n\nthe Investigating Officer specifically mentioned that the\n\ndocument i.e., agreement of sale, dated 12.03.2013, is not\n\na genuine document, as it was prepared on 28.01.2013 on\n\na Rs.100/- non-judicial stamp paper, thereby rendering it\n\nas a created and fabricated document. In spite of the\n\nsame, the learned XII Additional Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate, Hyderabad, based on the protest petition filed\n\nby respondent No.2, took cognizance against the petitioners\n\nand issued summons, through order dated 19.11.2019,\n\nwithout considering the final report and without assigning\n\nany reasons and the learned I Additional Metropolitan\n\nSessions Judge also without considering the memorandum\n\nof grounds raised by the petitioners in the criminal revision\n\n 7\n\npetition dismissed the same on 19.02.2020, simply\n\nconfirming the order of the learned Magistrate.\n\n4.2. He also submitted that the petitioners never received\n\nany amount from respondent No.2 nor cheated him, as\n\nalleged in the complaint. Hence, the ingredients under\n\nSections 406\n, \n420\n and \n120B\n of the IPC do not attract. He\n\nfurther submitted that petitioner No.2 lodged a complaint\n\nagainst respondent No.2 and the same was registered as\n\nCrime No.26 of 2021 for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 465\n, \n467\n, \n468\n and \n471\n of the IPC and the\n\nInvestigating Officer after conducting investigation filed the\n\nfinal report and the same was taken cognizance and\n\nnumbered it as C.C.No.9582 of 2021 and the said case is\n\npending before the XII Additional Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate at Nampally, Hyderabad.\n\n4.3. He further submitted that basing upon the very same\n\nalleged agreement of sale, respondent No.2 had filed a suit,\n\nnamely, O.S.No.223 of 2023 on the file of the Principal\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Medchal-Malkajgiri District at\n\nMalkajgiri, seeking specific performance of agreement of\n\nsale and the said suit is pending. Hence, continuation of\n\n 8\n\ncriminal proceedings basing upon the fabricated document\n\nis clear abuse of the process of law.\n\n4.4. In support of his contention, he relied upon the\n\nfollowing judgments:\n\n \n1. \nDeepak Gaba and others v. State of\n Uttar Pradesh and another\n 1;\n\n 2. Thiyagarajan Anjayampati Sivaswamy\n v. The State of Telangana\n (Crl.P.No.3651 of 2023);\n\n 3. Pradnya Pranjal Kulkarni v. State of\n Maharashtra and another 2;\n\n \n4. \nDelhi Race Club (1940) Limited and\n others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and\n another\n 3; and\n\n 5. Priyanka Srivastava and another v.\n\n State of Uttar Pradesh and another 4.\n\n5. Submissions of learned counsel for respondent\n No.2\n\n5.1. Per contra, learned counsel submitted that petitioner\n\nNo.1 is a private limited company and petitioner Nos.2 and\n\n3, who are husband and wife respectively, are the Directors\n\n1\n\n (2023) 3 SCC 423\n\n2\n\n 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1948\n\n3\n\n 2025 (2) ALD (Crl.) 616 (SC)\n\n4\n\n (2015) 6 SCC 287\n\n 9\n\nof petitioner No.1 company. The petitioners entered into an\n\nagreement of sale, dated 12.03.2013, with respondent No.2\n\nand they agreed to sell the open plots for a sum of\n\nRs.1,70,00,000/- and respondent No.2 has paid an amount\n\nof Rs.1,65,00,000/- on various dates towards the sale\n\nconsideration and he has to pay balance sale consideration\n\nof Rs.5,00,000/- only. In spite of receiving a substantial\n\namount towards sale consideration, the petitioners failed to\n\nexecute the registered sale deed, On the contrary, with\n\ndishonest intention to cheat respondent No.2, they sold\n\nsome of the plots to third parties. He further submitted\n\nthat respondent No.2 lodged a complaint on 13.04.2017.\n\nHowever, at the instance of the petitioners, the\n\nInvestigating Officer, without properly conducting a proper\n\nand fair investigation, filed the final report referring the\n\ncase as 'false'.\n\n5.2. Aggrieved thereby respondent No.2 filed a protest\n\npetition. The learned Magistrate, after recording the sworn\n\nstatement of respondent No.2 as PW.1 and PW.2 and after\n\ngoing through the documents, filed by respondent No.2 i.e.,\n\nExs.P.1 to P.13, took cognizance against the petitioners and\n\nrightly issued summons, through order dated 19.11.2019.\n\n 10\n\nHe further submitted that learned Sessions Judge by giving\n\ncogent reasons dismissed the revision petition holding that\n\nthe real facts as to whether there were any transactions\n\nbetween respondent No.2 and the petitioners under\n\nagreement of sale will come into light only on conducting\n\nfull-fledged trial, by its order dated 19.02.2020.\n\n5.3. He further submitted that the allegations made by the\n\npetitioners that the stamp paper is a fabricated one is not\n\ntrue and correct. In fact, the stamp paper had purchased\n\nby petitioner No.2 only on the name of respondent No.2 and\n\nno prudent man will purchase the fabricated stamp paper\n\nby paying huge amount to the petitioners as sale\n\nconsideration. He further submitted that the petitioners,\n\nsince inception, are having ill-intention to cheat respondent\n\nNo.2. Therefore, the petitioners, even after receiving the\n\nsale consideration, sold some plots to third parties in spite\n\nof existence of agreement of sale between the petitioners\n\nand respondent No.2.\n\n5.4. He further submitted that respondent No.2 paid an\n\namount of Rs.1,14,00,000/- to petitioner Nos.2 and 3 by\n\nway of cash and RTGS and a sum of Rs.51,00,000/- to\n\naccused Nos.4 to 11 by way of RTGS, and the petitioners\n\n 11\n\nhave received total amount of Rs.1,65,00,000/-.\n\nRespondent No.2 filed RTGS receipts before the learned\n\nMagistrate along with the protest petition. The learned\n\nMagistrate after due consideration of the statements of\n\nPWs.1 and 2 and Exs.P.1 to P.13, specifically held that a\n\nprima facie case was made out against the petitioners and\n\naccordingly took cognizance against the petitioners.\n\n5.5. He further submitted that subsequent to the learned\n\nMagistrate taking cognizance, petitioner No.2 filed a\n\ncomplaint against respondent No.2 basing upon the alleged\n\nF.S.L. report. The Investigating Officer, without properly\n\nconducting an investigation, filed the charge sheet. In the\n\nsaid case, respondent No.2 filed discharge application\n\nseeking to discharge him in the said proceedings and the\n\nsame is pending. He also submitted that respondent No.2\n\nfiled a suit for specific performance of agreement of sale\n\nagainst the petitioners and others on 16.11.2022. The\n\npendency of the civil suit is not a ground for seeking to\n\nquash the proceedings. There are no grounds to interfere\n\nwith the orders passed by the learned XII Additional Chief\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad, which was confirmed\n\nby the learned I Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge at\n\n 12\n\nHyderabad, and the criminal petition is liable to be\n\ndismissed.\n\n5.6. In support of his contention, he relied upon the\n\nfollowing judgments:\n\n \n1. \nThota Papi Reddy and others v. Gudalli\n Yellaiah\n land and others 5;\n\n \n2. M/s. \nIndia Carat Pvt. Ltd. v. State of\n Karnataka and another\n 6; and\n\n \n3. \nDy. Chief Controller of Imports and\n Exports v. Roshanlal Agarwal and others\n 7.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n6. Having considered the rival submissions made by the\n\nrespective parties and after perusal of the material available\n\non record, it reveals that respondent No.2 lodged a private\n\ncomplaint against the petitioners and others on 13.04.2017\n\nbefore the learned XII Additional Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate. Basing on the said complaint, the learned\n\nMagistrate referred the matter to the police. Accordingly,\n\nthe police registered Crime No.98 of 2017 on 28.06.2018 for\n\nthe offences under \nSections 406\n, \n420\n and \n120B\n of the IPC.\n\nThe Investigating Officer after conducting investigation filed\n\n5\n\n 2006 (2) ALD (Crl.) 447\n\n6\n\n (1989) 2 SCC 132\n\n7\n\n (2003) 4 SCC 139\n\n 13\n\nthe final report on 28.05.2018 referred the matter as 'false'.\n\nOn 13.11.2018, respondent No.2 filed protest petition\n\ninvoking the provisions under \nSection 202\n read with 151 of\n\nthe \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, 1973 (for short, 'the\n\nCr.P.C\n.'). Along with the protest petition, he filed\n\ndocuments. The learned Magistrate after going through the\n\nsworn statements of PWs.1 and 2 and Exs.P.1 to P.13 held\n\nthat there is a prima facie case against the petitioners and\n\ntook cognizance and issued summons to the petitioners, by\n\nits order dated 19.11.2019.\n\n7. It is relevant to extract the order passed by the\n\nlearned Magistrate, which reads as follows:\n\n \"By considering the sworn statement of\n complainant i.e., PW1, PW2 and Ex.P1 to P13\n found a prima facie case against the petitioner.\n Hence cognizance of offence taken against A1 to\n A3 only for the offence U/s.420, 406 and 120(B)\n of \nIPC\n.\n\n As there is no prima facie case made out\n against the other accused, Crl.M.P. is dismissed.\n\n Registered as C.C.No.17248 of 2019 against\n the A1 to A3. Issue summons to A1 to A3. Call\n on 11.02.2020.\"\n\n Aggrieved by the above said order, the petitioners filed\n\n 14\n\nCriminal R.P.No.259 of 2019 invoking the provisions of\n\nSection 397\n of the Cr.P.C. before the learned I Additional\n\nMetropolitan Sessions Judge at Hyderabad, and the learned\n\nSessions Judge dismissed the criminal revision petition on\n\n19.02.2020 holding that the main grievance of the\n\npetitioner is that Ex.P.1 was fabricated one, whereas\n\nrespondent No.2 claims that he paid huge amount by way\n\nof cash and also through RTGS in respect of transaction\n\npursuant to Ex.P.1 and the real facts as to whether there\n\nwere any transaction between the petitioners and\n\nrespondent No.2 under agreement of sale-Ex.P.1 will come\n\ninto light after full-fledged trial and that no prejudice will\n\nbe caused to the petitioners as they will be given an\n\nopportunity to cross-examine respondent No.2.\n\n8. The core contention of the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners before this Court is that as per the Forensic\n\nScience Laboratory report dated 28.04.2021, the agreement\n\nof sale executed on Hundred Rupees non-judicial stamp\n\npaper and the said stamp paper itself is a fabricated\n\ndocument and basing upon the said fabricated/created\n\ndocument, he is not entitled to prosecute the petitioner.\n\nWhereas, the specific case of respondent No.2 is that he\n\n 15\n\nhad paid substantial amounts pursuant to the agreement\n\nof sale by way of cash and also through RTGS and RTGS\n\nreceipts and other documents are enclosed along with the\n\nprotest petition and the petitioners with a dishonest\n\nintention cheated respondent No.2 and sold some of the\n\nplots to the third parties.\n\n9. Whether respondent No.2 has paid any amount to the\n\npetitioners or to the other persons at the instance of the\n\npetitioners, whether the amounts transferred through\n\nRTGS pertaining to the agreement of sale dated\n\n12.03.2013, whether agreement of sale and other\n\ndocuments relied upon by respondent No.2 are genuine or\n\nnot, are disputed facts and the same cannot be adjudicated\n\nby this Court in the criminal petition and the same has to\n\nbe decided by the trial Court after full-fledged trial only.\n\n10. It is pertinent to mention that respondent No.2 filed a\n\nsuit in O.S.No.223 of 2023 seeking specific performance of\n\nagreement of sale dated 12.03.2013 against the petitioners\n\nand other defendants on 16.11.2022, much after filing of\n\nthe private complaint dated 13.04.2017, against the\n\npetitioners. It is trite law that mere pendency of civil cases\n\nbetween the parties does not bar to invoke criminal\n\n 16\n\njurisdiction provided the allegations disclose the\n\ncommission of a cognizable offence. In the case on hand,\n\nthe allegations made in the suit in O.S.No.223 of 2023 as\n\nwell as allegations made in C.C.No.17248 of 2019 are\n\ndifferent and distinctive. Moreover, petitioner No.2 filed a\n\ncomplaint and the same was numbered as C.C.No.9582 of\n\n2021, which is subsequent to the filing of private complaint\n\nby respondent No.2.\n\n11. \nIn \nDeepak Gaba\n supra, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nheld that in the absence of factual allegations establishing\n\nthe essential ingredients of \nSection 405\n IPC such as\n\nentrustment, dishonest misappropriation, or conversion in\n\nviolation of law or contract a mere monetary dispute or an\n\nallegedly wrong demand does not constitute an offence\n\nunder \nSections 405\n/\n406\n IPC. It further emphasized that\n\ncriminal proceedings cannot be permitted to be used as\n\ninstruments of harassment or vengeance, and when\n\nallegations in the complaint and pre-summoning evidence,\n\neven if accepted on their face, do not disclose the\n\ncommission of an offence or are absurd and inherently\n\nimprobable, the High Court must exercise its inherent\n\npowers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C to quash such\n\n 17\n\nproceedings.\n\n12. In Thiyagarajan Aniayampati Sivaswamy supra, the\n\nTelangana High Court quashed the cognizance order of the\n\nSpecial Judge for Economic Offences on the ground that it\n\nwas cryptic and passed without application of mind. The\n\nCourt reiterated that issuing process and summoning an\n\naccused is a serious judicial act which requires the\n\nMagistrate/Special Court to record satisfaction, even\n\nbriefly, that a prima facie case exists. Mere mechanical or\n\nbald orders stating that cognizance is taken are\n\ninsufficient. Relying on various Supreme Court precedents,\n\nthe Court held that non-speaking orders at the stage of\n\ncognizance burden courts with unnecessary trials and\n\ncause undue harassment to accused. Directions were\n\nissued to trial courts in Telangana to ensure that orders\n\nunder \nSections 156(3)\n Cr.P.C., cognizance on charge\n\nsheets, protest petitions, and committals must briefly\n\nreflect judicial satisfaction. Consequently, the impugned\n\norder was set aside, with liberty to the Special Judge to\n\npass a fresh, reasoned order.\n\n13. In Pradnya Pranjal Kulkarni supra, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held that when a petition seeks quashing of\n\n 18\n\nan FIR together with the charge-sheet and the cognizance-\n\ntaking order, if any, and Section 528 of the Bharatiya\n\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita (\"BNSS\") is invoked, the High\n\nCourt (or Division Bench) has jurisdiction to entertain and\n\nmould such relief, so long as the requisite facts are on\n\nrecord and the court is satisfied that quashing is warranted\n\nin the circumstances.\n\n14. \nIn \nDelhi Race Club (1940) Ltd.\n supra, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that if the complainant's grievance is merely\n\nthat a sum of money is due and payable, the proper remedy\n\nis to file a civil suit for recovery and not a criminal\n\ncomplaint alleging cheating or criminal breach of trust. The\n\nCourt noted that \nin that case\n no civil suit had been filed\n\nand even the period of limitation for such recovery\n\nappeared to have expired. The Court further emphasised,\n\nwhile concluding, that despite the replacement of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860 by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita,\n\n2023, courts have continued to show a casual approach in\n\nfailing to appreciate the fine distinction between the\n\noffences of cheating and criminal breach of trust.\n\n15. In Priyanka Srivastava supra, the Supreme Court\n\ncautioned against the routine and irresponsible filing of\n\n 19\n\napplications under \nSection 156(3)\n Cr.P.C. It was held that\n\nsuch applications must be supported by an affidavit duly\n\nsworn by the applicant to ensure accountability, and the\n\nMagistrate, in appropriate cases, may verify the truth and\n\nveracity of the allegations. The Court observed that many\n\nsuch applications are filed mechanically to harass\n\nindividuals, including those discharging statutory duties,\n\nand stressed that criminal courts cannot be misused as\n\ninstruments for settling scores.\n\n16. \nIn \nThota Papi Reddy\n supra, the erstwhile High Court\n\nof Andhra Pradesh, relying on the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in \nIndia Carat (P) Ltd.\n supra, held that\n\neven if the police report under \nSection 173(2)\n Cr.P.C\n\nconcludes that no case is made out, the Magistrate is not\n\nbound by such conclusion and can, in exercise of powers\n\nunder \nSection 190(1)(b)\n, independently apply his mind to\n\nthe material collected during investigation, take cognizance,\n\nand issue process against the accused, without being\n\nobliged to follow the procedure under \nSections 200\n and \n202\n\nCr.P.C.\n\n17. \nIn \nRoshanlal Agarwal\n supra, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt held that at the stage of issuing process under\n\n 20\n\nSection 204\n CrPC, the Magistrate is only required to be\n\nsatisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding,\n\nand not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction.\n \nIt\n\nwas further clarified, following \nU.P. Pollution Control Board v.\n\nMohan Meakins Ltd.\n and \nKanti Bhadra Shah v. State of W.B.\n, that\n\nthere is no legal requirement for the Magistrate to record\n\ndetailed reasons while issuing summons, and the process\n\ncannot be quashed merely because the order taking\n\ncognizance is not a speaking order.\n\n18. It is relevant to mention that in K. Jagadish v. Udaya\n\nKumar G.\nS. 8\n, the Hon'ble Apex Court has reaffirmed the\n\nwell-settled principle that the same set of facts may give\n\nrise to both civil and criminal proceedings, and that\n\navailing a civil remedy does not bar the initiation of\n\ncriminal prosecution.\n \nThe Court relied heavily on\n\nprecedents like \nKamaladevi Agarwal v. State of W.B.\n and\n\nTrisuns Chemical Industry v. Rajesh Agarwal\n, to reiterate\n\nthat criminal proceedings cannot be quashed merely\n\nbecause a civil dispute is also pending between the parties.\n\nIn Kamaladevi Agarwal, it was categorically held that the\n\npendency of civil proceedings does not justify quashing\n\n8\n\n (2020) 14 SCC 552\n\n 21\n\ncriminal proceedings, especially where the allegations\n\ndisclose a prima facie criminal offence. The Court observed\n\nthat many acts of cheating occur in the context of\n\ncommercial or financial transactions, and such a \"civil\n\nprofile\" does not strip the act of its \"criminal outfit.\"\n \nThe\n\nCourt also referred to \nState of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal\n and\n\nRajesh Bajaj v. State (NCT of Delhi\n), which held that\n\nquashing of FIRs under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. should be\n\nlimited to rare and exceptional cases. It emphasized that\n\njust because a transaction involves a commercial or\n\nmonetary element that alone is not a ground to rule out\n\ncriminal intent or proceedings. Ultimately, the Court\n\nconcluded that the High Court had erred in quashing the\n\ncriminal proceedings, stressing that criminal cases must\n\nproceed as per the \nCr.P.C\n. and cannot be halted solely due\n\nto parallel civil litigation, regardless of the status or\n\nauthority of the civil forum.\n\n19. In Kamal Shivaji Pokarnekar supra, the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt held that the inherent powers under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. has to be exercised in exceptional cases sparingly,\n\nwith caution, only to prevent abuse of process or to secure\n\nthe ends of justice; and it cannot be invoked to weigh\n\n 22\n\nevidence or stifle a genuine prosecution, but may be\n\napplied where the allegations in the complaint, taken at\n\nface value, do not disclose the basic ingredients of any\n\noffence. The case on hand is not the rarest of rare cases to\n\nexercise powers of this Court under \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C.\n\nto quash the proceedings in C.C.No.17248 of 2019.\n\n20. It is relevant to mention that in the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in \nSonu Gupta v. Deepka Gupta\n 9,\n\nit was held that at the stage of taking cognizance, the\n\nMagistrate is required only to see whether a prima facie\n\ncase is made out and he is not required to evaluate the\n\nsufficiency of evidence or undertake a detailed inquiry into\n\nthe merits. If the Magistrate, at the stage of cognizance,\n\nenters into analysis the evidence or evaluates the defence,\n\nit would amount to premature adjudication, which is\n\nimpermissible in law.\n\n21. It is pertinent to mention that in \nKamal Shivaji\n\nPokarnekar v. State of Maharashtra\n 10, the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt held that at the stage of cognizance and summoning,\n\nthe Magistrate is required only to ascertain whether a\n\nprima facie case exists for proceeding against the accused;\n\n9\n\n (2015) 3 SCC 424)\n\n10\n\n (2019) 14 SCC 350\n\n 23\n\nhe is not required to evaluate the merits or sufficiency of\n\nthe material, nor to determine whether it would ultimately\n\nlead to conviction.\n\n22. It is also relevant to mention that in \nState of Gujarat\n\nv. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta\n 11, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt held that at the stage of cognizance on a police\n\nreport, the Magistrate is only required to be satisfied that\n\nsufficient ground exists to proceed, and not to apply a strict\n\nstandard of proof or consider possible defences.\n\nInterference by the High Court in revisional jurisdiction by\n\nexamining merits at this nascent stage was erroneous.\n\nAccordingly, the impugned order of the Gujarat High Court\n\nwas set aside and the Magistrate's order taking cognizance\n\nof the supplementary charge-sheet and issuing summons\n\nwas restored, with a direction for the accused to appear\n\nand the trial to proceed in accordance with law.\n\n23. In plethora of judgments, the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nspecifically held that at the stage of taking cognizance, the\n\nMagistrate is only required to be satisfied that sufficient\n\ngrounds exists for proceeding further and to see whether a\n\nprima facie case is made out against the accused and the\n\n11\n\n (2019) 20 SCC 539\n\n 24\n\nMagistrate is not required to evaluate the sufficiency of\n\nevidence or undertake a detailed enquiry into the merits of\n\nthe case, nor is it necessary to examine whether the\n\nmaterial would ultimately result in conviction.\n\n24. It is already stated supra, the learned Magistrate after\n\ngoing through the statements of PWs.1 and 2 and the\n\ndocuments which are enclosed along with protest petition\n\ni.e., Exs.P.1 to P.13, specifically held that there is a prima\n\nface case against the petitioners and accordingly took\n\ncognizance. The learned Sessions Judge, upon due\n\nconsideration confirmed the said order by giving specific\n\nreasons and dismissed the Crl.R.P.\n\n25. For the foregoing reasons as well as the principles \nlaid\n\ndown by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court as stated supra, this Court\n\ndoes not find any illegality, irregularity or procedural\n\nimpropriety warranting interference with the order passed\n\nby the learned I Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge at\n\nHyderabad in Criminal R.P.No.259 of 2019 dated\n\n19.02.2020, confirming the order dated 19.11.2019 passed\n\nby the learned XII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,\n\nHyderabad, or any ground to quash C.C.No.17248 of 2019\n\nto exercise the powers conferred under \nSections 482\n of the\n\n 25\n\nCr.P.C\n. and the same is liable to be dismissed.\n\n26. In the result, the criminal petition is dismissed.\n\nHowever, the presence of the petitioners in C.C.No.17248 of\n\n2019 is dispensed with, unless their presence is specifically\n\nrequired subject to the condition that the petitioners shall\n\nrepresent through their counsel on each and every date of\n\nhearing. In case of non-appearance of the petitioners on\n\nthe specific date so fixed by the trial Court for their\n\nappearance, the trial Court is entitled to proceed with the\n\nmatter, in accordance with law. It is made clear that the\n\ntrial Court shall decide the matter on own merits,\n\nuninfluenced by any of the observations made in this order\n\nor in the impugned order dated 19.02.2020 passed by the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge in Crl.R.P.No.259 of 2019 as well\n\nas the order dated 19.11.2019 passed by the learned\n\nMagistrate in Crl.M.P.No.2600 of 2019.\n\n Miscellaneous applications, pending if any, shall\n\nstand closed.\n\n _______________________\n J.
