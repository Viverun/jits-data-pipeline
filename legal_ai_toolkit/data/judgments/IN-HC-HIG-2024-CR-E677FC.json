Accused in S.C.No.80/2023 pending before the\n\nCourt of the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Gadag\n\narising out of Crime No.40/2023 registered by Mulugund\n\npolice station, Gadag for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 498A\n,\n,\nof IPC, is before this Court under\n\nSection 439\nof Cr.P.C.\n\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n3. FIR in Crime No.40/2023 was registered by\n\nMulugund police station, Gadag against the petitioner\n\nherein initially for the offences punishable under\nSections\n\n498A\n,\n,\n,\nof IPC on the complaint of Salim who\n\nis the brother of the victim Reshma Husain Shekh. In the\n\nsaid case, the petitioner was arrested on 30.05.2023.\n\nInvestigation in the case is completed and charge sheet\n\nhas been filed. Bail application filed by the petitioner\n\n-3-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:3621\n\nCRL.P No. 103713 of 2023\n\nbefore the trial Court in Crl.Misc.361/2023 was rejected on\n\n06.10.2023. Therefore, he is before this Court.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner having\n\nreiterated the grounds urged in the petition submits that\n\nthe version of alleged eyewitness CW6 in her statement\n\nunder\nSection 161\nof Cr.P.C. and under\nSection 164\nof\n\nCr.P.C. are inconsistent. The petitioner has no criminal\n\nantecedents and he has two minor children who are\n\nrequired to be taken care of. He is in custody from\n\n30.05.2023 onwards. Accordingly, he prays to allow the\n\npetition.\n\n5. Per contra, learned High Court Government\n\nPleader has opposed the bail application.\n\n6. FIR in Crime No.40/2023 was registered by\n\nMulugund police station, Gadag on the complaint of Salim\n\nwhich was lodged on 30.05.2023, at about 9.05 a.m. In\n\nthe complaint, it is averred that the complainant's sister\n\nwas married to the petitioner herein about 12 years prior\n\nto the date of the complaint and from the wedlock, the\n\ncouple have two children. It is further averred that the\n\n-4-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:3621\n\nCRL.P No. 103713 of 2023\n\npetitioner was ill-treating his wife and therefore the\n\ncomplainant had brought back his sister-Reshma along\n\nwith the two minor children to his house about 15 days\n\nprior to the date of the complaint.\n\n7. On 29.05.2023, the petitioner allegedly came to\n\nthe house of the complainant and requested him to send\n\nhis wife with him as he intended to visit Davalmalik Hillock\n\nat Mulugund. The complainant allegedly sent his cousin\n\nsister-Simran along with the petitioner and Reshma. At\n\nabout 6.30 p.m. on the said date, Simran allegedly\n\ntelephoned the complainant and informed him that the\n\npetitioner had pushed down Reshma from the Hillock and\n\nshe has sustained grievous injury and therefore she was\n\ntaken to the hospital. Immediately the complainant went\n\nto the hospital and noticed that Reshma had suffered\n\ngrievous injury and she was not in a position to talk. It is\n\nin this background, on 30.05.2023 a complaint was lodged\n\nbased on which FIR in Crime No.40/2023 was registered.\n\nReshma had subsequently died in the hospital on\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:3621\n\nCRL.P No. 103713 of 2023\n\n31.05.2023. Therefore\nSection 302\nof IPC was invoked\n\nagainst the accused.\n\n8. According to the prosecution, CW6-Simran was\n\nthe eyewitness to the incident in question. In the\n\ncomplaint, it is averred that Simran had informed the\n\ncomplainant at about 6.30 p.m. on 29.05.2023 that\n\npetitioner had pushed down Reshma from the Hillock and\n\nas a result of the fall, Reshma had suffered grievous injury\n\nand she was taken to the hospital and immediately\n\nthereafter complainant visited the hospital. The complaint\n\nwas lodged belatedly i.e., on the next date at about 9.05\n\na.m. The statement made by the eyewitness CW6 before\n\nthe police under\nSection 161\nof Cr.P.C. and the statement\n\nmade by her before the jurisdictional Magistrate under\n\nSection 164\nof Cr.P.C. are inconsistent. From a perusal of\n\nthe statement of CWs.7 and 8 who are the other alleged\n\neyewitnesses, a serious doubt arises as to whether they\n\nhad witnessed the petitioner pushing down his wife from\n\nthe hillock. The petitioner, who was arrested on\n\n30.05.2023, has no criminal antecedents. Investigation in\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:3621\n\nCRL.P No. 103713 of 2023\n\nthe case is completed and charge sheet has been filed. He\n\nis required to take care of his two minor children. Under\n\nthese circumstances, I am of the opinion that the prayer\n\nmade by the petitioner for grant of regular bail is required\n\nto be answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, the\n\nfollowing:\n\nORDER\n\nPetition is allowed. The petitioner is directed to be\n\nenlarged on bail in S.C.No.80/2023 pending before the\n\nCourt of the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Gadag\n\narising out of Crime No.40/2023 registered by Mulugund\n\npolice station, Gadag for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 498A\n,\n,\nof IPC, subject to the following\n\nconditions:\n\ni. The petitioner shall execute personal bond for a\nsum of Rs.1,00,000/- with 2 sureties for the\nlikesum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional\nCourt;\n\nii. The petitioner shall appear regularly on all the\ndates of hearing before the Trial Court unless the\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:3621\n\nCRL.P No. 103713 of 2023\n\nTrial Court exempts his appearance for valid\nreasons;\n\niii. The petitioner shall not directly or indirectly\nthreaten or tamper with the prosecution\nwitnesses;\n\niv. The petitioner shall not leave the jurisdiction of\nthe Trial Court without permission of the said\nCourt until the case registered against him is\ndisposed off.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\nKGK\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 9",
