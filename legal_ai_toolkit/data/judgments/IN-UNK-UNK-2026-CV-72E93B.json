The present appeal has been filed by the husband-\n appellant/plaintiff against the Judgment dated 05.10.2018 and Decree\n of dismissal dated 28.11.2018 passed in Original Suit No.174 of 2016\n by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Giridih.\n\n 3. The suit has been instituted by the husband for divorce\n under \nSection 13\n of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 on the ground of\n cruelty, desertion and mental incapacity of the respondent-wife.\n\n 4. The Trial Court after considering the pleading of the\n parties has formulated six issues for decision, which are as follows:-\n\n ¼1½ D;k oknh dk okn iks\"k.kh; gS \\\n ¼2½ D;k bl okn esa okn&dkj.k gS \\\n ¼3½ D;k izfrokfnuh us oknh ds lkFk Øwjrk fd;k gS \\\n ¼4½ D;k izfrokfnuh us yxkrkj nks o\"kksZ ls vf/kd le; ls oknh dk vfHkR;kx dj\n fn;k\n fn;k gS \\\n ¼5½ D;k oknh fookg&foPNsn dk fMØh ikus dk gdnkj gS \\\n ¼6½ D;k oknh fdlh vU; vuqrks\"k ;k vuqrks\"kksa dks ikus dk gdnkj gS \\\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -2-\n\n5. After analyzing the evidences, pleadings and argument of\nthe parties all the issues have been decided against the plaintiff-\nhusband and in favour of the wife-respondent vide impugned\nJudgment dated 05.10.2018 and accordingly decree has been drawn\nand signed on 28.11.2018.\n\n6. Being aggrieved, the present appeal has been filed by the\nappellant-husband and vide order dated 24.09.2019, delay in filing the\nappeal has been condoned. It may be stated that in course of trial as\nwell as during the pendency of the appeal, efforts of mediation were\nmade between the parties, but all the efforts failed. Even during the\nfinal hearing of the appeal, efforts of compromise were made by us,\nbut there could be no compromise between the parties. Hence we have\nheard this appeal on merits.\n\n7. Before this Court, the appellant-husband has taken two\npoints i.e. cruelty and desertion. Mental disability of the respondent-\nwife has not been pressed. It is worth to note that the court below has\nrejected the ground of mental illness as no evidence had been led by\nthe appellant-husband.\n\n8. Considering the pleadings and arguments and material\navailable on record, two points are required to be considered by this\nCourt.\n\n (i). Whether the respondent-wife has treated the\nappellant-husband with cruelty warranting dissolution of marriage.\n\n (ii). Whether residing separately by wife since\n12.07.2014 amounts to desertion entitling husband for decree of\ndivorce as per the mandate of \nSection 13\n (i-b) of the \nHindu Marriage\nAct, 1955\n.\n\n9. As per the pleadings of the husband, marriage had been\nsolemnized between the parties as per Hindu rites and rituals at\nMirzaganj on 29.01.2007 in presence of relatives and family members\nof both the parties and they have lived as husband and wife at Ranchi\nand Delhi. One son and one daughter have been born out from their\nwedlock. As per appellant- husband, the respondent-wife always\nbehaved in a psychic and rude manner with the appellant-husband and\nalso with his parents and has treated him as well as his parents with\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -3-\n\nutmost cruelty in different ways. The appellant-husband was\nconsiderate and treated his wife with compassion and tolerated her\ncruelty giving her time to mend her ways and even he allowed his\nbrother-in-law, namely Dinesh Kumar to live in their matrimonial\nhome at Ranchi in 2007-2008 to pursue his graduation course and on\nsuccessful completion of course he got job in Insurance Company.\nAppellant-husband even encouraged his wife for higher studies and\naccordingly she got admitted in M.A. (History) in Ranchi University\nin June, 2007 but she did not pursue her course. Thereafter even she\nwas admitted in Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) for\nM.A. (English), but in vein. In 2008, appellant-husband had searched\na job in English Nursery School as per her educational qualification,\nbut she refused to work. Just after one year of marriage, the appellant-\nhusband had taken his wife to marriage ceremony of her cousin sister,\nnamely, Poonam at Mirzaganj and on completion of the rituals, he\ninformed her parents regarding the cruel and rude behavior of his\nwife. After coming back, her behavior became ruder. Ultimately, she\nconceived and gave birth to a healthy male child. Even after birth of\nthe child, her behavior did not improve and after 20 days of birth she\nhad been taken to her parents' place by his father-in-law for better\ncare of child. Due to the behavior pattern of his wife and her family\nmembers, appellant apprehended and accordingly he filed an\nInformatory Petition in the court of C.J.M., Giridih apprehending\nfiling of false case against him and his family members for dowry and\ndomestic violence and requested the learned C.J.M., Giridih to send\nthe above mentioned Informatory Petition to Jamua Police Station and\nTisri Police Station with a direction to take necessary, preventive and\nprotective action so that no false case be instituted.\n\n10. Thereafter, appellant moved to Delhi where he got job in\nAIIMS. Appellant was desirous to bring his wife to Delhi but in the\nmeantime she moved to Giridih Tailik Sahu Sabha who held\npanchayati on 08.11.2009 and as per dictum of panchayat, she went to\nDelhi alongwith her husband where she resided for few months.\nAppellant-husband wanted to bring his father to Delhi for treatment\nwhich was refused by his wife and accordingly he died on 11.05.2010\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -4-\n\ndue to lack of proper care and treatment. In spite of death of his father,\nhe attended the marriage ceremony of his brother-in-law, which was\nheld on 05.06.2010 at Mirzaganj and performed necessary rituals.\nSuddenly after marriage of her brother, namely Rupesh Kumar, she\ncame to Delhi without information on 28.06.2010 and called the\nappellant in the morning at 7.00 A.M, when he had gone for a\nbreakfast in AIIMS canteen. He informed his wife to remain calm as\nhe will come and open the gate of the residence but she called the\npolice and created a scene. As appellant was getting threats, he again\nfiled an application dated 10.06.2010 in the office of S.P., Giridih.\n\n11. The respondent-wife again went to her parents' place on\n07.09.2010. When he went there to meet his wife and son, he was not\nallowed to meet his wife and son in October, 2010 and January, 2011,\nwhich amounts to cruelty. She further lodged an F.I.R. as Tisri P.S.\nCase No.38 of 2011 dated 12.05.2011 under \nSection 498A\n/\n34\n of the\nIndian Penal Code and 3/4 of the \nDowry Prohibition Act\n. Compromise\nhad been arrived between the parties and on that basis he got bail.\nThat case is still pending for trial, and in spite of the fact that final\nform had been submitted, still the C.J.M, Giridih has taken cognizance\nin the case. As per the compromise, they again started living as\nhusband and wife but cruelty of the respondent-wife became more\nintense and psychic behavior endangering the life of appellant as well\nas his son. In the meantime, respondent-wife again became pregnant\nand one day she left for her parents' place but appellant-husband took\nher back from the railway station but ultimately with her maternal\nuncle, namely, Praween Kumar, she went to her parents' place\non 03.07.2012. Appellant came to know from the independent source\nin July-August, 2012 that she got the fetus aborted. The appellant\nultimately got job at Ranchi and as per desire of his wife, they again\nstarted living as husband and wife from November December, 2012\nbut behavior of respondent-wife did not improve. She used to threat\nhim with suicide and has treated the appellant-husband with cruelty\nand sometimes not allowed to enter the house if he got delayed due to\npressure of work. She used to bolt the house from inside due to her\npsychic behavior. One day when they were returning after visiting a\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -5-\n\npark she jumped from the car and ran towards the car on trivial issue.\nAgain she became pregnant and ultimately blessed with a female child\nin 2014. One day he had been assaulted by the brother-in-law for\nwhich he complained to Bariatu police station but subsequently he\nwithdrew the application but his wife has lodged a false criminal case\nunder \nSection 498A\n of the Indian Penal Code against the appellant-\nhusband in Bariatu police station and ultimately she left the\nmatrimonial house on 12.07.2014 out of her own will and since then\nthey are living separately and this amounts to desertion.\n\n12. On 02.08.2014 a maintenance case being M.T.S. Case\nNo.232 of 2014 has been filed in which vide order dated 29.11.2016,\nappellant-husband has been directed to pay Rs.25,000/- as\nmaintenance i.e. Rs.15,000/- for wife and Rs.5,000/- each for two\nchildren. (However, it has been admitted in course of argument that\nfor about 11 months payment has not been made.)\n\n13. In support of his pleadings, the appellant-husband has not\nproduced any documentary evidence, but has examined two witnesses,\none himself and his mother, namely, Kaushalya Devi.\n\n14. Respondent-wife has filed written statement denying the\nallegation of cruelty, desertion and mental illness. It has been alleged\nthat demand of dowry of Rs.2,00,000/- and a car could not be given to\nappellant-husband and for extracting the same, respondent-wife had\nbeen treated with cruelty and time to time, she had been ousted from\nher matrimonial house. She has admitted that they had lived as\nhusband and wife at Ranchi and at Delhi. After birth of male child she\nwent to her parents' place but appellant-husband was not willing to\ntake her back and as such she approached the Tailik Sahu Sabha and\npanchayati was held on 08.11.2009 and as per dictum of the panchayat\nshe was taken back to the matrimonial home. She has denied that she\nhas ever refuted for treatment of father of the husband rather she has\nperformed her duty towards parents of the appellant-husband. She has\nfurther stated that as appellant-husband was harassing her for demand\nof dowry and as such an FIR being Tisri P.S. Case No.38 of 2011 has\nbeen instituted on 12.05.2011 under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC and\n\nSection 3\n/\n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act in which the wife readily\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -6-\n\naccepted the compromise to save her marriage upon which as per the\nterms and condition of the bail order, she was taken to the matrimonial\nhome. When she went to attend marriage of her brother and after\ncompletion of marriage ceremony, appellant- husband came alone and\nwas not willing to take her back and as such she went to Delhi\nalongwith her brother. To avoid the entry, husband locked the house\nand went to the work place. Even after persuasion, when her husband\ndid not turn up, she had to get the help of Delhi police and upon\nintervention of Delhi police a compromise had been arrived between\nthe parties and she had been allowed to enter into the matrimonial\nhome at Delhi. Even at Ranchi, she was always mistreated and\npressurized for bringing dowry or doing job. Ultimately, she had to\napproach Bariatu police station by lodging Bariatu police case No.429\nof 2013 under \nSections 498A\n and \n323\n of the IPC in which also she\nreadily compromised. In spite of compromise, she was driven out of\nmatrimonial home on 12.07.2014 and since then she has not been\nallowed to enter the matrimonial home, although she is always\ndesirous to save the matrimonial home and has participated in the\nmarriage of younger brother of her husband on 07.05.2017 at his\nvillage.\n\n15. In support of her pleading, she has examined four\nwitness, namely, Ashok Saw, Naresh Saw, Praveen Kumar and\nherself. She has also produced documentary evidence i.e. Exhibit-A, a\nmutual divorce application dated 13.07.2009 sent by the husband to\nwife after signing. Exhibit-B, letter dated 30.07.2010 to her father\ngiving threat. Exhibit-C, Formal FIR of Tisri P.S. Case No.38 of 2011.\nExhibit-D, certified copy of the Charge-sheet of Tisri P.S Case No.38\nof 2011. Exhibit D/a, certified copy of the charge-sheet of Bariatu P.S.\nCase No.429 of 2013. Exhibit-E, certified copy of the order of framing\nof charge of Tisri P.S. Case No. 38 of 2011, Exhibit-F, certified copy\nof the compromise between the parties in Tisri P.S. Exhibit-G,\ncertified copy of the order dated 21.01.2012 in Tisri P.S. Case No. 38\nof 2011, Exhibit-G/a, certified copy of the order-sheet of A.B.P. Case\nNo. 256 of 2011. Xerox copies of Panchnama of Tailik Sahu Sabha\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -7-\n\nand information given by the wife-Suman Kumari to Delhi police\nwere marked as 'X' and 'Y' for identification.\n\n16. The appellant-in-person has submitted that the impugned\nJudgement and Decree passed by the court below are absolutely illegal\nand against the evidence on record. It is submitted that on the basis of\nthe evidence on record, the cruelty of the respondent wife is proved by\nhim. It is also submitted that admittedly the respondent wife has filed\nmultiple criminal cases against him, in which the appellant had to\nundergo jail, which in itself amounts to cruelty by the respondent wife,\nthus entitling the appellant to the decree of divorce. In any event, the\ndesertion since 12.07.2014 is an admitted fact and this alone gives a\ngood ground for divorce. It is further submitted by the appellant-in-\nperson that in spite of the desertion for more than six years, no case\nfor restitution of the conjugal rights has been filed by the respondent\nwife, which shows that desertion is voluntary on her part as well. He\nhas further submitted that there is irretrievable breakdown of marriage\nbetween the parties, and on this ground also, the decree of divorce\nshould have been passed.\n\n17. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent\nwife has submitted that the court below has discussed the evidence of\nboth the sides in detail and has rightly decided all the issues against\nthe appellant and in favour of the respondent wife. As such, there is no\nillegality in the impugned Judgement and Decree passed by the court\nbelow, and this appeal is fit to be dismissed. Learned counsel has\nsubmitted that the respondent is still willing to lead a respectable\nconjugal life with her husband, but the husband is not willing to keep\nher.\n\n18. Having heard the appellant-in-person and learned counsel\nfor the respondent wife, we find that so far as first point raised by the\nappellant regarding cruelty, it appears from the pleading of the\nplaintiff-husband himself that he has given bald and sweeping\nstatements without providing any cogent documentary proof of the\nsame. There is only oral evidence of the appellant and her mother, but\nthe oral evidence adduced by the respondent wife in support of her\npleadings, are also supported by documentary evidence, which\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -8-\n\ndemolish the case of cruelty, as pleaded by the husband, rather it\nsupports the case of the respondent wife that actually she was treated\nwith cruelty and torture by the appellant. Merely filing of criminal\ncases by the respondent wife cannot be treated to be cruel behavior on\nher part, unless the allegations made by her are proved to be false,\nwhich is not the case till date, as the trial in the criminal cases are still\npending. Indeed the compromises by her in order to secure bail for the\nappellant in the criminal cases, clearly indicate the willingness of the\nrespondent wife to resume the respectable conjugal life with the\nappellant. None filing of any case for restitution of the conjugal rights\nby the respondent wife, cannot mean that she is also interested in\nliving separate from her husband, rather the facts of this case show\nthat she has been compelled by the husband himself to leave the\nmatrimonial house. As regards contention of the appellant that the\nmarriage between him and the respondent has irretrievably broken\ndown, we still hope that good sense shall prevail over the appellant,\nkeeping in view the fact that he has two children out of this wedlock,\nand he shall not allow their future to be compromised due to\ndifferences between him and his wife. At the place of taking the\nextreme step of annulling the marriage between them, we would prefer\nto give more time to the appellant to ponder over future of his children\nand to reunite his family for a blissful living together. We are also\nconscious of the fact that irretrievable breakdown of marriage is still\nnot a ground for dissolution of marriage under \nSection 13\n of the Hindu\nMarriage Act, even though way back in the year 1985, the Apex Court\nin \nJorden Diengdeh Vs. S.S. Chopra\n, reported in (1985) 3 SCC 62,\nexpressed its views as follows:-\n\n \"7. It is thus seen that the law relating to judicial\n separation, divorce and nullity of marriage is far, far from\n uniform. Surely the time has now come for a complete\n reform of the law of marriage and make a uniform law\n applicable to all people irrespective of religion or caste. It\n appears to be necessary to introduce irretrievable\n breakdown of marriage and mutual consent as grounds of\n divorce in all cases. The case before us is an illustration of a\n case where the parties are bound together by a marital tie\n which is better untied. There is no point or purpose to be\n served by the continuance of a marriage which has so\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n -9-\n\n completely and signally broken down. We suggest that the\n time has come for the intervention of the legislature in these\n matters to provide for a uniform code of marriage and\n divorce and to provide by law for a way out of the unhappy\n situations in which couples like the present have found\n themselves in. We direct that a copy of this order may be\n forwarded to the Ministry of Law and Justice for such action\n as they may deem fit to take. In the mean while, let notice go\n to the respondents.\"\n\n19. From pleading of the parties and the evidence on record,\nit appears that the husband wants to get rid of his wife as it is evident\nfrom Exhibit-A, i.e., petition for mutual divorce which has been sent\nto the wife after signing by the husband. Exhibit-B, letter dated\n30.07.2010 which has been sent to the father-in-law by the husband\nalso suggests that he wants to get rid of his wife by hook and crook.\nLord Denning, L.J. in Kaslefsky v. Kaslefsky [(1950)] 2 All ER 398;\n403] observed as under:\n\n \"If the door of cruelty were opened too wide, we should\n soon find ourselves granting divorce for incompatibility of\n temperament. This is an easy path to tread, especially in\n undefended cases. The temptation must be resisted lest we\n slip into a state of affairs where the institution of marriage\n itself is imperiled.\"\n\n20. Be that as it may, the allegation of cruelty as alleged by\nthe husband has not been proved by placing any cogent evidence on\nrecord and as such this ground has to fail and accordingly this point\nhas been decided in favour of the respondent-wife and against the\nappellant-husband, which we hereby, affirm.\n\n21. So far as point of desertion is concerned, it is admitted\nposition between the parties that they are living separately since\n12.07.2014. The argument of the appellant-husband is that living\nseparately itself is sufficient in the eyes of law for granting divorce,\nwhich is not acceptable. \nSection 13(1)\n(i-b) of the \nHindu Marriage Act\n,\nis quoted hereinunder:-\n\n \"(ib) has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of\n not less than two years immediately preceding the\n presentation of the petition; or\n *** *** ***\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n - 10 -\n\n Explanation. --In this sub-section, the expression\n \"desertion\" means the desertion of the petitioner by the\n other party to the marriage without reasonable cause and\n without the consent or against the wish of such party, and\n includes the wilful neglect of the petitioner by the other\n party to the marriage, and its grammatical variations and\n cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly.\n\n22. From perusal of the above section, it is evident that\ncommand of law is clear that desertion has to be voluntary. In the\npresent case, the wife has been driven out of her matrimonial home\nand she is still willing to live in her matrimonial home as it is evident\nfrom the fact that she has participated in the marriage of younger\nbrother of her husband on 07.05.2017 at village of her husband and\nthe compromises by her in the criminal cases in order to secure bail\nfor the appellant. Further the entire sequence of fact suggests that\nhusband is desirous to get rid of his wife and on so many occasions, he\nhad to take her back only after compromise and on the dictum of\npanchayati.\n\n23. It is also settled principle of law that nobody can take\nbenefit of his own fault. If the contention of the appellant-husband is\naccepted then the very purpose of the law will be defeated. Any\nhusband desirous to get rid of his wife may get desired result by\ndriving out his wife from matrimonial home by force or creating a\nsituation and thereafter taking plea of desertion for more than two\nyears. The law is clear that if one of the parties to the matrimonial\nhome, voluntary and without any plausible explanation has left the\nmatrimonial home giving no option to the other party, then it amounts\nto desertion. Desertion is a willful and voluntary act by the party to\nleave something without any rational reason. In the present case,\nhusband is at fault and this is the reason for separate living of both the\nparties.\n\n24. In view of the finding recorded by us, the appellant-\nhusband is not entitled for decree of divorce on the ground of\ndesertion for more than two years.\n\n25. As both the points have been decided against the\nappellant-husband, the appeal fails and accordingly it is dismissed.\nThe Judgment dated 05.10.2018 and Decree of dismissal dated\n\n F.A. No. 47 of 2019\n\n - 11 -\n\n 28.11.2018 passed in Original Suit No.174 of 2016 by Principal Judge\n Family Court, Giridih, are, hereby, affirmed.\n\n 26. Office is directed to prepare the decree accordingly.\n\n 27. In the facts of the present case and considering the\n conduct of the parties it is held that wife is entitled for cost of\n litigation which is quantified to Rs.20,000/- (Twenty Thousand),\n which must be paid within two months from the date of the decree.\n\n 28. With above observations and directions, the present\n appeal is, hereby, dismissed.\n\n (Rajesh Kumar, J)\n\nH.C. Mishra, J.:-\n\n (H.C.
