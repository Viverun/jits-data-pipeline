The petitioner\n\nby way of this writ petition has challenged his discharge from Air Force\n\nprematurely. It is submitted that had he not been illegally discharged, he\n\nwould have continued in service and would have served upto 58 years and\n\nwould have been entitled to receive regular pension. He prayed that he\n\nshould be granted regular pension deeming him continue in service after\n\nsetting aside the order of his discharge.\n\n2. The petitioner has also prayed for quashing of the order dated\n\n07.04.2014 passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (for\n\nshort, 'AFT'), whereby his OA was rejected. He further prayed for\n\nquashing of orders dated 25.02.1972 and 22.09.2010, which were\n\nchallenged by him before the AFT.\n\n 1 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:43 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -2-\n\n3. Initially the issue before this Court was with regard to the\n\nmaintainability of the writ petition against the order passed by the AFT.\n\nHowever, keeping in view the judgment passed in Civil Appeal No. 447\n\nof 2023 - Union of India and others vs Parashotam Dass ; 2023(3) SLR\n\n1, decided on 21.03.2023, wherein the writ petitions were held to be\n\nmaintainable against the order passed by the AFT and the cases were\n\nremanded to the respective High Courts for adjudication on merits, the\n\nquestion of maintainability is no more required to be examined and,\n\ntherefore, all the writ petitions were directed to be heard independently\n\nwhich had different issues. Thereafter, the present case was taken up and\n\nthe petitioner in person and counsel for the respondents were heard.\n\n4. The petitioner was enrolled in the Indian Air Force as a\n\nregular Combatant Airmen in the trade of Radar Operator, Group-II. He\n\nwas thereafter attested to the Air Force after successful completion of\n\ntraining on 10.12.1964 in Operational 43 Signal Unit A.F. He was\n\npromoted to the substantive rank of Corporal (CPL) on 27.12.1976 and\n\nwas further promoted to the rank of Sergeant with effect from 25.09.1969.\n\nAfter having appeared and qualifying the examination, he was further\n\npromoted to the rank of Flight Sergeant. He actively participated in the\n\ntwo Indo-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971. During this service tenure, it is\n\nstated that he had successfully passed the Orientation Course as Radar\n\nOperator Specialist and had been awarded First Rate of Good Conduct\n\nBadge and Second Rate Good Conduct Badge on 27.12.1966 and\n\n27.12.1970, respectively. It is stated that the petitioner had been awarded\n\nwith several other medals and decorations including Raksha Medal,\n\n 2 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -3-\n\nSamar Sewa Star Medal and 9 years Long Service Medal and two distinct\n\nmedals of 1971 war. The petitioner, thus, submitted that he had completed\n\n9 years service on 26.12.1971 whereafter he was retained in service,\n\nhowever, was discharged without any reason on 28.03.1972. The\n\npetitioner submitted that he had requested his AOC to allow him to\n\ncontinue serving regularly till completion of 15 years engagement but his\n\nrequest was not examined and remained unheard.\n\n5. The petitioner has submitted that he was governed by the Air\n\nForce Instructions 12/S/48 (hereinafter to be referred as \"AFI\") as per the\n\namended terms and conditions of service of Regular Airmen of the I.A.F.\n\nThe said A.F.Is. have been amended from time to time. As per the list, the\n\nlast amendments were made in July, 1969. The terms and conditions of\n\nservice of Regular Airmen of the I.A.F. provided that in future they would\n\nbe governed by the conditions as laid down therein. The relevant extract\n\nof AFI reads as under:-\n\n \"12.

The\n\npetitioner further submits that he had, after being enrolled, further\n\npromoted twice upto to the rank of Sergeant. He had also been continuing\n\nafter 9 years of service, however, he was discharged without giving any\n\nreason vide order dated 09.02.1972.\n\n6.

The petitioner has further submitted that as per Rule 13\n\nClause (ii) of the \nAir Force Act\n and Rules 1932, the discharge order was\n\nbad in law which states that the discharge under Rule 13 (ii) is at his own\n\nrequest on fulfilling the conditions of enrolment and that the Commanding\n\nOfficer is the competent authority to discharge him, however, as the\n\npetitioner never submitted his request to be discharged, the order passed\n\n 6 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -7-\n\nby the Commanding Officer was without jurisdiction and he was\n\nincompetent to discharge him. It is submitted that the petitioner has sent\n\nseveral representations and also sent notice through his lawyer after he\n\ncould not receive any positive reply from the Air Force Authorities. He\n\nalso sent a petition under \nSection 26\n of the Air Force Act, 1950 to the\n\nChief of the Air Staff on 27.06.2003 claiming service pension. However,\n\nthe Air Force Officers have shown indifferent attitude. The petitioner\n\nsubmitted that once his service was extended, he can be deemed to be\n\ncontinued in service for 15 years as he fulfills the other conditions\n\nrequired for extension. The Air Force Command Officer had issued a\n\ntrade proficiency certificate to the petitioner dated 26.03.1972 at the time\n\nof discharge. It is submitted that upto 6 years after discharge, the\n\npetitioner remained in reserve service and he, therefore, after having\n\ncompleted his reserve service also submitted an application for setting\n\naside the discharge and, thus, he was always continuing with his claim and\n\nit cannot be said that the petitioner had put up a stale old claim.\n\n8. The petitioner submitted that as a defence personnel, he had\n\nmaintained discipline and was always expecting that his superiors to take\n\ndecision with regard to his case and it is only after many years when\n\nnothing happened, he approached the counsel, an Ex-Army Officer, who\n\ntook up his claim and made a representation. The Air Force Record\n\nOfficer vide letter dated 29.07.2003 rejected the case of the petitioner for\n\npension relying on Regulation 121 of the Pension Regulations under the\n\nAir Force Act\n 1961, which require 15 years of qualifying service to earn\n\nservice pension. Other representations were sent by him through his\n\n 7 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -8-\n\ncounsel on 26.06.2004 and 22.07.2010, which were rejected by the Air\n\nForce Headquarter vide letter dated 22.09.2010 reiterating their stand that\n\nthe pension can only be earned on minimum service of 15 years. It was\n\nalso pointed out that the personal file of the petitioner had been destroyed\n\nby the Board of Officers after retention of stipulated period of 25 years.\n\nThe petitioner submitted that the Armed Forces Tribunal, Kolkata, in one\n\ncase allowed a person, who had completed 9 years regular service and was\n\ncalled during emergency situation and rendered 1 year 135 days while he\n\nwas in the reserve list, to be treated to have completed 15 years of service\n\nby counting 9 year regular service plus 6 years reserve service. The\n\nArmed Forces Tribunal Kolkata had relied on a judgment passed by\n\nKerala High Court in the order passed in \nAsim Majumdar vs Union of\n\nIndia\n in TA No. 13/2010 arising out of Writ Petition No. 8971 of 2009\n\nfiled before the Calcutta High Court.\n\n9. The petitioner submitted that AFT, Chandigarh has\n\nwrongfully dismissed his OA and denied the benefit to him without\n\nexamining the issue relating to the wrongful discharge.\n\n10. Per contra, counsel appearing for the respondents-Union of\n\nIndia submitted that as the record of the petitioner was not available, it is\n\nnot possible for the respondents to make submissions relating to the order\n\nof discharge. It is further submitted that the petitioner has preferred the\n\npetition and put up his claim after a delay of almost 28 years, whereas the\n\nrecord of the petitioner was destroyed as per rules. Further it is submitted\n\nthat as the petitioner was discharged with no requirement of reserve\n\n 8 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -9-\n\nservice, he cannot claim the benefit of 6 years' reserve service and\n\npension accordingly. It is submitted that AFT has rightly rejected the case\n\nof the petitioner.\n\n11. The respondents have also filed their written statement and\n\nsubmitted that as per \nRegulation 121\n of Pension Regulations for the Air\n\nForce, 1961 (Part 1), the petitioner had not completed 15 years to earn\n\nservice pension and he was, therefore, only paid ` 2,402 on account of\n\nservice gratuity at the time of discharge. As per Rule 136 (a), reservist\n\npension could have been paid to a person who had completed 9 years\n\nregular service and 6 years reserve qualifying service but, in fact, the\n\npetitioner was not transferred to the reserve service and was, therefore, not\n\nbound to be recalled for active service and his claim for grant of reserve\n\npension was, therefore, not in conformity with the Pension Regulations of\n\nthe Air Force and his reserve service of 6 years cannot be counted to make\n\nhis pensionable service.\n\n12. It is further submitted that the petitioner filed OA after a\n\nperiod of 30 years when his record has already been destroyed. It is stated\n\nthat as per discharge order, he was discharged \"On fulfilling the conditions\n\nof engagement on completion of 09 years of engagement and not being\n\nrequired in regular service\". Thus, 6 years service cannot be counted and\n\nthe AFT has rightly rejected his claim.\n\n13. We have considered the submissions and the judgments cited\n\nat bar by the petitioner.\n\n 9 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -10-\n\n14. \nIn \nSohan Singh vs Union of India and another\n AIR 1984\n\nSC 498, Hon'ble the Supreme Court held as under:-\n\n \"4. On a careful consideration of the materials we are\n satisfied that the order of discharge of the appellant was\n passed mainly on the ground that the criminal case against\n the appellant was pending and the authority concerned was\n of the opinion that the appellant was likely to be convicted in\n that particular case. The materials on record clearly indicate\n that the pendency of the criminal case against the appellant\n and the possibility of the appellant being convicted of the\n said charges had greatly weighed with the authority and had\n influenced its decision in directing the discharge of the\n appellant. The note of the Commanding Officer re-\n commending discharge on the ground that the appellant was\n not suitable, records that 'the appellant was likely to be\n convicted'. We have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion\n that if the order of acquittal had been pronounced before the\n date of the order of discharge of the appellant, the authority\n concerned would have allowed the application for extension\n of the term of service of the appellant. If extension had been\n allowed, as in the normal course it would have been granted\n if the order of acquittal were there at the relevant time, the\n appellant would have been entitled to continue in service for\n a further period of six years in the usual course. Out of the\n said period of six years the appellant in view of the\n provisions of D.I. Rules had in fact served for a little over a\n year before he was actually discharged.\"\n\n15. \nIn \nWrit Petition No. 166 of 1990 - Nirvair Singh vs Union of\n\nIndia and others\n (2001 (3) CLR 442), Bombay High Court has examined\n\nthe case relating to the naval staff of Indian Navy and the issue was with\n\nregard to discharge orders passed on expiry of engagement. The Court\n\n 10 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -11-\n\nnoticed that the concerned petitioners were ready and willing to complete\n\ntheir 15 years of service but were discharged before they completes 15\n\nyears and held as under:-\n\n \"16. After the Apex Court's judgment, it is clear that the\n period during which the petitioners were employed as\n artificer apprentice is required to be computed for pension\n and gratuity. Further, as per circular dated 9th August 1976\n the Petitioners were required to be given chance of getting\n re-engagement for a limited period so that they can complete\n the qualifying service for pension. However, Petitioners were\n not permitted to complete 15 years of service and they were\n illegally discharged. The Petitioners also sought interim\n relief, but that was also opposed at that time on the ground\n that the main question was pending before the Apex Court.\n Hence, for no fault of the Petitioners and for the fault of the\n Respondents, the Petitioners were not permitted to complete\n 15 years of qualifying service. In such a situation, the only\n way which is open is to direct the Respondents to consider\n that the petitioners have completed the qualifying service of\n 15 years for the purpose of getting pensionary benefits, as the\n petitioners were not permitted to get reengagement for a\n limited period because of the wrongful insistence by the\n Respondents that they must accept re-engagement for a\n period of five years. Further, the Regulation itself empowers\n the Competent Authority to condone the deficiency in service\n for eligibility to service pension upto a period of six months.\n We would further note that in Writ Petition Nos. 166, 171,\n 221, 223 and 365, all of 1990, 268 and 312 of 1991, the\n seven Petitioners would have completed 15 years of service if\n their service prior to attaining the age of 17 years is taken\n into consideration. With regard to the remaining ten\n Petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 164,165, 168, 169, 170, 172,\n\n 11 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -12-\n\n 222, 224, 225 and 369, all of 1990, if their service prior to\n the age of 17 years is taken into consideration, they would\n have completed more than 14 years of service. If the said\n period is not taken into consideration, they have completed\n more than 13 years and 6 months of service or 14' years and\n few days in some cases. For the aforesaid reasons, it is\n directed that the Petitioners be considered to be in service for\n a period of 15 years for the purpose of getting pensionary\n benefits as at this stage, after lapse of 8 years, it would not be\n proper to direct the Petitioners to serve the Navy for the\n remaining period by opting re-engagement for one year or\n few months more.\"\n\n16. The Larger Bench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in \nDeokinandan\n\nPrasad vs The State of Bihar and others\n AIR 1971 SC 1409, held that\n\nright to pension is property in terms of \nArticle 19 (1)(f)\n and \n31 (1)\n of the\n\nConstitution of India and right to pension flows from the Rules and not the\n\norder granting pension. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the aforesaid case\n\nheld as under:-\n\n \"28. The respondents have not taken up the position that the\n officers like the petitioner are not entitled to pension. A\n reference to Rule 5 of the Pension Rules shows that the\n officers mentioned therein are entitled to pension. There is no\n controversy that the petitioner is an officer in the Education\n Department of the Bihar 'Education Service. It is item No. 3\n of the Schedule to Rule 5. Rule 42 declares that every pension\n shall be held to have been granted Subject to the conditions\n contained in Chapter VIII. It is not the case of the\n respondents that Chapter VIII which applies to re-\n employment of pensioners, has any relevancy to the case on\n hand. We have already referred to Rule 46. Under that rule a\n Government servant dismissed or removed for misconduct,\n\n 12 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\nCWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -13-\n\n insolvency or 'inefficiency is not eligible for pension. But that\n rule clearly contemplates that action by way of dismissal or\n removal in respect of the three matters mentioned therein has\n already taken place according to law. The bar under Rule 46\n will operate only when the conditions mentioned therein are\n satisfied. In fact the consequences envisaged under the rule\n flow from the action already taken. Rule 129 provides for the\n payment of superannuation pension to a Government servant\n entitled or compelled by the rules to retire at a particular\n age. Rule 134 clarifies the payment of retirement pension to a\n Government servant permitted to retire after completing\n qualifying service for 30 years or any such less time as may\n for any special class of Government servants be prescribed.\n Rule 135 provides for Government servants mentioned in\n Rule 5 to be entitled on their resignation being accepted to a\n retiring pension after completing qualifying service of not\n less than 25 years. Rule 146 provides the scale of pension for\n Government servants mentioned in Rule 5. We have only\n referred to some of the important rules to show that the\n payment of pension does not depend upon the discretion of\n the State; but, on the other hand, payment of pension is\n governed by the Rules and a Government servant coming\n Within the Rules is entitled to claim pension. The order dated\n June 12, 1968 has to be quashed in view of the fact that the\n foundation for the said order is the one based on the order\n dated August 5, 1966, which has been quashed by us. When\n the order dated August 5, 1966 can no longer survive, the\n order dated June 12, 1968 quite naturally falls to the ground.\n\n The last question to be considered, is, whether the right to\n receive pension by a Government servant is property, so as to\n attract \nArticles 19(1)(f)\n and \n31(1)\n of the Constitution. This\n question falls to be decided in order to consider whether the\n writ petition is maintainable under \nArticle 32.\n To this aspect,\n\n 13 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -14-\n\n we have already adverted to earlier and we now proceed to\n consider the same.\"\n\n17. In K. R. Erry vs State of Punjab ILR 1967(1) Punjab &\n\nHaryana 278, Full Bench of this Court held as under:-\n\n \"I am inclined to take the view that the right to\n superannuation pension--including its amount--is a valuable\n right vesting in a Government servant, and before that right\n is prejudicially affected, he is entitled to a notice to show\n cause against the proposed cut: such appears to me to be the\n scheme of the Rules read as a whole. The fact that a right of\n appeal has been conferred on an aggrieved Government\n servant in this respect would seem to lend additional support\n to this View. I do not find it easy on any rational ground to\n deny generally speaking to an aggrieved party a right of\n hearing before the original authority in a cause in which he\n is given the right of appeal.\"\n\n18. \nIn \nChet Singh vs State of Punjab\n AIR 1977 (SC) 1494, it\n\nwas held as under:-\n\n \n\"4. The proviso to \nSection 42\n lays down that notice to\n interested parties to appear and opportunity to be heard are\n conditions precedent to passing of an order under \nSection 42\n.\n The fact that the Additional Director was satisfied that the\n respondent did not have an opportunity of being heard due to\n his illness, seems to us to amount to a finding that the proviso\n could not be complied with so that the previous order could\n not be held to be an order duly passed under \nSection 42\n of\n the Act. It could be ignored as \"non est\". The view taken in\n \nHarbhajan Singh\n's case (supra) would not apply to the\n instant case although \nSection 42\n of the Act, does not contain\n\n 14 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -15-\n\n a power of review. Orders which are \"non est\" can be\n ignored at any stage.\"\n\n19. \nIn \nAjit Singh vs Union of India and others\n Law Finder Doc\n\nId# 4605 Delhi High Court observed that discharge could not be sustained\n\nunder Rule 13 passed by the Commanding Officer as there was no consent\n\ngiven by him. The relevant extract reads as under:-\n\n \"5. On a perusal of the Petitioner's Certificate of Service,\n it is evident that he was Discharged by order of the\n Commandant AMC Centre, Lucknow, in consequence of his\n erroneous assumption of the Petitioner's \"completion of the\n terms of engagement under Army Rule 13(iii)(i) after serving\n 12 years, 226 days with the Colours and 2 years and 315\n days in the Reserve (non-qualifying service included)\". His\n character is stated to be good. The Petitioner's services were\n neither terminated nor was he released on medical grounds.\n This responsibility and all ensuing repercussions of the\n mistake in the Discharge must be borne by the Respondents,\n since the Petitioner did not play any role in it. As far as he\n was concerned, he would have continued in service till he\n was forty years of age. It would be inequitable to hold\n otherwise since the Petitioner had admittedly given the best\n years of his life to the service of the Army Medical Corps.\n Having done so his legitimate expectation i.e. for receiving\n pension and other retrial benefits must be protected. This\n right which he has earned cannot be extinguished or diluted\n by stating that even if the time served by him as a \"Boy\n Recruit\" is taken into consideration, he would still not fulfill\n the minimum period of service requisite for grant of pension\n etc. It would also not make the slightest difference that\n during the period in which he was permitted to save in the\n Army Medical Corps, 380 days could not be taken into\n\n 15 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -16-\n\n consideration for the non-qualifying service period. The\n simple answer is that the Petitioner would have willingly\n served if not till he had attained the age of forty years, but at\n least till he had served for the qualifying years, i.e., 15 years\n of service together with the 380 days which in his case are\n stated by the Respondent to be 'non-qualifying'. Had the\n Respondents not Discharged the Petitioner in the mistaken\n understanding of his having completed the terms of\n engagement, he could have challenged the Respondents'\n unilateral decision of Discharge as being contrary to any\n provision of the \nArmy Act\n or Army Rules. As has already\n been mentioned above, his services were neither terminated\n nor was he discharged on medical ground. The Respondents'\n decision is clearly detrimental to his interests and punitive in\n character since he would stand to lose his right for receipt of\n pension. A punishment can be inflicted only in strict\n compliance of the statutory provisions.\"\n\n20. A look at the order of discharge as quoted above reflects that\n\nthe petitioner had been discharged by applying Rule 13 (ii) of the General\n\nStatutory Rules and Orders of Air Force and it would be apposite to quote\n\nrelevant extract of Rule 13, which is as under:-\n\n \"13. Authorities empowered to authorize discharge. - The\n authorities specified in column 3 of the table below shall be the\n authorities competent, in respect of the persons specified in column\n 1 and for the causes and in the manner specified in columns 2 and 4\n respectively, to discharge from the service persons subject to the\n Act. Any power conferred by this rule on any authority may be\n exercised by any higher authority.\n\n Class Cause of discharge Competent Special Instructions\n authority to\n authorise discharge\n Officers of the All causes of The Governor A notification in the Official\n Indian Air discharge General in Council Gazette of the retirement of an\n\n 16 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -17-\n\n Force officer, the relinquishment of\n his commission etc. shall be\n deemed to be a discharge\n within the meaning of sub-\n section (2) of \nsection 2\n of the\n Act.\n Persons (i) At his own Commanding To be carried out in\n enrolled under request on transfer Officer accordance with the\n the Act who to the pension conditions of enrolment and\n have been establishment. with \nsection 17\n of the Act and\n attested. (ii) At his own Commanding Rule 10.\n request on Officer\n fulfilling the Ditto\n conditions of his\n enrolment.\n\nThus, the Commanding Officer in terms of Rule 13(ii) discharged the\n\nperson enrolled under the Act, who have been attested at his own request\n\non transfer to the pension establishment or on fulfilling the conditions of\n\nhis enrolment or having been found medically unfit for further service.\n\nMerely because a person who fulfills the conditions of enrolment, he\n\ncannot be discharged by the Commanding Officer without there being a\n\nrequest. Keeping in view the specific admitted stand that the petitioner\n\nhad not made any request for being discharged on fulfilling the conditions\n\nof enrollment, the order passed on 09.02.1972 is found to be illegal.\n\n21. We also find that as per AFI (supra) the Officer was required\n\nto take a decision on completion of 9 years service whether to continue as\n\nan individual. It is an admitted position that the services of the petitioner\n\nhave been extended after 9 years for a further period from 27.12.1971 to\n\n28.03.1972 i.e. 93 days. The sanction for extension has been given on the\n\nday when the decision was taken to discharge him. As per AFI (supra),\n\nonce an extension has been given, the same would be for a period of 6\n\nyears, that is till he completes 15 years of service. There is no provision\n\nfor extension of service for 93 days alone.\n\n 17 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -18-\n\n22. This Court also noticed that the petitioner completed 9 years\n\nof service on 26.12.1971 when the 1971 war was in force and it appears\n\nthat only after the emergency was lifted that the petitioner has been\n\ndischarged in 1972. In the opinion of this Court, orders could not have\n\nbeen passed to the detriment and disadvantage of a defence personnel in a\n\nmanner that he is deprived of his pension.\n\n23. From the perusal of the judgments, which have been quoted\n\nhereinabove, it is apparent that pension has to be treated as a personal\n\nright of an individual for the service which he rendered with the State.\n\nOnce the rules provide for granting benefit of 6 years as reserve service\n\nand 9 years as regular service (before the AFI came into operation) i.e.\n\nJuly, 1969, a defence personnel was entitled to continue in service upto 15\n\nyears after the AFI came into operation with existing service of defence\n\npersonnel to be allowed to continue after 9 years upto 15 years provided\n\nthey have been atleast promoted to the post of Corporal. It does not sound\n\nto reason to deprive the petitioner, who had been promoted to the rank of\n\nSergeant, to be given the benefit of 15 years of pensionable service for the\n\npurpose of qualifying service.\n\n24. We would not, therefore, look into or examine the reasons for\n\ndenying continuity to the petitioner upto 15 years in the absence of record\n\nwhich is stated to have already been burnt/ destroyed. But at the same\n\ntime considering that the petitioner had already been promoted to the post\n\nof Sergeant and no reasons are coming forward in the order discharging\n\nhim after he had put in more than 9 years of service, we hold him to be\n\n 18 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -19-\n\nentitled to the benefit of complete 15 years of service for the purpose of\n\npension alone. Denying him the right of reservist pension is also found to\n\nbe without any reason as held by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in \nSohan\n\nSingh\n's case (supra). The petitioner was required to be treated for the\n\npurpose of reserve service and we find that after he completed 9 years, he\n\nwas allowed to be continued till emergency was lifted. In view thereof, the\n\nbenefit was required to be given to him.\n\n25. The question now arises whether he has to be given reservist\n\npension or his period of service deemed to be of 15 years ?\n\n26. In the opinion of this Court and in view of the fact that the\n\nrecord is not available and the petitioner has approached this Court\n\nbelatedly and we have decided not to examine the question relating to the\n\nextension of service of the petitioner after he completed 9 years and 93\n\ndays but at the same time we have also held the order of discharge to be\n\nillegal and contrary to the provisions of Rule 13 (ii) of the Rules and hold\n\nthat the Commanding Officer could not have discharged him, he would be\n\nentitled to all consequential benefits as he was in continuous service. His\n\ndischarge order having been quashed, he would be entitled to full pension\n\non completion of his full service on attaining the age of 58 years. The\n\norder passed by the AFT is found to be laconic. It has failed to examine\n\nthe main issue and has only dealt on the issue relating to reservist pension.\n\nSince the order of discharge dated 09.02.1972 itself is found to be void ab\n\ninitio and non est, having been passed by an officer who was incompetent\n\nto pass the same there being no consent on the part of the petitioner for\n\n 19 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -20-\n\ndischarge, the orders passed by the AFT is found to be not sustainable in\n\nlaw and the same is set aside.\n\n27. In view of the above and taking into consideration that denial\n\nof pension also takes away the Fundamental Right of the petitioner, we do\n\nnot deem it appropriate to remand the matter to the AFT at this stage and\n\ndirect the Union of India to release the pension of the petitioner\n\nconsidering him to have served the Air Force on the post of Sergeant upto\n\nthe age of 58 years. Accordingly, his pension shall be calculated by\n\nnotional calculation of his salary and he would be entitled to pension from\n\nthe date he attained the age of 58 years. No arrears of salary shall be paid\n\nto him for the period he deemed to be in service as he had actually not\n\nperformed his duties for the said purpose. The pension, however, shall be\n\nactually calculated and paid with all arrears from the date the petitioner\n\ncompletes 58 years. The other retiral benefits shall also be paid to him\n\nafter deducting the gratuity amount which had already paid to him. No\n\ninterest would be payable on the aforesaid amount as the petitioner has\n\napproached this Court belatedly and scales of justice would, therefore, be\n\nweighed equally by not awarding interest on the arrears of pension.\n\n28. The exercise shall be conducted within a period of four\n\nweeks by the Defence Accounts Section on the basis of documents which\n\nhave been placed before this Court. The petitioner shall make available\n\nthe documents which he has in his possession relating to his service to the\n\nDefence Accounts Section and the pension shall not be denied merely\n\nbecause records of the petitioner have been destroyed.\n\n 20 of 21\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 23-04-2024 22:46:44 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:052666-DB\n CWP No. 17312 of 2014 2024:PHHC:052666-DB -21-\n\n 29.

On a careful consideration of the materials we are\n satisfied that the order of discharge of the appellant was\n passed mainly on the ground that the criminal case against\n the appellant was pending and the authority concerned was\n of the opinion that the appellant was likely to be convicted in\n that particular case. The materials on record clearly indicate\n that the pendency of the criminal case against the appellant\n and the possibility of the appellant being convicted of the\n said charges had greatly weighed with the authority and had\n influenced its decision in directing the discharge of the\n appellant. The note of the Commanding Officer re-\n commending discharge on the ground that the appellant was\n not suitable, records that 'the appellant was likely to be\n convicted'. We have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion\n that if the order of acquittal had been pronounced before the\n date of the order of discharge of the appellant, the authority\n concerned would have allowed the application for extension\n of the term of service of the appellant. If extension had been\n allowed, as in the normal course it would have been granted\n if the order of acquittal were there at the relevant time, the\n appellant would have been entitled to continue in service for\n a further period of six years in the usual course.

After the Apex Court's judgment, it is clear that the\n period during which the petitioners were employed as\n artificer apprentice is required to be computed for pension\n and gratuity. Further, as per circular dated 9th August 1976\n the Petitioners were required to be given chance of getting\n re-engagement for a limited period so that they can complete\n the qualifying service for pension. However, Petitioners were\n not permitted to complete 15 years of service and they were\n illegally discharged. The Petitioners also sought interim\n relief, but that was also opposed at that time on the ground\n that the main question was pending before the Apex Court.\n Hence, for no fault of the Petitioners and for the fault of the\n Respondents, the Petitioners were not permitted to complete\n 15 years of qualifying service. In such a situation, the only\n way which is open is to direct the Respondents to consider\n that the petitioners have completed the qualifying service of\n 15 years for the purpose of getting pensionary benefits, as the\n petitioners were not permitted to get reengagement for a\n limited period because of the wrongful insistence by the\n Respondents that they must accept re-engagement for a\n period of five years. Further, the Regulation itself empowers\n the Competent Authority to condone the deficiency in service\n for eligibility to service pension upto a period of six months.\n We would further note that in Writ Petition Nos. 166, 171,\n 221, 223 and 365, all of 1990, 268 and 312 of 1991, the\n seven Petitioners would have completed 15 years of service if\n their service prior to attaining the age of 17 years is taken\n into consideration.
