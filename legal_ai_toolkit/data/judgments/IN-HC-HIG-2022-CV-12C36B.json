JUSTICE S. KUMAR\nCAV JUDGMENT\n(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)\n\nDate : 11-05-2022\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n2/38\n\nThe following questions arise for consideration in the\n\ninstant writ petition:-\n\n1. Whether denial of earned remuneration and post retiral\nbenefits constitute an infringement of the right to life\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India?\n2. Whether the acts of the State in delaying the\ndisbursement of retiral benefits can be countenanced\ngiven the established notion of the State as a Model\nEmployer?\n3. Whether a case is made out for punitive\ndamages/heavy cost in the instant set of facts in light\nof the inordinate lapses?\n4. Whether the State is obligated to constitute an\neffective grievance redressal mechanism with respect\nto payment of legitimate dues of a salaried employee,\nincluding pension and other post retiral benefits, to\nensure that earned dues are disbursed on time?\nFACTS\n\n2. The petitioner namely Lilawati Mishra (referred to as\n\nthe petitioner) is the wife of late Shri Krishna Kumar Mishra\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the employee), whose salary in arrear\n\nand non-disbursement of retiral benefits are the subject of this\n\npetition.\n\n3. The employee was appointed as a Temporary Estimator\n\non 05.12.1961 and joined the office of Superintending Engineer\n\nChhotanagpur Circle. After a series of internal and\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n3/38\n\ninterdepartmental postings in several districts such as the office\n\nof Executive Engineer, Ranchi Division, Rajendra Agriculture\n\nCollege, Pusa, etc., he was promoted to the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer in1994 and was to join the office of Executive\n\nEngineer, Advance Planning Division, Munger Road\n\nConstruction Department, but since his joining was not\n\naccepted, was ultimately allowed to retire on 31.12.1996,\n\nwithout getting such posting.\n\n4. The first communication with respect to payment of\n\narrears of salary, pension and post retiral benefits was to the\n\nEngineer-in-Chief-cum-Secretary, Rural Engineering\n\nOrganization, Patna, Bihar, on 04.01.1997. Since then, letters to\n\nmany of the respondents were written by the employee during\n\nhis lifetime and by the petitioner (annexed with the petition).\n\nSuch letter, Annexure-2 to the writ petition, contains details of\n\nsalary arrears totalling ten years, nine months and 13 days.\n\n5. It is to be noted that even before superannuation of the\n\nemployee, a letter was written by the then Executive Engineer,\n\nRural Engineering Organization, Works Division, Ranchi to\n\nEngineer-in-chief-cum-Additional Commissioner-cum-Special\n\nSecretary, Rural Engineering Organization, Bihar Patna\n\n(Annexure-3 to the writ petition) putting onto paper the various\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n4/38\n\nperiods for which the employee was not paid his earned\n\nremuneration. Further requesting the concerning authority to\n\ninitiate said payment, keeping in view the approaching date of\n\nsuperannuation, i.e. 31.12.1996.\n\n6. A number of inter-departmental communications were\n\nundertaken to verify the papers, service book etc., of the\n\nemployee, which, according to the petitioner, stood already\n\nsubmitted, but to no avail. Such facts evident from Annexure 9\n\ndated 18.01.2011, Page-45, remain uncontroverted by the State.\n\nThe last pay certificate and other related documents were also\n\nsent to the Executive Engineer, Works Division, Ranchi, on\n\n17.01.2011.\n. The further representation made on 07.04.2011\n\n(Annexure-11, page-47) resulted in other interdepartmental\n\ncommunications. On 01.04.2013, another representation was\n\nmade before respondent no.5 herein (Annexure-20, page-60),\n\nbut despite all these communications, no resolution of their\n\ndemands/needs were forthcoming.\n\n8. Ultimately, the employee died in 2017, not receiving\n\nany of the amounts due to him.\n\n9. This writ petition was filed on 06.03.2021 for a writ of\n\nmandamus to the respondents' authorities for payment of retiral\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n5/38\n\nbenefits and arrears in salary and interest.\n\n10. The delay in filing the writ petition has not escaped\n\nthis Court. However, in light of the attending facts, it cannot\n\nimpede the petition's adjudication on merits.\n\n11. A counter affidavit has been filed, noticeably after\n\nconsiderable delay by respondent no.6, namely Deputy\n\nSecretary, Road Construction Department, Government of\n\nBihar, Patna, on behalf of the State on 25.04.2022. In such\n\ncounter affidavit, it is stated that all possible efforts are being\n\ntaken for the redressal of grievance of retiral dues of the\n\ndeceased employee. Prior to the filing of this writ petition, the\n\nlast communication was 01.11.2013 by the Secretary, Road\n\nConstruction Department, Government of Bihar to the Principal\n\nSecretary, Rural Works Department, Jharkhand, Ranchi,\n\nrequesting to make available the complete pension papers along\n\nwith no dues certificate of the employee (Annexure-A to the\n\ncounter affidavit).\n\n12. Further explaining the delay, subsequently, a series of\n\ndepartmental memos were issued and one such being dated\n\n27.10.2021 to the Accountant General, Bihar, Patna, seeking a\n\nreport regarding the issuance of an authorization letter of\n\npension/gratuity of the deceased employee. Also to the in charge\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n6/38\n\nofficer, Finance (D.C.F.C.), Department, Patna, regarding\n\nissuance of sanction letter of utilized earned leave of the\n\ndeceased employee; and to the Executive Engineer, Rural Works\n\nDepartment, Works Division, Ranchi to supply duly filled\n\npension papers, service history, last pay record, departmental no\n\ndues certificate, housing no dues certificate and duly filled up\n\nform for withdrawal of G.P.F. along with relevant information of\n\nGroup Insurance Amount. A similar memo for documents was\n\nsent to the Executive Engineer, Region Survey Advance\n\nDivision, Road Construction Department, Munger.\n\n13. Attempting, with the above issued memos, to show\n\nthe efforts being taken, it is prayed for on behalf of \"the State\"\n\nto \"dismiss the present writ petition\".\n\n14. The petitioner filed a response to the counter-affidavit\n\non 27.04.2022, annexing the service book, stating that the same\n\nto have been submitted to the relevant authority way back in the\n\nyear 2011 itself.\n\n15. It is also noted therein that the respondents have not\n\nmade any effort to deny the bonafide employment of the\n\npetitioner's late husband or his having served the State, thus\n\nentitling him to the dues in issue.\n\n16. Significantly, it is not the respondents' case that the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n7/38\n\nemployee in question was facing any inquiry/disciplinary\n\nproceedings; not diligent, or there being any other justifiable\n\nreasons for withholding the dues. Also, there is no dispute about\n\nthe amount and the period to which the employee is entitled to\n\nsalary; pension; gratuity; and all other admissible dues still\n\npayable.\n\nLAW\n\n17. The law with regard to pension, retiral dues has been\n\nlaid down in a number of cases by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.\n\nRight to a sum of money as salary and consequential dues\nis property under the Constitution of India\n\n18. A Five Judges Bench of the Apex Court in\nState of\n\nMadhya Pradesh v. Ranjojirao Shinde & another\n, AIR\n\n1968 SCC 1053, has observed:\n\n\"It is obvious that a right to a sum of money is\nproperty\"\n\n19. A Seven Judges Bench of the Apex Court in\n\nMadan Mohan Pathak and another v. Union of India and\n\nothers\n, (1978) 2 SCC 50 observed:\n\n\"... The right to pension was also regarded as property\nfor the purpose of\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nby the decisions of this\nCourt in\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n[(1971) 2\nSCC 330 : 1971 Supp SCR 634] and State of Punjab v. K.R.\nErry & Sobhag Rai Mehta [(1973) 1 SCC 120 : (1973) 2\nSCR 405] .\n\nThis Court adopted the same line of reasoning\nwhen it said in\nState of Gujarat v. Shri Ambica Mills Ltd.,\nAhmedabad\n[(1974) 4 SCC 656 : (1974) 3 SCR 760] (SCC,\np. 664, para 19) that\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n8/38\n\n\"unpaid accumulations represent the obligation of the\nemployers to the employees and they are the property of the\nemployees. Mathew, J., speaking on behalf of the Court,\nobserved that the obligation to the employees owed by the\nemployers was 'property from the standpoint of the\nemployees'.\"\n\nIt would, therefore, be seen that property within the\nmeaning of\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nand clause (2) of\nArticle 31\n\ncomprises every form of property, tangible or intangible,\nincluding debts and choses-in-action, such as unpaid\naccumulation of wages, pension, cash grant and\nconstitutionally protected Privy Purse. The debts due and\nowing from the Life Insurance Corporation in respect of\nannual cash bonus were, therefore, clearly property of Class\nIII and Class IV employees within the meaning of\nArticle\n, clause (2). And so also was their right to receive annual\ncash bonus for the period from the date of commencement\nof the impugned Act up to March 31, 1977, for that was a\nlegal right enforceable through a Court of law by issue of a\nwrit of mandamus. (Vide the observations of Hegde, J., at p.\n194 in the Privy Purse case.)\"\n\n20. Prior to the 44th Amendment of the Constitution,\n\nwhich led to the repeal of\nArticle 31\n, by virtue of the\n\nConstitution (44th\nAmendment) Act, 1978\n, a Constitution\n\nBench (Five Judges) of the Apex Court in\nBombay Dyeing &\n\nManufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bombay and others\n,\n\nAIR 1958 SC 328, held - unpaid wages of an employee, so\n\nearned by him, would become a debt due to him from the\n\nemployer and as such was a property which could be assigned\n\nunder the law. The observation was made in the context where,\n\nunder the provisions of the\nBombay Labour Welfare Fund Act\n,\n\nunclaimed accumulated wages of employees working with\n\nseveral private entities, stood transferred to a body constituted\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n9/38\n\nunder the said Act.\n\nThe context being different but the principle\n\nof the unpaid wage of an employee, so earned by him, is a\n\nproperty continued to be reiterated, even subsequently, by\n\nanother Constitution Bench (Five Judges) of the Apex Court in\n\nMaharana Shri Jayvantsinghji Ranmalsinghji v. The State\n\nof Gujarat and others\n, AIR 1962 SC 821.\n\n21. With repeal of\nArticle 31\n, right to property\n\ncontinued to remain as Constitutional Right, by virtue of\n\ninsertion of\nArticle 300A.\n\nArticle 21 -\nRight to life- Receipt of\nwages/salary/dues is one such facet.\n\n22. A Constitution Bench (Five Judges) of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in Olga Tellis and others v.\n\nBombay Municipal Corporation and others, (1985) 3\n\nSCC 545, has held that right to livelihood, which\n\nis comprehended in the right guaranteed by\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution, cannot be deprived, except according to the\n\nprocedure established by law.\n\n23. The principles\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in Olga\n\nTellis (supra), stand reiterated by a Constitution Bench (Nine\n\nJudges) in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) & another v.\n\nUnion of India and others, AIR 2017 SC 4161, in the\n\nfollowing terms:\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n10/38\n\n\"114.\nIn\nOlga Tellis v Bombay Municipal\nCorporation195, Chandrachud C J\n, while explaining\nthe ambit of\nArticle 21\nfound a rationale for\nprotecting the right to livelihood as an incident of\nthe right to life. For, as the Court held, deprivation of\nlivelihood would result in the abrogation of the right\nto life: \"148. The sweep of the right to life conferred by\n\nArticle 21\nis wide and far reaching. It does not mean\nmerely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as,\nfor example, by the imposition and execution of the death\nsentence, except according to procedure established by\nlaw. That is but one aspect of the right to life. An equally\nimportant facet of that right is the right to livelihood\nbecause, no person can live without the means of living,\nthat is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood\nis not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life,\nthe easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life\nwould be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the\npoint of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only\ndenude the 195 (1985) 3 SCC 545 PART I 111 life of its\neffective content and meaningfulness but it would make\nlife impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would\nnot have to be in accordance with the procedure\nestablished by law, if the right to livelihood is not\nregarded as a part of the right to life. That, which alone\nmakes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life\nliveable, must be deemed to be an integral component of\nthe right to life. Deprive a person of his right to\nlivelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life...\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n24.\nIn M/s\nShantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal\n\nTotame & others\n, (1990) 1 SCC 520, the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nheld:\n\n\"9. Basic needs of man have traditionally been\naccepted to be three - food, clothing and shelter. The right to\nlife is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take\nwithin its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the\nright to decent environment and a reasonable\naccommodation to live in. The difference between the need\nof an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in\nview. For the animal it is the bare protection of the body; for\na human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which\nwould allow him to grow in every aspect - physical, mental\nand intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring fuller\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n11/38\n\ndevelopment of every child. That would be possible only if\nthe child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that every\ncitizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable\nhouse but a reasonable home particularly for people in India\ncan even be mud-built thatched house or a mud-built fire-\nproof accommodation.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n25. That 'right to life' includes 'right to livelihood'\n\nstood settled way back in by a Constitution Bench of the\n\nApex Court in the year 1991.\nIn\nDelhi Transport Corporation\n\nv. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress & others\n, 1991 Supp(1)\n\nSCC 600, while dealing with the constitutional\n\nvalidity of Regulation 9(b) of the Delhi Road\n\nTransport Authority (Conditions of Appointment and\n\nService) Regulations, 1952, enabling the employer to\n\nterminate services of the employee by issuance of one\n\nmonth notice or payment in lieu thereof, the Court held that:\n\n\"262. The right to life includes right to livelihood.\nThe right to livelihood therefore cannot hang on to the\nfancies of individuals in authority. The employment is\nnot a bounty from them nor can its survival be at their\nmercy. Income is the foundation of many fundamental\nrights and when work is the sole source of income, the\nright to work becomes as much fundamental.\nFundamental rights can ill-afford to be consigned to the\nlimbo of undefined premises and uncertain applications.\nThat will be a mockery of them.\"\n\n\"316. ...It would, further, be held that right to public\nemployment which includes right to continued public\nemployment till the employee is superannuated as per\nrules or compulsorily retired or duly terminated in\naccordance with the procedure established by law is an\nintegral part of right to livelihood which in turn is an\nintegral facet of right to life assured by\nArt. 21\nof the\nConstitution. Any procedure prescribed to deprive such a\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n12/38\n\nright to livelihood or continued employment must be just,\nfair and reasonable procedure. In other words an\nemployee in a public employment also must not be\narbitrarily unjustly and unreasonably be deprived of\nhis/her livelihood which is ensured in continued\nemployment till it is terminated in accordance with just,\nfair and reasonable procedure...\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n26. It was further held that income is the foundation of\n\nmany fundamental rights and when work is the sole source of\n\nincome, the right to work becomes as much fundamental and\n\nfundamental rights can ill-afford to be consigned to the limbo\n\nof undefined premises and uncertain applications.\n\n27. That right to life, enshrined in\nArticle 21\n, would\n\ninclude right to livelihood, stood reiterated by the Apex\n\nCourt in\nD.K. Yadav v. J.M.A. Industries Ltd.\n, (1993) 3 SCC\n\n259, in the following terms:\n\n\"12. ...\nArticle 21\nclubs life with liberty, dignity of\nperson with means of livelihood without which the\nglorious content of dignity of person would be\nreduced to animal existence...\"\n\n28.\nIn\nChameli Singh & others v. State of U.P. &\n\nanother\n, (1996) 2 SCC 549 (Three Judges), the Apex Court\n\nobserved:\n\n\"8. ...Right to live guaranteed in any civilised\nsociety implies the right to food, water, decent\nenvironment, education medical care and shelter.\nThese are basic human rights known to any civilised\nsociety...\"\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n13/38\n\n29. A salaried person by and large depends upon\n\nincome from salary for his sustenance and sustenance of\n\nhis family and if he is not paid salary despite working for a long\n\nperiod, will it not affect his life and liberty? This amounts\n\nto denial of basic human rights of a citizen and would\n\nalso amount to deprivation of his life and liberty\n\nguaranteed to every citizen under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution. (\nProfessor Devendra Mishra v. University of Delhi\n,\n\n167 (2010) DLT 259).\n\n30. Income of a person is the cornerstone of many of his\n\nfundamental rights. This can be interpreted to mean that\n\nreceiving of income is a foundational feature of the Right\n\nto Livelihood. Thereby, it becomes obvious that a deprivation\n\nof income on part of the State directly violates the Right to Life\n\nunder\nArticle 21.\n\n31. The State through its inaction has thwarted self-\n\ndevelopment of the employees and his family who were\n\ndeprived of their hard earned money. After all, a man may use\n\nhis income for purposes other than the three basic needs which\n\nhave been mentioned in\nShantistar\n(supra). Thereby the state\n\nprevented the welfare of its own citizens which goes against the\n\ncore objectives of a welfare state like India.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n14/38\n\n32. There is multiplicity of legislations whereby the state\n\nhas imposed a duty on varied Departments to ensure that\n\ntheir employees enjoy a decent standard of living.\n\nProcedure for timely disbursement is prescribed and the\n\nemployee un-refutingly complied with the same. Therefore,\n\nwhen the State did not disburse the salaries to its employees\n\ndespite having the money in its coffers, money which was\n\nready to be disbursed, it was clearly engaging in practicing\n\ndouble standards.\n\n33. The State through its administrative inaction has\n\nclearly desecrated the dignity which is inherent in its employees.\n\nThereby, the State has also acted contrary to the provisions of\n\nChapter IV and Chapter IV A of the Constitution of India.\nIn\n\nSudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.\n,\n\n(1984) 3 SCC 369l, Hon'ble the Apex Court observed-\n\n\"16.\nArticle 37\nprovides that \"the provisions contained\nin Part IV -- Directive Principles of State Policy, shall not\nbe enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid\ndown are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of\nthe country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply\nthese principles in making laws\".\nArticle 41\nprovides that\n\"the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity\nand development, make effective provision for securing\nthe right to work, to education and to public assistance in\ncases of unemployment, old age, sickness and\ndisablement, and in other cases of undeserved want\".\n\nArticle 43\nobligates the State \"to secure, by suitable\nlegislation to all workers, a living wage, conditions of\nwork ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment\nof leisure...Pension and gratuity are both retiral benefits\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n15/38\n\nensuring that the workman who has spent his useful span\nof life in rendering service and who never got a living\nwage, which would have enabled him to save for a rainy\nday, should not be reduced to destitution and penury in his\nold age. As a return of long service he should be assured\nsocial security to some extent in the form of either\npension, gratuity or provident fund whichever retiral\nbenefit is operative in the industrial establishment. It must\nnot be forgotten that it is not a gratuitous payment, it has\nto be earned by long and continuous service.\"\n\n34. It can clearly be seen that none of the three\n\nbasic needs of man mentioned in\nShantistar\n(Supra) can be\n\nacquired without monetary power. Thereby, through its\n\ninaction the state has clearly exhibited a lethargic and\n\ncallous, attitude towards disbursal of its mandated duties.\n\nTherefore, the inaction of the state clearly enables a\n\nviolation of the Right to Life as mandated under the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n35. Coming to the facts of the present case, an employee,\n\ni.e., a salaried person primarily depends upon his income from\n\nsalary for the purpose of subsistence of his family. In our\n\nconsidered view, if such a salaried person is not paid his due and\n\nadmissible salary despite having zealously worked and served\n\nthe State, the same will obviously affect his life and liberty. This\n\ndefinitely would amount to denial of basic human rights of a\n\ncitizen and would violate fundamental right of life and liberty\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n16/38\n\nguaranteed to a citizen under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n\n36. Therefore, by arbitrarily denying wages to the\n\nemployee right to livelihood was denied by the State\n\nwithout following the procedure established by law, which in\n\nour considered view, is a blatant violation of\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\nStatutory Right Of Receiving Pension\n\n37. The Apex Court in\nState of W.B. v. Haresh\n\nC.Banerjee & others\n, (2006) 7 SCC 651, has held that\n\npension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and the\n\npleasure of the Government and to receive pension is a\n\nvaluable right of a government servant, is a sell-settled legal\n\nproposition.\n\n38. Pension, as is well established, is the deferred\n\nportion of the compensation for rendering long years of\n\nservice. It is a hard-earned benefit, accruing to an employee\n\nin the nature of property. [\nState of Jharkhand v. Jitendra\n\nKumar Srivastava\n, (2013) 12 SCC 210;\nVeena Pandey\n\nversus Union of India & Others\n, 2021 SCC Online SC\n\n1078]\n\n39. Emphasizingly, the Hon'ble Supreme has held that\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n17/38\n\npensionary provisions must be given liberal construction\n\nmore so as a social welfare measure. It is not a bounty to be\n\ndispersed contrary to the rules, but very basis for grant of\n\nsuch pension is to facilitate a retired government employee,\n\nlive with dignity, in the winter of his life. This fundamental\n\nprinciple must be kept in mind while taking action, depriving\n\nbenefits which ought not to be done, unreasonably, more so,\n\non technicalities. [\nV. Sukumaran v. State of Kerala\n, (2020) 8\n\nSCC 106;\nState of W.B. v. Haresh C. Banerjee and others\n,\n\n(2006) 7 SCC 651]\n\n40. We may only extract, for benefit, both of the employer\n\nand the employee, as to how another Constitution Bench of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court elucidated the principles behind the\n\npolicy for grant of pension in\nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n,\n\n(1983) 1 SCC 305.\n\n\"19. What is a pension? What are the goals of\npension? What public interest or purpose, if any, it seeks\nto serve? If it does seek to serve some public purpose, is it\nthwarted by such artificial division of retirement pre and\npost a certain date? We need seek answer to these and\nincidental questions so as to render just justice between\nparties to this petition.\n\n20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a\ngratuitous payment depending upon the sweet will or\ngrace of the employer not claimable as a right and,\ntherefore, no right to pension can be enforced through\nCourt has been swept under the carpet by the decision of\nthe Constitution Bench in\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of\nBihar\n[(1971) 2 SCC 330 : AIR 1971 SC 1409 : 1971\nSupp SCR 634 : (1971) 1 LLJ 557] wherein this Court\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n18/38\n\nauthoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the\npayment of it does not depend upon the discretion of the\nGovernment but is governed by the rules and a\ngovernment servant coming within those rules is entitled\nto claim pension. It was further held that the grant of\npension does not depend upon anyone's discretion. It is\nonly for the purpose of quantifying the amount having\nregard to service and other allied matters that it may be\nnecessary for the authority to pass an order to that effect\nbut the right to receive pension flows to the officer not\nbecause of any such order but by virtue of the rules.\n\nThis\nview was reaffirmed in\nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n.\n[(1976) 2 SCC 1 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 172 : AIR 1976 SC\n667 : (1976) 3 SCR 360]\n\n21. There are various kinds of pensions and there are\nequally various methods of funding pension programmes.\nThe present enquiry is limited to non-contributory\nsuperannuation or retirement pension paid by Government\nto its erstwhile employee and the purpose and object\nunderlying it. Initially this class of pension appears to\nhave been introduced as a reward for loyal service.\nProbably the alien rulers who recruited employees in\nlower echelons of service from the colony and exported\nhigher level employees from the seat of Empire, wanted to\nensure in the case of former continued loyalty till death to\nthe alien rulers and in the case of latter, an assured decent\nliving standard in old age ensuring economic security at\nthe cost of the colony.\n\n22. In the course of transformation of society from\nfeudal to welfare and as socialistic thinking acquired\nrespectability. State obligation to provide security in old\nage, an escape from undeserved want was recognised and\nas a first step pension was treated not only as a reward for\npast service but with a view to helping the employee to\navoid destitution in old age. The quid pro quo was that\nwhen the employee was physically and mentally alert, he\nrendered unto master the best, expecting him to look after\nhim in the fall of life. A retirement system therefore exists\nsolely for the purpose of providing benefits. In most of the\nplans of retirement benefits, everyone who qualifies for\nnormal retirement receives the same amount\n(see Retirement Systems for Public Employees by\nBleakney, p. 33).\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nRight To Receive Gratuity\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n19/38\n\n41. Gratuity has also been held to be a statutory\n\nright which cannot be taken away. (Allahabad Bank\n\nRetirees Assn v.

State of Bihar\n, (2003) 6\n\nSCC 1, the Apex Court has observed as under:\n\n\"30. The Government companies/public sector\nundertakings being 'states' would be constitutionally liable\nto respect life and liberty of all persons in terms of\nArticle\nof the constitution of India. They, therefore, must do so\nin cases of their own employees. The government of the\nState of Bihar for all intent and purport is the sole\nshareholder. Although in law, its liability towards the\ndebtors of the company may be confined to the shares\nheld by it but having regard to the deep and pervasive\ncontrol it exercises over the Government companies; in\nthe matter of enforcement of human rights and/or rights of\nthe citizen of life and liberty, the State has also an\nadditional duty to see that the rights of employees of such\ncorporations are not infringed.\n\n31. The right to exercise deep and pervasive control\nwould in its turn make the Government of Bihar liable to\nsee that the life and liberty clause in respect of the\nemployees is fully safeguarded. The Government of the\nState of Bihar, thus, had a constitutional obligation to\nprotect the life and liberty of the employees of the\ngovernment-owned companies/corporations who are the\ncitizens of India. It had an additional liability having\nregard to its right of extensive supervision over the affairs\nof the company.\"\n\n\"71. The States of India are welfare States. They\nhaving regard to the constitutional provisions adumbrated\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n20/38\n\nin the Constitution of India and in particular Part IV\nthereof laying down the Directive Principles of the State\nPolicy and part IVA laying down the Fundamental Duties\nare bound to preserve the practice to maintain the human\ndignity.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n43. Further, the Apex Court in\nKapila Hingorani v.\n\nState of Bihar\n, (2005) 2 SCC 262, has held that the\n\nemployees have a human right as also a fundamental right\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nwhich the States are bound to protect.\n\nEven where the public sector undertakings were unable to pay\n\nthe salaries of its employees, the Apex Court directed the State\n\nto disburse the same on the basis of the aforesaid principle. We\n\nsee it fit to quote as under:-\n\n\"37. We make it clear that we have not issued the\naforementioned directions to the States of Bihar and\nJharkhand on the premise that they are bound to pay the\nsalaries of the employees of the public sector\nundertakings but on the ground that the employees have a\nhuman right as also a fundamental right under\nArticle 21\n\nwhich the States are bound to protect. The directions,\nwhich have been issued by this Court on 9-5-2003\n[(2003) 6 SCC 1 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 586] as also which\nare being issued herein, are in furtherance of the human\nand fundamental rights of the employees concerned and\nnot by way of an enforcement of their legal right to\narrears of salaries...\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n44. We notice that the Court was dealing with a case,\n\nwhere salaries of several employees of instrumentalities owned\n\nby the State were not disbursed and on the basis of news paper\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n21/38\n\nreport a public spirited citizen, a Supreme Court lawyer, had\n\ninvited attention of the Court to the apathy on the part of the\n\nState.\n\n45. Financial difficulties of employer cannot be a ground\n\nfor non-payment or delayed payment of wages to workmen.\n\nObviously, the State has not pleaded financial bankruptcy. Also\n\nit has not sought exercise of power declaring financial\n\nemergency envisaged under\nArticle 360\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n\nState - a Model Employer\n\n46. The Apex Court in\nState of Jharkhand and\n\nanother v. Harihar Yadav and others\n, (2014) 2 SCC 114,\n\nobserved:\n\n\"52. Having regard to the position that has emerged,\nwe are compelled to dwell upon the role of the State\nas a model employer.\nIn\nSom Prakash Rekhi v. Union of\nIndia\n, (1981) 1 SCC 449, Krishna Iyer, J., has stated\nthus: -\n\n\"Social justice is the conscience of our\nConstitution, the State is the promoter of\neconomic justice, the founding faith which\nsustains the Constitution and the country is\nIndian humanity. The public sector is a model\nemployer with a social conscience not an\nartificial person without soul to be damned or\nbody to be burnt.\"\n\n53 In\nGurmail Singh and others v. State of Punjab and\nothers\n, (1991) 1 SCC 189 it has been held that the State\nas a model employer is expected to show fairness in\naction.\n\n54.\nIn\nBalram Gupta v. Union of India and Another\n,\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n22/38\n\n1987 Supp1 SCC 228 the Court observed that as\na model employer the Government must conduct\nitself with high probity and candour with its employees.\n\n55.\nIn\nState of Haryana v. Piara Singh\n, (1992) 4 SCC 118\nthe Court has ruled that the main concern of the court\nin such matters is to ensure the rule of law and to see\nthat the Executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its\nemployees consistent with the requirements of\nArticles\nand\n16.\n\n56.\nIn\nBhupendra Nath Hazarika and another v. State of\nAssam and others\n, (2013) 2 SCC 516 while laying emphasis\non the role of the State as a model employer, though in a\ndifferent context, the Court observed:\n\n\"65.......It should always be borne in mind that\nlegitimate aspirations of the employees\nare not guillotined and a situation is not\ncreated where hopes end in despair. Hope for\neveryone is gloriously precious and a model\nemployer should not convert it to be deceitful\nand treacherous by playing a game of chess\nwith their seniority. A sense of calm\nsensibility and concerned sincerity should be\nreflected in every step. An atmosphere of trust\nhas to prevail and when the employees\nare absolutely sure that their trust shall not be\nbetrayed and they shall be treated with\ndignified fairness then only the concept of good\ngovernance can be concretized.\"\n\n\"57. If the present factual matrix is tested on the\nanvil of the aforesaid principles, there can be no\ntrace of doubt that both the States and the\nCorporations have conveniently ostracized the concept\nof \"model employer\". It would not be wrong to say\nthat they have done so with Pacific calmness, sans\nvision, shorn of responsibility and oblivious of their\nrole in such a situation. Their action reflects the attitude\nof emotionlessness, proclivity of impassivity and\ndeviancy with cruel impassibility. Neither of the States\nnor the Corporations have even thought for a moment\nabout the livelihood of the employees. They have\nremained totally alien to the situation to which the\nemployees have been driven to. In a State of good\ngovernance the Government cannot act like an alien. It\nhas an active role to play. It has to have a constructive\nand progressive vision...........\"\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n23/38\n\n47. The Corporate and Industrial Houses are\n\nexpected by the Indian State to take measures which\n\nprovide a decent standard of living to members of the\n\nsociety generally and more specifically, to their employees.\n\nTherefore, the State has the duty to set an example of\n\nbeing a model employer to its employees. If State does\n\nitself does not give salary to its employees for their hard\n\nwork then how can it be expected that the private\n\nentrepreneur will take care of their employees.\n\nLitigation Policy Of State\n\n48. We notice that State has formulated a Litigation\n\nPolicy with the avowed object of not only reducing litigation,\n\nsaving avoidable cost on unproductive litigation; but also\n\nreducing avoidable load on judiciary with respect to\n\nGovernment induced litigation. This is in tune with the\n\nmandate of\nArticle 39-A\nof the Constitution of India,\n\nobligating the State to promote equal justice. Now, if the\n\nemployees are not paid their salaries within time, obviously,\n\nthey are left with no remedy but to rush to the Courts.\n\n49. Of late, litigation pertaining to employees of the\n\nState has increased and it is not that State is the petitioner.\n\nThe action assailed is of mis-governance or avoidable\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n24/38\n\nomissions on the part of the Government. Why should the\n\nState force an employee to litigate in a case where\n\nemoluments/salaries, which are undisputed, are not disbursed\n\nin time.\n\n50. In the light of the recommendation of 13 th Finance\n\nCommission, the State of Bihar has formulated the State\n\nLitigation Policy, 2011, notified on 31st March 2011. The Policy\n\nis comprehensive, self speaking and self serving, though,\n\nperhaps, with the passage of time, may require a review. Be that\n\nas it may, as of date, the said policy is binding, more so, on the\n\nemployer. The object of the policy is to \"transform the State\n\nGovernment into an efficient and responsible litigant\" and also\n\nto deal with the genuine grievances of the employee with\n\nreasonable dispatch. In the Policy, the State terms itself to be a\n\n'responsible litigant' and for that term to mean - \"(a) That\n\nlitigation will not be resorted to for the sake of litigating. (b)\n\nThat false pleas and hyper-technical points will not be taken and\n\nshall be discouraged. (c) Ensuring that the correct facts and all\n\nrelevant documents are placed before the Court. (d) That\n\nnothing shall be suppressed from the court and there will be no\n\nattempt to mislead any court or Tribunal.\"\n\n51. As per clause 1.2, the Policy is based on the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n25/38\n\nrecognition \"that it is the responsibility of the Government to\n\nprotect the rights of the citizens, to respect fundamental rights\n\nand that those in charge of the conduct of the Government\n\nlitigation should never forget these basic principles.\"\n\n52. In terms of clause 1.3 underlying objective of the\n\nPolicy is also to reduce pressure on \"the overloaded judiciary\n\nand expedite dispensation of justice.\"\n\n53. Clause 2 of the Policy provides for establishment of a\n\nmechanism, though not termed, but in the nature of pre-\n\nlitigation consideration/resolution of the dispute. At various\n\nlevels, the Empowered Committee is mandated to be\n\nconstituted, enabling the employees to vent out their grievances\n\nprior to initiation of litigation.\n\n54. Part IV of the said Policy deals with prevention of\n\navoidable litigation. The relevant portion thereof is extracted as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"IV. PREVENTION/CONTROL OF AVOIDABLE\nLITIGATION\nA\n\n4. A Setting up Grievance Redressal System\n\n4. A(1). Very often the major causes of litigation\ninvolving the State Government are from arbitrariness\nin decision making or non application of mind or non-\nresponse/ improper response to representations made\nby employees, including retired employees/ parties. It\nis seen that in most cases in respect of service matters\nthe cause of action arises out of relief not being given\nas per the Rules, Government instructions or policy\ndecisions as are in force. It is also seen that in most\ncases before the matter reaches the Court the affected\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n26/38\n\nparty undeservedly spends a lot of his time and effort\nover redressal of his grievance through normal\nadministrative channels. In this situation all\nDepartments of the State Government shall set up\neffective Grievance Redressal Committees in order to\npre-empt a large number of avoidable litigation.\n\n4. A (2). It shall be mandatory for employees, including\nthose retired, to seek redressal, at the first instance,\nthrough this system before approaching the Courts.\n\n4. A(3). A time limit of eight weeks or so may be fixed\nfor deciding such representations.\n\n4. A(4). Such Grievance Redressal Committees shall be\nset up in each Department at the State Level, District\nLevel and Sub-Divisional Level and each of them shall\nhave a Grievance Cell. All cases and issues at the\nrequest of the aggrieved party shall be reviewed to\nredress genuine grievances.\n\n4. A(5) The Department Level Grievance Committee\nshall be headed by the Principal Secretary/ Secretary of\nthe Department concerned and shall meet once a month\nto review the efficiency of the Grievance Redressal\nSystem in the Department. Similarly at the District and\nSub-Divisional Level, the Committee shall be headed\nby the District Magistrate or Sub Divisional Officer, as\nthe case may be. The District Sub Divisional Level\nGrievance Redressal Committees shall meet once every\nmonth on the first Tuesday of each month; if this is a\nholiday, the Committee will meet on the next working\nday excluding \"Janata ka Darbar\" days, i.e., Mondays\nand Thursdays. Where it is found that certain\nGovernment instructions require to be reviewed, it shall\nrefer the same to the State Level Empowered\nCommittee. As seniority matters are a major source of\nlitigation these shall be resolved expeditiously by the\nDepartment and seniority lists should be updated,\nprinted and published regularly.\n\nB\n\n4. B. Quick Action on Representations/ Legal\nNotices\n\n4.B(1). A legal notice is intended to alert the State to\nnegotiate a just settlement or at least have the courtesy\nto tell the potential outsider why the claim is being\nresisted. Nowadays such notices have become a\nformality. When such a legal notice is served upon any\nDepartment asking for the relief the same should be\ndecided expeditiously in accordance with the prevalent\nRules/ Instructions and by a detailed speaking order.\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n27/38\n\nTimely response would avoid waste of public money\nand promote expeditious work in Court in cases which\ndeserve to be attended to.\n\n4. B(2). While passing orders in original jurisdiction or\nin appeals in respect of disciplinary proceedings a\ndetailed speaking order should be passed. It is the\nbounden duty of the enquiry officer to follow all the\nprescribed procedures for conducting the enquiry so\nthat no lapse occurs in the procedural parts and orders\nare not set aside on that ground and the matter is\nremanded back for fresh decision. Officers should be\ntrained periodically in these aspects.\n\n4.B(3). While deciding cases relating to seniority of\nemployees, the decision should be taken promptly and\nstrictly in accordance with the Rules so that the interest\nof the employees is not jeopardized due to a delayed\ndecision. ...\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n55. It seems that the Policy was never put to practice, for,\n\nhad it been so, all adjudicatory forums, including this Court\n\nwould not have been flooded with litigation. The information\n\nobtained from the Registry reveals that 39,000 (approx.) [36,596\n\n(Group 13, 14 and 15) original + 2191 (LPA)] cases pertaining\n\nto the employees' dispute with the State Government/ its\n\ninstrumentalities are pending consideration before this Court.\n\nMethods of alternative dispute resolution must be implemented\n\nso as to reduce this number so far as possible.\n\n56. The Hon'ble Supreme Court speaking through\n\nHon'ble Mr. Justice M.M. Shantanagoudar in High Court of\n\nJudicature at Madras Rep. by its Registrar General v. M. C.\n\nSubramaniam & Ors., (2021) 3 SCC 560, held that:-\n\n\"13. The provisions of\nSection 89\nCPC must be\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n28/38\n\nunderstood in the backdrop of the longstanding proliferation\nof litigation in the civil courts, which has placed undue\nburden on the judicial system, forcing speedy justice to\nbecome a casualty. As the Law Commission has observed in\nits 238th Report on Amendment of\nSection 89\nof the Code\nof Civil Procedure, 1908 and Allied Provisions, Section 89\nhas now made it incumbent on civil courts to strive towards\ndiverting civil disputes towards alternative dispute\nresolution processes, and encourage their settlement outside\nof court (Para 2.3). These observations make the object and\npurpose of Section 89 crystal clear -- to facilitate private\nsettlements, and enable lightening of the overcrowded\ndocket of the Indian judiciary. This purpose, being\nsacrosanct and imperative for the effecting of timely justice\nin Indian courts,...\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n57. The importance and fundamental nature of salary and\n\nother emoluments to be paid to an employee place an obligation\n\nupon the machinery of the State to ensure that such cases where\n\nthe claims are bonafide and genuine, do not get delayed as a result\n\nof the judicial process and pendency and that they should be\n\nresolved at the pre-litigation stage itself.\n\n58. An employee has a constitutional right to receive\n\nwages/ salary/emoluments/retiral benefits within time, so also\n\nState is under a constitutional obligation and duty to disburse\n\nthe same.\n\n59. In the instant case, the law, as discussed above,\n\nrenders the path clear. The Husband of the petitioner,\n\nemployee herein, rendered services for a period of thirty-four\n\nyears from 12.05.1961 to 31. 12. 1996. It is an admitted\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n29/38\n\nposition, as evidenced by Annexure-3, page-34, dated\n\n22.11.1996, that dues of the various period were to be paid to\n\nthe employee, which was never done. Post-retirement, the\n\nemployee and later the petitioner made several\n\nrepresentations to various authorities over the year for\n\ndisbursal of arrears in salary and retirement benefits which\n\nunfortunately fell on deaf ears. It is saddening that the\n\nemployee was denied the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour\n\nonly on account of procedural wrangles and back and forth of\n\nbureaucratic channels and for no fault of his.\n\n60. The counter affidavit filed by the State admits that\n\ndespite the passage of twenty-five years, pension papers and\n\nother no dues certificates have yet not been prepared. It is\n\nonly six months after the filing of the present writ petition\n\nthat the State now wishes to ascertain the facts vide\n\ncommunications dated 27.10.2021, Annexure-B to E, from\n\ndifferent authorities. It is further noted, as on the date of filing\n\nof the said counter affidavit, i.e. 25.04.2022, no responses to\n\nsuch departmental memos are reflected from the record. Such\n\na callous and lax attitude on the part of the State which has\n\nbeen held by Hon'ble the Supreme Court to be a model\n\nemployer does not fit the description.\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n30/38\n\n61. With the passage of several years, from the\n\nemployee's superannuation to the payment of post retiral\n\nbenefits resulting from this order, it would no longer serve the\n\ncause of justice if the State is let off by doing just that.\n\n62. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in\nNalabati Behera v.\n\nState of Orissa\n, (1993) 2 SCC 746, while discussing the\n\npublic law remedy of compensatory or exemplary damages\n\nheld as under:-\n\n\"34. The public law proceedings serve a different\npurpose than the private law proceedings. The relief of\nmonetary compensation, as exemplary damages, in\nproceedings under\nArticle 32\nby this Court or under\n\nArticle 226\nby the High Courts, for established\ninfringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed under\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution is a remedy available in\npublic law and is based on the strict liability for\ncontravention of the guaranteed basic and indefeasible\nrights of the citizen. The purpose of public law is not only\nto civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that\nthey live under a legal system which aims to protect their\ninterests and preserve their rights. Therefore, when the\ncourt moulds the relief by granting \"compensation\" in\nproceedings under\nArticle 32\nor 226 of the Constitution\nseeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights,\nit does so under the public law by way of penalising the\nwrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on\nthe State which has failed in its public duty to protect the\nfundamental rights of the citizen. The payment of\ncompensation in such cases is not to be understood, as it is\ngenerally understood in a civil action for damages under\nthe private law but in the broader sense of providing relief\nby an order of making 'monetary amends' under the\npublic law for the wrong done due to breach of public\nduty, of not protecting the fundamental rights of the\ncitizen. The compensation is in the nature of 'exemplary\ndamages' awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of\nits public law duty and is independent of the rights\navailable to the aggrieved party to claim compensation\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n31/38\n\nunder the private law in an action based on tort, through a\nsuit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or/and\nprosecute the offender under the penal law.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n63. It has also been recognized by Hon'ble a bench of\n\nHon'ble Allahabad High Court headed by Hon'ble Chief Justice\n\nDr. D. Y. Chandrachud [as His Lordship then was] in Rekha\n\nDevi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, Civil Writ No.24947 of 2014\n\ndecided on May 2, 2014, that a High Court is not powerless to\n\nissue exemplary damages under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\n\nof India.\n\n64. Plenary power of this Court under the Constitution is\n\nwide enough.\n\n65. Therefore, in the considered opinion of this Court, the\n\npetitioner is not only entitled to arrears in salary (para 4), post-\n\nretirement benefits along with interest as per law thereupon, but\n\nalso punitive damages/costs on the ground of inordinate delay\n\nand for having had to run from pillar to post to get the earned\n\ndues.\n\n66. Questions of law answered hereinunder:\n\n1. Whether denial of earned remuneration and post\nretiral benefits constitute an infringement of the right to\nlife under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India?\n\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n32/38\n\n67. Hon'ble, the Supreme Court has, as discussed above,\n\nheld in several judgments that salary and equally post retiral\n\nbenefits, which have been duly earned, are rights vesting in such\n\nemployee. Denial of wages and post retiral benefits in the\n\ninstant case is a classical case of infringement of\nArticle 21\n,\n\nowing almost entirely to the indifferent attitude of the State\n\ntowards its employees and former employees.\nIn M/s\n\nShantistar Builders\n(supra), the three primary actions of\n\nhuman existence have been listed, and in\nD. K. Yadav\n(supra),\n\nlivelihood is recognized as a facet of\nArticle 21.\n\n2. Whether the acts of the State in delaying the\ndisbursement of retiral benefits can be countenanced\ngiven the established notion of the State as a Model\nEmployer?\n\n68. The State, in its myriad of functions, is not only an\n\nemployer but is also a lawmaker. The lawmaker has stipulated\n\nvarious methods to regulate employment, balancing the interest\n\nof both the employer and the employee, conceiving redressal\n\nmechanisms to ensure timely resolution of disputes, and\n\nevolving ways to protect the vulnerable party in a particular\n\ntransaction. In the instant case and many other such cases, the\n\nState itself has laid waste to its own rules and regulations-\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n33/38\n\ncalling into question the very basis of such laws and regulations.\n\n69. As the stipulated model employer, it is incumbent\n\nupon the State to ensure the proper application of such\n\nregulations to set an example for other entities. This\n\nresponsibility has clearly been abdicated.\n\n3. Whether a case is made out for punitive\ndamages/heavy cost in the instant set of facts in light of\nthe inordinate lapses?\n\n70. Hon'ble the Supreme Court held that exemplary\n\ndamages are awarded in cases where the right to life under\n\nArticle 21\nhas been grossly infringed. In the instant case, the\n\npetitioner's husband retired in 1996, which is 25 years ago.\n\nHowever, till today, documents disbursement of salary,\n\nincluding gratuity and pension etc., are being sought from\n\nvarious departments. Hence the answer has to be in the\n\naffirmative.\n\n71. This Court further takes strong exception to the State's\n\nstand taken before this Court to dismiss the present petition in\n\nlight of the light of recent efforts being made, evidenced by the\n\nnumerous memoranda issued on 27.10.2021.\n\n72. In the considered view of this Court, this case is fit for\n\nan award of exemplary damages/costs over and above the dues\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n34/38\n\nof the petitioner's husband, to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees\n\nFive Lacs).\n\n4. Whether the State is obligated to constitute an\neffective grievance redressal mechanism with respect to\npayment of legitimate dues of a salaried employee,\nincluding pension and other post retiral benefits, to ensure\nthat earned dues are disbursed on time?\n\n73. As already discussed, India is a welfare State and\n\nhas been termed a model employer. The directive principles\n\nof State policy which are fundamental to the governance of\n\nthe State, impose an obligation upon the State to ensure a\n\nliving way and decent standard of living. Further, it has been\n\nobserved that a salaried person is almost entirely dependent\n\nupon the same, and delay or denial would impede such\n\nobligation infringing the very core of\nArticle 21\nguaranteeing\n\na dignified existence.\n\n74. Considering the large number of such cases filed\n\nbefore this Court, it would be appropriate in our view to ask\n\nthe Chief Secretary to conceive an accessible and easy\n\nmechanism for timely redressal of salary and pension-related\n\ngrievances. Such a mechanism developed with a holistic view\n\nwill go a long way in extinguishing the need for an aggrieved\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n35/38\n\nperson to knock on the doors of justice.\n\n75. In the light of the discussion above, we dispose of\n\nthe writ petition in the following manner:-\n\n(a) The respondents-authorities shall positively pay the\n\nentire amount constituting unpaid salary, gratuity,\n\npension etc., to the writ petitioner, namely Lilawati\n\nMishra, within two months from today. The\n\nDepartment's principal Secretary shall file an\n\naffidavit of compliance within two months from\n\ntoday. For compliance the matter be listed on\n\n12.07.2022.\n\n(b) Petitioner shall be entitled to interest on such\n\namounts @ 18% per annum or the prevalent\n\nstatutory interest, whichever is lower.\n\n(c) Also, She shall be entitled to an exemplary cost\n\nquantified at Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lacs). It\n\nshall be open for the State to recover the same from\n\nthe erring officials.\n\n(d) The Chief Secretary to the Government shall ensure\n\nthat the mechanism in terms of the Bihar State\n\nLitigation Policy, 2011 is not only put in place, but\n\nalso made effectively functional. He shall also\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n36/38\n\nendeavour to provide further mechanism, enabling\n\nthe employees to vent out their grievances, be it of\n\nwhatever nature. One such tool is setting up a 'Web\n\nPortal' at the level of the Principal Secretary/\n\nSecretary of the concerned Department(s), where\n\nthe employees can lodge their\n\ngrievances/complaints. Such grievances/\n\ncomplaints shall be processed and adequately\n\nresponded to within a reasonable period. This\n\nwould facilitate speedy redressal of genuine\n\ngrievances and prevent unnecessary litigation,\n\nclogging the wheels of the administration of\n\njustice. Such endeavour shall only be in the spirit\n\nof Litigation Policy, framed by the State\n\nGovernment. We see a significant advantage in the\n\nuse of information and technology. It would result\n\nin effective and efficient redressal of grievances, if\n\nany, and improve efficiency in the affairs of\n\ngovernance of the State, further instilling\n\nconfidence and trust amongst the employees.\n\n(e) It is to be noted that this Court passed similar\n\ndirections on an earlier occasion to set up a web\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n37/38\n\nportal. However, no progress in this regard has\n\nbeen reported to the Court.\n\n(f) All Grievances Redressal Committees stipulated\n\nunder the Litigation Policy shall be made\n\nimmediately functional and operational.\n\n(g) In the light and spirit of clause (c) of sub-section (1)\n\nof\nSection 89\nof the Code of Civil Procedure, an\n\nendeavour shall be made of having the matters of\n\nthe employees resolved through the process of\n\njudicial settlement, including settlement through\n\nLok Adalat. The Patna High Court Legal Services\n\nAuthority is requested to have the needful done.\n\n(h) We direct the State to immediately undertake such a\n\nmeasure at the earliest.\n\n(i) We also request the learned Advocate General, State\n\nof Bihar, who plays a pivotal role in the\n\nimplementation of the Litigation Policy to\n\nundertake such a drive at the earliest. This he can\n\ndo by engaging all the stakeholders, more\n\nspecifically the Principal Secretaries of the\n\nconcerned Departments.\n\n76. The writ petition stands disposed of with the\nPatna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n38/38\n\naforesaid directions/observations.\n\n77. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stand\n\ndisposed of.\n\n(Sanjay Karol, CJ)\n\nS. Kumar, J. I agree.\n\n(S.
