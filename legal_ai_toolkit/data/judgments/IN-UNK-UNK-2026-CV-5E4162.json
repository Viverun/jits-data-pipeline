Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner in each of\n\nthese petitions and the learned State Public Prosecutor who was\n\ndirected to take notice.\n\n The petitioners in all these petitions are arraigned as\n\naccused Nos.1 and 2. The first of the petitions namely,\n\nCrl.P.3774/2015, arises out of Crime No.172/2014 which is\n\n 165\n\nnow numbered as C.C.No.8/2015 on the file of the Court of the\n\nII Additional Senior Civil Judge & Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nMangaluru. It was alleged by the complainant in each of the\n\npetitions that the petitioners and four other persons were\n\nrunning a company in the name and style of \"Vraksha Business\n\nSolutions India Ltd., situated at Utility Royal Towers, II Floor,\n\nK.S. Rao Road, Mangaluru and were involved in collecting\n\ndeposits from the public for a fixed period and interest was to\n\nbe paid on the said deposits, to the depositors. The business of\n\nthe company was widely publicized through media and\n\ninvestors were invited from the general public. Respondent\n\nNo.2 in all these petitions was an agent for collecting money\n\nfrom the public and they had deposited the monies so collected,\n\nto the company run by the petitioners. On maturity of the fixed\n\ndeposit period, it transpires that the company did not refund the\n\nmonies collected from the public and there were repeated\n\nrequests by such depositors to the agents, who were the\n\ncomplainants in the cases. Since there were evasive answers to\n\n 166\n\nthe queries and demands made by the complainants, the\n\ncomplainants had approached the court and the same was\n\nregistered as an First Information Report (FIR), as already\n\nstated.\n\n The second respondent in the present petitions are all\n\ncomplainants who are similarly aggrieved. Each such\n\ncomplaint being separately numbered as an FIR and individual\n\ncriminal cases having been initiated against the petitioners, the\n\npetitioners are before this court.\n\n \n3. The learned counsel for the petitioners would draw the\n\nattention to the observations of the Supreme Court in the case\n\nof \nT.T. Antony vs. State of Kerala and others\n 2001 (6) SCC 181,\n\nwherein it is observed that an information given under sub-\n\nsection (1) of \nSection 154\n of the Cr.P.C. is commonly known as\n\na First Information Report (FIR), though this term is not used in\n\nthe \nCr.P.C\n. It is the earliest and the first information of a\n\ncognizable offence recorded by an officer in charge of a police\n\nstation. It sets the criminal law into motion and marks the\n\n 167\n\ncommencement of the investigation which ends up with the\n\nformation of opinion under \nSection 169\n or 170 of \nCr.P.C\n., as\n\nthe case may be, and forwarding of a police report\n\nunder \nSection 173\n of Cr.P.C. It is also possible that more\n\ninformation than one are given to a police officer in charge of a\n\npolice station in respect of the same incident involving one or\n\nmore than one cognizable offences.\n In such a case, the Supreme\n\nCourt has observed that the police officer in charge need not\n\nenter every one of them in the station house diary and this is\n\nimplied in Section 154 of Cr.P.C. All other informations made\n\norally or in writing after the commencement of the investigation\n\ninto the cognizable offence disclosed from the facts mentioned\n\nin the FIR and entered in the station house diary by the police\n\nofficer or such other cognizable offences as may come to his\n\nnotice during the investigation, will be statements falling\n\nunder Section 162 of Cr.P.C. And that no such information or\n\nstatement can properly be treated as an F.I.R. and entered in the\n\nstation house diary again, as it would in effect be a second FIR\n\n 168\n\nand the same cannot be in conformity with the scheme of\n\nthe Cr.P.C.\n\n The Supreme Court has, by way of illustration,\n\npostulated a situation in which A having killed B, his wife,\n\ninforms the police that she is killed by an unknown person or\n\nknowing that B is killed by his mother or sister, A owns up the\n\nresponsibility and during investigation the truth is detected; it\n\ndoes not require filing of fresh FIR against A - the real offender\n\nwho can be arraigned in the report under \nSection 173(2)\n or\n\n173(8) of \nCr.P.C\n., as the case may be. It would of course be\n\npermissible for the investigating officer to send up a report to\n\nthe concerned Magistrate even earlier that investigation is being\n\ndirected against the person suspected to be the accused.\n\nTherefore, the Supreme Court has concluded that under the\n\nscheme of the provisions of \nSections 154\n, \n155\n, \n156\n, \n157\n, \n162\n,\n\n169\n, \n170\n and \n173\n of Cr.P.C., only the earliest or the first\n\ninformation in regard to the commission of a cognizable\n\noffence satisfies the requirements of \nSection 154\n Cr.P.C. Thus,\n\n 169\n\nthere can be no second F.I.R. and consequently there can be no\n\nfresh investigation on receipt of every subsequent information\n\nin respect of the same cognizable offence or the same\n\noccurrence or incident giving rise to one or more cognizable\n\noffences. On receipt of information about a cognizable offence\n\nor an incident giving rise to a cognizable offence or offences\n\nand on entering the F.I.R. in the station house diary, the officer\n\nin charge of a Police Station has to investigate not merely the\n\ncognizable offence reported in the FIR but also other connected\n\noffences found to have been committed in the course of the\n\nsame transaction or the same occurrence and file one or more\n\nreports as provided in Section 173 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n It is also pointed out that the Government of Karnataka,\n\nPolice Department has issued a circular\n\nNo.L&O/Misc./24/2015-16 dated 30.07.2015, wherein it has\n\nbeen stated that any subsequent information the Investigating\n\nOfficer receives with regard to any incident out of the same\n\nincident or with regard to any incident out of the same\n\n 170\n\ntransaction, he shall not register further crime numbers but he\n\nshall treat that information as the statement of the witnesses\n\neither under \nSection 162\n of Cr.P.C. or under \nSection 161\n of\n\nCr.P.C. in the earliest case registered. Therefore, he would\n\nsubmit that it would save precious judicial time and the pending\n\nproceedings could be conveniently disposed of if the earliest\n\ncase registered on the same set of circumstances is taken as the\n\nmain case and all subsequent complaints are made as statements\n\nmade in the said case and to that extent, there would be no\n\nprejudice caused to any of the complainants, as the relief sought\n\nfor by the complainants is to punish the petitioners for the\n\nalleged offences which could be conveniently tried on one\n\nsingle case and therefore, would seek the indulgence of this\n\ncourt to allow these petitions in terms as prayed for.\n\n 4. The learned State Public Prosecutor would not dispute\n\nthe legal position as sought to be interpreted with reference to\n\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court as well as the circular\n\nissued by the State.\n\n 171\n\n Consequently, the petitions are allowed. The court below\n\nis directed to treat the case in C.C.No.8/2015 as the main case\n\nand all subsequent complaints which are the subject matter of\n\nthese several petitions be treated as statements by the witnesses\n\nand the cases could be tried as a single case, on the strength of\n\nthe evidence of the several complainants who would be treated\n\nas witnesses. If any further complaints are registered, since\n\nthere are large number of investors involved and it is more\n\nlikely that in future other cases would be filed, in respect of\n\nsuch cases arising out of the same set of circumstances, the\n\nsame rule shall be applied by the prosecution in taking those\n\ncases, recording the statements of such complainants as\n\nstatements made in the course of investigation. In the event\n\nthere are any private complaints filed under \nSection 200\n\nCr.P.C., the same shall be brought to the attention of the court\n\nthat the above order has been passed whereby if such additional\n\ncases either by way of a police complaint or a private complaint\n\n 172\n\nis instituted, they shall be treated as statements made in the\n\npending cases aforesaid.\n\n I.A.1/2015 in all the petitions stand disposed of.\n\n Sd/-\n\n JUDGE\n\nKS",
