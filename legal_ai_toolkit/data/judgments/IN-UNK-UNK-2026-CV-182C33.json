The\nrespondent is his wife. The appellant and the respondent\nwere married according to Hindu rites and customs on 26-8-88\nat Hyderabad. The marriage was also consumated. During\nOctober 1988, while the couple were in a honeymoon, it is\nalleged that the respondent told the appellant that she was\nforced into marriage by her parents, while she was more\ninterested in her career rather than a married life, as she\nhad studied M.Sc. in electronics. It is also alleged by\nthe appellant that on 15.10.88, on a petty quarrel, the\nrespondent walked out of his house and it was after great\npersuasion she was brought back to his house. The very next\nday of the said incident, the respondent was taken by her\nparents to their house and despite request by the appellant\nand members of his family, she did not return for about\ntwo-and-a-half months to the house of the appellant. During\nthat period, there was a reconciliation, as a result of\nwhich the respondent was sent to the house of the appellant\non the condition that she should be sent to the house of her\nparents on every Thursday and taken back on Saturday to\nfacilitate her to perform Santoshimata Puja on every Friday.\nAccording to the appellant, this arrangement also did not\nsuit the respondent and all the time she complained of\ndeprivation and expressed her desire to return to her\nparents house permanently. On 8-3-89, it is alleged that\nthe respondent in privacy took out her Mangalsutra and threw\nit at the appellant, and on the very next day, she went to\nher parents place and thereafter she never returned to the\nappellants house, despite several requests.\n\n Thereafter, there were several meetings for\nreconciliation which failed. It is also alleged that the\nrespondent got a complaint lodged through her uncle who was\nthen posted as Superintendent of Police, with the Womens\nProtection Cell, CID, Hyderabad against him and his father\nand other members of his family as a result of which they\nhad to seek anticipatory bail from the court. Subsequently,\nagain, efforts were made for reconciliation but they did not\nfructify and under such circumstances, the appellant filed a\npetition before the Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad for\ndissolution of marriage by granting decree of divorce on the\ngrounds of mental cruelty and desertion. The grounds of\ncruelty were attributed to three acts of the respondent.\nFirstly, while in privacy, the respondent took out her\nMangalsutra and threw it at the appellant; secondly, the\nrespondent kept, maintained and preserved the copies of the\nletters sent by her to the appellant which shattered the\nmutual confidence between the couple; and thirdly, that the\nrespondent lodged a complaint through her uncle against the\nappellant and the other members of his family\n u/s 498A\n IPC\nwith the Womens Protection Cell, Hyderabad, for which they\nhad to obtain anticipatory bail from the court. According\nto the appellant, all these three acts of the respondent\nconstituted mental cruelty upon him and thus was entitled to\na decree of divorce. The wife filed counter affidavit to\nthe petition filed by her husband wherein she admitted that\nwhile in privacy she took out Mangalsutra and that she\nmaintained and preserved the copies of letters sent by her\nto her husband. However, she denied having lodged any\ncomplaint with the Womens Protection Cell, Hyderabad or\nthrew Mangalsutra at the face of her husband. The appellant\nexamined himself as well as his witnesses in support of his\nallegation and filed the letters sent by the respondent to\nhim which were exhibited as Exts. A1 to A10. The Fourth\nAdditional District Judge, City Civil Court, found that the\nacts of the respondent in taking out Mangalsutra and\nthrowing it at the husband, keeping and maintaining the\ncopies of letters sent to her husband and lodging of\ncomplaint with the Women Protection Cell constituted mental\ncruelty upon the husband and as such the appellant was\nentitled to decree of divorce. However, the trial court\nfound that the wife did not desert the appellant.\n\n Aggrieved, the respondent filed an appeal before the\nAndhra Pradesh High Court. The High Court, on appreciation\nof evidence found, that the incidents alleged by the\nappellant were blown out of proportion and in fact those\nincidents did not constitute mental cruelty. Consequently,\nthe decree of the trial court was reversed and the appeal\nwas allowed. It is against this judgment the appellant is\nin appeal before us.\n\n Learned counsel appearing for the appellant urged that\nthe view taken by the High Court that since the parties\nafter the incident of 8th March, 1989, cohabited and it\ntherefore amounts to condonation of guilt of the wife is\nbased on no evidence, and as such the said finding suffers\nfrom legal infirmity. It is true that the High Court\nrecorded the following finding in its judgment - the very\nadmission in the petition of the respondent that he did not\nmake an issue of the incident and cohabited with the\nappellant, thereafter constituted condonation.\n\n On a perusal of the petition filed by the appellant,\nwhat we find is that in the petition for divorce, the\nappellant has alleged that on 8th March, 1989, his wife took\nout her Mangalsutra and threw it at him and thereafter\nfinally deserted him. We further find that the appellant\nand his witness in their testimony nowhere admitted that\nafter the date of the incident i.e. on 8th March 1989 the\nwife and the husband cohabited. The respondent also in her\nevidence never stated that she cohabited with her husband\nafter the date of incident. It is, however, correct that\nthe appellant in connection with the incident of 8th March,\n1989 stated that he did not make an issue out of the said\nincident as it would have disturbed the peaceful life of his\nfamily. But, he would never forgive his wife for the said\nact. We, therefore, do not find any evidence of the fact\nthat the parties cohabited after 8th March, 1989, as the\nwife stated to have left the house of the appellant after\nthat date. In the absence of such evidence, the finding of\nthe High Court that since the parties cohabited after 8th\nMarch, 1989 and as such same would constitute condonation of\nguilt, is unsustainable.\n\n It was then urged that the view taken by the High\nCourt that the incident of throwing of Mangalsutra by the\nwife as alleged by the appellant has not been substantiated\nand further the removal of Mangalsutra by his wife would not\namount to mental cruelty within the meaning of \nSection\n13(1)(ia)\n of Hindu Marriage Act, is erroneous. The\nappellant in his petition as well as in his evidence,\nalleged that his wife after taking out her Mangalsutra threw\nat him. The wife in her counter affidavit and statement\nadmitted that she removed the Mangalsutra but denied that\nshe had ever thrown the Mangalsutra at her husband. As\nstated above this incident took place in privacy. There was\nno other witness to the incident. The respondent very well\ncould have denied the alleged incident. But she admitted to\nhave removed the Mangalsutra only to please her husband.\nMoreover, when the wife was being cross-examined before the\ntrial court no question was put to her about throwing of\nMangalsutra at the appellant. For all these reasons we find\nthat testimony of the respondent was rightly believed by the\nHigh Court while disbelieving the incident of throwing of\nMangalsutra by the respondent, as alleged by the appellant.\n\n Coming to the second limb of the argument whether the\nremoval of Mangalsutra by the respondent constituted mental\ncruelty upon the husband, learned counsel for the appellant\nsubmitted that Mangalsutra around the neck of a wife is a\nsacred thing which symbolises the continuance of married\nlife and Mangalsutra is removed only after the death of\nhusband. Thus, the removal of Mangalsutra by the\nrespondent-wife was an act which reflected mental cruelty of\nhighest order as it caused agony and hurt the sentiments of\nthe appellant.\n\n Before we deal with the submission it is necessary to\nfind out what is mental cruelty as envisaged under \nsection\n13(1)(ia)\n of the Act. Mental cruelty broadly means, when\neither party causes mental pain, agony or suffering of such\na magnitude that it severs the bond between the wife and\nhusband and as a result of which it becomes impossible for\nthe party who has suffered to live with the other party. In\nother words, the party who has committed wrong is not\nexpected to live with the other party. It is in this\nbackground we have to test the argument raised by the\nlearned counsel for the appellant. The respondent after\nhaving admitted the removal of Mangalsutra stated, that\nwhile in privacy the husband often used to ask her to remove\nthe chain and bangles. She has also stated that in her\nparents house when her aunt and mother used to go to\nbathroom they used to take out Mangalsutra from their neck\nand therefore she thought that she was not doing anything\nwrong in removing Mangalsutra when she was asked to do so by\nher husband. She also stated that whenever she removed\nMangalsutra, she never thought of bringing an end to the\nmarried life and was still wearing her Mangalsutra; and it\nis when her husband made hue and cry of such removal of\nMangalsutra, she profusely apologized . From all these\nevidence the High Court concluded that the incident was\nblown out of proportion and the appellant attempted to take\nadvantage of the incident by picturising the same as an act\nof cruelty on the part of the wife. The question,\ntherefore, arises whether the removal of the Mangalsutra by\nthe wife at the instance of her husband would amount to\nmental cruelty within the meaning of \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n of\nthe Act. It is no doubt true that Mangalsutra around the\nneck of a wife is a sacred thing for a Hindu wife as it\nsymbolises continuance of married life. A Hindu wife\nremoves her Mangalsutra only after the death of her husband.\nBut here we are not concerned with a case where a wife after\ntearing her Mangalsutra threw at her husband and walked out\nof her husbands house. Here is a case where a wife while\nin privacy, occasionally has been removing her Mangalsutra\nand bangles on asking of her husband with a view to please\nhim. If the removal of Mangalsutra was something wrong\namounting to mental cruelty, as submitted by learned counsel\nfor the appellant, it was the husband who instigated his\nwife to commit that wrong and thus was an abettor. Under\nsuch circumstances the appellant cannot be allowed to take\nadvantage of a wrong done by his wife of which he himself\nwas responsible. In such a case the appellant cannot be\nallowed to complain that his wife is guilty of committing an\nact of mental cruelty upon him, and further by such an act,\nhas suffered mental pain and agony as a result of which\nmarried life has broken down, and he is not expected to live\nwith his wife. It also appears to us that, whenever the\nappellant asked her wife for removal of her Mangalsutra, the\nrespondent never comprehended that her husband at any point\nof time would react to such occurrences in the way he did.\nUnder such circumstances, the appellant was not expected to\nhave made an issue out of it. We are, therefore, of the\nview that removal of Mangalsutra by the respondent would not\nconstitute mental cruelty within the meaning of \nSection\n13(1)(ia)\n of the Act.\n\n The next ground of act of cruelty attributed to the\nwife relates to her preserving and maintaining copies of her\nletters sent to her husband. Learned counsel urged that the\nact of the wifes preserving copies of such letters has\nshaken the confidence of the husband which amounts to mental\ncruelty upon her husband, as according to him, copies of\nsuch letters were preserved knowingly to use them as\nevidence in future and such an action definitely amounts to\nmental cruelty.\n\n The view taken by the High Court was that mere\nretention of copies of the letters would not amount to\nmental cruelty. We also find that if the wife had any\nintention to use copies of those letters she would have\nfiled the same before the trial court. Excepting filing a\ncounter affidavit the respondent-wife did not file any copy\nof the letters sent to her husband, whereas the husband has\nfiled all the letters sent to him by his wife in the court\nwhich were exhibited. The respondent wife in her testimony\nstated that she wrote several letters to her husband, but\nher husband did not reply any of them and as such she\nstarted preserving the copies of the letters sent by her to\nher husband. This act of the respondent, according to us,\nis a most natural behaviour of human being placed in such\ncircumstances. Thus, we find mere preserving the copies of\nthe letters by the wife does not constitute an act which\namounts to mental cruelty, and a result of which it becomes\nimpossible for the husband to live with his wife. We,\ntherefore, reject the submission of learned counsel for the\nappellant.\n\n The last act of the respondent, which according to the\nlearned counsel for the appellant, amounts to mental cruelty\nis that she lodged a complaint with the Women Protection\nCell, through her uncle and as a result of which the\nappellant and the members of his family had to seek\nanticipatory bail. The respondent in her evidence stated\nthat she had never lodged any complaint against the\nappellant or any members of his family with the Women\nProtection Cell. However, she stated that her parents\nsought help from Women Protection Cell for reconciliation\nthrough one of her relative who, at one time, happened to be\nthe Superintendent of Police. It is on the record that one\nof the functions of the Women Protection Cell is to bring\nabout reconciliation between the estranged spouses. There\nis no evidence on record to show that either the appellant\nor any member of his family were harassed by the Cell. The\nCell only made efforts to bring about reconciliation between\nthe parties but failed. Out of panic if the appellant and\nmembers of his family sought anticipatory bail, the\nrespondent cannot be blamed for that. Thus, we are of the\nopinion, that representation made by the parents of the\nrespondent to the Cell for reconciliation of the estranged\nspouses does not amount to mental cruelty caused to the\nappellant.\n\n For all these reasons, we do not find any merit in\nthis appeal. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. There\nshall be no order as to costs.",

It is no doubt true that Mangalsutra around the\nneck of a wife is a sacred thing for a Hindu wife as it\nsymbolises continuance of married life. A Hindu wife\nremoves her Mangalsutra only after the death of her husband.\nBut here we are not concerned with a case where a wife after\ntearing her Mangalsutra threw at her husband and walked out\nof her husbands house. Here is a case where a wife while\nin privacy, occasionally has been removing her Mangalsutra\nand bangles on asking of her husband with a view to please\nhim. If the removal of Mangalsutra was something wrong\namounting to mental cruelty, as submitted by learned counsel\nfor the appellant, it was the husband who instigated his\nwife to commit that wrong and thus was an abettor. Under\nsuch circumstances the appellant cannot be allowed to take\nadvantage of a wrong done by his wife of which he himself\nwas responsible. In such a case the appellant cannot be\nallowed to complain that his wife is guilty of committing an\nact of mental cruelty upon him, and further by such an act,\nhas suffered mental pain and agony as a result of which\nmarried life has broken down, and he is not expected to live\nwith his wife. It also appears to us that, whenever the\nappellant asked her wife for removal of her Mangalsutra, the\nrespondent never comprehended that her husband at any point\nof time would react to such occurrences in the way he did.\nUnder such circumstances, the appellant was not expected to\nhave made an issue out of it. We are, therefore, of the\nview that removal of Mangalsutra by the respondent would not\nconstitute mental cruelty within the meaning of \nSection\n13(1)(ia)\n of the Act."

Learned counsel urged that the\nact of the wifes preserving copies of such letters has\nshaken the confidence of the husband which amounts to mental\ncruelty upon her husband, as according to him, copies of\nsuch letters were preserved knowingly to use them as\nevidence in future and such an action definitely amounts to\nmental cruelty."

      "text": "The view taken by the High Court was that mere\nretention of copies of the letters would not amount to\nmental cruelty. We also find that if the wife had any\nintention to use copies of those letters she would have\nfiled the same before the trial court. Excepting filing a\ncounter affidavit the respondent-wife did not file any copy\nof the letters sent to her husband, whereas the husband has\nfiled all the letters sent to him by his wife in the court\nwhich were exhibited. The respondent wife in her testimony\nstated that she wrote several letters to her husband, but\nher husband did not reply any of them and as such she\nstarted preserving the copies of the letters sent by her to\nher husband. This act of the respondent, according to us,\nis a most natural behaviour of human being placed in such\ncircumstances. Thus, we find mere preserving the copies of\nthe letters by the wife does not constitute an act which\namounts to mental cruelty, and a result of which it becomes\nimpossible for the husband to live with his wife. We,\ntherefore, reject the submission of learned counsel for the\nappellant."

      "text": "The last act of the respondent, which according to the\nlearned counsel for the appellant, amounts to mental cruelty\nis that she lodged a complaint with the Women Protection\nCell, through her uncle and as a result of which the\nappellant and the members of his family had to seek\nanticipatory bail. The respondent in her evidence stated\nthat she had never lodged any complaint against the\nappellant or any members of his family with the Women\nProtection Cell. However, she stated that her parents\nsought help from Women Protection Cell for reconciliation\nthrough one of her relative who, at one time, happened to be\nthe Superintendent of Police. It is on the record that one\nof the functions of the Women Protection Cell is to bring\nabout reconciliation between the estranged spouses. There\nis no evidence on record to show that either the appellant\nor any member of his family were harassed by the Cell. The\nCell only made efforts to bring about reconciliation between\nthe parties but failed. Out of panic if the appellant and\nmembers of his family sought anticipatory bail, the\nrespondent cannot be blamed for that. Thus, we are of the\nopinion, that representation made by the parents of the\nrespondent to the Cell for reconciliation of the estranged\nspouses does not amount to mental cruelty caused to the\nappellant."
