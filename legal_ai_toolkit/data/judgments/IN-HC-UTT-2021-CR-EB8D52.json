Khulbe\n\nOffice Notes,\nreports, orders or\nSL. proceedings or\nDate COURT'S OR JUDGES'S ORDERS\nNo directions and\nRegistrar's order\nwith Signatures\nABA No.225 of 2021\nWith\nABA No.240 of 2021\nHon'ble R.C. Khulbe, J.\n\nMr. Aditya Singh, learned counsel for the\napplicants.\n\nMr. Deepak Bisht, learned B.H. for the State.\nThe applicants have filed the present\nanticipatory bail applications under\nSection 438\n\nCr.P.C. for the following common relief:-\n\n\"To direct that in case the applicant is arrested by\nthe investigating officer in connection with the FIR\nNo.83 of 2019 dated 22.08.2019 under\nSection 304B\n\nIPC, P.S. Clementown, District Dehradun\n(cognizance taken under\nSection 304B\nIPC vide order\ndated 25.01.2021 passed by the learned CJM,\nDehradun, in Criminal Case No.803 of 2021) she\nshall be released on bail on any condition which this\nHon'ble Court may set upon the applicant herein.\nIt is argued by learned counsel for the\napplicants that, initially, an FIR was lodged under\n\nSections 326\n,\n498-A\n,\n,\n,\nIPC and u/s ¾\n\nD.P. Act\nwith P.S. Clementown, District Dehradun\nagainst them; thereafter, they were arrested,\naccordingly, bail applications were filed, in which\nthis Court as well as the Coordinate Bench granted\nthem bail vide orders dated 06.12.2019 and\n15.01.2021 respectively. He further submitted that\nafter granting the bail, charge sheet was submitted\nagainst the applicants under\nSection 304B\nIPC also;\nhe submits that since the accused have already been\nenlarged on bail in the aforesaid offences;\naccordingly, they are also entitled for anticipatory\nbail under\nSection 304B\nIPC as well. It is also\nsubmitted by learned counsel for the applicants that,\nif any offence is added in the charge sheet, in that\ncircumstance, the accused will put their appearance\nand move an application for granting bail in added\noffence also, the concerned court will grant bail in\nthe added offence i.e. the original bail will continue\nin the added offence also, as per the law laid down\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court in the Constitutional\nBench in\nSushila Aggarwal and Others vs. State\n(NCT of Delhi) and Another\n, reported in (2020) 5\nSCC 1.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the accused and\nlearned counsel for the State. I have also gone\nthrough the ruling of the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\nWhen the matter came up for hearing before\nthe Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court\nin\nthe\nabove case\n(Supra), in paragraph no.7, following\ntwo questions were framed:-\n\n\"(1) Whether the protection granted to a\nperson under\nSection 438\nCr.P.C. should be\nlimited to a fixed period so as to enable the\nperson to surrender before the Trial Court\nand seek regular bail.\n\n(2) Whether the life of an anticipatory bail\nshould end at the time and stage when the\naccused is summoned by the court.\"\n\nFrom the perusal of the judgment (supra), it is\nclear that the questions framed in the aforesaid\nparagraph relate to the anticipatory bail under\n\nSection 438\nCr.P.C., although, in paragraph no.7.1,\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court also dealt with\nSections\nand\nCr.P.C., but in paragraph no.77.1, the\nApex Court clearly held that, 'the observations\nabout the width and amplitude of the power\nunder Section 438, made in answer to the first\nquestion, are equally relevant here too'.\n\nIt is clear that the Hon'ble Apex Court\nanswered the questions framed regarding the\nanticipatory bail as envisaged under Section 438\nCr.P.C. and not under Sections 437 and 439 Cr.P.C.\n\nAlthough, the Hon'ble Apex Court also\ndiscussed the judgment rendered in the case of\n\nPradeep Ram vs. State of Jharkhand and\nAnother\n, reported in (2019) 17 SCC 326, but the\nConstitutional Bench of the Apex Court did not\noverruled the judgment of\nPradeep Ram\n(supra).\n\nNow, it is a settled law, that if the anticipatory\nbail is granted, it will continue till the conclusion of\nthe trial; if some offences were added, then the\naccused will have a right to put his appearance and\nmove an application in the added offence also, the\nconcerned Court will enlarge the accused in the\nadded offence also, and there is no need to file fresh\nbail bonds and the anticipatory bail will continue.\n\nWhile in the present matter, no such\nanticipatory bail was granted to the accused. The\naccused were enlarged on regular bail only under\n\nSections 326\n,\n498-A\n,\n,\n,\nIPC and u/s ¾\n\nD.P. Act\n, but the charge sheet has subsequently\nbeen submitted under\nSection 304B\nIPC against the\naccused; accordingly, the Court cannot direct the\nsubordinate Court to enlarge the accused on bail on\nthe same sureties as furnished earlier.\n\nIn these circumstances, the present\nanticipatory bail applications are hereby rejected.\n\nPending applications, if any, stand disposed\nof.\n\n(R.C. Khulbe, J.)\n06.12.2021\nBS",
