JUSTICE ROBIN PHUKAN\n\nORDER\n\nDate : 10.08.2023\n(A.M. Bujor Barua)\nHeard Mr. KN Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. N\nGautam, learned counsel for the appellant in WA No. 46/2023 and WA No.\n162/2023 and Mr. MK Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. M\nSarma, learned counsel for the appellant in WA No. 239/2022. Also heard Mr. DK\nDas, learned counsel for the respondent Bhagwan Pator, Mr. D Mozumdar,\nlearned Additional Advocate General for the authorities in the State of the\nAssam and Mr. D Mahanta, learned counsel for the respondents No. 11, 12 and\n\n13 in WA No. 163/2023.\n\n2. The facts and circumstances leading to the present appeals flow from the\nConstitution Seventy Seventh Amendment introducing\nArticle 16(4A)\nby which it\nwas provided that nothing shall prevent the State from making any provisions\nfor reservation in the matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in\nthe services under the State in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes, which in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the\nservices under the State and the Constitution (Eighty Fifth) Amendment wherein\nan amendment was brought in to the\nArticle 16 (4A)\nproviding for reservation in\nthe matters of promotion with consequential seniority. The Constitution Seventy\nSeventh Amendment to the Constitution is as per the\nConstitution (Seventy\nSeventh Amendment) Act, 1995\nand the Constitution (Eighty Fifth) Amendment\nis as per the\nConstitution (Eighty Fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n.\n\n3. It has to be taken note that in the State of Assam by the\nAssam Act\nXII of\nPage No.# 10/35\n\n1979 i.e. the\nAssam Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of\nVacancies in Services and Posts) Act, 1978\n(in short, the Act of 1978), as per\nSection 5 thereof, reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the\nposts to be filled up by promotion was already statutorily provided for.\n\n4. After the Seventy Seventh and Eighty Fifth Amendment to the\nConstitution, the Government of Assam through the Department of Personnel\n(B) had issued an Office Memorandum under the signature of the Commissioner\nand Secretary to the Government of Assam in the Personnel Department\nbearing No. ABP.59/96/163 dated 12.03.2002 providing for consequential\nseniority to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Government servants on\ntheir promotion by virtue of the rules of reservation and the Office\nMemorandum clearly provides that such provision was consequent upon the\namendment of\nArticle 16(4A)\nof the Constitution of India by the\nConstitution\nEighty Fifth Amendment Act, 2001\n. In other words, it has to be understood that\nby virtue of\nSection 5\nof the Act of 1978 the provisions for reservation in\npromotion to the reserved category candidates was already introduced in the\nState of Assam prior to Seventy Seventh Amendment of the Constitution,\nwhereas by the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 even the consequential\nseniority upon such reservation on promotion being acted upon was also\nprovided pursuant to the Eighty Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n5. It is also to be taken note that by the\nAssam Act\nXIX of 2012 notified by\nthe Notification No. LGL.128/2011/40 dated 21.08.2012 and published in the\nAssam Gazette Extraordinary No. 383 dated 21.08.2012, Section 5A was\nintroduced after\nSection 5\nof the Act of 1978.\nSection 5A\nof the Act of 1978\nprovides for a post based roster for implementing reservation in promotion for\nthe members of reserved category. After the amendment of the Act of 1978 by\nPage No.# 11/35\n\nthe\nAssam Act\nXIX of 2012, the Office Memorandum bearing\nNo.TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-1/146 dated 29.12.2014 was issued under the signature\nof the Principal Secretary to the Government of Assam in the WPT & BC\nDepartment.\n\n6. The opening paragraph of the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014\nprovides that the guidelines were in order to implement the post based roster\nreservation in the matters of reservation of posts for Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes both plains and hills, in direct recruitment and promotions.\n\n7. Considering the nature of arguments raised, it would be relevant to take\nnote of the provisions of Clause 1.11 of the Office Memorandum dated\n29.12.2014 as well as Clause 14 which are extracted below:\n\n\"1.11 These rosters are an aid to determine the entitlement of different categories\nwith regard to the quota reserved for them in matters of appointment and promotion.\nThey are not intended to determine seniority in the cadre.\n\n14. All existing orders on the subject are deemed to have been amended to the\nextent herein.\"\n\n8. WP(C) No.1560/2015 and WP(C) No.2680/2015 were instituted by a\nregistered society in the name of Equality Forum and four other persons serving\nas Assistant Engineer (Civil) in the Irrigation Department and seeking promotion\nto the next cadre of Assistant Executive Engineer, respectively.\nIn both the writ\npetitions an issue was raised that as per the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in\nM. Nagaraj & Ors. Vs. Union of India\n&ors. reported in\n(\n2006)8 SCC 212 and U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. Vs. Rajesh Kumar\n& ors.\nreported in (2012)7 SCC 1, there is a requirement of the State to have a\nquantifiable data on the backwardness and inadequacy of the representation of\nPage No.# 12/35\n\nthe reserved category candidates for the purpose of promotion.\n\nAccording to the\npetitioners in the said two writ petitions, in the State of Assam no process was\ninitiated for obtaining the quantifiable data as required in\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra)\nand\nU.P. Power Corporation Ltd.\n(supra), apart from the report of an one man\ncommittee comprising of Sri H Sonowal, the then Commissioner and Secretary\nto the Government of Assam in the Welfare of Plains Tribes and Backward\nClasses, which report was also inadequate and unacceptable, and as such\nfurther continuation with the provisions of reservation in promotion as well as\nproviding for consequential seniority would be unsustainable in law.\n\nIn the said\ntwo writ petitions referred as Equality Forum, as reported in 2016(1) GLT 710,\nby the judgment and order dated 23.12.2015, in paragraph 47 thereof, it was\nprovided that till the exercise of collection of quantifiable data relating to the\nthree constitutional requirements of backwardness of the class, inadequacy of\nrepresentation in public service and overall efficiency in the administration in the\nevent of reservation, as mandated in\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra) and\nU.P. Power\nCorporation Ltd.\n(supra) is done and an opinion is formed by the State based\nupon the quantifiable data so collected as to whether the enabling provisions of\n\nArticle 16(4A)\nis to be invoked, reservation in promotion would remain in a\ndormant state.\nThe paragraph 47 of the judgment in Equality Forum (supra) is\nextracted hereinbelow:-\n\n\"47. In a separate proceeding relating to reservation in promotion in the\nIrrigation Department (MC No. 726 of 2014 in WP(C) No. 707 of 2014), this\nCourt held that there was no quantifiable data before the State regarding the 3\n(three) constitutional requirements, namely, backwardness of the class,\ninadequacy of representation in public services and overall efficiency in\nadministration in the event of reservation in promotion. It was held that in the\nabsence of such quantifiable data question of forming any opinion by the State\nto invoke the enabling provision of\nArticle 16 (4-A)\nwould not arise. Accordingly,\nit was held that till the exercise of collection of quantifiable data relating to the\nthree constitutional requirements as mandated in\nM Nagaraj\n(supra) and Uttar\nPage No.# 13/35\n\nPradesh Corporation Limited\n(supra) and formation of opinion by the State\nbased on the quantifiable data so collected that the enabling provision of\nArticle\n16 (4-A)\nis to be invoked was carried out, the 1978 Act as amended in 2012 in\nso far it provides for reservation in promotion would remain in a dormant state.\"\n\n9. In paragraph 67 of the judgment of Equality Forum (supra), it was\nprovided that the quantifiable data has to be both service and cadre specific and\nwhat the one man commission appointed by the Government of Assam to\ncollect the quantifiable data had done was that it had made a general statement\non the backwardness of the scheduled castes and schedule tribes and had not\nprovided quantifiable data either on the backwardness or on the inadequacy of\nrepresentation having regard to the promotional posts. It further provided that if\nupon undertaking the exercise of collecting data, it was found that in a\nparticular cadre there is adequate representation of the scheduled castes and\nschedule tribes, providing for reservation in promotion to such cadre would not\nbe justified. In paragraph 68 it was provided that in the event reservation is\nsought to be introduced, then an assessment of backwardness of the\ncommunities having regard to their representation in the promotional cadres\nwould have to be carried out. In paragraph 74 of the judgment in Equality\nForum (supra) it was provided that though the State had made provision for\nreservation in promotion by enacting the Act of 1978, which was amended in\nthe year 2012, implementation of the same would depend on acquiring the\nquantifiable data, which exercise has to be carried out cadre wise in the context\nof the service where the cadre is placed. Accordingly, it was provided that\nreservation in promotion would have to be justified with the help of the\nquantifiable data to show presence of two of the compelling reasons i.e.\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation cadre wise, which would then\nhave to be harmonized with the efficiency in administration as mandated under\n\nArticle 335.\nParagraph 74 of the judgment in Equality Forum (supra) is extracted\nPage No.# 14/35\n\nherein below:-\n\n\"74. As held in\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra), implementation of the scheme of\nreservation in promotion and collection of quantifiable data for the same to\nform an opinion on backwardness and inadequacy of representation and to\nharmonise the same with the constitutional limitation of efficiency in\nadministration under\nArticle 335\nis a categorical imperative. Collection of data\nand the opinion based thereon rendered by the One Man Commission do not\nconform to the norms\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in M. Nagaraj.\n\nTherefore,\nthere can be no manner of doubt that the exercise carried out by the One-Man\nCommission does not fulfil the mandate\nlaid down in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra). The\ncabinet memorandum prepared by the WPT and BC Department while\nforwarding the recommendation of the One Man Commission to the Cabinet for\napproval also completely missed the point by stating in paragraph 8\nthereof that the general established fact is that SCs and STs are comparatively\nlagging behind the general category in many areas like justice, social, economic\nand political fields; otherwise, the reservation provision would not have come\ninto existence in the Constitution. Therefore, according to the WPT and BC\nDepartment, further analytical study in this regard in the name of collecting\nquantifiable data would be denial of justice to the SCs and STs. I am afraid the\nWPT and BC Department had completely misdirected itself and had totally\noverlooked the mandate of the Apex Court in M. Nagaraj, which has vitiated the\ncabinet memorandum and the consequent approval of the Cabinet to such\nrecommendation. Though State has made provision for reservation in promotion\nby enacting the 1978 Act, which was amended in the year 2012,\nimplementation of the same would depend on acquiring of quantifiable data\nwith regard to the 2(two) compelling reasons, which exercise has to be carried\nout cadre-wise in the context of the service where the cadre is placed. That\nhaving not been done, the report of the One-Man Commission would be of no\nlegal consequence and would not enable the State to give effect to the\nprovisions of the 1978 Act as amended in so far reservation in promotion is\nconcerned. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that if the State desires to\ngive effect to the provisions of the 1978 Act as amended in the year 2012 by\nproviding for reservation in promotion, it would have to justify the same with\nthe help of quantifiable data to show presence of the 2(two) compelling\nreasons, backwardness and inadequacy of representation, cadre-wise in the\ncontext of the service where the cadre is placed, which would then have to be\nharmonised with efficiency in administration as mandated under\nArticle 335.\"\n\n10. Pursuant to the judgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum (supra), the\nGovernment of Assam in the Department of Welfare of Plains Tribes and\nBackward Classes issued the Office Memorandum No.TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-I/207\ndated 03.08.2016.\nThe opening paragraph of the said Office Memorandum\nPage No.# 15/35\n\ndated 03.08.2016 provides that it was issued as per the guidelines laid down by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra) and\nU.P. Power Corporation\nLtd.\n(supra).\nThereafter in the first paragraph itself reference is made to the\nreport of the one man committee appointed by the Government of Assam for\ncollecting quantifiable data which was assailed before the High Court in Equality\nForum (supra) and accordingly, the provisions of the judgment dated\n23.12.2015 in Equality Forum (supra) is referred and quoted. The subject matter\nof the Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 is stated to be \"Review of\nGovernment Policy of Reservation in Promotion with reference to the Hon'ble\nGauhati High Court judgments\".\n\n11. The Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 is extracted as below:\n\n\" GOVERNMENT OF ASSAM\nDEPARTMENT OF WELFARE OF PLAINS TRIBES AND BACKWARD CLASSES\nDISPUR ::::ASSAM\nNo. TAD/BC/68/2011/Pt-I/207 dated Dispur 3 rd August, 2016\nOFFICE MEMORANDUM\nSubject: Review of Government Policy of Reservation in Promotion with reference to\nthe Hon'ble Gauhati High Court judgments\n\n-------\n\n---------\n\nWith a view to bringing the policy of reservation in promotion for reserved\ncategories in line with the directions of the Hon'ble High Court, Government have\nreviewed the existing procedure of effecting reservation in promotion and accordingly\nlays down the following guidelines to be followed while considering promotion in any\ncadre in any establishment\n\ni) The policy of reservation in promotion shall continue.\n\nii) ii) Each establishment while taking up the process of promotion in a\nparticular cadre of a service, shall examine the representation of SC, ST\n(P) and ST (H) candidates in the cadre in comparison with the prescribed\npercentage of reservation and calculate shortfall if any, in the cadre with\nreference to that particular year. Shortfall of reservation of a particular\nPage No.# 16/35\n\nreserved category in a cadre means the difference between the total\nnumber of reserved posts for that category in the cadre and the number\nof persons of that category holding the posts in the cadre. While\ncalculating the shortfall, all candidates belonging to the same category\n[SC or ST(P) or ST (H)] shall be taken into account irrespective of the\nmode of their entry into the cadre i.e. whether on account of seniority-\n\ncum-merit or merit cum seniority, as the case may be, or through any\nother process admissible in law or by way of reservation. If in a\nparticular cadre, SCs and STs are not adequately represented and\nshortfall is found to exist in the cadre, they may be considered as\nbackward insofar as that particular cadre is concerned. Such shortfall\nshall be filled up by the concerned category of incumbents within the\nzone of consideration either on account of seniority-cum-merit/ merit-\ncum-seniority or by way of providing reservation as the case may be, till\nthe prescribed percentage in respect of the said category is achieved.\n\niii) If no eligible incumbent belonging to the shortfall category is available\nwithin the zone of consideration, this will further substantiate the status\nof backwardness and inadequate representation of category in the cadre\nand therefore the number of posts that are required to meet the\ncalculated shortfall shall be kept vacant and the vacancy shall be carried\nforward and filled up in the next year. In case, sufficient number of SC or\nST (P) or ST (H) candidates fit for promotion against reserved posts are\nnot available and if the posts cannot be allowed to remain vacant on\ngrounds of maintaining efficiency in administration, the appointing\nauthority may with full justification, refer the vacancy to the Department\nof WPT and BC for de-reservation, subject to the condition that no\ncandidate belonging to the category for which the post is reserved is\navailable within the zone of consideration placed before the annual\nSelection Committee/ Departmental Promotion Committee for two\nconsecutive years. In other words, the concerned Department may move\nproposal for de-reservation in the third year.\n\niv) If an occasion arises during the promotion process, in which stipulated\npercentage in respect of reserved category is met, but in the gradation\nlist/ seniority list there are candidates of reserved category who on merit\nis entitled to the promotion, his / her case shall be considered for\npromotion on merit if such candidate has not gained the seniority by way\nof any accelerated promotion earlier.\n\nv) As regards the question of maintaining administrative efficiency as\nrequired under\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution of India, Hon'ble High\nCourt held that, \"......it should be assessed applying objective measurable\nstandards.\" In that sense, the Annual confidential Reports (ACR)/ Annual\nPerformance Appraisal Reports (APAR) of the incumbent along with the\nlength of service, participation in training programs concerning job\nrequirements, acquisition of degrees or diplomas or diplomas on subjects\nPage No.# 17/35\n\nif mandatory to the job, should be considered as the yardstick of\nmeasuring efficiency.\n\nvi) It shall be the responsibility of the concerned appointing authority to\nprovide adequate information concerning the above to the Selection\nCommittee (Department Promotion Committee ) which shall evaluate all\nrelevant parameters while making its recommendation.\n\nThis shall come into force with immediate effect.\n\nSd/-\n\n(Rajiv Kumar Bora IAS)\nAdditional Chief Secretary to the Govt. of Assam, WT & BC\nDepartment, Dispur.\"\n\n12. The respondent No. 1 in WA No. 46/2023 namely, Shri Bhagwan Pator\ninstituted WP(C) No. 5005/2016 assailing the Clauses (iii) and (iv) of the Office\nMemorandum dated 03.08.2016 on the ground that it would have been an\neffect of de-reservation in respect of promotion and secondly, promotion on the\nbasis of merit which is otherwise due to the reserved category candidates would\nbe taken away. The society Equality Forum which had earlier instituted the writ\npetition resulting in the judgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum (supra)\nhad instituted WP(C) No. 5026/2016 assailing the entire Office Memorandum\ndated 03.08.2016 on the ground that although in paragraph 47 of the judgment\nin Equality Forum (supra), it was provided that the reservation in promotion\nwould be kept in a dormant state till such time the quantifiable data is collected\nby the State in respect of backwardness and inadequacy of representation of\nthe reserved candidates and also harmonize with the efficiency in administration\nas required under\nArticle 335\n, but by the Office Memorandum, reservation in\npromotion is sought to be brought back without adhering to the requirement of\ncollection of quantifiable data.\n\n13. The two writ petitions being WP(C)No.5005/2016 and WP(C)5026/2016\nPage No.# 18/35\n\nwas decided by the learned Single Judge by the Judgment and Order dated\n06.06.2022.\n\n14. Without going into the arguments and counter arguments that were raised\nby the parties in the aforesaid two writ petitions, we take note of the\ndeterminations that had been made by the learned Single Judge at paragraph 7\nof the said judgment dated 06.06.2022 which are extracted as below:\n\n\"7. The aforesaid determinations can be summarized in the following manner:\n\nI. The Policy of the state in providing reservation in promotion with\nconsequential seniority is discernable from\nSection 5\nof the 1978 Act read\nwith O.M. dated 12.03.2002.\n\nII. The Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 shall hold the field till such\npolicy is expressly repealed by the State.\n\nIII. III. O.M. dated. 03.06.2016 is notified laying procedure for collection of\nquantifiable data on Backwardness and inadequacy of representation and\ndetermining efficiency in administration while giving effect to such policy of\nproviding reservation.\"\n\n15. In paragraph D(iii) of the said judgment it has further been held as\nextracted:\n\n\"D(iii) That being the position, this court un-hesitantly holds that the policy of\nproviding reservation in promotion with consequential seniority being holding the field\nas per O.M. dated 12.03.2002, the State is not within its competence and jurisdiction to\ndeprive such service benefit to a meritorious reserved category candidates and that too\nwithout expressly bringing such policy by superseding the benefit granted under O.M.\ndated 12.03.2002.\"\n\n16. From the judgment and order dated 06.06.2022 of the learned Single\nJudge, it is discernible that in respect of the challenge to Clause (iv) of the\nOffice Memorandum dated 20.01.2016, it has been provided that the policy of\nPage No.# 19/35\n\nproviding reservation in promotion with consequential seniority having been\nholding the field as per the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002, the State is\nnot within its competence and jurisdiction to deprive such benefit to a\nmeritorious reserved category candidate and that too without expressly bringing\nsuch policy by superseding the benefits granted under the Office Memorandum\ndated 12.03.2002. With regard to the challenge of the society Equality Forum as\nregards the entire Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016, it has been provided\nin the order dated 06.06.2022 of the learned Single Judge in paragraph 7(VIII)\nthat given the dictum of the Honb'ble Supreme Court in\nJarnail Singh Vs. Laxmi\nNarayan Gupta\nreported in 2018 (10) SCC 396, the judgment dated 23.12.2015\nrendered in Equality Forum (supra) has become redundant.\n\nIn other words, by\nthe judgment dated 06.06.2022 in WP(C) No. 5005/2016 and WP(C) No.\n5026/2016, the learned Single Judge firstly held that Clause (iv) of the Office\nMemorandum dated 03.08.2016 has to be interpreted in a manner that the\npolicy of reservation in promotion with consequential seniority benefit having\nbeen provided by the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002, it is beyond the\ncompetence of the State to deny service benefit to a meritorious reserved\ncategory candidate without superseding the earlier Office Memorandum dated\n12.03.2002 and with regard to the claim of the society Equality Forum that\nalthough in paragraph 47 of the judgment in Equality Forum (supra) it has been\nprovided that till the quantifiable data is collected the policy of reservation shall\nremain dormant but the requirement of keeping the policy dormant shall not\nhold good in view of the subsequent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nrendered in\nJarnail Singh-I\n(supra).\n\n17. Smti. Ivy Gohain Dasgupta who is an unreserved category candidate and is\na respondent in WP(C)No.2999/2020 had instituted IA(C) No.2033/2022 seeking\nPage No.# 20/35\n\nleave to file an appeal against the judgment and order dated 06.06.2022 in\nWP(C)No.5005/2016 and WP(C)5026/2016 on the ground that the conclusions\narrived therein had adversely affected the legal rights of the said applicant.\nAlong with the interlocutory application, a memo of writ appeal was also\npresented before the Registry which was not numbered at that stage. IA(C)No.\n2033/2022 was given its consideration by the order dated 31.12.2023 granting\nleave to Smti. Ivy Gohain Dasgupta to prefer an appeal against the judgment\nand order dated 06.06.2006 in WP(C) No. 5005/2016 and WP(C) No.\n5026/2016. In the circumstance WA No. 46/2023 had been registered. Some of\nthe unreserved category candidates had instituted WA No.162/2023 also being\naggrieved by the judgment and order dated 06.06.2022 in WP(C)No. 5005/2016\nand WP(C) No. 5026/2016.\n\n18. The society Equality Forum who were the writ petitioner in\nWP(C)No.5026/2016 had instituted WA No.239/2022 on their own grounds\nbeing aggrieved by the conclusion of the learned Single Judge as regards their\nplea that inspite of the judgment in Equality Forum (supra) in paragraph 47,\nreservation in promotion have not been kept in a dormant state and by the\nOffice Memorandum dated 03.08.2016, reservation in promotion was allowed in\nsome manner without collecting the necessary quantifiable date.\n\n19. Mr. KN Choudhury, learned senior counsel for the appellant Smti. Ivy\nGohain Dasgupta and the other appellants in WA No.162/2023 has raised the\ncontention that by the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 the consequential\nseniority meted to the reserved category candidates by the earlier Office\nMemorandum dated 12.03.2002 had been superseded, meaning thereby that\nthe provisions of the consequential seniority pursuant to the enabling provisions\nof the Constitution (Eighty Fifth) amendment had been withdrawn. Accordingly,\nPage No.# 21/35\n\nMr. KN Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel assails the conclusion of the learned\nSingle Judge in the judgment and order dated 06.06.2022 in\nWP(C)No.5005/2016 and WP(C)5026/2016.\n\n20. As regards Clause (iv) of the Office Memorandum dated 03.08.2016 it is the\nsubmission of Mr. KN Choudhury, learned senior counsel that as consequential\nseniority itself has been withdrawn by the State authority no further question\nremains on any claim of the reserved category candidates for consideration on\nmerit pursuant to their consequential seniority. Mr. KN Choudhury, learned\nSenior Counsel substantiated his contentions by referring to Clauses 1.11 and\n14 of the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 that a conjoint reading of the\nprovisions of the said two clauses would make it apparent that the earlier\nprovision of consequential seniority meted by the Office Memorandum dated\n12.03.2002 had been withdrawn. It is also the submission of Mr. KN Choudhury,\nlearned Senior Counsel that consequential seniority is pursuant to an enabling\nprovision under\nArticle 16 (4A)\nof the Constitution as introduced by the\nConstitution (Eighty Fifth) amendment and, therefore, it being an enabling\nprovision, it always remain a discretion of the State authorities to withdraw the\nconsequential seniority as per their requirement.\n\n21. Mr. DK Das, learned counsel for the respondent Sri Bhagwan Pator per\ncontra contends that Clauses 1.11 and 14 of the Office Memorandum dated\n29.12.2014 even on a conjoint reading do not indicate in any manner that the\nconsequential seniority meted by the earlier Office Memorandum dated\n12.03.2002 had been withdrawn.\n\n22. Mr. MK Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant Equality Forum\non the other hand has raised the contention that the provisions of paragraph 47\nof the judgment in Equality Forum (supra) [hereinafter for convenience referred\nPage No.# 22/35\n\nas Equality Forum-I(supra)] was explicit enough to provide that till such time\nthe quantifiable data on the elements of backwardness and inadequacy in\nrepresentation coupled with a harmonization of administrative efficiency under\n\nArticle 335\nis obtained, the provisions for reservation in promotion would remain\ndormant, and therefore as no collection of any such quantifiable data has been\nput on record, the embargo provided by paragraph 47 of the judgment in\nEquality Forum (supra) prevails and no such benefit of reservation in promotion\ncan be given to any of the reserved category candidates let alone giving any\nconsequential seniority.\n\n23. Mr. DK Das, learned counsel for the respondents who represents all the\nreserved category candidates per contra raises the contention that in\nJarnail\nSingh-I\n(supra) in paragraphs 32 and 36 the Supreme Court having provided\nthat the provisions in\nM Nagaraj\n(supra), providing that the State has to collect\nquantifiable data showing backwardness of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled\nTribe being contrary to the Nine Judges Bench in\nIndra Sawhany Vs. Union of\nIndia and Others\nreported in 1992 Supp.(3) SCC 217, to be invalid to such\nextent that as there is a presumption of backwardness in favour of the\nScheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, therefore there may not be\na further requirement to obtain any quantifiable data to substantiate their\nbackwardness.\n\n24. The relevant portion of the paragraphs 32 and 36 of\nJarnail Singh-I\n(supra)\nare extracted as below:\n\n\"32. It will be seen that this Bill contains two things that are different from\nArticle\n16(4-A)\nas already enacted. First and foremost, it clarifies that the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes that are notified under\nArticles 341\nand\nshall be deemed\nto be backward, which makes it clear that no quantifiable data is necessary to\ndetermine backwardness.....\"\n\nPage No.# 23/35\n\n36. Thus, we conclude that the judgment in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n,\n(2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] does not need to be referred to a\nseven-Judge Bench.\n\nHowever, the conclusion in\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n,\n(2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] that the State has to collect quantifiable\ndata showing backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, being\ncontrary to the nine-Judge Bench in\nIndra Sawhney (1) [Indra Sawhney v. Union of\nIndia\n, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1] is held to be invalid to this\nextent.\"\n\n25. Mr. DK Das, learned counsel also refers to the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt rendered in\nM Nagaraj\n(supra), wherein in paragraph 47 it has been\nprovided that the collection of data as regards inadequacy in representation of\nthe reserved category candidates would have to be done cadre wise and\nsubmits that as the collection of data as regards inadequacy would have to be\ndone cadre wise, therefore, there cannot be a centralized procedure set in place\nfor collection of the data regarding inadequacy in representation and such\ninadequacy would have to be determined cadre wise and case wise in respect of\nevery such promotion under consideration in respect of any given cadre.\n\n26. It is the further contention of Mr. DK Das, learned counsel for the reserved\ncategory candidates that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nB.K. Pavitra and others\nVs. Union of India and others\n, reported in (2019) 16 SCC 129 , in paragraph 126\nhad held that the framers of the Constitution did not define what is meant by\nthe phrase \"efficiency of administration\" and that\nArticle 335\ncannot be\nconstrued on the basis of a stereotypical assumption that roster point\npromotees drawn from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not\nefficient or that efficiency is reduced by appointing them. It is also provided in\nparagraph 116 of\nthe said judgment\nthat no citizen can be discriminated on\naccount of religion or race.\n\n27.\nParagraphs 116 and 126 of B.K. Pavitra\n(supra) are extracted as below:\n\nPage No.# 24/35\n\n\"116. By recognising that formal equality of opportunity will be insufficient in fulfilling\nthe transformative goal of the Constitution, these members recognised that the\nconception of equality of opportunity must recognise and account for existing societal\ninequalities. The most revealing debates as to how the Constituent Assembly\nunderstood equality of opportunity under the Constitution took place on 30-11-1948.\n\nMembers debated draft\nArticle 10 (which would go on to become\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution).\nIn these debates, some members understood sub-clause (4) (providing\nfor reservations) as an exception to the general rule of formal equality enunciated in\nsub-clause (1). Illustratively, an articulation of this position was made by Mohammad\nIsmail Khan, who stated : (CAD Vol. VII)\n\"... there can be only one of these two things--either there can be clear equal\nopportunity or special consideration.\nArticle 10\nsays there shall be equality of\nopportunity, then it emphasises the fact by a negative clause that no citizen shall be\ndiscriminated on account of religion or race. It is quite good, but when no indication is\ngiven whether this would override\nArticle 296\nor\nArticle 296\nis independent of it, we\nare certainly left in the lurch. What would be the fate of the minorities? [\nArticle 296\n\nstated that special considerations shall be shown to minorities to ensure\nrepresentation in the services]...\"\n\n126. The Constitution does not define what the Framers meant by the phrase\n\"efficiency of administration\".\nArticle 335\ncannot be construed on the basis of a\nstereotypical assumption that roster point promotees drawn from the SCs and STs are\nnot efficient or that efficiency is reduced by appointing them. This is stereotypical\nbecause it masks deep-rooted social prejudice. The benchmark for the efficiency of\nadministration is not some disembodied, abstract ideal measured by the performance\nof a qualified open category candidate. Efficiency of administration in the affairs of the\nUnion or of a State must be defined in an inclusive sense, where diverse segments of\nsociety find representation as a true aspiration of governance by and for the people. If,\nas we hold, the Constitution mandates realisation of substantive equality in the\nengagement of the fundamental rights with the directive principles, inclusion together\nwith the recognition of the plurality and diversity of the nation constitutes a valid\nconstitutional basis for defining efficiency. Our benchmarks will define our outcomes. If\nthis benchmark of efficiency is grounded in exclusion, it will produce a pattern of\ngovernance which is skewed against the marginalised. If this benchmark of efficiency\nis grounded in equal access, our outcomes will reflect the commitment of the\nConstitution to produce a just social order. Otherwise, our past will haunt the inability\nof our society to move away from being deeply unequal to one which is founded on\nliberty and fraternity. Hence, while interpreting\nArticle 335\n, it is necessary to liberate\nthe concept of efficiency from a one-sided approach which ignores the need for and\nthe positive effects of the inclusion of diverse segments of society on the efficiency of\nPage No.# 25/35\n\nadministration of the Union or of a State. Establishing the position of the SCs and STs\nas worthy participants in affairs of governance is intrinsic to an equal citizenship. Equal\ncitizenship recognises governance which is inclusive but also ensures that those\nsegments of our society which have suffered a history of prejudice, discrimination and\noppression have a real voice in governance. Since inclusion is inseparable from a well-\ngoverned society, there is, in our view, no antithesis between maintaining the\nefficiency of administration and considering the claims of the SCs and STs to\nappointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a\nState.\"\n\n28. Accordingly, it is the contention of Mr. DK Das, learned counsel for the\nreserved category candidates that the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India having\ndone away with the requirement of collection of quantifiable data regarding\nbackwardness and also having held that collection of quantifiable data regarding\ninefficiency in administration cannot be on a stereotypical assumption that\nreserved category candidates are otherwise inefficient in administration, what\nfurther remains is the collection of quantifiable data in respect of adequacy or\ninadequacy of representation of reserved category candidates. But, again the\ncollection of quantifiable data in respect of adequacy or inadequacy of\nrepresentation had also been circumscribed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nJarnail Singh and Others Vs. Lachmi Narain Gupta and Others\nin Civil Appeal No.\n629/2022 (Jarnail Singh-II) and therefore such collection of quantifiable data\nwould now have to be understood as per the circumscribed requirement as\nprovided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. As the circumscribed requirement is to\ncollect quantifiable data cadre wise and service wise, therefore, it would be\nmore prudent if instead of undertaking an exercise to obtain the quantifiable\ndata in a comprehensive manner applicable for the whole of the State in respect\nof all such cadres and services that are in place, the same purpose can be\nachieved if the Departmental Promotion Committee while considering any\npromotion to the respective cadres, before proceeding with the promotion,\nPage No.# 26/35\n\nobtains the quantifiable data regarding adequacy or inadequacy of\nrepresentation of reserved category candidates in respect of such promoted\ncadre for which the promotion process would be undertaken.\n\n29. With regard to the contention raised by Mr. KN Choudhury, learned senior\ncounsel for the appellant Smti. Ivy Gohain Dasgupta and the other appellants\nthat the provision for consequential seniority having been provided by the\nConstitution (Eight Fifth) amendment, which itself is an enabling provision, it is\nalways the discretion of the State authorities who provides for such\nconsequential seniority to also withdraw the provision of the consequential\nseniority, it is taken note that an enabling provision in a statute is understood to\nbe a provision which does not provide for any specific provision, but the\nstatutory provision enables the executive to provide for such provision, if\notherwise advised or justified under the law, meaning thereby that it is a\ndiscretion vested on the executive authority through delegation to either provide\nfor or not to provide for such provisions. The only compelling circumstance that\nremains would be that once in exercise of the enabling provision if a particular\nprovision is provided for, till such provision remains in place, it would be binding\nfor all as regards the requirement to implement such provision. But, at the same\ntime, in the same manner in which a discretion was vested in the executive\nauthorities to provide for such provision, if so advised and justified under the\nlaw, equally it would also be open for the State authorities to withdraw such\nprovision as per their own discretion again subject to if justified in the\ncircumstance as well as under law. From such point of view, we are in\nagreement with Mr. KN Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel that the Office\nMemorandum dated 29.12.2014 could have also withdrawn the benefit of\nconsequential seniority meted to the reserved category candidate by the earlier\nPage No.# 27/35\n\nOffice Memorandum dated 12.03.2002. But at the same time, although the\nenabling provision enables the State authorities to withdraw such benefit, but\nwhat would further have to be examined as to whether the Office Memorandum\ndated 29.12.2014 in fact withdraws the benefit of consequential seniority meted\nby the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002.\n\n30. To substantiate the contention that the Office Memorandum dated\n29.12.2014 had in fact withdrawn the consequential seniority earlier given by\nthe Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002, Mr. KN Choudhury, learned Senior\nCounsel relies upon the Clauses 1.11 and 14 of the Office Memorandum dated\n29.12.2014. A reading of Clause 1.11 of the Office Memorandum dated\n29.12.2014 makes it discernible that the rosters are in aid to determine the\nentitlement of different categories with regard to the quota reserved for them,\nbut they are not entitled to determine the seniority. In other words, we are\nrequired to interpret the meaning of the word 'they' appearing in Clause 1.11.\n\n31. The expression 'they' refers to the earlier sentence in Clause 1.11 i.e. that\nthe rosters are an aid to determine the entitlement of different categories. In\nother words, the expression 'they' refers to the rosters. The first paragraph of\nthe Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 provides that the Office\nMemorandum had been issued consequent upon the amendment to the Act of\n1978 and the acceptance of the recommendation of the one man commission\nconstituted by the Government of Assam.\n\n32. We have taken note that the recommendation of the one man commission\nreferred in the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 had in the meantime been\nheld to be unacceptable as per the judgment of this Court in Equality Forum\n(supra). At this stage, we take note that in fact there are two judgments\navailable, both in respect of petitions instituted by the society Equality Forum.\n\nPage No.# 28/35\n\nOne such is the judgment dated 23.12.2015 rendered in WP(C) No. 1560/2015\nand WP(C) No. 2680/2015, reported in 2016 (1) GLT 710 and the other is the\njudgment and order dated 06.06.2022 in WP(C) No. 5005/2016 and WP(C) No.\n5026/2016. For clarity and convenience, we refer the judgment rendered in\nEquality Forum (supra) reported in 2016 (1) GLT 710 to be Equality Forum-I and\nthe judgment dated 06.06.2022 in WP(C) No. 5005/2016 and WP(C) No.\n5026/2016 to be Equality Forum-II.\n\n33. In other words, the purport of the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014\nhas to be understood that it was issued consequent upon the amendment to the\nAct of 1978. As noted above, by the\nAssam Act\nXIX of 2012, the Act of 1978\nhad been amended by which Section 5A thereof had been introduced. It had\nalso been taken note hereinabove that\nSection 5A\nof the Act of 1978 provides\nfor post based roster for implementing reservation in promotion.\n\n34. As the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 had been issued consequent\nupon the amendment by which\nSection 5A\nof the Act of 1978 had been\nintroduced, the word 'roster' in Clause 1.11 and the further provision that the\nroster do not intend to determine seniority would have to be understood in the\ncontext of Section 5A. All that\nSection 5A\nof the Act of 1978 provides is that\nearlier the reservation in promotion was given effect by following the procedure\nof vacancies, but upon introduction of Section 5A, the same would be done by\nfollowing the roster point in the roster scale.\n\n35. If a reservation in promotion is given effect or implemented based upon\nthe roster point in the roster scale, there is always a possibility that a reserved\ncategory candidate may be promoted against the post which may be a little\nhigher up in the roster scale as the said roster point post may have fallen\nvacant. In that circumstance, the provision of Clause 1.11 would have to be\nPage No.# 29/35\n\nunderstood that the seniority referred therein related to the roster would mean\nthat if a reserved category candidate is promoted against a roster post which\nwould be a little higher in the roster scale in comparison to the other promotees\nwho may be a little lower in the roster scale, the same will not entail any\nseniority over the others, who were also promoted in the same process but\nplaced perhaps a little lower in the roster scale. In other words, placement of a\nreserved category candidate in a given roster point irrespective of the position\nwould not determine the seniority of such candidates and the seniority would be\ndetermined otherwise under the law depending on the manner and\ncircumstance in which the promotion was given effect.\n\n36. It being the meaning of the provision of Clause 1.11, it must be\nunderstood that Clause 1.11 of the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 does\nnot relate to any consequential seniority of a reserved category candidate. In\nthe context of the meaning attributed to Clause 1.11 in the manner indicated\nabove, when we read the provision of Clause 14 of the Office Memorandum\ndated 29.12.2014, it is noticed that the said Clause provides that all existing\norders on the subject are deemed to have been amended to the extent as\nprovided in the said Office Memorandum. The expression 'are deemed to have\nbeen amended to the extent hereinabove' would mean that it also includes the\nextent as provided in Clause 1.11 meaning thereby that the aspect of\ndetermination of seniority provided therein is not related to any consequential\nseniority, but it relates to a provision that by following the roster point system, if\na reserved category candidate is promoted in a post, which is otherwise a little\nhigher in the roster scale, it being positioned in the higher in the roster scale,\nwill not determine the seniority of that person over others who may be\npromoted against a post in the roster scale which may be a little lower.\n\nPage No.# 30/35\n\n37. Accordingly, it would have to be concluded that a conjoint reading of\nClause 1.11 and Clause 14 of the Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2014 would\nmean that the consequential seniority that was otherwise meted by the Office\nMemorandum dated 12.03.2002 had not been withdrawn.\n\n38. With regard to the contention of Mr. MK Choudhury, learned senior\ncounsel for the petitioner in WA No. 239/2022, we take note that as per\nparagraph 47 of the judgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum-I (supra)\nthere is an expressed prohibition by a judicial pronouncement that till such\nquantifiable data on backwardness, inadequacy of the representation and\ninefficiency in administration is collected no reservation in promotion in favour of\nthe reserved category candidates can be further carried forward. But paragraph\n74 of the judgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum-I (supra) provides for\ncollection of quantifiable data in respect of backwardness of the reserved\ncategory candidates as well as inadequacy of their representation which again\nwould have to be determined cadre wise and service wise in the respective\ndepartments and further, upon such data being obtained there would be a\nrequirement of harmonization with the efficiency in administration as provided\nunder\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution of India.\nBut the requirement of the\nprovisions in the judgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum-I (supra) would\nagain have to be read in the context of the submissions of Mr. DK Das, learned\ncounsel for the unreserved category candidates that in paragraph 36 of\nJarnail\nSingh-I\n(supra) there is a presumption in law in favour of backwardness of the\nreserved category candidates and in view of such presumption in law there is no\nfurther requirement of obtaining any quantifiable data to substantiate the\nbackwardness.\n\n39. The said provision being rendered by a Constitution Bench judgment of\nPage No.# 31/35\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court, when read together with the provisions of the\njudgment in Equality Forum-I (supra) it has to be understood that there would\nbe no further requirement under the law for any collection of quantifiable data\nto substantiate the backwardness of the reserved category candidates inasmuch\nas there is a presumption in law as regards the existence of backwardness.\n\nFurther, we also have to take note that in paragraph 47 of the judgment of\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nJarnail Singh-II\n(supra) it has been provided that the\nadequacy or inadequacy of representation of reserved category candidates\nwould have to be determined cadre wise, service wise and in the given relevant\ndepartment.\nThe said provision is also consistent with the provisions in\nparagraph 74 of the judgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum-I (supra)\nthat the collection of quantifiable data regarding adequacy or inadequacy of\nrepresentation would have to be determined cadre wise, service wise and\ndepartment wise.\n\n40. If the determination of the quantifiable data is for adequacy or\ninadequacy of representation of the reserved category candidates in a given\ncadre of a service in a particular department of the Government, we are in\nagreement with the contentions raised by Mr. DK Das, learned counsel for the\nrespondent Sri Bhagwan Pator that it would be more prudent and appropriate to\nundertake such exercise through the Departmental Promotion Committee (in\nshort, DPC) itself before embarking upon a promotion process for a given cadre.\nThe same would be prudent inasmuch as the DPC will have all the data before it\nas to the cadre strength of the promoted cadre where the promotion is to be\nconsidered and out of the total cadre strength how many posts in the cadre are\nto be earmarked for the reserved category candidates and out of the earmarked\nreserved category posts how many posts are being occupied by the reserved\nPage No.# 32/35\n\ncategory candidates. In other words, if the reserved category candidates are\noccupying all the posts earmarked for the reserved category candidates in a\ngiven cadre it can be easily understood that in that given cadre there is an\nadequacy of the representation of the reserved category candidates and in the\nevent the number of the reserved category candidates in the cadre is less than\nthe number of posts earmarked for the reserved category candidates, it has to\nbe understood that there is an inadequacy of representation in that given cadre.\nIf the determination would be made in the above manner, we are of the view\nthat it would be more appropriate and apposite for the DPC to make such\ndetermination. But again such determination would have to be made before\ninitiating the actual promotion process.\n\n41. As regards the third requirement of obtaining quantifiable data that it\nshould also harmonize with the inefficiency in administration, we take note of\nthe provisions of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nB.K. Pavitra-II\n\n(supra) wherein in paragraph 126 it has been provided that inefficiency in\nadministration referred to\nArticle 335\ncannot be construed on the basis of a\nstereotypical assumption that roster point promotees drawn from the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes communities are not efficient or that efficiency is\nreduced by appointing them and secondly, the provisions in paragraph 116 of\n\nthe said judgment\nwherein by referring to the Constituent Assembly debates in\nrespect of the position expressed by Mohammad Ismail Khan no citizen shall be\ndiscriminated on account of religion or race meaning thereby that an\ninterpretation is sought to be given that, if across the board the reserved\ncategory candidates are construed to be inefficient or contributing to the\ninefficiency in the administration without specific factual determination, it would\nbe a discrimination on account of race which would be impermissible under\nPage No.# 33/35\n\nArticle 15\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n42. As a determination of the quantifiable data on the inefficiency in\nadministration across the board in respect of reserved category candidates\nwould amount to a discrimination on account of race which is prohibited under\n\nArticle 15\nof the Constitution of India, we also have to hold that the requirement\nof obtaining quantifiable data on effect of inefficiency in administration because\nof the reservation in promotion meted to the reserved category candidates\nwould also be a violation of\nArticle 15\nof the Constitution of India and hence,\nimpermissible.\n\n43. As the three contentions raised by Mr. MK Choudhury, learned Senior\nCounsel for the petitioner in WA No. 239/2022 are answered as indicated above,\nmeaning thereby that as per the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nrendered in paragraph 36 in the\nJarnail Singh-I\n(supra) there is no requirement\nof obtaining quantifiable data as regards backwardness and as per the judgment\nrendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraphs 116 and 126 of\nB.K.\nPavitra-II\n(supra) quantifiable data on inefficiency in administration across the\nboard in respect of the reserved category candidates cannot be obtained and\nfurther as the quantifiable data in respect of adequacy or inadequacy of the\nrepresentation of the reserved category candidates can also be done at the level\nof the DPC in respect of the cadre for which the promotion process had been\ninitiated, we are of the view that the prohibition imposed by paragraph 47 in\njudgment dated 23.12.2015 in Equality Forum-I (supra) would have to be\nunderstood in the manner indicated.\nIn other words as there would not be any\nrequirement of obtaining quantifiable data on backwardness and inefficiency in\nadministration and obtaining the data regarding adequacy or inadequacy of the\nrepresentation can be done at the level of the DPC, the prohibition imposed by\nPage No.# 34/35\n\nparagraph 47 in Equality Forum-I (supra) would now no longer hold good\nsubject to the condition that the DPC before embarking upon each and every\npromotion process undertakes an exercise to determine the adequacy or\ninadequacy of representation of the reserved category candidates in that\nparticular given cadre where promotion is sought to be made.\n\n44. Now, as regards the interpretation of Clause (iv) of the Office\nMemorandum dated 03.08.2016 we again quote the said provisions which is as\nbelow:\n\niv) If an occasion arises during the promotion process, in which stipulated\npercentage in respect of reserved category is met, but in the gradation list/ seniority list\nthere are candidates of reserved category who on merit is entitled to the promotion,\nhis / her case shall be considered for promotion on merit if such candidate has not\ngained the seniority by way of any accelerated promotion earlier.\n\n45. A reading of the Clause (iv) makes it discernable that if an occasion arises\nduring the promotion process in which stipulated percentage in respect of\nreserved category is met but in the gradation list/seniority list there are\ncandidates of reserved category candidates who on merit are also entitled to a\npromotion, his/her cases are to be considered for promotion on merit only if\nsuch candidate has not given seniority by way of any accelerated promotion. It\nwould mean that if a reserved category candidate is seeking for a promotion\nagainst any post in the promoted cadre which is earmarked for a reserved\ncategory candidate, he would be entitled to the benefits of consequential\nseniority as provided in the Office Memorandum dated 12.03.2002 but on the\nother hand if the posts earmarked for the reserved category candidates are\nalready exhausted by being occupied by the reserved category candidates but in\nthe gradation lists there remains some further reserved category candidates,\nthey can compete for promotion against the unreserved posts but in such event\nPage No.# 35/35\n\nthey would not be entitled to the benefits under the consequential seniority and\non the other hand if on the basis of their seniority otherwise i.e. without taking\nnote of the consequential seniority they are within the zone of consideration,\nsuch candidates can be considered for promotion.\n\n46. Upon the issues being raised in the present appeals having been decided\nin the manner indicated above, it is further provided that the decisions rendered\nin the present judgment in WA No. 46/2023, WA No. 162/2023 and WA No.\n239/2022 would prevail over all such provisions of the learned Single Judge in\nthe judgment dated 06.06.2022 in WP(C) No. 5005/2016 and 5026/2016 but in\nrespect of any other provisions which may not be contrary or inconsistent with\nthe provisions of this judgment the same may prevail, but with a further\nclarification that if any such provisions of the judgment of the learned Single\nJudge is in conflict or contradictory to any of the provisions in the present\njudgment, such provisions and the judgment of the learned Single Judge stands\nmodified accordingly.\n\n47. It is stated that in the meantime by the Office Memorandum dated\n18.01.2023 the provisions of consequential seniority has been withdrawn and\nthe catch up principle has been reintroduced. We are not observing anything on\nmerit on the said Office Memorandum and as we have been told that the said\nOffice Memorandum is under challenge in separate writ petitions which shall be\ndetermined on its own merit, the consequences of such Office Memorandum\nshall also be subject to what may be provided in such proceedings.\n\nWrit appeals stand disposed of in the above terms.\n\nJUDGE JUDGE\n\nComparing Assistant",
