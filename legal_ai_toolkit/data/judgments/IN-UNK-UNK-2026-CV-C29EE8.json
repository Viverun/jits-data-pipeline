It is observed by the Supreme \n\n Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava \n\n (supra) that, an affidavit duly sworn by the \n\n complainant makes him more responsible, it is \n\n because, once the affidavit is found false, \n\n he would be liable for prosecution in \n\n accordance with law. The Magistrate is duty \n\n bond to verify veracity of the same and \n\n the nature of the allegations of the case. \n\n In the present case, the trial Court has \n\n failed to follow the law laid down by the \n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \n\n 1 2015(6) S.C.C. 287\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 9\n\n Priyanka Srivastava (supra). \n\n 5.

The \n\n family members of petitioners approached \n\n High Court by filing Writ Petition \n\n No.7256/2010 (Shri Nandlal Taniram Sonje and \n\n others V/s The State of Maharashtra and \n\n others) and the High Court by considering the \n\n past record of respondent no.2 quashed the \n\n appointment of present respondent no.2 as a \n\n fit person. He submits that, the Advocate \n\n General of Maharashtra State has prosecuted \n\n the present respondent no.2 under the \n\n provisions of the \nMaharashtra Vexatious \n\n Litigation (Prevention) Act, 1971\n. Learned \n\n Senior counsel submits that, in order to take \n\n revenge, respondent no.2 has filed the \n\n present proceeding against the family members \n\n of Shinkar family. The present proceeding is \n\n not initiated against all the Directors of \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 13\n\n Pathpedi, however, the same is initiated by \n\n adopting the method of pick and choose \n\n policy, that too members of Shinkar family \n\n only. One of the allegation in \n\n complaint/proceeding is that, petitioner nos. \n\n 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 have taken \n\n concession/rebate on the rate of interest of \n\n loan. However, the proceeding shows that, \n\n present respondent no.2 has not filed \n\n affidavit duly sworn by him indicating \n\n that, how many persons have taken \n\n concession/rebate on the rate of interest of \n\n loan, and which provisions of law have been \n\n flouted while sanctioning concession/rebate \n\n on the rate of interest. Learned counsel \n\n submits that, it is a matter of record that, \n\n present respondent no.2 and his wife has also \n\n availed the facility of concession/rebate on \n\n the rate of interest of loan. Though present \n\n respondent no.2 has filed interventions in \n\n Writ Petition no.3330/2014 (Shri Devidas \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 14\n\n Waman Shinkar and others V/s The State of \n\n Maharashtra and others) and Writ Petition \n\n No.7883/2015 (Shri Devidas Waman Shinkar and \n\n others V/s The State of Maharashtra and \n\n others), present respondent no.2 deliberately \n\n with an ulterior motive for wreaking \n\n vengeance, withheld the said orders from the \n\n District and Sessions Court. Therefore, \n\n learned senior counsel submits that, the \n\n complaint/proceeding instituted by respondent \n\n no.2, is manifestly attended with malafide \n\n and/or the proceeding is maliciously \n\n instituted with an ulterior motive for \n\n wreaking vengeance. In support of aforesaid \n\n contentions, the reliance is also placed on \n\n the exposition of law by the Hon'ble Apex \n\n Court in the case of State of Haryana V/s \n\n Bhajan Lal2. \n\n 8. Learned senior counsel submits that, \n\n 2 1992 AIR (SC) 604\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 15\n\n the allegations in the first information \n\n report or the complaint, even if taken at its \n\n face value and read in its entirety, the same \n\n does not constitute any offence or make out a \n\n case against the petitioners. He submits \n\n that, the allegations made in the first \n\n information report or the complaint are so \n\n absurd and inherently improbable on the basis \n\n of which no prudent person can ever reach to \n\n a conclusion for proceeding against the \n\n accused. The allegations clearly depicts that \n\n the present proceeding manifestly attended \n\n with malafide and/or the same is instituted \n\n with an ulterior motive to take revenge \n\n against Shinkar family only. Learned Senior \n\n counsel submits that, the complainant has \n\n neither made all the Directors as a party \n\n accused nor made any allegations against the \n\n said Directors. Therefore, this is nothing \n\n but a pick and choose policy adopted by \n\n respondent no.2 just to settle his personal \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:12 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 16\n\n grudge. \n\n 9.

It is submitted that, it is observed \n\n by the Sessions Court that, without carrying \n\n out proper investigation, it is not desirable \n\n to issue process against accused by the Court \n\n at initial stage. Thus the Additional \n\n Sessions Judge has not taken the cognizance \n\n and referred the matter to the police.

It \n\n is submitted that, therefore, the Supreme \n\n Court in the said case held that the stage of \n\n taking the cognizance arises only after the \n\n investigation report is filed before the \n\n Magistrate concerned. Therefore, the \n\n challenge to an order under \nsection 156(3)\n of \n\n Cr.P.C. is premature, as the stage of \n\n cognizance comes after the report is filed by \n\n the police after completing the \n\n investigation. It is submitted that, after \n\n making compliance of the provisions of \n\n \nsections 154(1)\n and \n154(3)\n by the \n\n complainant, there are averments made in the \n\n 5 (2017) 1 SCC 640\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 31\n\n complaint. Learned counsel invites our \n\n attention to para 15 of the complaint filed \n\n before the Sessions Court and submits that \n\n the complaint was filed in Deopur Police \n\n Station by respondent no.2. Thereafter, as \n\n the cognizance was not taken, on 18th April, \n\n 2016, the complaint was filed before the \n\n Superintendent of Police, Dhule. The said \n\n complaint is filed after full-fledged \n\n compliance of provisions of \nsections 154(1)\n \n\n and \n154(3)\n of the Cr.P.C. On the basis of the \n\n complaint filed by respondent no.2 i.e., \n\n original complainant, the Superintendent of \n\n Police, Dhule had issued letter to the Police \n\n Inspector of Deopur Police Station, Dhule to \n\n register the crime if the offence is made \n\n out. It is submitted that, in the case of \n\n Priyanka Shrivastav (supra), the Supreme \n\n Court was pleased to direct that, the \n\n application under \nsection 156(3)\n of Cr.P.C. \n\n should be supported by the affidavit.

The complainant/applicant has enclosed \n\n the important evidence from which the \n\n offences under sections 406, 409, 417, 418, \n\n 467, 468, 471, \n120(B)\n read with 34 of the \n\n \nIndian Penal Code\n and offence under the \n\n M.P.I.D. Act are prima facie evident. It is \n\n submitted that, it is true that, the \n\n complainant and his wife were convicted for \n\n the offence punishable under \nsection 138\n of \n\n the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 34\n\n sentence till rising of the Court was \n\n ordered.

The \n\n said factors are being brought before this \n\n Court only to cause prejudice against the \n\n complainant and the said facts have no \n\n concern with the prayers in the Petition and \n\n the impugned order.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 35\n\n 25. It is submitted that, the various \n\n submissions made by the petitioners about \n\n their non-involvement in the offence or \n\n involvement of others into the crime in \n\n question are their probable defence, however, \n\n the same cannot be taken into consideration \n\n at this preliminary stage, where the order \n\n passed under \nsection 156(3)\n is under \n\n challenge in Criminal Writ Petition. It is \n\n submitted that, the complaint application was \n\n filed by the complainant on 10th April, 2016 \n\n in Deopur Police Station, Dhule and on 18th \n\n April, 2016, he had filed the application \n\n before Superintendent of Police, Dhule. So \n\n also there is report of Deopur Police Station \n\n dated 2nd June, 2016, wherein it is stated in \n\n column no.16 that \"izHkkjh vf/kdkjh ;kaph f'kQkjl\n\n Lor% pkSd'kh dsyh vkgs-\" and from this it is \n\n evident that, the concerned Police Officer \n\n had made the inquiry and recommended for \n\n registration of the crime. In other words, it \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 36\n\n is the satisfaction of the Police Officer, \n\n that, the cognizable offence has been prima \n\n facie made out. In these circumstances, it \n\n was the bounden duty of the police to \n\n register the crime and to investigate the \n\n same. In support of abovesaid contentions, \n\n the learned counsel placed reliance on the \n\n exposition of law by the Supreme Court in the \n\n case of Ramesh Karmari V/s State (N.C.T. of \n\n Delhi) and ors6. It is submitted that, on the \n\n basis of the order dated 28th February, 2017, \n\n the crime no. 14 of 2017 has been registered \n\n in Deopur Police Station, Dhule. The \n\n investigation has been commenced and \n\n thereafter some of the accused have been \n\n arrested by the Police. The statements of \n\n some of the witnesses must have been \n\n recorded. What is done by the police would be \n\n nullified if the first information report is \n\n quashed at this stage, when the investigation \n\n 6 AIR 2006 S.C. 1322\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 37\n\n has been substantially proceeded. If the \n\n police found that, the first information \n\n report is false, the police would take \n\n appropriate action against the complainant. \n\n If the first information report is quashed \n\n the serious crime would remain uninvestigated \n\n even after the registration of crime. \n\n Therefore, learned counsel appearing for \n\n respondent no.2 submits that, the Petition \n\n may be rejected. \n\n 26. Learned A.P.P. appearing for the \n\n respondent/State submits that, pursuant to \n\n the directions issued by Additional Sessions \n\n Judge, Dhule vide order dated 28th February, \n\n 2017, the F.I.R. bearing C.R.

With \n\n their able assistance, we have carefully \n\n perused the pleadings in the Petition, \n\n grounds taken therein, reply filed by \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 39\n\n respondent no.2 and affidavit in rejoinder \n\n and also the written notes of arguments \n\n submitted by the learned counsel appearing \n\n for the petitioners, learned counsel \n\n appearing for respondent no.2, and also \n\n investigation papers made available for \n\n perusal by the learned A.P.P. appearing for \n\n respondent/State. \n\n 28. An important point raised by the \n\n learned senior counsel appearing for the \n\n petitioners that, respondent no.2 in the \n\n present case did not file the affidavit duly \n\n sworn by him in support of Criminal Misc. \n\n application filed by him before the Sessions \n\n Court at Dhule in terms of dictum of Hon'ble \n\n Supreme Court of India in the case of \n\n Priyanka Srivasta (supra) goes to the root \n\n of the matter. Admittedly, the Criminal M.A. \n\n No. 22/2017 filed by respondent no.2 was not \n\n supported by the affidavit sworn by him. \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 40\n\n The Supreme Court in the case of Priyanka \n\n Srivasta (supra) held thus :- \n\n \"27. Regard being had to the aforesaid \n enunciation of law, it needs to be \n reiterated that the learned Magistrate \n has to remain vigilant with regard to \n the allegations made and the nature of \n allegations and not to issue directions \n without proper application of mind. He \n has also to bear in mind that sending \n the matter would be conducive to justice \n and then he may pass the requisite \n order. The present is a case where the \n accused persons are serving in high \n positions in the Bank. We are absolutely \n conscious that the position does not \n matter, for nobody is above the law. \n But, the learned Magistrate should take \n note of the allegations in entirety, the \n date of incident and whether any \n cognizable case is remotely made out. It \n is also to be noted that when a borrower \n of the financial institution covered \n under the SARFAESI Act, invokes the \n jurisdiction under Section 156(3) \n Cr.P.C. and also there is a separate \n procedure under the Recovery of Debts \n Due to Banks and Financial Institutions \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 41\n\n Act, 1993, an attitude of more care, \n caution and circumspection has to be \n adhered to.\n\n 28. Issuing a direction stating \"as per \n the application\" to lodge an FIR creates \n a very unhealthy situation in society \n and also reflects the erroneous approach \n of the learned Magistrate. It also \n encourages unscrupulous and unprincipled \n litigants, like Respondent 3, namely, \n Prakash Kumar Bajaj, to take adventurous \n steps with courts to bring the financial \n institutions on their knees. As the \n factual exposition would reveal, \n Respondent 3 had prosecuted the earlier \n authorities and after the matter is \n dealt with by the High Court in a writ \n petition recording a settlement, he does \n not withdraw the criminal case and waits \n for some kind of situation where he can \n take vengeance as if he is the emperor \n of all he surveys. It is interesting to \n note that during the tenure of \n Appellant 1, who is presently occupying \n the position of Vice-President, neither \n was the loan taken, nor was the default \n made, nor was any action under the \n \nSARFAESI Act\n taken. However, the action \n under the \nSARFAESI Act\n was taken on the \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 42\n\n second time at the instance of the \n present Appellant 1. We are only stating \n about the devilish design of Respondent \n 3 to harass the appellants with the sole \n intent to avoid the payment of loan. \n When a citizen avails a loan from a \n financial institution, it is his \n obligation to pay back and not play \n truant or for that matter play possum. \n As we have noticed, he has been able to \n do such adventurous acts as he has the \n embedded conviction that he will not be \n taken to task because an application \n under \nSection 156(3)\n Cr.P.C. is a simple \n application to the court for issue of a \n direction to the investigating agency. \n We have been apprised that a carbon copy \n of a document is filed to show the \n compliance with \nSection 154(3)\n, \n indicating it has been sent to the \n Superintendent of Police concerned.\n\n 29. At this stage it is seemly to state \n that power under \nSection 156(3)\n warrants \n application of judicial mind. A court of \n law is involved.

Both \n the aspects should be clearly spelt out \n in the application and necessary \n documents to that effect shall be filed. \n The warrant for giving a direction that \n an application under \nSection 156(3)\n be \n supported by an affidavit is so that the \n person making the application should be \n conscious and also endeavour to see that \n no false affidavit is made.

As far as power under Sub-section (3) \n of \nSection 156\n of the Cr.P.C. is \n concerned, there are various decisions of \n the Apex Court and this Court. In the case \n of Anil Kumar and Others. v. M.K. Aiyappa \n and Another MANU/SC/1002/2013 : (2013) 10 \n SCC, the Apex Court considered the scope \n of powers under Sub-section (3) of Section \n\n 156. What is material is paragraph 11 of \n the said decision which reads thus:-\n\n \"11. The scope of \nSection 156(3)\n Cr.P.C. \n came up for consideration before this \n Court in several cases. This Court in \n Maksud Saiyed Case examined the \n requirement of the application of mind \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 49\n\n by the Magistrate before exercising \n jurisdiction under \nSection 156(3)\n and \n held that where jurisdiction is \n exercised on a complaint filed in terms \n of \nSection 156(3)\n or \nSection 200\n \n Cr.P.C., the Magistrate is required to \n apply his mind, in such a case, the \n Special Judge/Magistrate cannot refer \n the matter under \nSection 156(3)\n against \n a public servant without a valid \n sanction order. The application of mind \n by the Magistrate should be reflected in \n the order. The mere statement that he \n has gone through the complaint, \n documents and heard the complainant, as \n such, as reflected in the order, will \n not be sufficient. After going through \n the complaint, documents and hearing the \n complainant, what weighed with the \n Magistrate to order investigation under \n \nSection 156(3)\n Cr.P.C., should be \n reflected in the order, though a \n detailed expression of his views is \n neither required nor warranted. We have \n already extracted the order passed by \n the learned Special Judge which, in our \n view, has stated no reasons for ordering \n investigation.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 50\n\n 18. Thus, the Apex Court held that when \n the learned Magistrate orders \n investigation under Sub-section (3) of \n \nSection 156\n what weighed with the learned \n Magistrate to order investigation should \n be reflected from his order, though a \n detailed expression of his views is not \n warranted. While passing an order under \n Sub-section (3) of \nSection 156\n of Cr.P.C, \n surely some reasons are required to be \n recorded after going through the Complaint \n as well as the documents produced with the \n complaint and after hearing the \n complainant. The reasons should be \n sufficient to indicate that the learned \n Magistrate had applied his mind.\n\n 20. The relevant decisions of the Apex \n Court including the decision in the case \n of Lalita Kumari, were considered by \n another Division Bench to which one of us \n (Anuja Prabhudessai, J.) is a member. \nIn \n paragraph No. 15 of the decision dated \n 30th March, 2015 in Writ Petition No. 4775 \n of 2014 (\nMr. Pandharinath Narayan Patil & \n Ors. v. The State of Maharashtra and Anr.\n) \n the Division Bench held thus:-\n\n \"15. It is thus well settled that the \n powers under \nsection 156(3)\n of the Code \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 51\n\n cannot be exercised mechanically but are \n required to be exercised judiciously. \n The magistrate is not required to embark \n upon an in-depth roving enquiry as to \n the reliability or genuineness of the \n allegations, nonetheless, he has to \n arrive at a conclusion that the \n application discloses necessary \n ingredients of the offence for which \n investigation is intended to be ordered. \n Furthermore, the reasons for arriving at \n such conclusion should be clearly \n reflected in the order.\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n \n21. After considering the decision of the \n Apex Court in the case of \nLalita Kumari v. \n State of U.P.\n, the Apex Court in the case \n of Priyanka, reminded the learned \n Magistrates that the Court of Law is \n involved when power under Sub-section (3) \n of \nSection 156\n is invoked and it is not \n the case of the Police taking steps as per \n \nSection 154\n of the said Code. The Apex \n Court has reminded the learned Magistrates \n that there is a difference between the \n Court of Law exercising the power under \n Sub-section (3) of \nSection 156\n and the \n Police acting under \nSection 154\n. \n Therefore, only on the ground that the \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 52\n\n allegations made in the Complaint \n constitute a cognizable offence, an order \n under Sub-section (3) of \nSection 156\n \n cannot be mechanically passed. The Apex \n Court observed that the power under \n \nSection 156(3)\n warrants application of \n judicial mind. The mandate of law \nlaid \n down in\n the case of Lalita Kumari is only \n against the Police in the context of \n mandatory provisions of Sub-section (1) of \n \nSection 154\n of Cr.P.C. From paragraph 29 \n of the decision in the case of Priyanka, \n it is apparent that even in a case where \n the Complaint is seeking an action under \n \nSection 156(1)\n discloses commission of a \n cognizable offence, it is not necessary \n that in every such case the learned \n Magistrate should pass an order under Sub-\n section (3) of \nSection 156\n. It is \n ultimately the discretion of the learned \n Magistrate which is to be exercised after \n considering several factors. What we \n emphasis even at the risk of repetition is \n that only because the Complaint filed \n seeking an action under Sub-section (3) of \n \nSection 156\n discloses commission of a \n cognizable offence, the learned Magistrate \n should not mechanically the exercise power \n without application of judicial mind.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 53\n\n 22. The Apex court has laid emphasis on \n the complainant supporting his case under \n Sub-section (3) of \nSection 156\n of the Code \n by filing an affidavit. As observed in \n paragraph No. 31 of the decision, mere \n filing of affidavit is not sufficient. In \n a given case, the learned Magistrate will \n be well advised to verify the truth and \n veracity of the allegation. Advantages of \n filing of such affidavit are also \n mentioned in \nthe said decision\n of the Apex \n Court.\n\n 23. Filing of an affidavit is also not \n empty formality. The manner in which \n affidavit is to be filed is prescribed in \n Chapter VII of the Criminal Manual \n published by this Court in paragraph Nos. \n 1 to 5, 7 and 8:-\n\n \"1. (1) The heading of every affidavit \n to be used in a Court of Justice shall \n be \"in the Court of....at..... \". \n\n naming such Court.\n\n (2) If there be a case pending in \n Court, the affidavit in support of, or \n opposition to, an application \n respecting it, must also begin with the \n heading \"In the matter of the case \n of..... \" in the case.\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 54\n\n (3) If there be no case pending in \n Court heading shall be: In the matter \n of the application of.\n\n 2.

All erasures, errors, \n interlineations, etc, in the affidavit \n shall be legibly initialed and dated by \n the declarant.\n\n 8. (1) The Officer authorised in this \n behalf, shall, before administering the \n oath ask the declarant if he has read \n the affidavit and understood the \n contents thereof, and if the latter \n states that he has not read it, or \n appears not to understand fully, the \n contents thereof, or appears to be \n blind, illiterate or ignorant of the \n language in which it is written, the \n Officer administering the oath shall \n read and explain or cause some other \n competent person to read and explain in \n his presence the affidavit to the \n declarant in the language which both \n the declarant and the Officer \n administering the oath understood.\n\n (2) When an affidavit is read, \n translated or explained as herein \n provided the Officer administering the \n oath shall certify in writing at the \n foot of the affidavit that it has been \n so read, translated or explained in his \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 57\n\n presence and that the declarant \n understood the same at the time of \n making the affidavit and made his \n signature or finger impression in the \n presence of the Officer.\"\n\n 24. Thus, the requirement of law is that \n every affidavit should clearly specify \n what portion of the statement is made on \n declarant's personal knowledge and what \n portion of the statement is made on his \n information or belief. When a particular \n statement is made on the basis of \n information and belief, the affidavit must \n state that the declarant believes the said \n statement to be true. Particulars of the \n source or ground of information or belief \n as provided in clause (2) of paragraph No. \n 5 of the Chapter VII of the Criminal \n Manual are required to be disclosed. The \n manner in which an affidavit should be \n executed is also \nlaid down in\n paragraph \n No. 8 of Chapter VII. An affidavit filed \n without substantially complying with the \n requirements of Chapter VII cannot be said \n to be an affidavit filed in compliance \n with the directions issued by the Apex \n Court in the case of Priyanka Srivastava. \n As stated in \nthe said decision\n, the object \n of filing an affidavit is to ensure that \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 58\n\n the complainant must face consequences, if \n his statements made therein are found to \n be false.

We are of the view, if \n the order made under Sub-Section (3) of \n \nSection 156\n is illegal, the FIR registered \n on the basis of the order can be quashed \n to avoid abuse of process of law.\" \n\n 33. It is contended by the petitioners \n\n that, respondent no.2 is habitual litigant, \n\n various proceedings are pending against \n\n respondent no.2. He is rival of Shinkar \n\n family. In the year 2001, he and his wife \n\n availed the loan facility from the Pathpedi \n\n borrowed the loan. Said amount, which was \n\n borrowed as loan, was not paid, which \n\n resulted into filing the proceedings under \n\n \nsection 101\n of the Maharashtra Co-operative \n\n Societies Act, 1960 (for short \nM.C.S. Act, \n\n 1960\n) by the said Pathpedi. The Pathpedi \n\n obtained Recovery Certificate under Section \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 66\n\n 101 of the \nM.C.S. Act, 1960\n against \n\n respondent no.2 and his wife. \n\n 34. In reply to the aforesaid contention \n\n of the petitioners, it is admitted by \n\n respondent no.2 that the aforesaid \n\n proceedings were initiated against respondent \n\n no.2 and his wife, and they were convicted \n\n and the sentence awarded was till rising of \n\n the Court. There is no denial to the fact \n\n that, the Advocate General of Maharashtra \n\n State has prosecuted the present respondent \n\n no.2 under the provisions of the \nMaharashtra \n\n Vexatious Litigation (Prevention) Act, 1971\n. \n\n Therefore, we find considerable force in the \n\n arguments of the learned senior counsel \n\n appearing for the petitioners that, \n\n respondent no.2 has grudge in his mind \n\n against the petitioners, and therefore, the \n\n criminal proceedings i.e. filing of present \n\n complaint by the complainant, is manifestly \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 67\n\n attended with malafide and maliciously \n\n instituted with malafide intention to wreak \n\n vengeance. The Supreme Court in the case of \n\n \"State of Haryana V/s Bhajan Lal9\" in para \n\n 108 of the judgment held thus :- \n\n \"108. In the backdrop of the \n interpretation of the various relevant \n provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV \n and of the principles of law enunciated \n by this Court in a series of decisions \n relating to the exercise of the extra-\n ordinary power under \nArticle 226\n or the \n inherent powers under Section 482 of the \n Code which we have extracted and \n reproduced above, we give the following \n categories of cases by way of \n illustration wherein such power could be \n exercised either to prevent abuse of the \n process of any Court or otherwise to \n secure the ends of justice, though it \n may not be possible to lay down any \n precise, clearly defined and \n sufficiently channelised and inflexible \n guidelines or rigid formulae and to give \n\n 9 AIR 1992 SC 604\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:13 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 68\n\n an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of \n cases wherein such power should be \n exercised. \n\n 1.

Where, the allegations in the F.I.R. do \n not constitute a cognizable offence but \n constitute only a non-cognizable \n offence, no investigation is permitted \n by a police officer without an order of \n a Magistrate as contemplated under \n \nSection 155(2)\n of the Code. \n\n 5. Where the allegations made in the FIR \n or complaint are so absurd and \n inherently improbable on the basis of \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 69\n\n which no prudent person can ever reach \n a just conclusion that there is \n sufficient ground for proceeding \n against the accused. \n\n 6. Where there is an express legal bar \n engrafted in any of the provisions of \n the Code or the concerned Act (under \n which a criminal proceeding is \n instituted) to the institution and \n continuance of the proceedings and/or \n where there is a specific provision in \n the Code or the concerned Act, \n providing efficacious redress for the \n grievance of the aggrieved party. \n\n 7. Where a criminal proceeding is \n manifestly attended with mala fide \n and/or where the proceeding is \n maliciously instituted with an ulterior \n motive for wreaking vengeance on the \n accused and with a view to spite him \n due to private and personal grudge.\" \n\n (Underlines supplied) \n\n 35. In the light of the aforesaid \n\n discussion, the contention of the petitioners \n\n that, the criminal proceedings are manifestly \n\n attended with malafide and maliciously with \n\n ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the \n\n accused deserves acceptance keeping in view \n\n the category no.7 i.e. where a criminal \n\n proceeding is manifestly attended with mala \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 70\n\n fide and/or where the proceeding is \n\n maliciously instituted with an ulterior \n\n motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused \n\n and with a view to spite him due to private \n\n and personal grudge. \n\n 36. Respondent no.2 in his application \n\n made allegation in respect of purchase of \n\n Mangal Karyalaya. However, in that respect \n\n already crime No. 97 of 2013 came to be \n\n registered. Therefore, in view of the \n\n judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of \n\n T.T. Antony (supra), on the same set of \n\n allegation, crime no. 14/2017 is not \n\n maintainable. \n\n 37. Pursuant to the directions issued by \n\n the Divisional Joint Registrar, Co-operative \n\n Societies to the District Social Auditor \n\n Class-I, the Auditor has lodged the complaint \n\n with Deopur Police Station, Dhule and on the \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 71\n\n basis of the said complaint, on 29th \n\n September, 2016 the crime No.92/2016 for the \n\n offences punishable under Sections 420, 465, \n\n 466, 467, 471 and 342 of the IP Code as well \n\n as sections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act has \n\n been registered. The said complaint submitted \n\n by the Auditor is in respect of very same \n\n Pathpedi. In the said crime, one of \n\n petitioners is already made accused. Since \n\n the allegations in the said first information \n\n report relates to the affairs of Dadasaheb \n\n Waman Vishnu Shinkar Nagari Sahakari Pathpedi \n\n and also about the illegalities and \n\n irregularities committed while conducting the \n\n affairs of the society and at the time of \n\n disbursement of loan etc., and therefore, it \n\n was not necessary to register the separate \n\n offence. In the crime No.92/2016 registered \n\n with Deopur Police Station, Dhule for the \n\n offences punishable under Sections 420, 465, \n\n 466, 467, 471 and 342 of the IP Code as well \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 72\n\n as sections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act, the \n\n Investigating Officer is at liberty to \n\n investigate about the allegations made even \n\n against the present petitioners so as to find \n\n out their role. An investigation is an \n\n exclusive domain of the Investigating Officer \n\n and the Investigating officer would be at \n\n liberty to investigate even about the \n\n involvement of present petitioners, and there \n\n cannot be any impediment for such \n\n investigation. Even the statement of present \n\n respondent no.2 can also be recorded in the \n\n said crime by the Investigating officer. It \n\n appears that, since the Special Auditor did \n\n not take any steps to file the complaint with \n\n Police Station inspite of the directions by \n\n the Superior Officer about the alleged \n\n illegalities and irregularities committed by \n\n the Directors, employees and borrowers etc., \n\n including the petitioners to register the \n\n first information report on the basis of such \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 73\n\n complaint, respondent no.2 presented the \n\n complaint before the Magistrate and the \n\n complaint was subsequently withdrawn and \n\n thereafter the Criminal Misc. Application No. \n\n 22/2017, was presented before the Court of \n\n Additional Sessions Judge at Dhule. Since as \n\n already observed the crime No. 92/2016 is \n\n already registered on the basis of the \n\n complaint filed by the Special Auditor on \n\n 20th August, 2016, the allegations as against \n\n the petitioners made in the present F.I.R. \n\n i.e. Crime No.14/2017 can also be gone into \n\n in the said first information report. There \n\n is no need of further investigation of said \n\n F.I.R., which is registered pursuant to \n\n directions issued by the Additional Sessions \n\n Judge, Dhule. \n\n 38. There is also another reason to \n\n cause interference in the impugned order \n\n directing registration of the first \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 74\n\n information report. In the impugned order, \n\n the cryptic reasons are assigned by the \n\n concerned Court without assigning any single \n\n reason how the provisions of sections 3 and 4 \n\n of the M.P.I.D. Act are attracted. While \n\n passing the impugned order, learned Judge did \n\n not even consider the fact that, Mohammad \n\n Abdul Arif was working as Divisional Joint \n\n Registrar, Co-operative Societies as public \n\n servant and therefore, to prosecute him, \n\n valid sanction is necessary. However, after \n\n registration of F.I.R. pursuant to the \n\n directions issued by the Additional Sessions \n\n Judge, Dhule, very same learned Judge while \n\n entertaining an application and granting \n\n anticipatory bail to Mohammad Abdul Arif, who \n\n was working as Divisional Joint Registrar \n\n made observation that, there was no valid \n\n sanction to prosecute him. Therefore, there \n\n was no proper application of mind by the \n\n learned Judge and as a result, by cryptic \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 75\n\n reasons, the impugned order is passed and on \n\n the basis of the said order, the first \n\n information report no.14/2017 with Deopur \n\n Police Station for the offence punishable \n\n under sections 406, 409, 417, 418, 420, 467, \n\n 468, 471, 120-B and \n34\n of I.P. Code and under \n\n sections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act is \n\n registered. \n\n 39. Though the learned counsel appearing \n\n for respondent no.2 has placed reliance on \n\n the judgment in the case of HDFC Securities \n\n Limited, in the facts of that case, the issue \n\n of filing the affidavit in support of \n\n application by the applicant/complainant \n\n therein was not involved. \nIn the present \n\n case, as already observed, in the light of \n\n mandate of the Supreme Court in the case of \n\n Priyanka Srivasta (supra) and the judgment of \n\n the Bombay High Court at Principal Seat in \n\n the case of \nSyed Anwar Ahmed\n (supra), it was \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 76\n\n incumbent upon the learned Judge, who passed \n\n the impugned order, to seek compliance from \n\n respondent no.2 to file the affidavit in \n\n support of Criminal Misc. Application. In the \n\n facts of the present case, as already \n\n observed the order passed by Additional \n\n Sessions Judge is cryptic and without \n\n assigning any valid reasons for invoking \n\n provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the \n\n M.P.I.D. Act. Therefore, the \nratio \nlaid down \n\n in\n the case of HDFC Securities Limited cannot \n\n be made applicable in the facts of the \n\n present case, when there is no affidavit \n\n sworn by respondent no.2 in support of \n\n averments in the Misc. Application and order \n\n suffers from non-application of mind. \n\n However, we make it clear that, the \n\n allegations made against the petitioners \n\n cannot go unattended and the Investigating \n\n Officer making investigation in Crime \n\n No.92/2016 will be at liberty to cause the \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 77\n\n investigation even in respect of the present \n\n petitioners also, since the said first \n\n information report is lodged on the basis of \n\n the complaint filed by the Special Auditor \n\n with Deopur Police Station, Dhule. We further \n\n make it clear that, there is no impediment to \n\n the Investigating Officer to cause the \n\n investigation keeping in view the allegations \n\n in the first information report registered on \n\n the basis of complaint lodged by the Special \n\n Auditor even against the petitioners, even \n\n though there are certain directions by the \n\n Minister and in turn the Special Auditor \n\n mentioned in that respect that, no offence \n\n should be registered against Devidas Waman \n\n Shinkar. As already observed, the \n\n investigation is an exclusive domain of the \n\n Investigating Officer and the Investigating \n\n Officer is at liberty to add any \n\n person/persons as an accused in ongoing \n\n investigation keeping in view the allegations \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 78\n\n in the first information report, and can also \n\n cause the further investigation. In \n\n substance, the allegations made in the First \n\n Information Report no. 14/2017 can be taken \n\n care of in ongoing investigation in crime \n\n no.92/2016 for the offence punishable under \n\n Sections 420, 465, 466, 467, 471, 406 read \n\n with \nsection 34\n of I.P. Code and under \n\n Sections 3 and 4 of the M.P.I.D. Act, and the \n\n Investigating Officer can record the \n\n statement of respondent no.2.\n\n \n40. The contention of the learned \n\n counsel appearing for respondent no.2 that, \n\n the revision as against the impugned order \n\n passed by the Additional Sessions Judge is \n\n maintainable, and therefore, the present \n\n Petition under \nArticle 226\n of the \n\n Constitution of India read with \nsection 482\n \n\n of the Cr.P.C. may not be entertained, cannot \n\n be accepted. It needs to be emphasized that \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 79\n\n the scope of exercise of jurisdiction of \n\n \nsection 482\n of Cr.P.C. is explained in \n\n greater details by the Supreme Court in the \n\n case of State of Haryana V/s Bhajan Lal and \n\n various pronouncement of the Supreme Court in \n\n recent past. The Supreme Court in the case of \n\n \nPrabhu Chawla Vs. State of Rajasthan and Anr.\n \n\n in Criminal Appeal No. 842 of 2016 with \n\n Criminal Appeal No. 844 of 2016, decided on \n\n 5th September, 2016, in para 3 held thus :\n\n \n3. While considering all these \n matters at the SLP stage, on \n 05.07.2013, a Division Bench \n found the impugned order of the \n High Court to be against the law \n stated in \nDhariwal Tobacco \n Products Ltd. v. State of \n Maharashtra10\n.\n In that case the \n Division Bench concurred with the \n proposition of law that \n availability of alternative \n remedy of criminal revision under \n Section 397 Cr.P.C. by itself \n\n 10 [2009] 2 SCC 370\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 80\n\n cannot be a good ground to \n dismiss an application under \n Section 482 of Cr.P.C. But it \n noticed that a later Division \n Bench judgment of this Court in \n the case of Mohit alias Sonu v. \n\n State of Uttar Pradesh11 \n apparently held to the contrary \n that when an order under assail \n is not interlocutory in nature \n and is amenable to the revisional \n jurisdiction of the High Court \n then there should be a bar in \n invoking the inherent \n jurisdiction of the High Court. \n\n In view of such conflict, these \n cases were directed to be placed \n before the Hon'ble Chief Justice \n for reference to a larger Bench \n and that is how the matters are \n before this Bench for resolving \n the conflict. \n\n 41. The Supreme Court after detailed \n\n discussion in paras 4 and 5; in para 6 of \nthe \n\n said judgment\n held thus: \n\n 11 [2013] 7 SCC 789\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 81\n\n 6. In our considered view any \n attempt to explain the law \n further as regards the issue \n relating to inherent power of \n High Court under \nSection 482\n \n Cr.P.C. is unwarranted. We would \n simply reiterate that Section \n 482 begins with a non-obstante \n clause to state: \"Nothing in \n this Code shall be deemed to \n limit or affect the inherent \n powers of the High Court to make \n such orders as may be necessary \n to give effect to any order \n under this Code, or to prevent \n abuse of the process of any \n Court or otherwise to secure the \n ends of justice.\" A fortiori, \n there can be no total ban on the \n exercise of such wholesome \n jurisdiction where, in the words \n of Krishna Iyer, J. \"abuse of \n the process of the Court or \n other extraordinary situation \n excites the court's \n jurisdiction. The limitation is \n self-restraint, nothing more.\" \n\n We venture to add a further \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 82\n\n reason in support. Since \nSection \n 397\n Cr.P.C. is attracted against \n all orders other than \n interlocutory, a contrary view \n would limit the availability of \n inherent powers under \nSection \n 482\n Cr.P.C. only to petty \n interlocutory orders! A \n situation wholly unwarranted and \n undesirable. \n\n 42. It clearly emerges that, the Supreme \n\n Court approved the law \nlaid down in\n the case \n\n of Dhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd. and ors. \n\n Vs. State of Maharashtra and another12 and \n\n ultimately held that, the availability of \n\n alternative remedy of criminal revision under \n\n \nSection 397\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure \n\n by itself cannot be a good ground to dismiss \n\n an application under \nSection 482\n of the Code \n\n of Criminal Procedure. \nThe judgment in the \n\n case of \nDhariwal Tobacco Products Ltd.\n \n\n [supra] is holding the field, since the date \n\n 12 [2009] 2 SCC 370\n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 83\n\n of its pronouncement of \nthe said judgment\n in \n\n the year 2009.\n\n 43. It is further not necessary to \n\n elaborate the reasons. Suffice it to say \n\n that, in the light of discussion in the \n\n foregoing paragraphs, we are of the \n\n considered view that, the impugned order \n\n passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, \n\n Dhule, deserves to be quashed and \n\n consequently the F.I.R. bearing C.R. No. 14 \n\n of 2017 registered on the basis of the same \n\n also deserves to be quashed. \n\n 44. Accordingly, the impugned order \n\n dated 28th February, 2017 passed by the \n\n Additional Sessions Judge, Dhule in Criminal \n\n Misc. Application No. 22/2017 is quashed and \n\n set aside. Consequently, the first \n\n information report i.e. Crime No. 14/2017 \n\n registered with Deopur Police Station for the \n\n::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017 ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2017 01:59:14 :::\n\n 379.17WP.odt+\n\n 84\n\n offence punishable under sections 406, 409, \n\n 417, 418, 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B and \n34\n of \n\n the I.P. Code and under sections 3 and 4 of \n\n the M.P.I.D. Act on the basis of the said \n\n order is also quashed. Rule made absolute on \n\n above terms. \n\n An observations made hereinbefore on \n\n the merits of the allegations in the first \n\n information report No. 14/2017 are prima \n\n facie in nature and cannot be construed as an \n\n impediment to the Investigating Officer, who \n\n is investigating into the F.I.R. no.92/2016 \n\n registered with Deopur Police Station, Dhule \n\n to proceed with the investigation in \n\n accordance with law.
