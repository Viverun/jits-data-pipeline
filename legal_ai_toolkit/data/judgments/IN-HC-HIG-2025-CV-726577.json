Since both the applications are connected, parties being\ncommon so also the issue, they are being disposed of by this\ncommon oral judgment. Parties have been referred to as per their\nstatus in civil application no.3285 of 2024.\n\n2. Mr Archit P. Jani, learned advocate appearing for the applicant,\nsubmitted that the applicant has Agreement to Sell dated\n17.03.2022 in his favour, executed by the respondents, except\nrespondent no.10. It is submitted that Special Civil Suit no.277 of\n2022 was filed by the respondents against the respondent no.10,\nseeking cancellation of the alleged Agreement to Sell executed on\n01.01.2013, only with a view to nullifying the rights of the applicant.\nAnother Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2022 was filed by the respondent\nno.10 seeking specific performance of the said Agreement to Sell\ndated 01.01.2013 against the rest of the respondents.\n\n2.1 It is submitted that it is surprising to note that the Special Civil\nSuit no.11 of 2023 was filed on 11.01.2023 and respondent no.9\nappeared on 13.01.2023 on his behalf and on behalf of the others\nand immediately within a span of 10 days i.e. on 21.01.2023, it was\ndisposed of on the ground of settlement. Similarly, the Special Civil\nSuit no.277 of 2022 was disposed of on 11.02.2023. It is further\nsubmitted that the applicant was not made party in any of the suits\nfiled by the respondents individually or jointly.\n\n2.2 It is next submitted that respondent no.9 preferred a Special\nCivil Suit no.14 of 2023 seeking cancellation of the registered\nAgreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022; however, subsequently, on\n14.07.2023 it came to be withdrawn simplicitor.

It is thereafter, that the\nregistered sale deeds have been executed by the Court\nCommissioner. It is submitted that the applicant having no option\nhad to file a Special Civil Suit no.299 of 2023 seeking specific\nperformance of the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 and is\npending. It is submitted that the applicant is severely prejudiced by\nthe consent decree inasmuch as, it had paid consideration of Rs.50\nlacs and when there is a registered Agreement to Sell coupled with\nthe consideration, the respondents i.e. original owners have no\noption but to execute sale deed in his favour.\n\n2.4 It is submitted that it is also not in dispute that at the time of\nexecution of the registered Agreement to Sell, there were no civil\ncases pending by the original owners or against the original owners.\nSo far as the so called Agreement to Sell dated 01.01.2013 in favour\nof the respondent no.10 is concerned, the same also creates a\ndoubt inasmuch as, for almost 10 years, no steps were taken and\nonly in the years 2022 and 2023, the suit proceedings were\ninitiated. It is submitted that the suits were filed only with a view to\nseeing that the rights of the applicant is prejudiced. Surreptitious\nfiling of the suits by the respondents, inter se, was nothing but an\nabuse of process of law.\n\n2.5 Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\nSakina\nSultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors. vs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin\nJamat Samaj & Ors.\nreported in 2020 (1) GLR 586. It is submitted\nthat it is by now well settled that a third party who was not a party\n\nPage 3 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nto the suit or compromise, but had an interest in the subject matter\nof compromise and is aggrieved by the decree passed by the Court\nunder\nOrder 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Code\"), the remedy available to him\nis to either approach very same Court seeking review or to file an\nappeal with the leave of the Court under the provisions of sub-\nsection (1) of\nSection 96\nof the Code. It is submitted that while\nsummarizing, the Full Bench, has held and observed that if the\naggrieved party was not the party to the suit, the remedy available\nto him, to challenge the decree passed by the Court on the basis of\nthe compromise between the parties to the suit (consent decree),\nwould be to file an appeal under sub-section (1) of\nSection 96\nof the\nCode with the leave of the appellate court or to file a review\napplication before the Court which passed the decree, as may be\npermissible under\nSection 114\nread with Order 43 of the Code. It is\ntherefore submitted that the remedy available to the applicant, is to\nchallenge the compromise deed, after seeking the leave of this\nCourt. It is submitted that the option to file suit, is not available.\n\nReliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\nPraash Robin\nNayudu vs. Rev. Imanuel S. Kant\nreported in 2023 (2) GLR 1319.\n\n2.6 Further reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\n\nGulam Nabi Khanday and Others vs. Mushtaq Ahmad and Others\n\nreported in 2024 SCC OnLine J&K 107.\n\nReliance is also placed on the\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of M/s.\nSree Surya\nDevelopers & Promoters vs. N. Shailesh Prasad\nreported in (2022) 5\nSCC 736, wherein, it has been held and observed that a party to a\nconsent decree, to challenge the compromise decree on the ground\nthat the decree was not lawful, has to approach the same Court\nwhich recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the\nconsent decree, would not be maintainable.\n\nPage 4 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n2.7 Further reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\n\nPushpa Devi Bhagat vs. Rajinder Singh and Others\nreported in\n(2006) 5 SCC 566. Specific reference is made to paragraph 17\nwherein, while referring to the amended provisions of Order 23 of\nthe Code, inter alia, it has been held and observed that no appeal is\nmaintainable against the consent decree having regard to the\nspecific bar contained in sub-section (3) of\nSection 96\nof the Code.\nBesides, no independent suit can be filed for setting aside a\ncompromise decree on the ground that the compromise was not\nlawful; in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A of the Code.\n\n2.8 While summing up, it is contended that there was a registered\nAgreement to Sell in favour of the applicant. Moreover, the applicant\nhas paid an amount of Rs.50 lacs. It was only keeping in dark the\napplicant, that the suits were filed and settlements were arrived at.\nRespondent no.9 was fully aware about the Agreement to Sell and\nhence, the suits filed by the respondents were nothing but fraud\nplayed upon the Court. In the circumstances, the applicant be\npermitted a leave to file the appeal.\n\n3. Per contra, Mr S. P. Majmudar, learned advocate appearing\nwith Mr Hardik J. Karathiya, learned advocate for the respondent\nno.10, submitted that the application, suffers from vice of\nsuppression of material fact inasmuch as, the applicant has chosen\nnot to disclose the factum of filing of the suit by him seeking specific\nperformance of the Agreement to Sell. Though reference is made of\nall other suit, the details of the suit filed by the applicant is missing\nand hence, the application deserves to be rejected only on the\nground of suppression of material fact.\n\n3.1 It is further submitted that clearly, the applicant, is mere\nholder of the Agreement to Sell and has no other interest in the\nproperty and therefore, appealable interest is not in favour of the\n\nPage 5 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\napplicant owing to passing of the consent decree. It is further\nsubmitted that it is settled that under the provisions of the\nTransfer\nof Property Act, 1882\n(hereinafter referred to as \"\nTP Act\n\"),\nAgreement to Sell does not create any interest. As against this,\nthere is a registered sale deed executed in favour of respondent\nno.10. Also, the applicant is neither a necessary nor a proper party.\nIf at all, the applicant is aggrieved or has any grievance, it has to\nprove his case independently and on its own merits, without\nreferring to the proceedings or the documents executed between\nthe respondents.\n\n3.2 Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\nPatel\nVinodbhai Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai Kacharabhai\nreported in\n2021 (3) GLR 2601. It is submitted that the issue stands fully\ncovered by the principle\nlaid down in\n\nthe said judgment\n. Not only\nthe principle but the facts, were also identical. This Court, has\nconsidered the aspect of aggrieved person so also the appealable\ninterest of the aggrieved person. Coordinate Bench, after\nconsidering various judgments on the point so also the provisions of\n\nSection 96\nand Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code, has held and observed\nthat in order to acquire the status of the aggrieved party, the person\nmust have legal interest and enforceable right which would in turn\nallow him to question the decree or order by preferring appeal\nthough, he may not be a party to the suit or the proceedings. It has\nalso been held and observed that the applicants who claim their\ninterest on the basis of the Agreement to Sell, could not be said to\nbe holding any interest in the property to be within the definition of\n\"legally aggrieved or prejudiced persons\".\n\n3.3 For the proposition that Agreement to Sell does not confer any\ninterest, reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\nSuraj\nLamp and Industries Pvt. Limited vs. State of Haryana\nreported in\n\nPage 6 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n(2012) 1 SCC 656. It has been held and observed that any\nagreement to sell which is not a registered deed of conveyance\nwould fall short of the requirements of\nSections 54\nand\nof the TP\nAct and will not confer any title or transfer any interest in\nimmovable property.\nSection 54\ndefines the term 'sale' and would\nmean a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or\npromised or part-paid and part-promised. The provision also\nenvisages that such transfer in the case of tangible immoveable\nproperty can be made only by a registered instrument.\n\n3.4 Reliance is also placed on the judgment in the case of\n\nVenigalla Koteswaramma vs. Malampati Suryamba\nreported in\n(2021) 4 SCC 246. It is submitted that law enunciated by the Apex\nCourt, is that as per the provisions of\nSection 54\nof the TP Act, an\nagreement for sale of immoveable property does not, of itself,\ncreate any interest in or charge on such property; a person having\nan agreement for sale in his favour does not get any right in the\nproperty, except the right of obtaining sale deed on that basis.\n\n3.5 In support of the submission of suppression of material fact,\nreliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\nHMT Ltd. vs.\nRukmini and Others\nreported in AIR 2024 SC 4677. The Apex Court,\nin no uncertain terms, stated that a person seeking equitable relief,\nmust come with clean hands, put forward all facts before the Court\nwithout concealing or suppressing anything and seek appropriate\nrelief. It is submitted that when a person does not disclose all the\ncorrect facts, he would be guilty of misleading the Court. In the\npresent case, though the applicant has mentioned about all the\nsuits, has chosen not to state about the suit filed by him against the\nrespondent no.9 seeking specific performance. The applicant has\nalready initiated the proceedings of specific performance and he has\nto prove his rights independently and on the strength of his own\n\nPage 7 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\ncase.\n\n3.6 It is further submitted that the judgment of Full Bench will not\napply to the applicant, as the applicant cannot be said to be\naggrieved party. It is only the party who has the appealable interest,\ncan be permitted to file the appeal. The applicant, has to satisfy that\nhe has an appealable interest. In view of mere Agreement to Sell,\nthe applicant, cannot claim that he has the appealable interest. It is\ntherefore urged that the applications do not deserve to be\nentertained and may not be accepted.\n\n4. In a brief rejoinder, Mr Archit P. Jani, learned advocate for the\napplicant, submitted that suppression, has to be of a material fact.\nIn the present case, the filing of the suit would not be material or\nconnected with the issue raised. Even otherwise, in the appeal\nmemo, there is a specific reference of the suit filed by the applicant\nand hence, by no stretch of imagination, it can be construed that\nthere was a suppression by the applicant. It is also submitted that\nAgreement to Sell does not confer any right but, the applicant can't\nwait until the order of consent decree is set aside. The applicant,\nwould not get any relief unless the consent decree is challenged and\nis quashed and set aside. It is submitted that if the suit were to be\nallowed then there is nothing left to be executed in favour of the\napplicant and hence, consent decrees have to go.\n\n4.1 Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\nR.\nJanakiammal vs. S. K. Kumarasamy (Deceased) Through Legal\nRepresentatives and Others\nreported in (2021) 9 SCC 114. It is\nsubmitted that the suit against the consent decree would not be\nmaintainable is a clear ratio\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in\nthe said\njudgment\n.\n\nFurther reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of\n\nMooman Jafferali Aliji Maknojiya vs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat\nSamaj\nreported in 2021 (0) AIJEL-HC-243430. The said judgment has\n\nPage 8 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nbeen relied upon, for the proposition of aggrieved party.\n\nReliance is\nalso placed on the judgment in the case of\nV. N. Krishna Murthy and\nAnother vs. Ravikumar and Others\nreported in (2020) 9 SCC 501.\n\n4.2 It is therefore urged that the applicant is very much aggrieved\nparty and hence, be permitted the leave to challenge the order and\nconsent decree, both dated 21.01.2023 as well as order and decree\nboth dated 11.02.2023 passed by the Court below.\n\n5. Heard the learned advocates appearing for the respective\nparties. Considered the facts, the law and the record made\navailable.\n\n6. Tersely stated are the facts. Discernibly, Special Civil Suit\nno.277 of 2022 was filed by the respondents except respondent\nno.10 seeking declaration that the Agreement to Sell dated\n13.01.2022 as well as the possession receipt be declared as illegal\nand bad as the same has been executed without the knowledge of\nthe plaintiffs. Subsequent thereto, the respondent no.10 filed\nSpecial Civil Suit no.11 of 2023, inter alia, seeking specific\nperformance of the Agreement to Sell dated 01.01.2013 and for\nconsequential relief of possession, pursuant to the possession\nreceipt dated 22.01.2016.\n\n7. Apparently, in the Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022, the\nparties have submitted compromise purshis - Exhibit 13 and the\nlearned Judge, has passed an order dated 11.02.2023 in terms of\nthe compromise purshis. Decree was drawn accordingly of the same\ndate. On the other hand, in Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2023\ncompromise purshis - Exhibit 8 was filed with the Court below and\nthe order has been passed dated 21.01.2023, disposing of the suit\nin terms of the purshis. Decree was passed accordingly of the same\ndate.\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n8. Apropos the above referred two orders and decrees, that\nexecution proceeding no.4 of 2023 was initiated. Order dated\n08.04.2023 came to be passed below Exhibits 1, 6 and 8 appointing\nthe Court Commissioner for the purpose of executing the sale deed\nand order dated 19.04.2023 below Exhibits 1, 6, 9 and 23 for\nappointing Court Commissioner and executing sale deed. After the\nproceeding, ultimately registered sale deeds have been executed by\nthe Court Commissioner. It is the compromise deed; the orders\npassed thereon and the consequential order dated 08.04.2023 and\nsale deeds executed in the execution proceedings, which have\ngiven rise to the captioned application by the applicant seeking\nleave to challenge the order and consent decree both dated\n11.02.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022 as well as\norder and decree both dated 21.01.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit\nno.11 of 2023.\n\n9. While adverting to the facts touching the applicant, notably,\nAgreement to Sell was executed by the respondent nos.1 to 9 dated\n17.03.2022. It is the case of the applicant that when there was an\nAgreement to Sell, the suits filed, could not have been settled\nbetween the parties, as the rights of the applicant have been\nprejudicely affected. The applicant has also filed Special Civil Suit\nno.299 of 2023 against the respondents seeking specific\nperformance of the Agreement to Sell as well as challenging the\nregistered sale deeds in favour of the respondent no.10. Clearly, it is\nthe Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022, on the basis whereof, the\napplicant is claiming his right so as to challenge the orders passed\nin the suits. Hence, one needs to ascertain as to whether any rights\ncan be said to have been invested or conferred upon the applicant\nso as to take out the captioned proceedings. Thus, few judgments\non the point are worth referring to.\n\nPage 10 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n10.\nIn the case of\nSakina Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors. vs.\nShia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj & Ors.\n(supra), the full\nbench, in paragraph 30 of the judgment has stated that when a\nperson aggrieved is third party who was neither a party to suit nor a\nparty to the compromise on the basis of which the decree was\npassed would not be bound by such decree. Such decree cannot be\nsaid to be consent decree qua such party and therefore, either the\nbar contained in sub-section (3) of\nSection 96\nor bar under Rule 3-A\nof the Order XXIII, would not be applicable to him. Such an\naggrieved party with a leave of the Court can always file an appeal\nas per the provisions of the Code and can challenge the validity of\nthe compromise decree on the grounds available to him. The full\nbench, while summing up its reasoning, in paragraph 40 (vii) has\nobserved thus:\n\n\"(vii) If the aggrieved party was not the party to the suit, the\nremedy available to him to challenge the decree passed by the\nCourt on the basis of compromise between the parties to the suit\n(consent decree), would be to file an appeal under\nSection 96(1)\nof\nC.P.C., with the leave of the appellate Court, or to file a review\napplication before the Court, which passed the decree, as may be\npermissible under\nSection 114\nread with\nOrder XLVII of C.P.C\n.\"\n\n11. Therefore, the aggrieved third party, who is not a party to the\nsuit or compromise, the remedy available to him is to file an appeal\nwith the leave of the Court, as neither the consent decree nor the\norders would be binding upon him. The issue then would arises is as\nto who can be said to be an aggrieved party. A person aggrieved,\nmust be a person who had suffered a legal grievance, against whom\na decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him\nof something or wrongfully refused him something or wrongfully\naffected his title of something and it does not include a person who\nsuffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury. A person\naggrieved must therefore necessarily be one whose right or interest\n\nPage 11 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nhas been adversely affected or jeopardized.\n\n12.\nIn the case of\nMooman Jafferali Aliji Maknojiya vs. Shia Imami\nIsmaili Momin Jamat Samaj\n(supra), the coordinate bench, while\nconsidering the application seeking leave to appeal has held and\nobserved that a stranger cannot be permitted to file an appeal in\nany proceedings unless he satisfies the Court that he falls within the\ncategory of aggrieved person. It is only where the judgment and\ndecree prejudicely affects the person, who is not a party to the\nproceedings, can prefer an appeal with the leave of the appellate\nCourt. The expression, \"person aggrieved\" has been lucidly\nexplained to mean that it does not include a person who suffers\nfrom a psychological or an imaginary injury; a person aggrieved\nmust therefore, necessarily be one, whose right or interest has been\nadversely affected or jeopardized. Summarizing the principle, in\nparagraph 16, this Court, has observed thus:\n\n16. The principles governing grant of leave to appeal may be\nsummarised as under :\n\n(i)\nSections 96\nand\nof the CPC provide for preferring an appeal\nfrom an original decree or decree in appeal respectively;\n\n(ii) the said provisions do not enumerate the categories of persons\nwho can file an appeal;\n\n(iii) however it a settled legal proposition that a stranger cannot be\npermitted to file an appeal in any proceedings unless he satisfies the\nCourt that he falls within the category of aggrieved person;\n\n(iv) it is only where a judgment and decree prejudicially affects a\nperson who is not a party to the proceedings, he can prefer an\nappeal with the leave of the Court;\n\n(v) a person aggrieved, to file an appeal, must be one whose right is\naffected by reason of the judgment and decree sought to be\nimpugned;\n\n(vi) the expression person aggrieved does not include a person who\nsuffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury;\n\n(vii) it would be improper to grant leave to appeal to every person\nwho may in some remote or indirect way be prejudicially affected by\na decree or judgment; and\n\nPage 12 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n(viii) ordinarily leave to appeal should be granted to persons who,\nthough not parties to the proceedings, would be bound by the\ndecree or judgment in that proceeding and who would be precluded\nfrom attacking its correctness in other proceedings.\"\n\n13.\nIn the case of\nR. Janakiammal vs. S. K. Kumarasamy\n(Deceased) Through Legal Representatives and Others\n(supra), the\nApex Court, was dealing with the provisions of Order 23, Rule 3 and\n3-A of the Code. The principle which can be deduced is, that the\nremedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such\nconsent decree is to approach the Court which recorded the\ncompromise and made a decree in terms of it and establish that\nthere was no compromise. In that event, the Court which recorded\nthe compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to\nwhether there was a valid compromise or not. It has been observed\nthat this is so because a consent decree is nothing but a contract\nbetween parties superimposed with a seal of approval of the Court.\nThe validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of\nthe agreement or compromise on which it is made. Therefore, the\ncompromise on the basis of which the consent decree is passed, is\nmerely a contract. Consent decree is nothing but a contract\nbetween the parties superimposed with a seal of the approval of the\nCourt.\n\n14. The present applicant who is seeking leave to appeal to\nchallenge the order and decree dated 21.01.2023 and order and\ndecree both dated 11.02.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit no.11 of\n2023 and Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022, respectively, whether\ncan be said to be an aggrieved party and if yes, what would be the\nremedy available to the applicant as he was not a party to the suit\nproceedings. Therefore, the first and foremost threshold to be\ncleared is that third party should be an aggrieved person.\n\n15.\nIn the case of\nSuraj Lamp and Industries Pvt.

It has been held and observed that\nSection\nof the TP Act makes it clear that contract of sale, that is, an\nagreement of sale, does not, of itself, create any interest in or\ncharge on such property. While discussing the provisions of\nSection\ni.e. requirement of registration of document, it has been held and\nobserved that transfer of immovable property by way of sale can\nonly be by a deed of conveyance and in absence of a deed of\nconveyance (duly stamped and registered as required by law), no\nright, title or interest in an immoveable property can be transferred.\nIn paragraph 12, it has been further observed that any contract of\nsale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed of\nconveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of\n\nSections 54\nand\nof TP Act and will not confer any title nor\ntransfer any interest in an immovable property (except to the\nlimited right granted under\nSection 53A\nof TP Act). According to TP\nAct, an agreement of sale, whether with possession or without\npossession, is not a conveyance as\nSection 54\nof TP Act provides\nthat sale of immoveable property can be made only by a registered\ninstrument. Paragraphs 11 and 12 are reproduced hereinbelow for\nready reference.\n\n\"11.\nSection 54\nof TP Act makes it clear that a contract of sale,\nthat is, an agreement of sale does not, of itself, create any interest\nin or charge on such property. This Court in\nNarandas Karsondas v.\nS.A. Kamtam and Anr.\n(1977) 3 SCC 247, observed:\n\nA contract of sale does not of itself create any interest in, or\ncharge on, the property. This is expressly declared in\nSection 54\nof\nthe Transfer of Property Act. See Rambaran Prosad V/s. Ram Mohit\nHazra [1967]1 SCR 293. The fiduciary character of the personal\nobligation created by a contract for sale is recognised in\nSection 3\n\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and in\nSection 91\nof the Trusts Act.\nThe personal obligation created by a contract of sale is described\nin\nSection 40\nof the Transfer of Property Act as an obligation\narising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of property,\nbut not amounting to an interest or easement therein.\"\n\nIn India, the word `transfer' is defined with reference to the word\n`convey'.

Narayan Bapuji Dhotra\n[2004 (8) SCC\n614] this Court held:\n\n\"Protection provided under\nSection 53A\nof the Act to the proposed\ntransferee is a shield only against the transferor. It disentitles the\ntransferor from disturbing the possession of the proposed\ntransferee who is put in possession in pursuance to such an\nagreement. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the\nproposed transferor who remains full owner of the property till it is\nlegally conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of\nthe transferee. Such a right to protect possession against the\nproposed vendor cannot be pressed in service against a third\nparty.\"\n\nIt is thus clear that a transfer of immoveable property by way of\nsale can only be by a deed of conveyance (sale deed). In the\nabsence of a deed of conveyance (duly stamped and registered as\nrequired by law), no right, title or interest in an immoveable\nproperty can be transferred.\n\n12. Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a\nregistered deed of conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of\nthe requirements of\nsections 54\nand\nof TP Act and will not\nconfer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property\n(except to the limited right granted under\nsection 53A\nof TP Act).\nAccording to TP Act, an agreement of sale, whether with\npossession or without possession, is not a conveyance.\nSection 54\n\nof TP Act enacts that sale of immoveable property can be made\nonly by a registered instrument and an agreement of sale does not\ncreate any interest or charge on its subject matter.\"\n\n16. Similarly, in the case of\nVenigalla Koteswaramma vs.\nMalampati Suryamba\n(supra), the Apex Court, has held and\nobserved that as per\nSection 54\nof the TP Act, an agreement for sale\nof immovable property does not, of itself, create any interest in or\ncharge on such property. A person having an agreement for sale in\nhis favour does not have any right, except the right of obtaining sale\ndeed on that basis. Paragraphs 39 and 39.1 of\nthe said judgment\n,\nread thus:\n\n\"39. Apart from the above, it is also fundamental, as per\nSection 54\n\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, agreement for sale of\nimmoveable property does not, of itself, create any interest in or\ncharge on such property, Bank of India v. Abhay D. Narottam and\nOrs.: (2005) 11 SCC 520. A person having an agreement for sale in\nhis favour does not get any right in the property, except the right of\n\nPage 15 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nobtaining sale deed on that basis8. For ready reference, we may\nreproduce\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act that reads as\nunder: -\n\n\"54. \"Sale\" defined.- \"Sale\" is a transfer of ownership in exchange for\na price paid or promised or part-paid and partpromised. Sale how\nmade.- Such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of\nthe value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a\nreversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered\ninstrument. In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value\nless than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by\na registered instrument or by delivery of the property. Delivery of\ntangible immoveable property takes place when the seller places the\nbuyer, or such person as he directs, in possession of the property.\n\nContract for sale.- A contract for the sale of immoveable property is\na contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms\nsettled between the parties. It does not, of itself, create any interest\nin or charge on such property.\"\n\n39.1. It goes without saying that the alleged agreement for sale did\nnot invest the vendee with title to, or any interest in, the property in\nquestion; and the alleged agreement for sale did not invest the\nvendee with any such right that the plaintiff could not have\nmaintained her claim for partition in respect of the properties left by\nAnnapurnamma without seeking declaration against the agreement.\nTherefore, this plea about non-maintainability of suit for want for\nrelief of declaration against the said agreement for sale remains\ntotally baseless and could only be rejected.\"\n\n17. Therefore, it is well settled that the transfer of immovable\nproperty by way of sale can only be by a deed of conveyance and\ndeed of conveyance, has to be duly stamped and registered as\nrequired by law and in absence thereof, no right, title or interest in\nan immovable property can be transferred. The law enunciated, is\nalso that any contract of sale which is not registered deed of\nconveyance would fall short of the requirements of\nSections 54\nand\nof the TP Act and will not confer any title or interest in an\nimmovable property.\n\n18. Concededly and not in dispute, the applicant is claiming right\nflowing from the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 executed by\nthe respondents except respondent no.10. Concededly, there is no\nsale deed executed in favour of the applicant by the respondents.\nTherefore, the issue which arises for consideration of this Court, is\n\nPage 16 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nas to whether in absence of any registered sale deed, in tune with\nthe provisions of\nSection 54\nof the TP Act read with\nSection 17\nof the\nRegistration Act, 1908, can it be said that any right or interest has\nbeen invested in the applicant. Also, merely on the basis of the\nAgreement to Sell, whether the applicant can be said to be an\naggrieved person. Clearly, answer to both the above referred issues\nhas to be in negative in view of the above referred judgments and\nprinciple laid down therein.\n\n19. At this stage, the judgment of the coordinate bench directly\non the point, is apt to be referred to. In the case of\nPatel Vinodbhai\nKhodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai Kacharabhai\n(supra), the question that\nfell for consideration and recorded in paragraph 2 was that whether\nthe applicants, not a party to the suit, which resulted into\ncompromise decree, can be said to be an aggrieved party to be\nentitled to be conferred right to appeal and to be consequently\ngranted leave to appeal. The answer was given in negative by\nholding that the applicants do not qualify on facts and in law to be\nthe aggrieved persons to be entitled to question the compromise\ndecree between the parties to the suit in question by preferring\nappeal thereagainst. It has also been held that whatever rights the\napplicants can claim on the basis of agreement to sell in their\nfavour, they have to establish such rights and the enforceability\nthereof in an independent proceedings by filing separate suit. The\nsuit for specific performance was filed with respect to Agreement to\nSell dated 29.06.2008 read with supplementary agreement dated\n27.09.2011 executed by the defendants therein. Compromise\npurshis was filed and decree was passed in terms of the\ncompromise. The applicants were aggrieved by the said\ncompromise decree on the ground that the plaintiff had executed an\nagreement to sell dated 05.08.2008 in favour of five persons and\nthose persons, executed an Agreement to Sell in favour of the\n\nPage 17 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\napplicant, and the applicants claimed that they have acquired the\ninterest in the subject property.\n\nReliance was placed on the\njudgment in the case of\nSakina Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors.\nvs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj & Ors.\n(supra). The\ncoordinate bench, considered the provisions of\nSection 96\n, Order 23\nRule 3 of the Code. The aspect of aggrieved person was considered\nin detail and this Court, held that as per the law enunciated, the\nperson filing appeal must have a legal grievance against the\ndecision which wrongfully deprived him of something or affected his\ntitle to something. This Court, after considering various judgments,\nprovisions; held that in order to be entitled to prefer an appeal, a\nperson must be one who can be said to be aggrieved against the\njudgment. The aggrievement has to be a legal aggrievement where\nthe aggrieved person could be said to be prejudicially affected to\npermit him to prefer appeal even if he is not a party to the suit\nproceedings. He must have an appealable interest. A party who\nwould be benefited because of the change in the judgment by\nredressal of the legal injuria is said to have an appealable interest.\nParagraph 9 and connected paragraphs read thus:\n\n\"9.Having discussed the principles of law as above and particularly\nconsidering the concept of 'aggrieved person' to be entitled to enjoy\nthe right to appeal, now the basic facts of the case may be\nrecapitulated and reverted to. The plaintiff Patel Pravinbhai\nKachrabhai of Special Civil Suit No.31 of 2012 had executed\nagreement to sell dated 05th August, 2008 in respect of the subject\nmatter property involved in the above Special Civil Suit for specific\nperformance between the plaintiff and the defendants in favour of\none Patel Bharatkumar and three others. This Bharatkumar and three\nothers, subsequently on 09th December, 2008 executed another\ndocument being agreement for sale in favour of the present\napplicants. When the suit was compromised between the parties to\nthe suit, the applicants on the basis of the above agreements dated\n05th August, 2008 followed by 09th December, 2008 claimed their\ninterest to project themselves as the party aggrieved qua the\ncompromise decree.\n\n9.1 In other words, what is fundamental is that in order to be entitled\nto prefer an appeal, a person must be one who can be said to be\naggrieved against the judgment. This aggrievement has to be a legal\naggrievement where the aggrieved person could be said to be\n\nPage 18 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nprejudicially affected to permit him to prefer appeal even if he is not\na party to the suit proceedings. He must have an appealable interest.\nA party who would be benefited because of the change in the\njudgment by redressal of legal injuria, is said to have an appealable\ninterest. The change in the judgment prayed to be appealed against\nby the third party, when brings an immediate right or legal benefit,\nthen the person can be said to be having appealable interest. This\nappealable interest should not be contingent, speculative or\nfuturative. The appealable interest must be substantial and\nimmediate.\n\n9.2 In order to acquire the status of aggrieved party, the person must\nhave legal interest and an enforceable right which would in turn\nallowing him to question the decree or order by preferring appeal,\nthough he may not be a party to the suit or proceedings. The\napplicants who claim their interest on the basis of the agreements to\nsell as above could not be said to be holding any interest in the\nproperty to be within the definition of legally aggrieved or prejudiced\npersons. As the applicants are not 'aggrieved party' vis-a-vis the\ncompromise decree having regard to their legal status, they could not\nbe clothed with right to appeal. They do not have 'appelable interest'\nin connection with the compromise decree.\"\n\n20. The facts on hand are in close proximity to the facts available\nin the case of\nPatel Vinodbhai Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai\nKacharabhai\n(supra) and\nthe said judgment\n, would directly apply so\nalso the principle.\n\n21. Contention is also raised that the suit would not be\nmaintainable against the consent decree, in view of the judgment in\nthe case of\nPushpa Devi Bhagat vs. Rajinder Singh and Others\n\n(supra). Pertinently, the facts were that the suit was filed by the\nlandlords against the appellant therein for recovery of the\npossession. Recording the submissions of the learned advocate,\norder was passed disposing of the suit as settled and parties were\ndirected to be bound by the statements made. Subsequently, for\nsome of the respondents appearance was filed. It is thereafter, a\nfresh decree was drawn in terms of the final order. It is at that point\nof time, that the appellant therein filed an application for setting\naside the decree dated 18.07.2001 on the ground that she had not\ninstructed her counsel to enter into any compromise on her behalf\nand in absence of any written compromise between the parties, duly\n\nPage 19 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nsigned, there was no lawful agreement or compromise. Application\nfor setting aside the consent decree was not pursued but appeal\nwas filed before the learned District Judge. Consent decree came to\nbe set aside on the ground that there was no agreement or\ncompromise reduced in writing and signed by the parties. The\nmatter was remanded to the trial court. The judgment was subject\nmatter of challenge before the Delhi High Court under Order 43 Rule\n(1-u) of the Code and it allowed the landlord's appeal on the ground\nthat consent decree did not fall under the first part of Order 23 Rule\n3 requiring an agreement or compromise between the parties to be\nin writing and signed by the parties but fell under the second part of\nthe said provisions.\n\n22. It is this judgment of the High Court, which was challenged in\nappeal before the Apex Court and the issues were, (i) whether the\nappeal filed under\nSection 96\nof the Code against the consent\ndecree was maintainable and (ii) whether the compromise resulting\nin a consent decree dated 18.07.2001 was not a valid compromise\nunder Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code. With this background, the Apex\nCourt, held that against consent decree no independent suit can be\nfiled for setting aside the consent decree on the ground that\ncompromise was not lawful in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A\nof the Code. The Apex Court, in paragraph 17, has observed thus:\n\n\"17. The position that emerges from the amended provisions of\nOrder 23, can be summed up thus :\n\n(i) No appeal is maintainable against a consent decree having regard\nto the specific bar contained in\nsection 96(3)\nCPC.\n\n(ii) No appeal is maintainable against the order of the court\nrecording the compromise (or refusing to record a compromise) in\nview of the deletion of clause (m) Rule 1 Order 43.\n\n(iii) No independent suit can be filed for setting aside a compromise\ndecree on the ground that the compromise was not lawful in view of\nthe bar contained in Rule 3A.\n\n(iv) A consent decree operates as an estoppel and is valid and\n\nPage 20 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nbinding unless it is set aside by the court which passed the consent\ndecree, by an order on an application under the proviso to Rule 3 of\nOrder 23.\n\nTherefore, the only remedy available to a party to a consent decree\nto avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which\nrecorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and\nestablish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court\nwhich recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the\nquestion as to whether there was a valid compromise or not. This is\nso because a consent decree, is nothing but contract between\nparties superimposed with the seal of approval of the court. The\nvalidity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the\nagreement or compromise on which it is made. The second\ndefendant, who challenged the consent compromise decree was\nfully aware of this position as she filed an application for setting\naside the consent decree on 21.8.2001 by alleging that there was no\nvalid compromise in accordance with law. Significantly, none of the\nother defendants challenged the consent decree. For reasons best\nknown to herself, the second defendant within a few days thereafter\n(that is on 27.8.2001), filed an appeal and chose not to pursue the\napplication filed before the court which passed the consent decree.\nSuch an appeal by second defendant was not maintainable, having\nregard to the express bar contained in\nsection 96 (3)\nof the Code.\"\n\n23. It has been held that the only remedy available to a party to a\nconsent decree to avoid such consent decree is to approach the\nCourt which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms\nof it and establish that there was no compromise. Therefore, the bar\nis to a party to a consent decree and the remedy available to the\nparty is to approach the Court which recorded the compromise;\nhowever\n,\nthe said judgment\n, did not deal with the right of a third\nparty who was neither a party to the agreement nor the suit nor the\nconsent decree. The said judgment, therefore, would not apply to\nthe facts of the present case.\n\n24. It is noteworthy that it is not in dispute that there is an\nAgreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 in favour of the applicant\nwhich, as is by now well settled would not create or invest any right\nin favour of the applicant. When there is no right invested, simply\nbecause the order which has been passed as a result of the\ncompromise decree, is not the liking of the applicant, would not\nmake a person aggrieved, much less any appealable right in his\n\nPage 21 of 22\n\nUploaded by RAVI PRAVINCHANDRA PATEL(HC01068) on Mon Jan 20 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 20 21:31:17 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CA/3285/2024 JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nfavour.\n\n25. Besides, the applicant has also filed Special Civil Suit no.299\nof 2023 seeking specific performance and is pending.
