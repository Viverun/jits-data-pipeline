No.750/2019, Police Station\n\nAnupgarh, Sangria, District Sri Ganganagar, for the offence under\n\nSections 8\n/\n,\n,\nof NDPS Act.\n\n(Downloaded on 07/02/2023 at 09:38:24 PM)\n\n[2023/RJJD/004129] (2 of 3) [CRLMB-10028/2022]\n\nHeard learned counsel for the parties. Perused the material\n\navailable on record.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners submit that after the\n\nrejection of the first bail application of the petitioners on\n\n11.09.2020, the statement of Seizure Officer has been recorded\n\nas PW-1. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submit that\n\nas per the statement of the Seizure Officer, the procedure for\n\nsearch and seizure as per the\nNDPS Act\nhas not been followed.\n\nTo buttress their contention, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners have relied upon the judgments of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court passed in the cases of\nSanjeev & Anr. Vs. State\n\nof Himachal Pradesh\nreported in 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 267\n\nand State of Punjab Petitioner Vs. Balbir Singh Respondent\n\nreported in AIR 1994 Supreme Court 1872.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners further submit that 3\n\nboxes were recovered from the car, however, the samples from all\n\nthe three boxes have not been sent for FSL. Learned counsel also\n\nsubmit that in the statement, it has come on record that their cars\n\nwere stopped by the seizure/raiding party. However, it has come\n\non record that the contraband has been recovered/intercepted\n\nwhile it was fleeing from the place of recovery/interception. They,\n\ntherefore, pray that the petitioners may be enlarged on bail.\n\nLearned Public Prosecutor opposed the bail applications.\n\nI have considered the submissions made at the bar and have\n\ngone through the relevant record of the case including the\n\n(Downloaded on 07/02/2023 at 09:38:24 PM)\n\n[2023/RJJD/004129] (3 of 3) [CRLMB-10028/2022]\n\nstatement of PW-1-Motaram, who is the Seizure Officer in the\n\npresent case.\n\nAdmittedly, huge quantity of contraband drugs have been\n\nrecovered from the vehicle of the petitioners in which both the\n\npetitioners were present. As far as the recovery of the contraband\n\ndrugs from the vehicle and from the possession of the petitioners\n\nis concerned, there are no contradictory statement of any witness,\n\nwho has appeared before the trial court so far. The factum of\n\nrecovery from the possession and from the car in which the\n\npetitioners were present is conclusively made out from the record\n\nplaced before this Court and the statements made before the trial\n\ncourt.\n\nHaving regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case and considering the fact that huge quantity of\n\ncontraband drugs have been recovered in the present case and\n\nlooking to the nature of accusation and gravity of the offence\n\nwithout expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, I am not\n\ninclined to grant bail under\nSection 439\nCr.P.C. to the petitioners\n\nat this stage.\n\nAccordingly, the present second bail applications preferred by\n\nthe petitioners under\nSection 439\nCr.P.C. are dismissed.\n\n(VINIT KUMAR MATHUR),J\n56-57-Shahenshah/-\n\n(Downloaded on 07/02/2023 at 09:38:24 PM)\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
