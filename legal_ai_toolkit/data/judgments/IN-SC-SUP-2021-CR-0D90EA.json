The First Information Report was registered on the complaint\n\nof the appellant, who is the brother of the deceased. The marriage between the\n\ndeceased and the first respondent was solemnized on 5 July 2018. It has been\n\nalleged in the FIR that at the time of the marriage, a cash amount of Rs 15 lakhs,\n\na motor vehicle and other household articles were provided in dowry. It has\n\nbeen alleged that the first respondent and his parents were not satisfied with the\n\namount of dowry and an amount of Rs 5 lakhs was being demanded. On 8\n\nFebruary 2019, it has been alleged that at about 8.45 pm, a phone call was\n\nreceived from a cell phone from the first respondent when the appellant was\n\ninformed that if he wished to see his sister alive, an amount of Rs 5 lakhs should\n\nbe arranged. It has been alleged that the phone was then disconnected.\n\nHowever, at 1.30 am on 9 February 2019, the appellant is alleged to have\n\nreceived a phone call requiring him to take away the dead body of his sister.\n\nThe FIR records that the appellant together with the members of the family went\n\nto Etawah and found that the matrimonial home of the appellant’s sister was\n\nlocked. They came to know that her dead body had been kept at the district\n\nhospital. On these allegations, the First Information Report came to be registered\n\nat 11.49 am on 9 February 2019.\n\n4 A charge-sheet has been submitted on 3 May 2019 for offences alleged under\n\nSections 498-A\nand\n304-B\nof the Indian Penal Code and\nSections 3\nand\nof the\n\nCrl.A.377/2021\nDowry Prohibition Act\n. The bail application filed by the first respondent was\n\nrejected by the Sessions Judge on 18 June 2019. The High Court was thereafter\n\nmoved in a bail application under\nSection 439\nof Code of Criminal Procedure\n\n1973. After recording the rival submissions, the High Court allowed the\n\napplication, observing thus:\n\n“Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case,\nsubmissions of learned counsel for the parties and keeping in\nview the nature of offence, evidence, complicity of accused\nand without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case,\nthe Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a\ncase for bail. The bail application is allowed.”\n\n5 We have heard Mr Vishal Yadav, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant, Mr Ravinder Singh, learned senior counsel for the first respondent and\n\nMr Sanjay Jain, learned counsel for the State of Uttar Pradesh have appeared in\n\npursuance of the notice issued by this Court on 27 January 2021.\n\n6 Mr Vishal Yadav, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits\n\nthat (i) the High Court has adduced absolutely no reasons for the grant of bail;\n\n(ii) the submission before the High Court that the deceased was suffering from a\n\nmental illness is patently false and the so called medical prescription dated 1\n\nJanuary 2019 was issued by an Ayurvedic doctor about a month before the\n\ndate of the incident on 1 January 2019; (iii) ex facie, the medical prescription\n\nwould indicate that the deceased was not undergoing treatment for a mental\n\ncondition; (iv) the death has taken place within a year of the marriage; and (v)\n\nhaving regard to the provisions of\nSection 304-B\nof the Indian Penal Code and\n\nCrl.A.377/2021\nthe presumptions which arise under\nSections 113-A\nand\n113-B\nof the Evidence\n\nAct, there was no justification for the High Court to grant bail at the present\n\nstage.\n\n7 On the other hand, Mr Ravindra Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the first respondent has supported the view of the High Court, on the\n\nground that (i) the High Court has desisted from expressing any view on the\n\nmerits which may impede the course of the trial; (ii) the statements which have\n\nbeen recorded during investigation would indicate that the death was as a\n\nresult of hanging; (iii) there is no complicity whatsoever of the first respondent;\n\n(iv) hence, it would be appropriate for this Court not to interfere with the order\n\ngranting bail to the first respondent.\n\n8 Mr Sanjay Jain, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of UP has\n\nsubmitted that an attempt has been made on behalf of the accused to\n\nimprove upon the case in the course of the pleadings. He sought to\n\ndemonstrate this by making a reference to paragraph 21 of the bail application\n\nfiled before the High Court, in which it was denied that the mobile number from\n\nwhich the informant was alleged to have received the phone call demanding\n\nadditional dowry was in any manner associated with the family or the near\n\nrelatives of the accused. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that in\n\nparagraph 7 of the counter affidavit before this court, the specific case of the\n\nfirst respondent is that on 8 February 2019, when he was away from home to\n\nattend a marriage of a close friend, he had received a call at 8.45 pm from the\n\nCrl.A.377/2021\nsame mobile number which is referred to in the FIR to the effect that his spouse\n\nhas committed suicide. Hence, it has been submitted that there has been a\n\nclear attempt to improve upon the case which was set up in the application for\n\nbail filed before the High Court.\n\n9 At the present stage, certain basic aspects need to be noted. It is not in dispute\n\nthat the first respondent was married to the sister of the appellant on 5 July 2018.\n\nShe died on 8 February 2019, within a year of the marriage. There are specific\n\nallegations in the First Information Report in regard to the demand of dowry, as\n\nwell as in regard to a phone call being received from the accused in close\n\nproximity to the death of the sister of the appellant when a demand for\n\nadditional amounts of money was made. The submission in support of bail\n\nrecorded by the High Court was that the sister of the appellant was undergoing\n\ntreatment for a mental illness. In this context, it is material to note that in\n\nparagraph 22 of the bail application, the plea was that the deceased was\n\n“suffering from severe headache and was mentally disturbed since the past\n\nnine months” and that she was taken to a doctor by the first respondent. A copy\n\nof the medical prescription, which has been submitted before this Court, would\n\nprima facie indicate that there was no serious ailment. The medical prescription\n\nof the Ayurvedic doctor and the remedies prescribed belie such a claim. Prima\n\nfacie, there are serious allegations in the FIR in regard to the harassment suffered\n\nby the deceased in close proximity to her death over demands for dowry by the\n\naccused. In view of the provisions of\nSection 304-B\nof the Indian Penal Code, as\n\nwell as the presumption which arises under\nSection 113-B\nof the Evidence Act,\n\nCrl.A.377/2021\nthe High Court was clearly not justified in granting bail.\n\n10 The order of the High Court granting bail contains absolutely no reasons at all.\n\nWhile it is true that at the time of considering an application for bail the High\n\nCourt would not be required to launch into a detailed enquiry into the facts\n\nwhich have to be determined in the course of trial, equally an application of\n\nmind by the High Court to the rival submissions is necessary. The High Court has\n\nmerely recorded the submissions and in the extract which we have reproduced\n\nearlier proceeded to grant bail without any evaluation of the rival submissions.\nIn\n\nthis context, it would be worthwhile to reproduce the principle which has been\n\nformulated in the two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in\nBrij Nandan Jaiswal\n\nvs. Munna\nalias Munna Jaiswal (2009) 1 SCC 678 where the Court observed thus:\n\n“It is now a settled law that the complainant can always\nquestion the order granting bail if the said order is not validly\npassed. It is not as if once a bail is granted by any court, the\nonly way is to get it cancelled on account of its misuse. The\nbail order can be tested on merit also. In our opinion,\ntherefore, the complainant could question the merits of the\norder granting bail. However, we find from the order that no\nreasons were given by the learned Judge while granting the\nbail and it seems to have been granted almost mechanically\nwithout considering the pros and cons of the matter. While\ngranting bail, particularly in serious cases like murder some\nreasons justifying the grant are necessary.”\n\n11 In the earlier part of this judgment, we have extracted the lone sentence in the\n\norder of the High Court which is intended to display some semblance of\n\nreasoning for justifying the grant of bail. The sentence which we have extracted\n\nearlier contains an omnibus amalgam of (i) “the entire facts and circumstances\n\nof the case”; (ii) “submissions of learned Counsel for the parties”; (iii) “the nature\n\nCrl.A.377/2021\nof offence”; (iv) “evidence”; and (v) “complicity of accused”. This is followed by\n\nan observation that the “applicant has made out a case for bail”, “without\n\nexpressing any opinion on the merits of the case”. This does not constitute the\n\nkind of reasoning which is expected of a judicial order. The High Court cannot\n\nbe oblivious, in a case such as the present, of the seriousness of the alleged\n\noffence, where a woman has met an unnatural end within a year of marriage.\n\nThe seriousness of the alleged offence has to be evaluated in the backdrop of\n\nthe allegation that she was being harassed for dowry; and that a telephone call\n\nwas received from the accused in close-proximity to the time of death, making\n\na demand. There are specific allegations of harassment against the accused on\n\nthe ground of dowry. An order without reasons is fundamentally contrary to the\n\nnorms which guide the judicial process. The administration of criminal justice by\n\nthe High Court cannot be reduced to a mantra containing a recitation of\n\ngeneral observations. That there has been a judicious application of mind by\n\nthe judge who is deciding an application under\nSection 439\nof the CrPC must\n\nemerge from the quality of the reasoning which is embodied in the order\n\ngranting bail. While the reasons may be brief, it is the quality of the reasons\n\nwhich matters the most. That is because the reasons in a judicial order unravel\n\nthe thought process of a trained judicial mind. We are constrained to make\n\nthese observations because the reasons indicated in the judgment of the High\n\nCourt in this case are becoming increasingly familiar in matters which come to\n\nthis Court. It is time that such a practice is discontinued and that the reasons in\n\nsupport of orders granting bail comport with a judicial process which brings\n\ncredibility to the administration of criminal justice.\n\nCrl.A.377/2021\n12 For the above reasons, we are of the view that the order of the High Court\n\ngranting bail without due application of mind to the relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances as well to the provisions of the law requires the interference of this\n\nCourt.\n\n13 We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and\n\norder of the Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court dated 1 December 2020\n\ngranting bail to the first respondent. The grant of bail to the first respondent shall\n\naccordingly stand set aside and the first respondent shall surrender forthwith.\n\nWe, however, clarify that the observations contained in the present order are\n\nconfined to the issue of bail and shall not affect the merits of the trial.\n\n14 Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.\n\n……….….....…...….......………………........J.\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\n………....…....…........……………….…........J.\n[M R Shah]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nApril 5, 2021\nCKB",
