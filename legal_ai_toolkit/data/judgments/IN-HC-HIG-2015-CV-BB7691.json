Umadevi\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1], rendered\n\nby the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court giving certain benefits to\n\nhave the long tenure of temporary service of more than 10 years in\n\nrespect of irregular appointments (unlike illegal appointments) to be\n\nregularised as a 'one time measure' could be taken as an 'ever to go\n\nexercise' to give regularisation of temporary employees, as and when\n\nthey complete 10 years' service, as sought to be effected by the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee ? Is the said Committee\n\njustified in taking a resolution to regularise the service of such\n\ntemporary hands who are appointed quite recently, even in the year\n\n2013 - '14, that too, without calling for applications by way of wide\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 2 :\n\npaper publication, but for confining such exercise notifying on the\n\nNotice Board of the Devaswom Board or at times in certain local\n\ndailies without calling for applications to fill up the regular vacancies?\n\nIs it appropriate for the Committee to ignore the claim of persons\n\n(temporary hands) who had served the Devaswom longer, even for\n\nmore than 10 years and to extend the benefit of regularisation to\n\npersons having much lesser tenure of about 'two years', merely for\n\nthe reason that the former group having been sent out already were\n\nnot continuing in the service of the Devaswom? These are the vital\n\npoints to be considered and clarified in these matters .\n\n2. The terms and conditions of service of employees in the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom are governed by the provisions of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\nand the Regulations framed by the\n\nManaging Committee [in exercise of the power conferred upon the\n\nCommittee under\nSection 39\nof the said Act]. As per the provisions\n\nof the Act, the appointment of staff is to be carried out by the\n\nManaging Committee, whereas the power to appoint 'temporary\n\nhands' to meet the need of the hour is vested upon the Administrator\n\nappointed/nominated under\nSection 14\nof the Act, of course, with the\n\nprior approval of the Managing Committee, in terms of Regulation\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 3 :\n\nNo.17 framed by the Managing Committee as aforesaid.\n\n3. As per the Regulations, appointment to the regular post of\n\nL.D.Clerks, Scavangers/Sweepers (as involved in the present case) is\n\nto be made by the Committee from the eligible hands. The method of\n\nappointment is by way of 'direct recruitment', either by conducting a\n\nwritten test or interview or both.\n\n4. It is not a matter of dispute that no regular appointment was\n\nbeing effected by the Committee in the Guruvayoor Devaswom for\n\nquite long. Due to one or other reason, the vacancies were being\n\nfilled up by appointing persons on temporary basis and they were\n\npermitted to be continued and regularised in the due course.\n\n5. Such appointment was being done merely on the basis of\n\ninterview, that too just by notifying the same in the Notice Board of\n\nthe Devaswom and at times in some local dailies as well. This became\n\nthe order of the day, which was sought to be challenged from different\n\ncorners and ultimately, the matter came up for consideration before\n\nthis Court in W.P.(C) No.32138 of 2011.\n\n6. After hearing both the sides, a learned Single Judge of this\n\nCourt made it clear point blank, that in so far as the appointment in\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswam was public appointment, it was quite arbitrary\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 4 :\n\nand illegal on the part of the Devaswom to have appointed persons\n\nwithout effecting wide publication in newspapers, but for the notice\n\nput up on the Notice Board of the Devaswom. The Bench also\n\nobserved that the question of unemployment was acute in the State\n\nand nobody could be expected to come to the office of the Devaswom\n\neveryday for watching the Notice Board to know the availability of\n\nany vacancy. The course pursued by the Devaswom was deprecated\n\nand as per Ext.P4 judgment dated 27.06.2012, it was made clear,\n\nwhether the appointment was temporary or permanent, the\n\nDevaswom had to notify the same giving wide publication, at least in\n\none of the newspapers. The fact remains that the said verdict has\n\nbecome final, despite which it is not being honoured by the\n\nDevaswom in letter and spirit as revealed from the course and\n\nproceedings being discussed herein.\n\n7. W.A. No. 481 of 2016 has been filed by the writ petitioner, on\n\nbeing aggrieved of the verdict passed by the learned single Judge,\n\ndeclining interference with regard to the prayer sought for to direct\n\nthe Devaswom to finalise the selection notified in the year 2001. In\n\nfact, interference was declined by the learned Single Judge holding\n\nthat no such relief could be extended to the petitioner, who was\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 5 :\n\nsimply sleeping over the issue for more than 10 years, till filing of the\n\nwrit petition in the year 2011 [W.P.(C) No.24917 of 2011].\n\n8. W.P.(C) No.32574 of 2014 has been filed by the writ\n\npetitioner, when the Guruvayoor Devaswom proceeded with steps to\n\nregularise the service of temporary hands in a quite arbitrary manner\n\neven by seeking to give permanent appointment to persons having\n\ntemporary service of just a few months or few years.\n\n9. The resolution taken by the Board by way of Ext.P3 shows\n\nthe list of persons to be regularised and states that non-extension of\n\nsuch benefit will amount to violation of human rights/fundamental\n\nrights/such other rights of the employees concerned. This was\n\nfollowed by Ext.P5 resolution dated 15.05.2015, whereby the list\n\ncame to be re-arranged, but still extending the benefit of\n\nregularisation to temporary hands who were recruited even in the\n\nyear '2014'. The writ petition was amended to an appropriate extent,\n\nseeking to interdict the above proceedings as highly arbitrary and\n\nillegal.\n\n10. Though the Devaswom took a resolution to regularise the\n\nservice of temporary hands having only two years' of service, on a\n\nmisconceived notion as to the dictum\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 6 :\n\nin\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra], the Government did not give\n\napproval to the same and authorised the Devaswom only to regularise\n\nthe service of persons who had completed 10 years' of temporary\n\nservice.\n\nIt is brought on record that such persons have been\n\nregularised in service as per the initial exercise of regularisation\n\ncarried out in the year 2010 in terms of the observations made by the\n\nApex Court in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra] (paragraph 53/44 in\n\nSCC/AIR respectively). The persons who were left out by the\n\nGovernment are the petitioners in some of the writ petitions; who\n\nseek for a direction to have the resolution taken by the Devaswom to\n\nbe implemented and to interdict the order passed by the\n\nGovernment/Commissioner to the extent they are aggrieved. Some\n\nother persons have approached this Court with the grievance,\n\nparticularly pointing out that they were serving the Devaswom for\n\nquite long, though as 'temporary hands' and that there was no\n\ncomplaint with regard to their service in any manner, nor was there\n\nany disciplinary proceedings. Still, on a fine morning, they were\n\nousted by another set of temporary employees to the choice of the\n\nDevaswom and subsequently, the latter group is sought to be\n\nregularised in service based on the resolution taken in this regard;\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 7 :\n\nwhich is stated as highly arbitrary and illegal and hence the\n\nchallenge.\n\nAll these matters have been tagged up together, being\n\nconnected with a common thread involving the question of\n\n'regularisation of temporary hands' stated as in violation of the law\n\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra]\n\nand for not filling up the regular posts by way of proper selection after\n\nwide publication.\n\n11. Heard Mr. Sajeev Kumar K. Gopal - the learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner in W.P.(C) No.32574 of 2014, Shri V. Krishna Menon -\n\nthe learned Standing Counsel for the Guruvayoor Devaswom, Shri K.\n\nJayakumar - the learned counsel for the party respondents in W.P.(C)\n\nNos. 19263 and 28743 of 2011 , Mr. Jaju Babu, the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the party respondents in W.P.(C) Nos. 4628, 7899,\n\n14871, 15060 of 2012 and 32574 of 2014, and the learned counsel\n\nfor other parties, besides the learned Government Pleader.\n\n12. W.P.(C) No.32574 of 2014 is treated as the 'lead case'\n\nand reference is made to the parties and proceedings as referred to in\n\nthe said case, except where it is separately mentioned with reference\n\nto the context.\n\n13. Way back on 16.02.2001, Ext.P1 notification was issued by\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 8 :\n\nthe Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee, inviting application\n\nfrom eligible candidates to fill up 18 regular posts of Scavengers and\n\nthe future vacancies, which may arise in the due course. The last\n\ndate for submitting the application was on 15.03.2001 . As per Ext.P2,\n\nthe petitioner also applied for the regular selection. But no further\n\nsteps were pursued by the Devaswom, despite collecting huge\n\namounts from the applicants by way of application fee. At the same\n\ntime, temporary employees were being engaged to various posts\n\nincluding the post of Scavenger and some of them were regularised,\n\non pick and choose basis, by the Devaswom. After a long wait, the\n\npetitioner approached this Court by filing W.P.(C) No. 24917 of 2011\n\nto direct the Devaswom to complete the process of regular selection\n\nnotified as per Ext.P1.\n\n14. When the above writ petition was pending and though no\n\ncounter affidavit was filed by the Devaswom, a decision was taken by\n\nthe Managing Committee of the Devaswom vide resolution No.299\n\n(Ext.P3) for regularising the temporary hands stating some 'strange\n\nreasons' and authorising the sub-committee constituted in this regard\n\nto submit a report within one month. This made the petitioner to\n\nchallenge Ext.P3 by way of W.P.(C) No. 32574 of 2014, wherein an\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 9 :\n\ninterim order was passed on 04.12.2014 staying all further\n\nproceedings pursuant to Ext.P3. The said interim order subsequently\n\ncame to be modified as per the order dated 20.02.2015 passed by a\n\nlearned Judge of this Court, whereby the Guruvayoor Devaswom was\n\npermitted to proceed with further steps and directing to submit a\n\nreport before this Court.\n\n15. It was thereafter that Ext. P5 resolution was passed by the\n\nDevaswom Managing Committee on 15.05.2015 to regularise the\n\nservice of temporary employees w.e.f. 01.04.2015, subject to the\n\napproval of the Government. As per the said resolution, the\n\nDevaswom reiterated its earlier stand to have the temporary hands\n\nregularized, lest, there should be \"any violation of human\n\nrights/fundamental rights of the temporary employees\" and as if it\n\nwere in conformity with the law declared by the Apex Court in\n\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra]. List of the persons who were stated\n\nas qualified; list of persons who were not qualified; besides such other\n\nlist in respect of various posts giving particulars of the candidates\n\nshowing their date of birth, caste, qualification, age as on the date of\n\nappointment, whether initial appointment was based on any\n\nnotification and interview and the vacancy position were also attached\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 10 :\n\nalong with Ext. P5. Another important aspect to be noted is that,\n\nearlier, in conformity with the decision taken by the Government to\n\nleave the appointment of staff in the Travancore Devaswom Board and\n\nCochin Devaswom Board to be effected by the PSC, resolutions were\n\npassed by the Guruvayoor Devaswom as well in this regard on\n\n12.02.2007 and 03.10.2007. However, the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee later took a 'U-turn' and resolved as per Ext. P5,\n\nto cancel the earlier resolutions leaving appointment to the PSC [taken\n\non 10.02.2007 and 03.10.2007], which was decided to be informed to\n\nthe Government, Devaswom Secretary and also to the Devaswom\n\nCommissioner. It is contended by the petitioners that hundreds of\n\nundeserving candidates have been included in the list, intending them\n\nto be regularized, also pointing out nobody has completed 10 years of\n\nservice as temporary service, but for a few. It is pointed out that\n\neven persons having just 'nine months' of service as a temporary\n\nhand are proposed to be regularized and in many cases, as revealed\n\nfrom the entry in the last column of the list, there was no notification\n\nor any selection process. With reference to list A forming part of\n\nExt.P5, it is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioners that, 272\n\npersons are going to be regularized; among whom only 14 persons\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 11 :\n\nhave got more than 10 years service. In respect of list B, in several\n\ncases, there was no notification or any process of selection and many\n\npersons are not having the requisite qualification or they are\n\noveraged. In several cases, dates of appointment have not been\n\ngiven, still, about 50 persons are going to be regularized from list B,\n\nsubmits the learned counsel. This being the position, the\n\ncircumstances which led to the decision to regularize the service of the\n\ntemporary hands, considering the alleged continuance of service or\n\nhardships is actually a non-existing ground and that the process and\n\nprocedure is nothing but arbitrary and illegal.\n\nIt is also pointed out\n\nthat, one time regularization for those who had already crossed 10\n\nyears of service as envisaged in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra] has\n\nbeen effected by the Devaswom, vide Ext. R1 (b) resolution No. 69\n\ndated 25.11.2010 and as such, no more similar exercise was liable to\n\nbe pursued, but for filling up the regular vacancies after wide publicity\n\nand a proper selection process.\n\n16. According to the learned standing counsel for the\n\nDevaswom, 'one time regularization' [after passing the verdict in\n\nUmadevi\n's case (cited supra)] was effected as per Ext.R1(b)\n\nResolution No. 69 dated 25.11.2010. It is stated that, though Ext. P1\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 12 :\n\nnotification was issued in the year 2001 for filling up the regular\n\nvacancies, some litigations were pending before this Court as O.P.\n\nNos. 5177 of 1999 and 15437 of 1999, which were disposed of only in\n\nthe year 2005; by virtue of which, Ext. P1 could not be acted upon.\n\nShortly thereafter, Ordinance No. 5 dated 05.02.2007 was\n\npromulgated by the Governor, leaving the recruitment in the\n\nDevaswom Board [Cochin Devaswom Board and Travancore\n\nDevaswom Board] to the PSC. It was soon thereafter that the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Board also passed a resolution as per Ext.\nR1\n\n(a) dated 10.02.2007 to leave the recruitment to the PSC, though it\n\nwas subsequently changed as per Ext. P5, in view of the reasons\n\nstated therein. As per Ext. R1(b) Resolution No. 69 dated\n\n25.11.2010, it was decided to regularize all persons having two years\n\nor more temporary service, following the principles in the Umadevi's\n\ncase [cited supra]. But on forwarding the proceedings for approval,\n\nthe Commissioner gave sanction for regularisation of only those\n\npersons who were having 10 years or more temporary service. Based\n\non the said approval, 18 persons were regularised in service. The\n\nlearned standing counsel further submits that regularisation of\n\ntemporary hands, who had completed 10 years of service was being\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 13 :\n\npursued in the Devaswom at different points of time and till\n\n06.11.2012, 124 temporary hands in different posts were regularised\n\nwith the approval of the Commissioner/Government. It is also\n\npointed out that 24 mahouts, who were serving the Devaswom on\n\ntemporary basis were regularised as per Resolution No. 24 dated\n\n02.08.2014 and the Government gave approval in this regard on\n\n31.10.2014. Since the Commissioner/Government had given\n\nsanction/approval/regularisation of only those temporary hands, who\n\nwere having 10 years or more service, the remaining persons who\n\nwere included in the list prepared by the Devaswom [who were\n\nbeneficiary to the resolution taken in this regard] approached this\n\nCourt by filing different writ petitions, wherein Ext. R1(c) interim order\n\nof stay was granted by this Court on 22.12.2011. It was in the said\n\ncircumstances, that the entire facts and figures were considered,\n\nleading to resolution No. 299 dated 25.08.2014 [Ext. P3] deciding to\n\nregularise the service of the temporary employees, in view of the\n\nserious hardships pointed out by the employees. It was only at this\n\npoint of time, that the petitioner sought to challenge the said\n\nproceedings [Ext. P3] by filing W.P.(C) No. 24917 of 2011, to cause\n\nExt. P1 notification/regular appointment to be finalized and on\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 14 :\n\ndismissal of the same [for being belated], he has come up in Writ\n\nAppeal No. 481 of 2016. The learned standing counsel further\n\npointed out that the petitioner has not challenged the temporary\n\nappointment effected by the Devaswom at any point of time and that,\n\nas on the date of filing the proceedings, he is overaged, having\n\ncrossed the age of 45 years. The learned standing counsel submits\n\nthat the writ petition itself is not maintainable, as it is to be regarded\n\nonly as a 'public interest litigation' [being not qualified], which course\n\nis not open in 'service matters' in view of the law declared by the Apex\n\nCourt/this Court. It is further pointed out that the regularisation\n\nsought to be made by the Devaswom is a 'policy decision', which is not\n\nliable to be intercepted and further that there is no violation of the\n\nprinciples of natural justice or the provisions of the\nGuruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Act\nor the\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Employees Regulation\n\nAct\nand so also, there is no violation of\nArticles 14\nor 16 of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n17. W.P.(C) No. 4070 of 2015 has been filed by two persons,\n\nwho responded to the notification for filling up of five existing and the\n\nfuture vacancies of the LDC, as per notification No. R1-720/2000\n\ndated 27.10.2000. No further steps were taken by the Devaswom,\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 15 :\n\ndespite the representation and reminders and the regular selection\n\nwas not done. The proceedings of the Devaswom regularising the\n\nservice of temporary hands in different posts have been produced and\n\nmarked as Exts. P5 to P11, as noted below:-\n\n- Ext. P11 dated 25.11.2010 pertains to the\n\nresolution No. 69 as to the regularisation of temporary\n\nhands in different posts as \"one time measure\" pursuant to\n\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra] [having 10 years of\n\ntemporary service or more].\n\n- Ext. P10 dated 01.03.2011 is as to the\n\nregularisation of 18 class IV/room boys etc. having 10 years\n\nof temporary service.\n\n- Ext. P7 Resolution No. 2 dated 02.07.2012 as to the\n\nregularisation of 'Krishnattam' workers having 10 years of\n\ntemporary service.\n\n- Ext. P6 dated 18.09.2012 resolution No. 125 - with\n\nreference to regularisation of Scavengers having 10 years of\n\ntemporary service.\n\n- Ext. P8 dated 14.06.2013 resolution No. 155 - as to\n\nthe regularisation of Sweepers/Scavengers having 10 years\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 16 :\n\nor more.\n\n- Ext. P9 dated 11.06.2014 - as to the regularisation\n\nof 'Sweepers/Scavengers/Vilakkuthuda' of 10 years of\n\ntemporary service or more.\n\n- Ext. P5 dated 02.08.2014 - resolution No. 24 - with\n\nreference to regularisation of 53 temporary mahouts.\n\n18. From the above, it can be seen that regularisation of\n\ntemporary hands was a regular phenomenon and was being adopted\n\nby the Devaswom as a method of recruitment, which is contrary to the\n\nStatute/law declared by the Apex Court in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited\n\nsupra]. In fact, the Devaswom Commissioner had written to the\n\nAdministrator and the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee,\n\nvide Ext. P12 dated 25.09.2013, as to the said undesirable activity\n\nand directing the Guruvayoor Devaswom to go for direct recruitment\n\n[in connection with the post of Scavenger]; also mentioning that\n\nweightage could be given to those who were having 10 years of\n\ntemporary service or more. As per Ext.P13 order dated 03.11.2012\n\npassed by the Commissioner, on regularisation of Scavengers who\n\nwere having 10 years of temporary service or more, various conditions\n\nwere incorporated and the Devaswom was alerted in this regard. The\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 17 :\n\nfact remains that, Exts. P12 and P13 were simply given a 'go-bye' and\n\nthe Guruvayoor Devaswom was continuing to engage temporary\n\nhands and later, regularizing them in service as a matter of course,\n\nwithout sufficient publication or due process of selection.\n\n19. It is pointed out that by virtue of\nS.19\nof the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Act, 1978, appointment of officers and employees in the\n\nDevaswom has to be effected by the Managing Committee. 10% of the\n\nposts stand reserved for SC/ST. In fact, the selection has to be\n\nconducted by the 'Sub Committee' appointed by the Managing\n\nCommittee, which is governed by the Regulations framed by the\n\nManaging Committee stipulating the qualification, age, method of\n\nselection etc. Regulation No.4 clearly says that the 'appointing\n\nauthority' is the Managing Committee, while Regulation No.5 stipulates\n\nthe method of recruitment, i.e., (a) by Direct recruitment ( by test or\n\ninterview or both); (b) by promotion and (c) in respect of temporary\n\nposts (with liberty to the Managing Committee to decide the method).\n\nThe said provisions are extracted below for convenience of reference.\n\n\"Regulation No.4:\n\n\"4. Appointing Authority: The appointing\n\nauthority for all the posts in the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 18 :\n\nService shall be the Managing Committee.\n\nRegulation No.5.\n\n\"5. Method of Appointment: Appointment to\n\nthe following categories of posts in the Guruvayur\n\nDevaswom Service shall be made as follows:\n\n(a) Direct recruitment shall be made after due\n\npublication of notices inviting applications. Eligible\n\npersons shall be called for written test or interview\n\nor both and selection made on the basis of merit.\n\n(b) In the case of appointments by promotion\n\nor direct recruitments, direct recruitment shall be\n\nresorted to only if suitable qualified candidates for\n\npromotion are not available\n\n(c) The Managing Committee shall decide the\n\nmethod of appointment in the case of temporary posts\n\nas and when required\n\nProvided that the posts of Executive Engineer,\n\nAssistant Executive Engineer, Assistant Engineer,\n\nPersonal Assistant to administrator, Accounts Officer\n\nand Manager shall be treated as selection category.\n\nAppointment to the selection category shall be made\n\nby the Managing Committee from among members\n\neligible for appointment to such category on the basis\n\nof merit and ability, seniority being considered only\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 19 :\n\nwhere merit and ability are approximately equal.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n(d) Qualifications:- xx xx xx\n\n(e) Qualification regarding age: (i) xx\n\nxx xx\n\n(ii) The Managing Committee shall prescribe\n\nage limit in the case of temporary posts as and when\n\nrequired.\"\n\n20. The different posts are mentioned in the Schedule and all\n\nthe posts involved herein are direct recruitment posts [LDC at\n\nSl.No.62, Sweeper at Sl.No.77 and Scavenger at Sl.No.78]. Going by\n\nthe contents of the above provisions, conferring power of appointment\n\nupon the 'Managing Committee' is obviously in respect of\n\nregular/permanent appointment (in respect of direct recruitment and\n\npromotion as well), besides the power of appointment to \"temporary\n\nposts\". Appointment to a 'temporary post' is different from\n\n'temporary appointment' in a regular post. 'Temporary appointment' in\n\na regular post is governed by Regulation No.17, which reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"17. Temporary appointment:- Where it is\n\nnecessary in the interest of the Devaswom owing to\n\nan emergency which has arisen to fill immediately a\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 20 :\n\nvacancy in a post and there would be undue delay in\n\nmaking such appointment in accordance with the\n\nregulations, the Administrator may appoint a person\n\notherwise than in accordance with the regulations\n\ntemporarily after obtaining the approval of the\n\nManaging Committee.\n\nProvided that a person appointed under this\n\nregulation shall not be allowed to continue in such\n\npost for a period exceeding 180 days and that he\n\nshall be paid the minimum pay in the time scale of pay\n\napplicable to such post. \"\n\n21. From the above, it is quite clear that the appointing\n\nauthority to effect 'temporary appointment' is none other than the\n\nAdministrator, of course, with the approval of the Managing\n\nCommittee and it shall be for a maximum period of 180 days. In the\n\ninstant case, no pleading is raised by the Devswom that the\n\nAdministrator had sought for approval to effect 'temporary\n\nappointment' at any time or that such appointments were effected by\n\nthe Administrator with the approval of the Managing Committee. The\n\nsaid power under\nRegulation 17\ncannot be simply taken over by the\n\nManaging Committee, merely stating that as per\nRegulation 4\n,\n\nappointing authority is the Managing Committee, which, as mentioned\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 21 :\n\nabove, is only in respect of filling up of 'regular posts', either by way\n\nof direct recruitment or by way of promotion, apart from filling up the\n\n'temporary posts' under Regulation No.5 (c) [where the Managing\n\nCommittee is at liberty to decide the method of appointment]. Since\n\nthe Managing Committee is bound by the Act and Regulations, there is\n\nviolation of the provisions of law in this regard. It is to be noted that\n\npendency of O.P.Nos. 5177 and 15437 of 1999 was never taken as a\n\nbar or hurdle by the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee\n\nwhile proceeding with the regular selection to the posts notified in the\n\nyear 2001, vide Ext.P1. There was no interim order as well. If this be\n\nthe position, why it was not pursued further, remains a matter of\n\nmystery, which has not been properly substantiated to the satisfaction\n\nof this Court, whereas the Devaswom was going all along with\n\ntemporary engagements and subsequent regularisation, which is\n\ntotally alien to the Scheme of the Act/Regulations. This is more so,\n\nsince the Devaswom, while passing Ext.P3/P5 Resolutions, laments\n\nthat they have no supporting staff and much hardships are being felt;\n\nwhich is stated as a reason for regularisation of service of temporary\n\nhands having even much less than one year of service. It was for the\n\nDevaswom to have done sufficient home work as to the job\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 22 :\n\nrequirements, vacancy position, number of retirements already\n\noccurred and which were to occur in the near future and such other\n\naspects, taking appropriate steps for filling up the vacancies on\n\n'regular basis'; instead of going on temporary appointment and\n\nsubsequent regularisation, confining the zone of consideration only to\n\na limited few, for want of sufficient publication and also for want of\n\nnon-intimation as to the chance for getting regulalrised, to make the\n\naspirants in the open market aware of the position.\n\n22. In DBP Nos. 79 of 2014 and 60 of 2015, it is seen that an\n\ninterim order was passed by this Court on 06.07.2015 to report\n\nvacancies in the Cochin Devaswom and Travancore Devaswom Board\n\nto the Devaswom Recruitment Board. It appears that the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee has wrongly understood\n\nthe scope of\nUmadevi\n's case (cited supra) and nurtured a\n\nmisconceived idea as to the scope of regularisation. Instead of\n\ngiving the benefit as a 'one time measure' to regularise the service of\n\npersons having more than 10 years (which already has been effected\n\nas per the resolution No.69 dated 25.11.2010) they were going, on\n\nyear after year, regularising the service of temporary hands on\n\ncompletion of 10 years' of service as a 'routine process', even beyond\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 23 :\n\nall logical limits, when they resolved, as per Ext.P3, to regularise the\n\nservice of persons having even two years' continuous service as\n\ntemporary hands and even in respect of persons who were having less\n\nthan one year of service, as enlisted in Ext.P5.\n\n23. It is pointed out that, pursuant to the Government decision\n\nand subsequent Ordinance to leave the field of recruitment in the\n\nCochin Devaswom Board and the Travancore Devaswom Board to the\n\npurview of PSC, the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee also\n\nhad requested the Government to suitably amend the\nGuruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Act and the Guruvayoor Devaswom Employees\n\nRecruitment Act\n, to have a similar course. It is stated that nothing\n\nhas transpired, despite reminders.\n\n24.\nThe Travancore Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions\n\nAct, 1950\nwas amended in the year 2008, facilitating the recruitment\n\nthrough the PSC, which was varied in the year 2012 by a further\n\namendment, whereby mode of appointment through the PSC was\n\nwithdrawn. Though appointment through the PSC was facilitated\n\nduring 2008-2012, since the relevant/additional rules were not\n\nframed, no appointment was effected through the PSC. It was much\n\nlater, that an Ordinance was issued in the year 2015, whereby Kerala\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 24 :\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board was constituted by the Government in\n\nrespect of all the Devaswoms mentioned in the said Act. According to\n\nthe learned counsel for the Devaswom, the provisions of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act and the Guruvayoor Devaswom Employees\n\nRegulations Act\nhave not been amended to the requisite extent, which\n\naccording to the petitioners, who challenge the proceedings of the\n\nDevaswom is not necessary; in view of the relevant Ordinance issued\n\nin 2014, followed by Act 16 of 2015, which clearly stipulates that the\n\nsame is applicable in respect of the Travancore Devaswom, Cochin\n\nDevaswom, Malabar Devaswom, Koodalmanikkam Devaswom and also\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom and hence, there is no obscurity. There is a\n\ncontention that the\nGuruvaryoor Devaswom Act\nhad obtained the\n\nassent of the President and no amendment has been made so far to\n\ncause the appointment to be made through the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board constituted under the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015 (Act 16 of 2015) brought into force\n\nw.e.f. 01.03.2014, which cannot be applied in this case. (A copy of the\n\nAct is produced with the statement filed by the said Recruitment\n\nBoard in W.P.(C) No. 30801 of 2016).\n\n25. As mentioned already, when W.P.(C) No. 32574 of 2014\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 25 :\n\ncame up for consideration before a learned Judge of this Court, it was\n\nobserved that the petitioner had approached this Court only belatedly\n\n[with reference to the claim for regular appointment notified in 2001]\n\nand hence that the prayers were not liable to be acted upon. It was\n\nalso observed in the said circumstance that it will only remain as\n\n'PIL' and it was accordingly, that the matter was caused to be referred\n\nto the Division Bench as per the order dated 15.10.2015. Before\n\npassing the said order, there was an interim order of stay, which was\n\nsubsequently modified permitting the Devaswom to proceed with\n\nsteps for regularisation, except in the case of Scavenger, L.D. Clerk\n\nand Lineman (involved in the cases pending consideration before this\n\nCourt). It is pointed out by the learned Standing Counsel for the\n\nDevaswom that, though temporary vacancies were notified in 2006,\n\n2007, 2013 and 2014 in the local dailies, the petitioner did not make\n\nany application. It is however conceded that such notices were being\n\npublished mostly in the local notice Board, as the temporary\n\nengagement was merely from locals, who alone would be available for\n\nsuch engagement. It is further pointed out that, although the interim\n\norder was modified as per order dated 03.08.2015 permitting the\n\nDevaswom to proceed with the selection in respect of other posts\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 26 :\n\n[except the posts of Scavenger, LDC and Lineman], it was actually not\n\nproceeded with, but kept in abeyance. There is inordinate delay in\n\napproaching this Court and there is no whisper as to what the\n\npetitioners were doing for the past 13 years and hence they cannot\n\nquestion the regularisation now.\n\n26. The learned Standing Counsel for the Recruitment Board\n\nsubmits with reference to\nSection 2(b)\nof Act 16 of 2015 , brought\n\ninto effect from 01.03.2014 [Ext.R5(g) in W.P.(C)No. 30801 of 2016]\n\nthat the Devaswom Board means the Cochin Devaswom Board,\n\nTravancore Devaswom Board, Malabar Devaswom Board, Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Board and Koodalmanikkam Devaswom.\nSection 9\ndeals\n\nwith the power and functions of the Board and hence after the said\n\nenactment, all appointments stand vested with the Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board and nobody else. Since the Act had come into\n\nforce with effect from 01.03.2014, Ext.R5 (h) decision dated\n\n25.08.2014, Ext.R5(i) decision dated 02.08.2014 and Ext.R5(j)\n\ndecision dated 15.05.2015 (having passed after commencement of the\n\nAct) are not correct or sustainable in law.\n\n27. The learned counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 15060\n\nof 2012 points out that the first petitioner is having more than 10\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 27 :\n\nyears' of temporary service and was working in the post of 'Ayah' in\n\nthe school belonging to Devaswom. Despite the better rights and\n\ncredentials, she was simply sent out and somebody else of the choice\n\nof the Managing Committee was appointed as a temporary hand in\n\n2012. When the course pursued by the Devaswom was challenged,\n\nwith reference to the process of selection for temporary engagement,\n\nthe said petitioner was also permitted to participate in the interview,\n\nas per the oral instruction given by this Court in this regard. Though\n\nshe participated in the process, she was not selected and undue\n\nfavours were extended to respondents 6 and 7, who were appointed\n\non temporary basis and are now sought to be regularised. In the said\n\ncircumstance, the writ petition was amended, also challenging the\n\nappointment of the respondents 6 and 7. Even at the time of taking\n\nResolution No.69 by the Guruvaryoor Devaswom vide Ext.P14,\n\ndeciding to regularise the service of the persons having 'two years'\n\nor more, the petitioners were still omitted to be included in the list and\n\nhence the prayer to include them in Ext.P14. It is also pointed out\n\nthat, one Smt. Ajitha A.S., who had also applied along with the\n\nsecond petitioner in the year 2007 was included in the list, while the\n\npetitioner came to be avoided, for no reason at all. There is a further\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 28 :\n\ncontention that some of the teachers working in the school were\n\nterminated from service in 2006-07, when they approached this Court\n\nby filing writ petitions, whereupon their claim was directed to be\n\nconsidered. Pursuant to this, they were decided to be included and\n\naccordingly, they were reinstated and subsequently regularised in\n\nservice (Ext.P16). Still, the petitioners are made to wait outside,\n\nwhich is stated as an instance of arbitrary exercise; more so when\n\nthey came to be excluded even as per proceedings dated 15.05.2015,\n\nwhile deciding to regularise the service of respondents 6 and 7.\n\n28. With reference to the pleading in W.P.(C)No. 2008 of 2016\n\n(where the post involved is LDC), the version of the Administrator of\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom is that the employees concerned do not have\n\nthe minimum service of 10 years and that the decision of the\n\nManaging Committee is bad. The case of the Devaswom is that the\n\nAdministrator of the Devaswom has no power to say so and that the\n\nAdministrator has only to implement the decision taken by the\n\nDevaswom. This is sought to be controverted by referring to the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Rules, 1980, to the effect that the duty cast\n\nupon the Administrator is not to implement each and every decision\n\nof the Managing Committee passed contrary to law, but implement\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 29 :\n\nonly the 'lawful decision' taken by the Managing Committee. There is\n\na contention for the Devaswom that it is not for the Administrator to\n\ndecide what is lawful and what is not; and that the order of the\n\nAdministrator stands suspended by the Managing Committee, as on\n\ndate. It is to be noted that, no counter affidavit has been filed by the\n\nAdministrator, who is a Sub Collector nominated by the Government.\n\nCounter affidavit has been filed only by the Chairman of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee; presumably in view of\n\nthe apparent conflict of opinion between the Administrator and the\n\nCommittee.\n\n29. Sri. Jayakumar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners in W.P.(C) Nos. 19263 of 2011 and 28743 of 2011\n\n[Scavengers and Linemen respectively] submits that the main prayer\n\nis to implement the resolution No. 69 taken by the Managing\n\nCommittee of the Devaswom vide Ext.P6 dated 25.11.2010 as such.\n\nIt is stated that the said resolution was taken to regularise the\n\ntemporary hands having 'two years' of service, which was based on a\n\n'legal opinion' obtained in this regard and as such, there is nothing\n\nwrong in it. Whether the dictum\nlaid down by\nthe Constitution Bench\n\nof the Apex Court in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra] is to be understood\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 30 :\n\nbased on such legal opinion obtained, if it be contrary [howsoever\n\nhigh, the status of the opinion-giver be] is not answered by the\n\nDevaswom or the learned counsel. It is stated that, the writ petitions\n\ncame to be filed, when the temporary employees were sought to be\n\nreplaced by another set of temporary employees. Later, election was\n\ndeclared to the General Assembly in the State and by virtue of the\n\nchange in Government, the Managing Committee of the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom also got changed in the due course. It is conceded that\n\nno regular appointment was being effected in the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom from 2001 onwards. With regard to the subsequent\n\ncourse and events, the learned senior counsel pointed out that Ext. P1\n\nresolution passed by the Board/Managing Committee to regularise the\n\nservice of the persons having \"two years\" of service is a 'policy\n\ndecision', which ought not to have been modified or watered down by\n\nthe Government/Devaswom Commissioner, for want of any power in\n\nthis regard. The Deputy Commissioner is never placed above the\n\nManaging Committee and once the schedule is created and approved,\n\nthe power of appointment is always with the Managing Committee, in\n\nterms of\nSection 19\nof the Act, which does not stipulate that assent of\n\nthe Commissioner is required for effecting appointment. The Statute\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 31 :\n\nonly says that, if any 'change in the schedule' is required, it shall only\n\nbe with the approval of the Commissioner. This Court is of the view\n\nthat the jurisdiction being exercised by this Court in connection with\n\nthe affairs of the Temple is 'parens patriae jurisdiction', Hindu Deity\n\nbeing a perpetual minor, care has to be taken to see that the action\n\ntaken by Managing Committee and in turn by the Devaswom, is\n\ntransparent in all respects and in conformity with the statutory\n\nprovisions and the law declared by the Apex Court/this Court on the\n\npoint.\n\n30. A reference to Regulation No. 17 of the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Employees Regulations 1983 may be useful in this context,\n\nwhich reads as follows :\n\n\"Temporary appointment :- Where it is necessary\n\nin the interest of the Devaswom owing to an emergency\n\nwhich has arisen to fill immediately a vacancy in a post and\n\nthere would be undue delay in making such appointment in\n\naccordance with the regulations, the Administrator may\n\nappoint a person otherwise than in accordance with the\n\nregulations of temporarily after obtaining the approval of\n\nthe Managing Committee.\n\nProvided that a person appointed under this\n\nregulation shall not be allowed to continue in such post of a\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 32 :\n\nperiod of exceeding 180 days and that he shall be paid the\n\nminimum pay in the time scale of pay applicable to such\n\npost.\"\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that such appointment by agreement under\n\nthe special circumstances mentioned therein is only to fill the gap in\n\nview of the lacunae, for want of special provision to be brought about\n\nin consistency with the regulations as to the conditions of service, pay\n\nand allowances, discipline and conduct. A person appointed under the\n\nsaid regulation shall not be regarded as a regular member of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Service and shall not be entitled by reason of\n\nsuch engagement for appointment, giving any preferential claim. As it\n\nstands so, the appointment of a temporary hand, separately dealt with\n\nunder Regulation No. 17, is to be effected by the 'Administrator' with\n\napproval of the Managing Committee; which stands on a different\n\nfooting and such power cannot be assumed by the 'Managing\n\nCommittee' as an alternate method of recruitment, in exercise of\n\npower of the Committee under the Act or Regulations which deals with\n\nappointment to the 'permanent cadre' or appointment to any\n\n'temporary posts' [not 'temporary service' in a permanent post].\n\n31. A contention has been put forth by the learned senior\n\ncounsel that the decision rendered by the Constitution Bench in\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 33 :\n\nUmadevi\n's case was considered in the subsequent decision rendered\n\nby 'two member' Bench of the Apex Court in\nJodhpur Vidyut Vitran\n\nNigam Ltd. Vs. Nanu Ram and Others\n[(2006) 12 SCC 494],\n\nwhere regularisation of service of persons having two years was\n\nsought for and it was approved by the Apex Court. With reference to\n\nthe directions given by the Apex Court in some cases to formulate a\n\nScheme for regularization, the learned counsel submits that the said\n\nprinciple can be applied in the present case as well. The said\n\nsubmission does not appear to be attractive as the power vested with\n\nthe Apex Court under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution of India to pass\n\nappropriate orders to meet the ends of justice is not available with this\n\nCourt, in exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\n\nof India.\n\n32. The learned Govt. Pleader submits that it is not correct on\n\nthe part of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee to\n\ncontend that the Government and the Commissioner do not have any\n\nsay in the affairs of the Devaswom. The position is evident from\n\nvarious provisions in the Act [\nThe Guruvayoor Devaswom Act\n], as\n\nnoted below:\n\n-\nSection 4(d)\nand (e), showing the constitution of the\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 34 :\n\nManaging Committee as nominated by the Government from\n\nthe Hindus among the Council of Ministers.\n\n-\nSection 5(2)\n, as to cessation of membership of a\n\nmember on his resignation, to be accepted by the Government.\n\n-\nSection 5(3)\n, conferring the power of the Government\n\nto order removal from the office of the membership referred\n\nto in sub-\nsection 3(e)\n.\n\n-\nSection 6\n, as to the power of the Government dealing\n\nwith dissolution and supersession of the Committee\n\n-\nSection 11\n, Restriction on the alienation of Devaswom\n\nProperty unless sanctioned by the Commissioner.\n\n-\nSection 12\n, Limitation on the borrowing and lending\n\npowers of the Committee unless sanctioned by the\n\nCommissioner.\n\n-\nSection 13\n, Duty of the Committee to submit report\n\nto the Commissioner on the administration of the affairs of\n\nthe Devaswom .\n\n-\nSection 14\n, Duty of the Managing Committee to appoint\n\nan officer of the Government, not below the rank of Deputy\n\nCollector, to be the Administrator of the Devaswom\n\n-\nSection 18(2)\n, as to the power of approval of the\n\nestablishment schedule by the Commissioner\n\n-\nSection 20\n, as to the power of the Commissioner to\n\ndirect the Committee with regard to fixation of standard\n\nscales of expenditure .\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 35 :\n\n-\nSection 21\n, as to the power of the Commissioner to\n\nmake alterations, omissions or additions in the budget .\n\n-\nSection 22\n, Restriction that no alteration shall be made\n\nin the working balance without the consent of the\n\nCommissioner (in relation to supplementary budget. )\n\n-\nSection 26\n, Power vested with the Commissioner with\n\nregard to rectification of defects disclosed in the audit and\n\norder of discharge against the Committee.\n\n- Section 33, Conferring power on the Government to call\n\nfor records and pass orders , if the\n\nproceedings/orders//decisions taken by the Committee are in\n\nviolation of the provisions of the Act or against the interest\n\nof the Devaswom and to have it modified or annulled or\n\nreversed or re-considered .\n\n-\nSection 36\n, conferring power to remove the difficulties\n\nin giving effect to the Act with the Government.'\n\n-\nSection 38\n, the rule making power vested with the\n\nGovernment to carry out the purpose of the Act.\n\n-\nSection 39\n: The power of the Government to\n\napprove/disapprove/modify the regulations formulated by the\n\nManaging Committee.\n\nInspite of the above clear provisions and despite the specific\n\ninstructions issued by the Government to the Managing Committee,\n\nthe Guruvayoor Devaswom was continuing with temporary\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 36 :\n\nappointments and subsequent regularisation as a method of\n\nrecruitment, which is contrary to law and hence liable to be\n\nintercepted.\n\n33. In reply to submission made from the part of the Standing\n\nCounsel of the Devaswom, particularly as to the 'locus standi' of the\n\npetitioners in W.P(C) No. 32574 of 2014 and W.P.(C) No. 4070 of\n\n2015, as referred to in the reference order dated 15.10.2015, that no\n\nPublic Interest Litigation (PIL) will lie in a 'service matter', it is stated\n\nthat a writ petition taken up for consideration as 'PIL' is not a service\n\nmatter at all. It is with regard to the 'process of recruitment' being\n\npursued by the Guruvayoor Devaswom, contrary to the relevant\n\nprovisions of law and also declaration made by this Court as per\n\nExt.P4 judgment in W.P.(C) No.32138 of 2011, that the writ petition\n\nhas been instituted. It is stated that the law declared by the Division\n\nBench of this Court in\nJaleel P.P. vs. P.K. Muralikrishnan and\n\nothers\n[2014 (1) KHC 672] with regard to scope of 'PIL' in service\n\nmatter is not applicable to the case in hand. That apart, presently,\n\nthe individual grievance of the said petitioner is separately projected\n\nand is pending consideration. It is also pointed out that, unless and\n\nuntil a notification is issued by the Devaswom prescribing the\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 37 :\n\nqualification, age and such other requirements, it does not fit into the\n\nmouth of the Devaswom to contend that the petitioner is not\n\nqualified or over-aged and hence cannot file any case before this\n\nCourt for appointment and hence the writ petition will remain only as\n\n'PIL'. It is only because of the wrong exercise done by the\n\nDevaswom, that the 'opportunity to be considered for selection' is\n\ndenied to the petitioner; that too, after collecting the application fee\n\nfrom several applicants, including the petitioner, which is still retained\n\nat the hands of the Devaswom, who has made 'unlalwful enrichment'\n\nat the cost of the poor and hapless unemployed youth. The learned\n\ncounsel adds that no notification was ever issued after 2001 for filling\n\nup the regular vacancies and even in respect of temporary hands, only\n\nsparingly was it notified in newspapers having circulation in local\n\narea, that too without disclosing the necessary details or as to the\n\nchance to get regularised in the due course. This is not a proper\n\npublication at all and not liable to be acted upon.\n\n34. According to Mr. K.K. Mohammed Ravuf, the learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No. 29442 of 2012, the\n\npetitioner, who applied for the post of LDC had undergone all the\n\nregular steps for selection, though there was no written test, but for\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 38 :\n\ninterview. Such engagement was against the sanctioned posts and\n\nit is contended with reference to '\nRegulation 5\n', that though it was a\n\nregular selection, they were appointed only on temporary basis and\n\nhence the dictum in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra] will not apply. But\n\nin response to the query raised by this Court, the learned counsel\n\nconcedes that the notification inviting applications was never for any\n\nregular selection but for temporary engagement and that there was\n\nno indication that there was a chance to have their service\n\nregularised. As it stands so, the so called selection process stated as\n\nundergone by the petitioners in connection with the appointment as\n\n'temporary hand' in different capacities, is not liable to be termed or\n\naccepted as a regular process of selection, more so when no publicity\n\nwas there all over Kerala, notifying the posts in question and no\n\nopportunity was given to all eligible persons to participate in the\n\nprocess; besides the fact that persons were picked up merely on the\n\nbasis of an interview and that alone.\n\n35. With reference to the claim and status of the petitioners in\n\nW.P.(C) No.4628 of 2012 (Scheduled Caste candidate) and W.P.(C)\n\n21928 of 2012 (open candidate), it is stated that they had applied for\n\nthe posts of Malayalam Typist (temporary engagement). It is pointed\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 39 :\n\nout with reference to the materials procured and produced invoking\n\nthe provisions of\nRTI Act\nin the case of the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.\n\n21998 of 2012, that there was only 'one mistake' in the total 56\n\nwords typed; whereas in the case of the selected person, as revealed\n\nfrom Ext.P3(c), there were '12 mistakes' out of 56 words. Still, the\n\npetitioner was simply pushed down and an undeserving hand with\n\nlesser merit has been selected which reveals the mode of selection\n\npursued by the Managing Committee. Hence it is contended that the\n\nselected persons have to be replaced by appointing the petitioners,\n\nhaving more merit.\n\n36. This is sought to be answered by the learned Counsel for\n\nthe respondents 3 and 4 and also by the learned Standing Counsel for\n\nthe Devaswom, stating that, though there is no dispute with regard to\n\nthe factual position as to the Malayalam typing test, proficiency in\n\nEnglish was also considered, where the petitioners' position was found\n\nbelow the respondents 3 and 4. The learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners points out that, in respect of the post of Malayalam Typist,\n\nthe test could only be in Malayalam Typing and nowhere was any\n\nEnglish Typing test contemplated and hence there is absolutely no\n\nrationale in selecting the respondents 3 and 4, the less meritorious\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 40 :\n\ncandidates; based on any English Typing Test.\n\n37. With regard to the scope of the verdict passed by the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Apex Court in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited\n\nsupra], it is to be noted that the law stands declared in crystal clear\n\nterms holding that public appointment cannot be permitted to be\n\nmade contrary to the relevant provisions of law and without giving a\n\nchance to eligible hands to participate in the process of selection.\n\nRegularization of temporary hands engaged against the sanctioned\n\nposts [where appointment was not illegal but irregular] was ordered,\n\nsubject to satisfaction of 10 years of service as on that date, as a 'one\n\ntime measure', which was specifically ordered not to be repeated.\n\nHowever, an exception was sought to be drawn by a two member\n\nBench of the Supreme Court extending the benefits to workers who\n\nactually did not come within the purview of the observations made by\n\nthe Apex Court in\nUmadevi\n's case, as per the decision rendered in\n\nU.P. State Electricity Board Vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey\n\n[(2007) 11 SCC 92], virtually watering down the binding effect of\n\nthe\nUmadevi\n's case.\n\nThis came to be considered by a Larger\n\nBench of the Apex Court in Official Liquidator Vs. Dayanand and\n\nOthers [(2008) 10 SCC 1] where the course pursued by the 'two\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 41 :\n\nmember Bench' was deprecated and it was made clear that the\n\nobservations in the said verdict could only be considered as a 'obiter'\n\nand shall never have any binding value on the High Courts, Tribunal\n\nand other judicial fora, nor shall it be made the basis for bypassing the\n\nprinciples laid down in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra].\n\n38. The genesis of law in this regard was discussed by a '3\n\nmember Bench' of the Apex Court in Renu & Ors. Vs. District &\n\nSessions Judge, Tis Hazari and Anr. [2014 AIR SC 2175 =\n\n(2014) 14 SCC 40], where the issue was in relation to the\n\nrecruitment of staff in the High Court and Subordinate Court of Delhi.\n\nThe observations and directions given by the Apex Court as contained\n\nin paragraph 35 are relevant and hence reproduced below for\n\nconvenience of reference :\n\nIn view of the above, the appeal stands disposed of\n\nwith the following directions:\n\ni) All High Courts are requested to re-examine the statutory\n\nrules dealing with the appointment of staff in the High\n\nCourt as well as in the subordinate courts and in case any of\n\nthe rule is not in conformity and consonance with the\n\nprovisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, the\n\nsame may be modified.\n\nii) To fill up any vacancy for any post either in the High\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 42 :\n\nCourt or in courts subordinate to the High Court, in strict\n\ncompliance of the statutory rules so made. In case any\n\nappointment is made in contravention of the statutory rules,\n\nthe appointment would be void ab-initio irrespective of any\n\nclass of the post or the person occupying it.\n\niii) The post shall be filled up by issuing the advertisement\n\nin at least two newspapers and one of which must be in\n\nvernacular language having wide circulation in the respective\n\nState. In addition thereto, the names may be requisitioned\n\nfrom the local employment exchange and the vacancies may\n\nbe advertised byother modes also e.g. Employment News,\n\netc. Any vacancy filled up without advertising as prescribed\n\nhereinabove, shall be void ab-initio and would remain\n\nunenforceable and inexecutable except such appointments\n\nwhich are permissible to be filled up without advertisement,\n\ne.g., appointment on compassionate grounds as per the rules\n\napplicable. Before any appointment is made, the eligibility as\n\nwell as suitability of all candidates should be\n\nscreened/tested while adhering to the reservation policy\n\nadopted by the State, etc., if any.\n\niv) Each High Court may examine and decide within six\n\nmonths from today as to whether it is desirable to have\n\ncentralised selection of candidates for the courts\n\nsubordinate to the respective High Court and if it finds it\n\ndesirable, may formulate the rules to carry out that purpose\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 43 :\n\neither for the State or on Zonal or\n\nDivisional basis.\n\nv) The High Court concerned or the subordinate court as the\n\ncase may be, shall undertake the exercise of recruitment on\n\na regular basis at least once a year for existing vacancies or\n\nvacancies that are likely to occur within the said period, so\n\nthat the vacancies are filled up timely, and thereby avoiding\n\nany inconvenience or shortage of staff as it will also control\n\nthe menace of ad-hocism.\n\n39. It is relevant to note that the entire case law as on date was\n\ndiscussed by the Apex Court and much reliance was placed upon the\n\nverdict passed by the Constitution Bench in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited\n\nsupra]. The Apex Court also observed that, even with regard to the\n\npower entrusted with the Chief Justice under\nArticle 229 (1)\nof the\n\nConstitution of India, it was subject to\nArticle 16 (1)\n, which guarantees\n\nequality of opportunity for all citizens in the matters relating to\n\nemployment. The Apex Court also made it clear that, in making\n\nappointment or regulating other service conditions of staff of the High\n\nCourt, power exercised by the Chief Justice was an administrative\n\npower supported by the constitutional backing and as such, the\n\nrecruitment effected shall be transparent in all respects.\nReference\n\nwas also made to the verdict of the Apex Court in H.C. Puttaswamy\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 44 :\n\n& Ors. Vs. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court,\n\nBangalore & Prs. [AIR 1991 SC 295] dealing with similar situation\n\ninterpreting the scope of\nArticle 229 (2)\nof the Constitution of India\n\nand the position prevailing in the State of Karnataka, whereby it was\n\nheld that the appointment made by the Chief Justice of the High Court\n\nwithout advertising the vacancies was invalid, being violative of\n\nArticles 14\nand\n16 (1)\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n40. It will be worthwhile to make a reference to other decisions\n\nas well, which made the Apex Court to give the specific directions as\n\nextracted above. The Apex Court had occasion to consider the issue\n\nof 'back door entries' in public appointments in\nState of U.P. & Ors.\n\nVs. U.P. State Law Officers Association and Ors.\n[AIR 1994 SC\n\n1654], when it was observed that the method of appointment was not\n\ncalculated to ensure that the meritorious persons alone will always be\n\nappointed and that the appointment made will not be on any\n\nconsideration other than merit. According to the Apex Court, in the\n\nabsence of guidelines, appointment may be made on political or\n\npersonal consideration and be arbitrary, which led to the declaration\n\nthat those who came by the back door, have to go by the same door\n\nand that there need be no legal anxiety to save them.\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 45 :\n\n41. In the instant case, going by the contents of Exts. P3 and\n\nP5 resolutions taken by the Board and also as revealed from the\n\npleadings, in many cases, no proper notification was issued giving\n\nwide publication before the appointment of persons as temporary\n\nhands. In several instances, no manner of selection was indicated.\n\nIn some cases, publication was made only in the 'Notice Board of the\n\nDevaswom'; while in some other cases, it was given in some\n\ninconspicuous manner, in some local dailies. There is no case for the\n\nDevaswom that they had given wide publicity, inviting applications\n\nfrom all the eligible hands in the State or that it was made clear in the\n\nadvertisement that the persons selected [admittedly on the basis of\n\ninterview alone] will get chance to get regularised in the due course.\n\nThe importance of proper advertisement with sufficient publicity was\n\nconsidered by the Apex Court, pointing out the important requirement\n\nof public appointment to be with transparency and holding that the\n\nadvertisement must specify the number of posts available for\n\nselection/recruitment; qualification and eligibility criteria for such\n\nposts; schedule of recruitment process to be published, with certainty\n\nand clarity. It was also mentioned that the advertisement should\n\nspecify the rule under which selection is to be made. The manner of\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 46 :\n\ninviting applications by putting up notice on the Notice Board was\n\ndeprecated by the Apex Court in\nState of Orissa & Anr. Vs. Mamata\n\nMohanty\n[2011 (3) SCC 436], holding that vacancies must be in\n\nadvance disseminating the information in reasonable manner in public\n\ndomain ensuring maximum participation of all eligible candidates, thus\n\nensuring right of equal opportunity. The relevant portion of the\n\nobservation as contained in paragraph 36 is extracted below :\n\n\"36. Therefore, it is a settled legal proposition that\n\nno person can be appointed even on a temporary or ad hoc\n\nbasis without inviting applications from all eligible\n\ncandidates. If any appointment is made by merely inviting\n\nnames from the Employment Exchange or putting a note on\n\nthe Notice Board etc. that will not meet the requirement of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. Such a course\n\nviolates the mandates of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India as it deprives the candidates who are\n\neligible for the post, from being considered. A person\n\nemployed in violation of these provisions is not entitled to\n\nany relief including salary. For a valid and legal appointment\n\nmandatory compliance of the said Constitutional\n\nrequirement is to be fulfilled. The equality clause enshrined\n\nin\nArticle 16\nrequires that every such appointment be made\n\nby an open advertisement as to enable all eligible persons to\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 47 :\n\ncompete on merit.\"\n\n42. Various principles to be followed in the matter of public\n\nappointment have been codified by the Apex Court in M.P. State Co-\n\nop\nBank Ltd., Bhopal Vs. Nanuram Yadav & Ors.\n[(2007) 8 SCC\n\n264], as contained in paragraph 24, which is extracted below for\n\nconvenience of reference :\n\n24. It is clear that in the matter of public appointments,\n\nthe following principles are to be followed :\n\n1. The appointments made without following the\n\nappropriate procedure under the Rules/Government\n\nCirculars and without advertisement or inviting applications\n\nfrom the open market would amount to breach of Arts. 14\n\nand 16 of the Constitution of India.\n\n2. Regularisation cannot be a mode of appointment.\n\n3. An appointment made in violation of the mandatory\n\nprovisions of the statute and in particular, ignoring the\n\nminimum educational qualification and other essential\n\nqualification would be wholly illegal. Such illegality cannot\n\nbe cured by taking recourse to regularization.\n\n4. Those who come by back door should go through\n\nthat door.\n\n5. No regularization is permissible in exercise of the\n\nstatutory power conferred under\nArt. 162\nof the\n\nConstitution of India if the appointments have been made in\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 48 :\n\ncontravention of the statutory Rules.\n\n6. The Court should not exercise its jurisdiction on\n\nmisplaced sympathy.\n\n7. If the mischief played so widespread and all\n\npervasive, affecting the result, so as to make it difficult to\n\npick out the persons who have been unlawfully benefited or\n\nwrongfully deprived of their selection, it will neither be\n\npossible nor necessary to issue individual show -cause notice\n\nto each selectee. The only way out would be to cancel the\n\nwhole selection.\n\n8. When the entire selection is stinking, conceived in\n\nfraud and delivered in deceit, individual innocence has no\n\nplace and the entire selection has to be set aside.\n\n43. Deprecating the arbitrary process of appointment, the Apex\n\nCourt held in [2014 AIR SC 2175 = (2014) 14 SCC 40] [cited\n\nsupra] that if any such appointment is made, it can be challenged\n\nbefore a Court of law, explaining the scope of the writ of 'Quo\n\nWarranto'. The observation made by the Apex Court in paragraph 15\n\nis relevant, which is extracted below :\n\n15. Where any such appointments are made, they can\n\nbe challenged in the court of law. The quo warranto\n\nproceeding affords a judicial remedy by which any person,\n\nwho holds an independent substantive public office or\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 49 :\n\nfranchise or liberty, is called upon to show by what right he\n\nholds the said office, franchise or liberty, so that his title\n\nto it may be duly determined, and in case the finding is that\n\nthe holder of the office has no title, he would be ousted\n\nfrom that office by judicial order. In other words, the\n\nprocedure of quo warranto gives the Judiciary a weapon to\n\ncontrol the Executive from making appointment to public\n\noffice against law and to protect a citizen from being\n\ndeprived of public office to which he has a right. These\n\nproceedings also tend to protect the public from usurpers of\n\npublic office who might be allowed to continue either with\n\nthe connivance of the Executive or by reason of its apathy.\n\nIt will, thus, be seen that before a person can effectively\n\nclaim a writ of quo warranto, he has to satisfy the Court\n\nthat the office in question is a public office and is held by a\n\nusurper without legal authority, and that inevitably would\n\nlead to an enquiry as to whether the appointment of the\n\nalleged usurper has been made in accordance with law or not.\n\nFor issuance of writ of quo warranto, the Court has to\n\nsatisfy that the appointment is contrary to the statutory\n\nrules and the person holding the post has no right to hold it.\n\n(Vide: The University of Mysore and Anr. v. C.D. Govinda Rao\n\nand Anr., AIR 1965 SC 491; Shri Kumar Padma Prasad v.\n\nUnion of India and Ors., AIR 1992 SC 1213 : (1992 AIR SCW\n\n1093); B.R. Kapur v. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr., AIR 2001\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 50 :\n\nSC 3435 : (2001 AIR SCW 3720); The Mor Modern Co-\n\noperative\nTransport Society Ltd. v. Financial Commissioner\n\nand Secretary to Govt., Haryana and Anr.\n, AIR 2002 SC\n\n2513 : (2002 AIR SCW 2826);\nArun Singh v. State of Bihar\n\nand Ors.\n, AIR 2006 SC 1413 : (2006 AIR SCW 1306);\nHari\n\nBansh Lal v.

Dhobei Sahoo and Ors.\n, (2014) 1 SCC 161\n\n: (AIR 2004 SC 246 : 2013 AIR SCW 6339)).\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that when the very 'process of\n\nrecruitment' made contrary to the relevant provisions of law and\n\nbinding precedents is under challenge, it cannot be branded as a\n\nsimple 'service matter', or the party who attempts to set the law in\n\nmotion cannot be non-suited saying that he does not have any 'locus\n\nstandi' or with reference to the principle that no public interest\n\nlitigation can be entertained in service matter. The nature of\n\ngrievance projected herein stands on a clear footing, dealing with the\n\n'process of recruitment' and as such, the contentions raised by the\n\nlearned standing for the Devaswom and also other parties concerned,\n\nquestioning the maintainability of the writ petitions challenging the\n\n'process of recruitment' made by the Devaswom is only to be repelled.\n\nIt is ordered accordingly.\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 51 :\n\n44. The latest of the judgments governing the field of\n\nregularization as rendered by the Apex Court has been reported in\n\n(2017) 3 SCC 410 [State of Jammu and Kashmir and Others Vs.\n\nDistrict Bar Association, Bandipora].\nThe law evolved so far,\n\nparticularly, with reference to the mandate of the decision rendered by\n\nthe Constitution Bench in\nUmadevi\n's case and the principles\nlaid\n\ndown in\n\nRenu Vs. District and Sessions Judge\n[(2014) 14 SCC\n\n40 = 2014 AIR SC 2175] were reiterated and it was held that\n\nregularisation could not be ordered as a matter of course. It was a\n\ncase where daily-rated employees were engaged in connection with\n\nthe affairs of the judiciary, including construction of the court complex\n\nin the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The basic issue projected before\n\nthe High Court of Jammu and Kashmir in a 'Public Interest Litigation'\n\npreferred by the District Bar Association, Bandipora, was for a\n\ndirection to transfer land, which was stated as to have earmarked for\n\nthe construction of the District Court complex or to provide a suitable\n\nsite. During the course of hearing of the said Public Interest\n\nLitigation, it was brought to the notice of the Court that an application\n\nhad been filed by the daily-rated workers engaged in the High Court of\n\nSri Nagar, claiming regularization. An interim order was passed on\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 52 :\n\n07.10.2015, observing that the respondent State was duty bound to\n\nconsider the claim of the daily-rated employees as a 'one time\n\nexception' and regularize their service. The Secretary of the\n\nDepartment concerned was directed to file a status report about this\n\naspect before the next date of hearing. The special leave petition\n\nfiled by the State against the said order came to be dismissed by the\n\nApex Court. However, the Division Bench of the Jammu and Kashmir\n\nHigh Court issued a further direction, in which it was noted that the\n\nState Government had, over a period of time, failed to create the\n\nrequisite number of posts for the State judiciary and that in order to\n\nensure that the work of the Court was not hampered, arrangements\n\nwere to be made to engage persons on daily-wage rate. The High\n\nCourt further observed that the State Government was duty-bound to\n\ncreate an equal number of posts for the absorption of daily-rated\n\nemployees at the earliest. It was thereafter, that the matter was\n\nfinalized directing the State Government of Jammu and Kashmir to\n\nregularize the service of 280 daily rated workers, which came to be\n\nchallenged before the Apex Court.\n\nAfter referring to the law evolved\n\nby the Apex Court at different points of time and making a reference\n\nto\nUmadevi\n's Case and Renu's case, among such other cases as\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 53 :\n\nmentioned above, the principles were reiterated and it was held that\n\nthe High Court was not justified in directing the State to regularise the\n\nservice of the 209 daily rated employees as a one time measure,\n\nwithout properly considering the procedure, precedents, rules and\n\nregulations regarding regularization. The Bench also observed that\n\nsuch regularization, if at all justified [involving ireregular appointment\n\nand not illegal appointment] could be made, only if the employees\n\nconcerned had completed 10 years of service or more in a duly\n\nsanctioned post, without the benefit of protection of any interim order\n\nof any Court or Tribunal and further that, such engagement should not\n\nhave been illegal, though irregular. After stetting aside the verdict\n\npassed by the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir, the matter was\n\nremanded to the High Court for fresh consideration in the light of the\n\nobservations made and also in the light of the mandate laid down by\n\nthe Apex Court in Umadevi's case/Renu's case and such other\n\nbinding precedents. It will be worthwhile to go through paragraph 29\n\nof the verdict, which hence is extracted below :\n\n\"29. We have adverted to the above grievances in order to\n\nemphasise that there is substantial merit in the submission\n\nthat the High Court proceeded to issue directions for\n\nregularisation without considering either the legal position\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 54 :\n\nenunciated in the judgments of this Court referred to\n\nabove and without considering the prevailing rules and\n\nregulations on the subject. The High Court has observed\n\nin its order dated 1-12-2015 that over a considerable\n\nperiod of time the State Government has not created the\n\nrequired number of posts for the State judiciary as a\n\nresult of which work has been hampered. According to the\n\nHigh Court opined that these workers have been rendering\n\nwork which should have been assigned to persons appointed\n\non a regular basis against sanctioned posts. It is\n\nunfortunate, in our view, that the State Government has\n\nallowed the requirements of the State judiciary to be\n\nneglected over such a long period of time. The need to\n\nfacilitate the proper functioning of the High Court and the\n\ndistrict judiciary is a constitutional necessity which\n\nimposes a non-negotiable obligation on the State\n\nGovernment to create an adequate numbers of posts and to\n\nprovide sufficient infrastructure. The State Government\n\nis to blame for the unfortunate situation which has\n\nresulted in a large number of persons being recruited on a\n\ndaily-wage basis.\"\n\n45. From the above, it is quite clear that the course pursued by\n\nthe respondent Devaswom, attempting to regularise the service of\n\ntemporary employees, who came to be appointed without much\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 55 :\n\npublicity and without giving chance to all the interested/eligible parties\n\nto have participated in the process of selection, under the cover/guise\n\nof extension of benefits flowing from paragraph 53 of the Umadevi's\n\ncase, that too, by passing a resolution to grant regularization even\n\nin the case of persons, who were having only two years and even\n\nmuch less of service cannot but be deprecated in the strongest\n\npossible words. We are of the view that the resolution taken by the\n\nBoard is not having the support/foundation on the law declared by the\n\nApex Court [which is the law of land and applicable to all, by virtue of\n\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution of India].\n\n46. As observed by the Apex Court in paragraph 29 of the Apex\n\nCourt in (2017) 3 SCC 410 (cited supra), it is only the Devaswom,\n\nwho is to be blamed for not effecting appointments of persons on\n\n'regular basis' to meet the requirement; but for repeatedly effecting\n\ntemporary recruitments without much publicity and subsequent\n\nregularization, giving benefit only to a limited few; thus compromising\n\nwith the merit and suitability, denying entry to a large sector of\n\npersons, who otherwise may be eligible and would have participated in\n\nthe process of selection, had there been proper publicity, also\n\nmentioning that the recruitment process would be for 'regular posts' or\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 56 :\n\nat least mentioning that there was a chance for being regularized; if\n\nall other requirements of selection were satisfied. In the said\n\ncircumstances, the Devaswom is directed to identify the vacancies to\n\nbe filled up on a permanent basis as above, and all the vacancies shall\n\nbe reported for filling up on a regular basis in accordance with the\n\nrelevant Rules, by reporting the same to the Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard, which has already been brought into existence.\n\nMerit of each case is separately dealt with in the above\n\nbackground.\n\n47. W.A. No. 481 of 2016\n\nThis appeal is filed against dismissal of the O.P. seeking for a\n\ndirection to complete the selection process initiated as per Exts.P1 and\n\nP2 dated 27.10.2000 and 16.10.2001 respectively. The ground for\n\ndismissal is that, it was in respect of a stale cause of action. The\n\nversion of the appellants/petitioners was that, they became aggrieved\n\nonly by Ext. P4, when a decision was taken to regularize certain other\n\npersons in the year 2010. We find that the said explanation is not\n\npalatable and hence it was rightly rejected by the learned single Judge\n\nand no interference is warranted. Appeal fails and it is dismissed\n\naccordingly. However, we make it clear that, we do not endorse the\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 57 :\n\nproceedings of the Devaswom to regularize the service of the\n\ntemporary hands as per Ext. P4 [which has already been dealt with in\n\nthe preceding paragraphs] resolution No. 69 dated 25.11.2010 of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Management Committee.\n\n48. W.P.(C) No. 4070 of 2015\n\nChallenge is against Resolution No. 299 dated 25.08.2014 of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Management Committee for causing\n\nregularization of the workers engaged on temporary basis. There is\n\nalso a prayer to direct the respondent Devaswom to notify the\n\nvacancies existing in all categories and conduct fresh selection, giving\n\nopportunity to all the candidates. In view of the reasons already\n\ngiven, we hold that Ext. P14 resolution is not correct or sustainable,\n\nwhich stands set aside. The Writ Petition stands allowed. We also\n\nfind it appropriate to direct the Devaswom to conduct fresh selection\n\nafter identifying the regular posts as made clear already.\n\n49. W.P.(C) No. 4628 of 2012\n\nThe prayer is to intercept the fresh notification/selection to the\n\npost of Typist as per Ext. P2 and also to set aside Ext.P3 (d)\n\nDevaswom rank list, simultaneously seeking to regularise the service\n\nof the petitioners. In so far as this Court has already held that the\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 58 :\n\ndecision taken by the 'GDMC' to regularise service of the temporary\n\nhands is bad in all respects; the relief of regularization is not liable to\n\nbe given to the petitioner. However, it will be for the Devaswom to\n\nconduct fresh selection against the regular posts as made clear\n\nalready. The Writ Petition is disposed of.\n\n50. W.P.(C) No. 4798 of 2015\n\nThe petitioners, who are stated as working as temporary hands\n\nin the Devaswom from 2008 to 2012 approached this Court seeking\n\nfor a direction to include them as well for regularization of service in\n\nterms of Ext. P3 resolution No. 299 dated 25.08.2014. We have\n\nalready held that the said resolution taken by the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Management Committee is not correct or sustainable.\n\nRegularization sought for is not liable to be granted. Writ Petition fails\n\nand the same is dismissed accordingly.\n\n51.

P1 order passed by the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee permitting them to continue in service\n\nwith intent to have their service regularised.\n\nWe have already held that regularisation ordered by the Apex\n\nCourt granting benefit of Paragraph 53 in\nUmadevi\n's case is only in\n\nrespect of the persons having completed 10 years of service as on that\n\nday, that too, as a one time measure. As it stands so, there is\n\nabsolutely no merit or bonafides in the resolution taken by the Board\n\nto regularise the temporary employees having just 'two years' service,\n\nwhich is contrary to the law\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court. In the said\n\ncircumstances, the claim is repelled and the above Writ Petitions stand\n\ndismissed accordingly.\n\n52. W.P.(C) No. 9085 of 2015\n\nThe prayer in the Writ Petition is to quash Ext. P3 resolution No.\n\n299 dated 25.08.2014 and the attempt to regularise temporary\n\nemployees on the strength of the said resolution, simultaneously\n\ncausing vacancies to be notified for conducting fresh selection in\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 68 :\n\naccordance with law. We have already found that Ext. P3 resolution\n\nis not correct or sustainable being contrary to the law declared by the\n\nSupreme Court and accordingly, we have set aside the same. We\n\nhave also directed the Devaswom to report substantive\n\nvacancies/regular vacancies for fresh selection in accordance with law.\n\nAs such no separate order is required to be passed. Writ Petition\n\nstands allowed to the said extent.\n\n53. W.P.(C) No. 14871 of 2012\n\nPrayer is to permit the petitioner to continue in service as\n\ntemporary hand till regular hand reports for duty and not to replace\n\nthe existing temporary employees by another set of temporary\n\nemployees. We have already declared the legal position and the\n\nfurther course of action to be pursued; pointing out the necessity to\n\nidentify and fill up the regular vacancies/all substantive vacancies,\n\nafter proper notification with wide publicity, enabling all eligible hands\n\nto participate in the process selection. No other order is required to\n\nbe passed in the instant case. It is disposed of accordingly.\n\n54. W.P.(C) No. 15060 of 2012\n\nThe main challenge is against Exts. P13 and P18 in so far as\n\nthey relate to appointment of 'Ayahs' in the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 69 :\n\nEnglish Medium School and to appoint the petitioners against the posts\n\nin question and also to regularize their service. Regularization of\n\ntemporary hands is not possible in view of the finding already\n\nrendered by this Court. The regular vacancies/substantive vacancies\n\nhave to be notified with wide publicity and they are to be filled up in\n\naccordance with the law. The appointment of the respondents 6 and\n\n7 stands set aside and the vacancies resulted shall be filled up by the\n\npetitioners herein, if any temporary engagement is necessary as a\n\nstop-gap arrangement, till the vacancies are filled up by the regular\n\nhands. Writ Petition is allowed in part; to the said extent.\n\n55. W.P.(C) No. 21998 of 2012\n\nThe Writ Petitioner challenges Exts. P2 and P3 notifications for\n\nthe post of typist on temporary/contract basis. There is a prayer for\n\nregularization of service of the petitioners as well; besides a\n\ncontention that his service as temporary hand shall not be replaced by\n\nanother temporary hand.\nIn view of the declaration already made by\n\nthis Court, with reference to the law declared by the Constitutional\n\nBench of the Apex Court in\nUmadevi\n's case [cited supra], this Court\n\nfinds that there is absolutely no merit in the grounds raised and the\n\nrelief sought for. Interference is declined. The Writ Petition is\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 70 :\n\ndismissed accordingly.\n\n56. W.P.(C) No. 32574 of 2014\n\nThe petitioner [in this 'lead case'] has approached this Court\n\nseeking to quash Ext.P3 resolution No. 299 dated 25.08.2014 and to\n\ndeclare that attempt on the part of the respondents to regularize the\n\ntemporary employees now working under different categories of the\n\nDevaswom is arbitrary. There is also a further prayer to set aside\n\nExt. P5 Resolution bearing No. 60 dated 15.05.2015. Another prayer\n\nis there, whereby the petitioner has sought to issue Writ of Mandamus\n\ndirecting the respondents 1 and 2 to notify the vacancies existing in all\n\ncategories of posts under the Guruvayoor Devaswom and to conduct a\n\nfresh selection process by giving opportunity to all eligible candidates\n\nand fill up the vacancies accordingly. As per the discussions already\n\nmade, we have held that Exts. P3 and P5 are not liable to be\n\nsustained, being arbitrary and illegal in all respects. Accordingly, we\n\nset aside Exts. P3 and P5, which cannot be applied or made the basis\n\nfor regularizing the service of anybody under the Devaswom. We\n\nhave also held all regular/substantive vacancies shall be identified and\n\nreported to the competent authority to conduct selection on the basis\n\nof the relevant rules and in accordance with law. In the said\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 71 :\n\ncircumstances, we grant the relief at 'prayer No. 3' as well.\n\nAccordingly, this writ petition stands allowed. However, cost will be\n\nborne by the parties.\n\n57. Before parting with the case, it has to be noted that serious\n\ndispute has raised from the part of the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee as to the field of recruitment to be left within the\n\npurview of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board, who has been\n\nimpleaded as the additional 5th respondent in W.P. (C) No. 30801 of\n\n2016 [as per order dated 21..03.2017 in I.A. No. 4875 of 2017]. It is\n\nstated by the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee in their\n\ncounter affidavit that the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board was\n\nbrought in existence as per the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board\n\nAct, which was brought into force on 01.03.2014, and the Board, in\n\nfact, was constituted only much later on '14.08.2015'. This being the\n\nposition, it is stated that the Recruitment Board cannot have any say\n\nwith regard to the steps for regularization of temporary hands sought\n\nto be pursued by the Managing Committee 'prior to 14.08.2015' and\n\nas such, the resolutions taken by the Guruvayoor Devawom Managing\n\nCommittee in respect of Service of the temporary hands prior to\n\n14.08.2015 have to be given effect to. It is however stated in\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 72 :\n\nparagraph 10 of the said affidavit dated 01.04.2017, that the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom would report the vacancies that arose after\n\n01.04.2015 and that the Board can start the selection process\n\naccordingly. It is also pointed that the Guruvayoor Devaswom was\n\nnot a party in DBP 79 of 2014 or DBP 60 of 2015, whereby direction\n\nwas given by this Court to fill up the vacancies on war footing, through\n\nthe Devaswom Recruitment Board, as per the order dated 06.07.2015.\n\n58. The version of the additional respondent/Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board, as projected in their statement dated 27.03.2017\n\nis that the Guruvayoor Devaswom Management Committee had\n\nentrusted the selection and appointment to the posts, except\n\nMelsanthi, Sopanam Kaval, Kshethram Koyma, Security Officer, to the\n\nKerala Public Service Commissioner as per Annexure R5(a) decision\n\ndated 10.02.2014. But they have not conducted any regular process\n\nof selection, but for effecting temporary appointments without proper\n\nnotification and publicity and without following proper selection\n\nprocess to different categories of posts, followed by subsequent\n\nregularization. It is also pointed out that regularization of temporary\n\nhands as a one time measure pursuant to the dictum in Umadevi's\n\ncase [cited supra] was effected by the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 73 :\n\nManagement Committee as per the resolution dated '25.11.2010' in\n\nrespect of service of temporary employees having completed 10 years\n\nas on 25.11.2010, as a 'one time measure' and that the same was\n\nimplemented as per Annexure R5(b) order passed by the\n\nAdministrator. Despite the fact that it was to be done as a 'one time\n\nmeasure', similar exercises were being pursued by the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom, causing regularization of temporary hands as and when\n\nthe temporary hands completed 10 years of service as evident from\n\nAnnexure R5(c) decision dated 02.07.2012. Similar exercise in\n\nrespect of appointment of Scanvangers was pursued as per Annexure\n\nR5 (e) decision dated 14.06.2013. The Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging committee proceeded with further steps for regularization of\n\ntemporary hands on several other dates as well, as evident from\n\nAnnexure R5(f) order dated 11.06.2014 issued by the Administrator.\n\nThis was followed by the subsequent decision for effecting such\n\nregularization of all the temporary employees stating some lame\n\nexcuse as borne by Annexure R5 (h) decision dated 25.08.2014 of the\n\nManaging Committee and Annexure R5(i) decision dated 02.08.2014\n\nof the very same Committee. The further steps taken by the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee to regularize various\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 74 :\n\ntemporary hands is discernible from Annexure R5(j) dated 15.05.2015\n\nas well.\n\n59. Admittedly, regularization is not a mode of appointment\n\nand such practice has been deprecated by the Apex Court on many an\n\nan occasion. In so far as the field of recruitment is governed by\n\nstatutory rules, no such regularization is permissible or possible in\n\ncontravention of the Rules framed under\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. Section 9 (1) of the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act 2015 [produced as Annexue R5 (g) in W.P.(C)\n\nNo. 30801 of 2016] reads as follows :\n\n\"9. Functions of the Board : (1) The Board shall have\n\nthe following functions, namely:-\n\n(i) notwithstanding anything contained in any other\n\nexisting Act or Rules or Regulations or orders or judgment\n\nor decree in respect of the appointment of candidates to\n\nthe posts in Devaswom Board, the Board shall prepare\n\nselect list for the appointment of candidates to various\n\nposts other than the hereditary posts and posts in the\n\naided educational institutions in the Devaswom Boards as\n\nper the provisions of this Act, Rules and Regulations;\n\n(ii) to invite applications, to conduct written\n\nexamination or interview or written examination and\n\ninterview and to prepare select list for selection to the\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 75 :\n\nvarious posts other than the hereditary posts under the\n\nDevaswom Board, as may be prescribed, as and when the\n\nrequisition for such examination is received from the\n\nconcerned Devaswom Board.\n\n(iii) to make all required arrangements in connection\n\nwith the examination including the preparation of question\n\npapers, supervision of examinations and valuation, conduct\n\nof interview and preparation of the select list;\n\n(iv) to conduct any other examination relating to\n\nDevaswom Board as entrusted by the Government;\n\n(v) to call for and obtain details regarding the\n\nexamination from the concerned Devaswom Board.\n\n(2) The Board shall be responsible for the proper\n\nconduct of the examination, to maintain the secrecy in the\n\npreparation of question paper, valuation, preparation of the\n\nlist of candidates to be interviewed and preparation of the\n\nfinal select list to be furnished to the Devaswom Board and\n\nother connected matters and for the safe custody of the\n\nrecords pertaining to the examinations.\n\n(3) (i) The Board shall conduct written examination\n\nto the candidate who had submitted applications and\n\nprepare lists, after conducting interview or written\n\nexamination and interview;\n\n(ii) Examination may be conducted for any Devaswom\n\nBoard or for all the Devaswom Boards in suitable manner\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 76 :\n\nfor the said purpose.\n\n(iii) An applicant, who applies for more than one post\n\nor to more than one Devaswom Boards, shall not be denied\n\nthe right to appear in more than one examination.\n\nProvided that, if the candidate applies for\n\nexaminations to various posts being conducted by the\n\nBoard and in the circumstance of conducting examinations\n\nto more than one post by the Board on the same day the\n\nright referred in 3 (iii) shall not be available to such\n\ncandidate.\n\n(4) The procedure to be followed by the Board, in\n\nrespect of the invitation of applications, conduct of written\n\nexamination, preparation of list of candidates to be\n\ninterviewed, conduct of interview and preparation of the\n\nselect list to various posts in the Devaswom Board, shall be\n\nsuch as may be prescribed.\n\n(5) The Board may issue general directions to the\n\nDevaswom Boards incidental to the functions of the Board\n\nand as are necessary for the conduct of the examinations.\n\n(6) It shall be the duty of the Board to furnish the\n\nselect list to the Devaswom Board and advise to the\n\ncandidates prepared in the manner as may be prescribed.\"\n\n60. From the above, it is quite clear that there is a 'non-\n\nobstante clause' in the said provision and as such, whatever may be\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 77 :\n\nthe contents of the\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act\nor\nGuruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Employees Recruitment Act\nof Regulations; after\n\ncommencement of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act 2015,\n\nrecruitment to various Devaswoms in Kerala can be effected only\n\nthrough the machinery under the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Act\n\n2015. This is more so, since the Guruvayoor Devaswom is also one\n\nof the Devaswoms, who comes under Section 2 (b) of the the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act 2015, which defines the term\n\n'Devaswom'. That apart, as per\nSection 9 (6)\nof the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Board Recruitment Act, it shall be the duty of the\n\nRecruitment Board to furnish select list to the Devaswom Board and\n\nadvise candidates prepared from the list in the manner as may be\n\nprescribed. In the above circumstances, this Court finds that the\n\nregular recruitment has to be made by the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board and no exception can be drawn by the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom.\n\n61. As mentioned already, the only possible instance of\n\nregularization pursuant to the verdict rendered by the Umadevi's\n\ncase [cited supra] could have been the regularization of the service of\n\nthe persons having completed '10 years', as a one time measure,\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 78 :\n\nwhich has been effected by the Devaswom as per the resolution dated\n\n25.11.2010. Having effected that, it was not open for the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Management Committee to have pursued\n\nfurther regularization of temporary hands as and when they\n\ncompleted 10 years of service and such persons who have been\n\nregularized in service after the decision taken on 25.11.2010. Since\n\nsuch persons, who have completed 10 years of service after\n\n25.11.2010 are not in the party array and their regularization is not\n\nunder challenge; this Court does not intend to mention anything\n\nfurther in this regard, but for declaring that no further regularization\n\nexercise shall be done in respect of any temporary hands, without\n\ncausing all the regular vacancies/substantive vacancies to be notified\n\nto the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board to conduct selection and\n\nadvise candidates based on the qualification stipulated to the posts in\n\nquestion.\n\n62. At the same time, it has to be noted that, because of the\n\nillegal exercise that was being pursued by the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee by engaging temporary hands and continuing\n\nthem for quite long without resorting to regular recruitment, the\n\npersons who came to be appointed so might have crossed the upper\n\nW.A. No. 481 of 2016 and\nconnected cases\n\n: 79 :\n\nage limit. In the said circumstances, while notifying the posts for\n\nregular appointment, it is possible for the Guruvayoor Devaswom to\n\nprovide for 'age relaxation' to such extent the above temporary hands\n\nhave been working under the Guruvayoor Devaswom Management\n\nCommittee and also provide some weightage for the service already\n\nrendered by them, for example; 'one mark' for 'one year' of\n\ncompleted service, subject to a maximum of 10 marks and to assess\n\nthe eligibility and suitability accordingly, along with such other\n\nrequirements and subject to satisfaction of the other\n\nqualifications/requirements.\n\nSd/-\n\nP.
