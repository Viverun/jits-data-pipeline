Special leave was\ngranted to the appellant by this Court on the limited ques-\ntion whether the correct principles on which gratuity should\nbe payable had been followed in this case or not. Since the\nmaking of the award, the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nwas\npassed, which, by\ns. 4(5)\ngave an option to the workers to\nchoose between the gratuity scheme under the award and the\none under the statute. The workers, however, did not put in\ntheir appearance in this Court.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that the\nqualifying period of service for earning gratuity was ten\nyears and for calculating the amount of gratuity basic\nwages without adding dearness allowance should be the basis\nas laid down by some decisions of this Court and the tribu-\nnal was wrong in holding 5 years as the qualifying service\nand basic wages and dearness allowance as the basis for\ncalculating the amount of gratuity.\nHELD: There is nothing fundamentally flawsome in the 5-\nyear period being fixed as the qualifying service. The\nTribunal was realistic in fixing the period of eligible\nqualifying service as continUoUs service counted with refer-\nence to the completed years as defined in\ns. 2(c)\nof the\nAct. [100 C&F]\n(1) In some cases, this Court highlighted the view that\nthe determination of gratuity is not based on any definite\nrules and each case must depend upon the prosperity of the\nconcern, the needs of the workmen and the prevailing econom-\nic conditions examined in the light of the auxiliary bene-\nfits which the workmen may get on determination of employ-\nment. It was also held that stability of the concern,\nprofits made 'in the past, the future prospects and capacity\nshould be the relevant circumstances which the Tribunal\nshould take into account in giving its award. Awards\nare' given on circumstances peculiar to each dispute and the\nTribunals are, to a large extent, free from the restrictions\nof technical considerations imposed on courts. In short,\nthe approach of the Tribunal should be what may be de-\nscribed as its legal hunch or horse-sense. Cases like\nGaziabad Engineering Co. accept the position that. while\ngratuity is usually related to the basic wage, a departure\nmay be made by relating it to the consolidated wage if there\nbe some strong evidence or exceptional circumstances\njustifying that course. The real reason why some cases\nlike British Paints required a qualifying period of 10\nyears was that a longer minimum period for earning gratuity\nin the case of voluntary retirement or resignation would\nensure that workmen did not leave one concern for another\nafter putting in the short minimum service qualifying for\ngratuity. But current conditions must control the Tribu-\nnal's conscience in finalizing the terms of the gratuity\nscheme. Colossal unemployment at all levels of workers in\nthe country today means that a worker will not leave his\nemployment merely because he has qualified himself for\ngratuity In an economic situation where there is a glut of\nlabour in the market and unemployment stares the working\nclass in the face it is theoretical to contend that employ-\nees will hop from industry to industry unless the qualifying\nperiod for earning gratuity is raised to 10 years. [98 H;\n99D; lOO A, D, E, F.]\n(2) Wages will mean and include basic wages and dearness\nallowance and nothing else. This corresponds to\ns. 2(s)\nof\nthe Act. Some of the decisions refer to basic wages and\nothers to consolidated wages as the foundation for\ncomputation of gratuity. These are matters of discretion\nand the \"feel\" of the circumstances prevalent in the indus-\ntry by the Tribunal and, unless it has gone wrong in the\nexercise of its discretion the award should stand.\nIn the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nalso it is not basic wages but gross\nwages inclusive of dearness allowance which had been taken\nas the basis.

No. 20/58\n'published in the U.P. Gazette dated the 10th Jan. 1970).\nI. N. Shroff, for the appellant.\n\nP.H. Parekh, for the respondent.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by.\nKRISHNA IYER, J.--A dispute between the appellant mill\n(the Strawboard Manufacturing Company Ltd) and its workmen,\nregarding a scheme of gratuity, was referred to the Indus-\ntrial Tribunal, way back in February 1958, and, long 19\nyears later, this Court is pronouncing on the validity of\nthe award made by the Tribunal in favour of the workmen:\n\nSmall wonder the respondent workmen, after this tiring and\ntraumatic tantalization, have not turned up to argue their\ncause, although Shri Parekh, as amicus curiae, has filled\nthe gap. Such an unhappy and not infrequent phenomenon as\nconsiderable delay in adjudication and implementation is\ndestructive of industrial peace and productive of disen-\nchantment with labour jurisprudence. Naturally, even consti-\ntutional provisions and governmental decisions about labour\nand concern for its welfare cease to achieve the desired\ngoals when the legal process limps and lingers and rights\nturn illusory' when remedies prove elusive. The life of\nrights is remedies and a jurisprudence of ready reliefs\nalone can inhibit the weaker numbers of our land asking\nthe disturbing question: 'Is Law Dead ?'. Dicey wrote long\nago:\n\n\"The saw ubi jus ibi remedium, becomes\nfrom this point of view something much more\nimportant than a mere tautological proposi-\ntion. In its bearing upon constitutional law,\nit means that the Englishmen whose labors\ngradually formed the complicated set of laws\nand institutions which we call the Constitu-\ntion, fixed their minds far more intently on\nproviding remedies for the enforcement of\nparticular rights or for averting definite\nwrongs, than upon any declarations of the\nRights of Man or Englishmen.\"\n\n(Jurisprudence of Remedies: University of Pennsylvania\nLaw Review, Vol. 117, Nov. 1968. p.l, 16).\n\nIt is more than rhetoric to say that courts belong to the\npeople.\n'Judges occupy the public's bench of justice. They\nimplement the public's sense of justice'. If the Courts are\nthe fulcrum of the justice-system, there is a strong case\nfor the reform of Court methodology and bestowal of atten-\ntion on efficient management of judicial administration.\nOtherwise, the courts may be so overloaded or so mismanaged\nthat they grind to a halt and citizens' exercise of their\nrights discouraged or frustrated. The vital aspects of\nthe jurisprudence of remedies include speeding the pace o[\nlitigation 'from the cradle to the grave'. We are reluc-\ntant to make these self-critical observation's about putting\nour house in order, but when the consumers of justice like\nworkmen lose interest in the judicial process and are ab-\nsent, legislative unawareness of research and development as\nto the needs of courts and simplification and acceleration\nof the judicative apparatus become matters of national\nconcern. Law's delays are in some measure, caused by legis-\nlative inaction in ,making competent, radical change in the\nprocedural laws and sufficient financing and modernising of\nthe justice system as a high priority programme.\nThe chequered career of this lis and its zigzag climb up\nthe precipice of justice contextually deserves brief narra-\ntion. The order of reference was made early in 1958, the\nusual processual exercise before the Tribunal resulted in an\naward on May 1, 1958 where the tribunal refused the relief\nbearing on gratuity. The disappointed workers challenged\nthe award before the High Court which set it aside in Novem-\nber 1963--too long a hibernation in the High Court for a\nlabour dispute where prompt adjudication is the essence of\nindustrial peace. Anyway, when the case came back to the\ntribunal, its decision took another six inscrutable years\nand, on October 31, 1969 a fresh award was made whereunder\nthe tribunal framed a gratuity scheme and gave the guide-\nlines thereof. This time the appellant mill straight came\nto the Supreme Court with the present appeal for which\nspecial leave was granted in a limited way, in the sense\nthat it was confined to the question 'whether the correct\nprinciples on which' gratuity should be payable have been\nfollowed in this case or not. It is a fact, though unfortu-\nnate, that this labour litigation arrived in this Court in\n1970 but its final chapter is being written by this judgment\nonly in 1977. And it is noteworthy that the facts are\nbrief, the legal issues small, the arguments brief and this\njudgment, but for general observations and traditional\nreference to rulings cited at the bar, could have been\njudiciously abbreviated.\n\nThe main battle at the bar has been over the correct\nprinciples in a scheme of gratuity for factory workers and\nfurther whether those principles have been departed from\nunder the award assailed by the appellant. We may mention.\nat this stage, that the Parliament has enacted the\nPayment\nof Gratuity Act, 1972\n, which has come into force with effect\nfrom September 16, 1972.\nSection 4(5)\nof -the said Act\ngives an option to the workers to choose between the gratui-\nty scheme under the award and the one under the statute.\nHad the workers been represented before this Court it might\nhave been possible for us finally to close this controversy\nor even produce a reasonable solution by discussion and\nnegotiation and persuade them to opt for\none or the other scheme. Early finality, credible certainty\nand mutually assented solutions, are the finer processes of\nconflict-resolution-a pursuit which baffles us here because\nof labour's absence. All that we can do, therefore, is to\nadjudicate upon the correctness or otherwise of the princi-\nples which have gone into the gratuity scheme prepared by\nthe tribunal in the light of the rulings of this Court and\nthe canons of industrial law.\n\nWe now proceed to itemise the grounds of attack levelled\nby Shri I.N. Shroff for the appellant .and assay their worth\nin the light of the submissions in defence of the award made\nby Shri P.H. Parekh appearing as amicus curiae. Even here\nwe may place on record our appreciation of Shri Parekh's\nservices to the Court and the fairness of Shri Shroff in\nmaking his points on behalf of the appelant.\nThe only dispute, which has ramified into a few issues,\nrelates to the gratuity scheme the tribunal has framed.\nShri Parekh is right in drawing our attention in limine to\nthe financial. insignificance, for the appellant, of the\nsubject matter of this lis and the consequential disinclina-\ntion we must display to disturb the award. He has urged\nthat the total annual impact on the industry by the imple-\nmentation of the award is of ,the order of Rs. 3,000/- to a\nsubstantial part of which the management has no objection.\nWhat is more, the appellant is prosperous enough to distrib-\nute dividends around 20% over the years. Further, since\n1972 an obligatory statutory gratuity scheme has come into\nforce with the result that the economic consequences of this\nlitigation, even if the appellant loses are marginal or\nnil. This makes us ponder whether, in matters of less than\ngrave moment, this court should, as part of high judicial\npolicy to arrest the tidal flow of unsubstantial litigation,\nturn away at the portals those who invoke our jurisdiction\nto examine every case where some legal principle has been\nwrongly decided, regardless of a sense of 'summit court'\nperspective and the rare use of its reserve power so as\nto preempt a docket explosion and the injustice of delayed\njustice and invest the High Courts and high tribunals with\nfinal legal wisdom. The amplitude of\nArt. 136\nis ,meant more\nfor exceptional situations than to serve as hospitable\nbasket to receive all challenges to seemingly erroneous\njudgments in the country.\n\nAs stated earlier, we are confronted by an industrial\ndispute and are called upon .to apply the principles of\nindustrial jurisprudence with its primary concern for peace\namong the parties, contentment of the worker's, the end\nproduct being increased production informed by distributive\njustice. Law, especially Labour Law, is the art of economic\norder sustained by social justice. It aims at pragmatic\nsuccess, but is guided by value-realities. It believes in\nrelativity and rejects absolutes. The recent constitutional\namendment (\nArt. 43A\n) which emphasizes the workers' role in\nproduction as partners in the process, read in the light of\nthe earlier accent on workers' rights and social justice,\ngives a new status and sensitivity to industrial jurispru-\ndence in our 'socialist republic'. This social philosophy\nmust inform interpretation and adjudication, a caveat needed\nbecause precedents become time-barred when societal ethos\nprogresses. We\nare not called upon to interpret an Act since, in this area\nof law, the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\ncame in on a later date.\nJudge-made law rules the roost. Even so, are we fattered by\ninflexible norms halLowed by dated decisions ? Not in this\njurisdiction. 'The golden rule' in a rapidly changing\nsystem, 'is that there are no golden rules'. We should be\nguided by realistic judicial responses to societal problems,\nagainst the back drop of the new, radical values implied in\n'social justice' to labour, the production backbone of the\nnation, adjusted to the environs of the particular industry\nand its economics and kindered circumstances. The dynamics\nof labour law, rather than the bonded of old-time case-law\nanswers questions of current justice. Cardozo had cautioned\nin his 'The Nature of the Judicial Process':\n\n\"That court best serves the law which\nrecognizes that the rules of law which grew up\non a remote generation may, in the fullness of\nexperience, by found to serve another genera-\ntion badly, and which discards the old rule\nwhen it finds that another rule of law repre-\nsents what should be according to the estab-\nlished and settled judgment of society, and no\nconsiderable property rights have become\nvested in reliance upon the old rule. It is\nthus great writers upon the common law have\ndiscovered the source and method of its\ngrowth, and in its growth found its health\nand life. It is not and i, should not be\nstationary. Change of this character should\nnot be left to the legislature. If judges\nhave woefully misinterpreted the mores of\ntheir day, or if the mores of their day are no\nlonger those of ours, they ought not to tie,\nin helpless submission, the hands of their\nsuccessors.\"\n\n(Cardozo: The Nature of the Judicial Process: Yale\nUniversity Press pp. 151-152).\n\nIndeed, we are stating no new proposition since the profu-\nsion of decisions assiduously presented before us states,\nin sum, that each case has to be decided; on the updated\njustice of the fact-situations therein and the only law that\nwe can reasonably discern from the rUlings we have read is\nthat there is no law but only justice, dependent on a varie-\nty of socio-economic variables, that the tribunal's award,\nif his performance is not perverse in the process or the end\nproduct. must be left well alone by this Court even. if some\njuristic failing or factual peccadillo can be discovered. A\nquest for error and an inclination for correction, frequent-\nly exercised by higher Courts will do double injury. It\nwill take away the necessary initiative of the tribunal to\nproduce satisfactory results. It will delay the finality of\nindustrial adjudication and thereby defeat the paramount\npurpose of early re-adjustment. Judicial decentralization\nclaims its price and it must be paid by ignoring errors less\nthan grave. Once this perspective is clear, our non-inter-\nference with this award is just. Moreover, an industrial\ntribunal must act on a legal horse sense, rather than on\njuristic abstractions, on rugged fairness rather than on\nrefined legalisms. It is shop-floor justice. not five-star\nloveliness. The weaker qualify for protective order, in the\nover-all view of the matter.\nGratuity for workers is no longer a gift but a right.\nIt is a vague, humanitarian expression of distributive\njustice to partners in production for long, meritorious\nservice. We have, therefore, adopt a broad and generous\napproach to the problems posed before us by Shri Shroff\nwithout being mechanistically precedent-bound or finically\nlooked into evidence.\n\nSpeaking generally, Shri Shroff focussed his fire-power\nfirstly-on the qualifying period of five years for earning\ngratuity as against ten years sanctified in some earlier\nrulings and, secondly, on the basic wage, as contrasted with\nthe 'consolidated' wage being treated as the base for the\ncomputation of gratuity. He did cite half-a-dozen of more\ncases of this court in support which, on closer scrutiny\nand studied in the light of other citations Shri Parekh\nemphasized, stand neutralized.\n\nThe Tribunal has itself referred to many rulings of this\nCourt, noted the features of the industry in question, the\nhigh dividends and 'the low wages and reached a via media\nwhich we may regard as a prudent judicial resolution of the\nsimple conflict. The flavour of the social milleu, the raw\nrealities of industrial conditions and the locale and life-\nstyle out there, are sensed by the tribunal better than a\ndistant court of last resort primarily specialising in\ndeclaration of law. So we are loathe to upset the scheme\nunless the tribunal is grievously or egregiously in error.\nShri Shroff staked his case on case-law alone and culled\npassages which upheld basic wages as basic and ten-year\nservice for eligibility. Even here, we must mention that the\nbasic wage at the relevant time (revised subsequently) was\nin the miserable range of Rs. 20/- per mensem and to calcu-\nlate gratuity on this pitiful rate, when after 'long. and\nmeritorious service' the worker bids farewell to his labour\nlife in the industry, is to be callous to basic justice.\nThe Human Today cannot be held captive by the\nless-than-human yesterday in a crucial area of social jus-\ntice. So viewed, we are constrained to negative the two\npreliminary contentions urged by Shri Shroff while agreeing\nwith him on the smaller points of clarification sought.\nWe reproduce, at this stage, the decretal part of the award:\n\n\"The award, therefore, is that the\nemployers should be required to frame a scheme\nof gratuity for their workmen. The details of\nthe gratuity scheme are as under:\n\n(a)On death of a workman while 15 days wages for each\nin continous service or on att- completed year of service\nainment of the age of superann- subject to a maximum of\nuation or on retirement or 15 months.\n\nresignation due to continued\nill health or on being incapi-\n\ncitated,\n(b) On voluntary abandoment 15 days wages for each\nos service by a workman completaed year of cont-\nin case not falling under inious service subject\n\n(a) or termination of to the condition that no\nservice by employers gratuity will be payable\non a total service of\nless than 5 years ,but\nthis condition will not\napply in case of resign-\n\nation or discharge on the\ngrounds of physical disa-\n\nblement or incapacity\n\n(i) For the purposes of gratuity of a period\nof six months or over shall be reckoned as\n'one year' while a period less than 6 months\nwill be ignored.\n\n(ii) Gratuity shall be payable to the nominee\nof the workman in case of his death or to his\nlegal heirs, if no one has been nominated by\nthe workman in this behalf.\n\n(iii) 'Wages' shall mean and include basic\nwages and dear food allowance but shall not\ninclude bonus.\n\n(iv) Gratuity will not be. allowed to a work-\nman in case of a serious misconduct committed\nby him such as insubordination, acts involving\nmoral turpitude, etc. In case of damage to\nthe property of employers or financial loss,\nthe a,mount to the extent of loss shall be\nliable to be deducted from the amount of the\ngratuity.\n\n(v) The basis of payment of gratuity shall be\naverage earnings of a workman during the last\nthree years.\"\n\nOne of the leading cases both sides referred to is the\n\nDelhi Cloth & General Mills Co., v. Workmen & Ors.\n(1) In\nthis decision the court did make the point:\n\n\"That gratuity is not in its present day\nconcept merely a gift made by the employer in\nhis own discretion. The workmen have in\ncourse of time acquired a right to gratuity on\ndetermination of employment provided the\nemployer can afford, having regard to his\nfinancial conditions to pay it.\"\n\nShah, J. speaking for the Court, also empha-\nsized what we have already adverted to:\n\n\"We consider it right to observe that in\nadjudication of industrial disputes settled\nlegal principles have little play; the awards\nmade by industrial tribunals are often the\nresult of ad hoc determination of dispnted\nquestions, and each determination for.as a\nprecedent for determination of other dis-\npute. An attempt to search for principle from\nthe law built up on those precedents is a\nfutile exercise. To the\n(1) [1969] 2 S.C.R. 307.\nCourts accustomed to apply settled principles\nto facts determined by the application of the\njudicial process, an essay into the unsur-\nveyed expenses of the law of industrial rela-\ntions with neither a compass.nor a guide, but\nonly the pillars of precedents is a disheart-\nening experience. The Constitution has howev-\ner invested this Court with the power to sit\nin appeal over the awards of Industrial Tribu-\nnals which are, it is said, rounded on the\nsomewhat hazy background of maintenance of\nindustrial peace, which secures the prosperity\nof the industry and the improvement of the\nconditions of workmen employed in the indus-\ntry, and in the absence of principles, prece-\ndents may have to be adopted as guides--some-\nwhat reluctantly to. secure some reasonable\ndegree of uniformity of harmony in the proc-\ness.\"\n\nSeveral decisions which were referred to at the bar\nhave been touched upon\nin\nthe above case\n. At the end of the\nconsideration of these cases, the Court made two pregnant\nobservations which we extract:\n\n\"We may repeat that in .matters relat-\ning to the grant of gratuity and even general-\nly in the settlement of disputes arising out\nof industrial relations, there are no fixed\nprinciples, on the application of which the\nproblems arising before the Tribunal or the\nCourts may be determined and often precedents\nof cases determined ad hoc are utilised to\nbuild up claims or to resist them. It would\nin the circumstances be futile to attempt to\nreduce the grounds of the decisions given by\nthe Industrial Tribunals, the Labour Appel-\nlate Tribunals and the High Courts to the\ndimensions of any recognised principle.\"\n\nx x x\nx x\n\"It is not easy to extract any\n\nprinciple from these cases; as precedents they\nare conflicting.\"\n\nThese cautionary signals guide us too in the instant case.\nIt is true that on account of the peculiar circumstances\naffecting the textile industry in the whole country the\nCourt felt that the Tribunal was in error in relating gratu-\nity to the consolidated wage in. stead of the basic wage.\nThe emphasis in the ruling is on the facts and circumstances\naffecting the particular industry and the promotion of\nindustrial peace in that field. Rightly, if we may say so\nwith respect, did the Court high-light the view that deter-\nmination of gratuity is hot based on any definite rules and\neach case must depend upon the prosperity of the concern,\nneeds of the work, men and the prevailing economic condi-\ntions, examined in the light of the auxiliary benefits\nwhich the workmen may get on determination of employment.\nIn short, the core of the matter is the totally of the\ncircumstances and the stage of evolution of industrial\nrelations at a given time What held good a decade ago may\nbe given the go by years later.\nAnother leading case on the question of gratuity is the\nBritish Paints(1) where, after referring to the special\nfeatures of the particular industry. and the other benefit\nschemes enjoyed by the employees, the Court referred to May\n& Baker where basic wages were treated as the basis and\nBritish India Corporation where 'gross salary i.e., basic\nwages plus dearness allowance' was held to be the basis. It\nmay be noted that in this case the minimum qualifying serv-\nice for gratuity was held to be 5 years except in cases\nwhere termination resulted from resignation by the employee.\nIn Hydro-Engineers(2) this Court apparently upheld the\ncontentions now urged before us by Shri Shroff but stressed\nthat no hard and fast rule could be laid down and each case\nmust be decided on its own circumstances.\n\nIn Hindustan Antibiotics(3), again, this Court high-\nlighted the relevant circumstances upon which the discre-\ntion of the Tribunal could play, viz., the stability of the\nconcern, the profits made in the past, the future prospects\nand capacity etc. This Court declined to disturb the gratu-\nity scheme\nin that case\neven though the wages which formed\nthe basis of the gratuity included dearness allowance.\nIn Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Ltd., Calcut-\nta(4) a Bench of this Court entered the caveat which we have\nunderscored in the earlier part of this judgment that:\n\n\"a free and liberal exercise of the\npower under\nArt. 136\nmay materially affect the\nfundamental basis of such decisions, namely,\nquick solution to such disputes to achieve\nindustrial peace. Though\nArt. 136\nis couched\nin widest terms, it is necessary for this\nCourt to exercise its discretionary jurisdic-\ntion only in cases where awards are made in\nviolation of the principles of natural jus-\ntice, causing substantial and grave injustice\nto parties or raises an important principle of\nindustrial law requiring elucidation and final\ndecision by this Court and discloses such\nother exceptional or special circumstances\nwhich merit the consideration of this Court.\"\n\nIt was also mentioned, what is not oft remembered when\ninterfering with awards, that the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nis\n\"intended to be a self-contained one\nand it seeks to achieve social justice on the\nbasis of collective bargaining, conciliation\nand arbitration. Awards are given on circum-\nstances peculiar to each dispute and the\ntribunals are, to a large extent, free from\nthe restrictions of technical considerations\nimposed on courts.\"\n\n(1) [1969] 2 S.C.R. 523.\n\n(2) [1969] 1 S.C.R. 156.\n\n(3) [1967] 1 S.C.R. 672.\n\n(4) [1959] Suppl. 2. S.C.R. 136.\nThis approach is what we earlier described as the Tribu-\nnal's legal hunch or horse sense. Even Gqziabad Engineer-\ning Co.,(1) on which Shri Shroff heavily relied, accepts the\nposition that while gratuity is usually related to the\nbasic wage, a departure by relating it to the consolidated\nwage may be made if there be some strong evidence or excep-\ntional circumstance justifying that course.\n\nCalcutta Insurance Co. Ltd. (2) also placed accent on\nthe practical approach in industrial adjudication and did\nnot interfere with the qualifying service of 5 years except\nin the case of resignation by the employee where the quali-\nfying period was raised to 10 years.\n\nThis survey of the cosmos of case-law can expand, but\nno service will be rendered by that exercise. All that we\nneed say is that there is nothing fundamentally flawsome in\nthe 5-year period being fixed as qualifying service. The\nreal reason why some cases like British Paints required a\nqualifying period of 10 years was that a longer minimum\nperiod for earning gratuity in the case of voluntary retire-\nment or resignation would ensure that workmen do not leave\none concern for another after putting in the short minimum\nservice qualifying for gratuity.\n\nWe think that current conditions must control the tribu-\nnal's conscience in finalizing the terms of the gratuity\nscheme. Taking things as they are, in our country presently\nthere is unemployment at the level of workers--that being\nthe category we are concerned with. Colossal unemployment\nmeans that the worker will not leave his employment merely\nbecause he has qualified himself for gratuity. In an econo,\nmic situation where there is a glut of labour in the market\nand unemployment stares the working class in the face it is\ntheoretical to contend that employees will hop from industry\nto industry unless the qualifying period for earning gratui-\nty is raised to 10 years. The tribunal was realistic in\nfixing 5 years as the period of eligibility.\nOur industrial realities do not provide for easy\nmobility of labour. What is more, the sense of national\nconsciousness in this field is reflected in the\nPayment of\nGratuity Act\nwhich fixes a period of 5 years as the qualify-\ning period for earning gratuity.\n\nDecisions have been brought to our notice some of which\nrefer to basic wages and others to consolidated wages as the\nfoundation for computation of gratuity. These are matters\nof discretion and the \"feel\" of the circumstances prevalent\nin the industry by the Tribunal and, unless it has gone\nhaywire in the exercise of its discretion the award should\nstand. We see that in the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nalso,\nnot basic wages but 'gross wages inclusive of dearness\nallowance, have been taken as the basis. This, incidental-\nly, reflects the industrial sense in the country which has\nbeen crystallised into legislation.\n\n(1) [1970] 1 S.C.R. 622.\n\n(2)[1967] 2 S.C.R. 596.\nAll things considered, we are disinclined to alter the\naward on the two critical issues on which it was challenged.\nHowever, there are certain minor clarifications which will\neliminate ambiguity and, on that both sides are agreed.\nWe clarify that wages will mean and include basic wages\nand dearness allowance and nothing else. This corresponds\nto\nSec. 2(s)\nof the Act. Likewise, we declare that qualify-\ning service is continuous service (counted with reference to\ncompleted years) as defined in\nSec. 2(c)\n. We hold that the\naward will operate as directed therein i.e. from the date of\nreference of the dispute. Both sides agree, in their state-\nment of the case, that in clause (a) of the award the ex-\npression due to continued ill-health or on being incapaci-\ntated' governs only resignation although we feel on compas-\nsionate grounds it should govern both situations. The ambi-\nguity must be resolved in favour of the workers. In regard\nto the other conflicts of construction possible, as set out\nin grounds 7 and 8 of the appellant's statement of case, we\nresolve them in favour Of the workmen, abandonment of serv-\nice being too recondite and the amount involved too trivial\nfor variation by this Court.\n\nShri I.N. Shroff fairly stated that the Court may make\nan order regarding costs. We direct that the appellant do\npay the respondents costs which we quantify at Rs. 2000/-.\nOut of this sum. Rs. 1000/will be paid direct to Shri Parekh\nwho has assisted the Court on behalf of the workers and the\nbalance of Rs. 1000/- shall be drawn by the present Presi-\ndent of the Respondent Union. Our parting thought is that\nnegotiating settlements should be vigorously and systemati-\ncally pursued even by tribunals since litigation, escalat-\ning. from deck to deck upto this Court, defeats both, whoev-\ner wins or loses. This must be a sobering influence on\nLabour and Management and agencies of conflictresolutions.\nThat is a legal beacon that can brighten the dark tunnel of\nindustrial conflict and promote national production cheered\nby shared wealth.\n\nP.B.R.",

SINGH, JASWANT  CITATION: 1977 AIR 941 1977 SCR (3) 91 1977 SCC (2) 329  ACT: GRATUITY--QUALIFYING PERIOD OF SERVICE AND CALCULATION OF AMOUNTS--TESTS FOR DETERMINATION.  HEADNOTE: IN AN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE BETWEEN THE APPELLANT MILL AND ITS WORKMEN RELATING TO THE PAYMENT OF GRATUITY, THE INDUS- TRIAL TRIBUNAL FRAMED A GRATUITY SCHEME AND GAVE THE NECES- SARY GUIDELINES FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. SPECIAL LEAVE WAS GRANTED TO THE APPELLANT BY THIS COURT ON THE LIMITED QUES- TION WHETHER THE CORRECT PRINCIPLES ON WHICH GRATUITY SHOULD BE PAYABLE HAD BEEN FOLLOWED IN THIS CASE OR NOT. SINCE THE MAKING OF THE AWARD, THE PAYMENT OF GRATUITY ACT, 1972 WAS PASSED, WHICH, BY S. 4(5) GAVE AN OPTION TO THE WORKERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE GRATUITY SCHEME UNDER THE AWARD AND THE ONE UNDER THE STATUTE. THE WORKERS, HOWEVER, DID NOT PUT IN THEIR APPEARANCE IN THIS COURT. IT WAS CONTENDED ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT THAT THE QUALIFYING PERIOD OF SERVICE FOR EARNING GRATUITY WAS TEN YEARS AND FOR CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF GRATUITY BASIC WAGES WITHOUT ADDING DEARNESS ALLOWANCE SHOULD BE THE BASIS AS LAID DOWN BY SOME DECISIONS OF THIS COURT AND THE TRIBU- NAL WAS WRONG IN HOLDING 5 YEARS AS THE QUALIFYING SERVICE AND BASIC WAGES AND DEARNESS ALLOWANCE AS THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF GRATUITY. HELD: THERE IS NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWSOME IN THE 5- YEAR PERIOD BEING FIXED AS THE QUALIFYING SERVICE. THE TRIBUNAL WAS REALISTIC IN FIXING THE PERIOD OF ELIGIBLE QUALIFYING SERVICE AS CONTINUOUS SERVICE COUNTED WITH REFER- ENCE TO THE COMPLETED YEARS AS DEFINED IN S. 2(C) OF THE ACT. [100 C&F] (1) IN SOME CASES, THIS COURT HIGHLIGHTED THE VIEW THAT THE DETERMINATION OF GRATUITY IS NOT BASED ON ANY DEFINITE RULES AND EACH CASE MUST DEPEND UPON THE PROSPERITY OF THE CONCERN, THE NEEDS OF THE WORKMEN AND THE PREVAILING ECONOM- IC CONDITIONS EXAMINED IN THE LIGHT OF THE AUXILIARY BENE- FITS WHICH THE WORKMEN MAY GET ON DETERMINATION OF EMPLOY- MENT. IT WAS ALSO HELD THAT STABILITY OF THE CONCERN, PROFITS MADE 'IN THE PAST, THE FUTURE PROSPECTS AND CAPACITY SHOULD BE THE RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE TRIBUNAL SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN GIVING ITS AWARD. AWARDS ARE' GIVEN ON CIRCUMSTANCES PECULIAR TO EACH DISPUTE AND THE TRIBUNALS ARE, TO A LARGE EXTENT, FREE FROM THE RESTRICTIONS OF TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS IMPOSED ON COURTS. IN SHORT, THE APPROACH OF THE TRIBUNAL SHOULD BE WHAT MAY BE DE- SCRIBED AS ITS LEGAL HUNCH OR HORSE-SENSE. CASES LIKE GAZIABAD ENGINEERING CO. ACCEPT THE POSITION THAT. WHILE GRATUITY IS USUALLY RELATED TO THE BASIC WAGE, A DEPARTURE MAY BE MADE BY RELATING IT TO THE CONSOLIDATED WAGE IF THERE BE SOME STRONG EVIDENCE OR EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFYING THAT COURSE. THE REAL REASON WHY SOME CASES LIKE BRITISH PAINTS REQUIRED A QUALIFYING PERIOD OF 10 YEARS WAS THAT A LONGER MINIMUM PERIOD FOR EARNING GRATUITY IN THE CASE OF VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT OR RESIGNATION WOULD ENSURE THAT WORKMEN DID NOT LEAVE ONE CONCERN FOR ANOTHER AFTER PUTTING IN THE SHORT MINIMUM SERVICE QUALIFYING FOR GRATUITY. BUT CURRENT CONDITIONS MUST CONTROL THE TRIBU- NAL'S CONSCIENCE IN FINALIZING THE TERMS OF THE GRATUITY SCHEME. COLOSSAL UNEMPLOYMENT AT ALL LEVELS OF WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY TODAY MEANS THAT A WORKER WILL NOT LEAVE HIS"
