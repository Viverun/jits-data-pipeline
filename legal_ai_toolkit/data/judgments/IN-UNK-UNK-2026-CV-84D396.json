Medical Services Rules 1945.\n In the State of U.P. there were two Medical Services\nconsisting of doctors serving in the State. The senior\nservice was called the Provincial Medical Service (P.M.S.)\nThis service was a gazetted service carrying a higher scale\nof pay than the other service which was known as P.S.M.S.\n(Provincial Subordinate Medical Service). So far as the\nP.M.S. was concerned, the incumbents of the posts in the\nservice were appointed by the Governor, whereas in the case\nof the P.S.M.S., the employees were appointed by the\nDirector, Health Services. On June 14, 1945, the Government\nof U.P. framed rules known as the \"United Province Medical\nServices (Men's Branch) Rules, 1945\" which were applicable\nto P.M.S. Only. Rule 3(b), (f), and (h) defined \"Direct\nRecruitment\", \"Member of the Service\" and \"Subordinate\nMedical Service\", respectively. Rule 5 provided for two\nmodes of recruitment. Rule 12 provided that selection of\ncandidate for direct recruitment shall be made in\nconsultation with the Public Service Commission Rule 13\nprescribed the mode of interview. Rule 15 laid down modes of\nrecruitment by promotions. Rule 17 specified the \"appointing\nauthority\" and the manner in which the vacancies should be\nfilled in. Under Rule 18, seniority in the service shall be\ndetermined by the date of order of appointment in a\nsubstantive vacancy. Rule 19 required that all persons\nwhether recruited directly or by promotion be placed on\nprobation, while Rule 20 laid down the circumstances under\nwhich a person appointed to a post in the Service on\nprobation may be confirmed.\n On 14-3-1946, two Medical Services were constituted,\nnamely (i) Provincial Medical Service Grade I (popularly\nknown as P.M.S. I ) and (ii) Provincial Medical Service\nGrade II (known as P.M.S. II). It was decided that existing\nmembers of PMS II were to be absorbed in PMS I and further\nrecruitment of medical graduates should be made to PMS II in\norder to replace the PSMS, By an order dated July 24, 1951,\nthe Government laid down that 50 per cent of the vacancies\nin PMS I were to be filled in by direct recruitment and 51\nper cent by promotion. The principle for determination of\ninter se seniority between direct recruits and the promotees\nin PMS I was not laid down at the time when the Government\norder was made. In spite of the quota fixed by the order\ndated 24-7-1951, no promotion from PMS II to PMS I could be\nmade between the years 1952 to 1963, except on an ad hoc\nbasis. On July 14, 1962 by virtue of an advertisement, the\nPublic Service commission invited applications for\nrecruitments to 56 gazetted posts out of which 9 posts were\npermanent and the rest were temporary but were likely to\ncontinue. In pur-\n255\nsuance of this advertisement, the appellants applied for\ndirect recruitment to PMS I and they were ultimately\nappointed on a temporary basis some time in June 1963, but\nbefore the merger of the two services (PMS I and PMS II)\nwhich came into existence on November 1, 1964. This merger\nwas brought about through an order of Government dt. 2-11-\n64. By this order the Pradeshik Medical Service (Men/Women)\nwas constituted which had two grades; namely-ordinary grade\nwhich included all the existing posts of PMS I, and PMS II\nand Selection Grade to consist of 71/2% of the total number\nof permanent posts in the ordinary grade. By para 2 it was\nspecified that \"the permanent and temporary posts in PMS I\nand PMS II grades shall continue to remain as such on their\nmerger until the temporary posts are made permanent\nsubsequently\". By para 4, the Government proposed to issue a\nfurther order regarding the fixation of the inter-se\nseniority while the right to fix inter-se seniority of the\nmembers of the two services was reserved, no provision was\nmade in the order which either applies or continues the\nRules of 1945 even ,3 in respect of inter-se seniority of\nmembers of each merging service. Thereafter another order\nwas passed on 20-2-1965 by which the U.P. Medical Service\n(Men's Branch) Rules 1945 were made applicable provisionally\nto the new PMS with the words \"unless otherwise ordered\".\nUltimately, a final order laying down the principles on the\nbasis of which the inter-se seniority of the members of the\ntwo services was to be determined in the new service was\nmade on 18-12-68. In consonance with the directions\ncontained in this order, the Government fixed the seniority\nof appellants 1 to 7 and petitioners 1 to 12. The appellants\nfell within the ambit of direction (b) of the order dt. 18-\n12-68 which provided for officers appointed to PMS either on\na permanent or temporary basis prior to the merger in a\nregular manner in consultation with The Lok Sewa Ayog\n(Public Service Commission) in order of their seniority. By\na Notification dated July 3, 1970 issued under \nArt. 309\n of\nthe Constitution, the Governor made certain amendments to\nRule 25 of the 1945 Rules, which dealt with promotion to the\npost of Civil Surgeon. The Government Thereafter directed\nthrough its order dt. 18-12-71 certain principles to be\nfollowed regarding fixation of seniority. As per this order\nthe Government by its order dt. 31-12-71 fixed the inter-se\nseniority of the members of the new service, placing the\nappellants above the petitioners/respondents and awarding to\nthem the selection grade prior to the petitioners.\n\nHEADNOTE:\n The petitioners/respondents challenged the vires of\nthese orders as (a) ultra vires \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution; (b) in consistent with the Rules 17 and 18 of\nthe 1945 Rules. The High Court accepted the plea of the\npetitioners/respondents. Hence the appeals by special leave\nby the appellants and the State.\n Allowing the appeals, the Court\n^\n HELD: 1. The combined effect of Rules 12, 13, IS and 17\nof the United Province Medical Service (Men's Branch),\nRules, 1945 is that whereas in the case of direct\nrecruitment, the matter was to be considered by the Public\nService Commission after advertising the vacancies, so far\nas recruitment to the Service by promotion is concerned, a\nSelection Committee constituted under the Rules had to send\nthe lists to the Commission. In a third category of cases to\nwhich appointments were made purely on a temporary or\nofficiating basis there was no provision for reference\neither to a Selection Committee or to\n256\nthe Commission and such appointments could be made by the\nGovernor under sub-rule (2) of Rule 17. [262B-C]\n In the instant case, the direct recruit applied to the\nGovernment in pursuance of an advertisement and they were\nappointed to the Senior Service only after they were\nrecommended by the Public Service Commission. The\nappointment, therefore, was not a purely officiating,\ntemporary or ad hoc appointment as contemplated by Rule\n17(2). [262D-E]\n 2. There is no magical formula or special charm in the\nword \"substantive\". The mere use of the term 'appointment in\na temporary vacancy' by itself would not conclude the matter\nor lead to the irresistible inference that the appointment\nwas not made in a substantive capacity, because even a\nsubstantive appointment could be made to a purely temporary\nvacancy. In order, therefore, to determine the nature of\nappointment, the Court must look to the substance of the\nmatter, the surrounding circumstances, the mode, the manner\nand the terms of appointment and other relevant factors. In\nthe instant case. Reading the advertisement and the manner\nand mode of the appointment of the appellants it is clear\nthat they were appointed in a substantive capacity lo\ntemporary posts which according to the advertisement were\nlikely to continue. Moreover the appellants were appointed\nto PMS I which was doubtless a [superior service carrying a\nhigher scale than PMS II of which the petitioners were\nmembers. [265B-E]\n Purshottam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, [1958] SCR\n828; followed.\n 3. The fact that due to some oversight on the part of\nappointing authority or to other fortuitous circumstance the\norder placing the appellants on probation was not passed for\nlong would not give any special advantage to the\npetitioners, (respondents) who were themselves drawn from a\nlower service and even if they held a substantive post in\nsuch service, they cannot by virtue of promotion to the\nhigher service af ter the appellants, claim seniority over\nthe latter. [266E-F]\n 4. \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution have not been\nviolated because a person who is appointed to a higher\nservice carrying a higher scale must r ordinarily be deemed\nto be senior to an employee who is promoted from a lower\nservice to the higher service even though his appointment\nmay have been substantive in the lower service. [266 F-G]\n Kewal Krihsan Bagga v. The Chairman Railway Board and\nOrs., [1976] 4 S.C.C. p. 733; followed.\n 5. In the absence of any provision in the order dated\n2-11-64 either applying or continuing the Rules of 1945 even\nin respect of the inter-se seniority of members of each\nmerging service, which was also passed under \nArt. 309\n of the\nConstitution and was therefore of a statutory character or\nat any rate had a statutory flavour, the Rules of 1945 could\nnot be applied to the situation obtaining after 2-11-64.\n[268G-H]\n 6. The Directions in the order dated 18-12-68 strike a\njust balance between the officers of erstwhile services\nafter they were merge into the New Services. Direction (b)\nof order dt. 18-12-68 regarding fixation of seniority does\nnot speak of any substantive appointment whatsoever but\nequates the\n257\nofficers appointed to PMS I on permanent or temporary basis\nprior to the merger. In other words, the direction\ncontemplates that any officer appointed to a post whether\npermanent or temporary in PMS I which was the Senior Service\nprior to merger, would rank after merger above those\nofficers who were drawn from PMS II. [271B, C, G]\n 7. The 1945 Rules did not apply to the New Service at\nits inception and what they were made applicable to the new\nservice only for a shortwhile by virtue of the order dated\n20th February 1965, purely on a provisional basis as the\nGovernment made it quite clear in that order itself that the\n1945 Rules will apply 'unless otherwise ordered' and thus\nhad reserved the right to pass final orders regarding\nseniority later which was done in 1968. [271D-E]\n 8. Direction (b) of the order dt. 18-12-68 is not\ninconsistent with Rule 18 of the 1945 Rules. Having regard\nto the history of PMS I and PMS II, if Rule 18 of the 1945\nRules were applied to the parties and the 1968 order\nignored, the resultant effect would be that equals and\nunequals would be treated similarly which would amount to a\ndirect infraction of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nThe appellants and the petitioners were not similarly\nsituate and if the petitioners were put above the appellants\nin the matter of seniority, it would have resulted in a\ngross and wholly unreasonable discrimination by making\njunior officers senior to superior officers. This is clear\nfrom the following propositions: D\n (i) To begin with, the Rules of 1945 had absolutely no\n application to the new Service. Those Rules\n applied to the old PMS I Service only and,\n therefore, to a situation completely different\n from 'hat which prevailed after the merger of the\n two Services on 1-11-1964. As the Government order\n merging the two Services was also an order passed\n under \nArt. 309\n of the Constitution, it had\n statutory force and was binding on all the\n officers of the new Service.\n (ii) At the time when the 1964 order was passed the\n Government deliberately did not frame any rules in\n order to determine the inter se seniority of the\n members of the new Service but reserved the right\n to do so.\n (iii) It was under the order dated February 20, 1965\n that for the first time the Rules of 1945 were\n applied to the new Service and that too \"unless\n otherwise ordered\" i.e., purely on a provisional\n basis. The order of 1968 laid down the principles\n for fixing seniority and, being a statutory order,\n superseded all the Rules in question including\n Rules 17 and 18 of the 1945 Rules. It was further\n confirmed by the order dated 18-12-1971. [273G-H,\n 274A-E, 275D]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 2870 &\n2869 of 1977.\n\n Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order\ndated 31-1-1977 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc\nWrit Petition No. 2852 of 1972.\n\n G.

K Jain for RR 13 in CA 2870/77.\n\n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n FAZAL ALI, J.-These two appeals by special leave are\ndirected against a judgment dated January 31, 1977 of the\nAllahabad High Court by which the High Court accepted the\nwrit petitions filed by the pre sent respondents 1 to 12 and\nquashed the order dated December 31, 1971 of the Government\nof U.P. insofar as it related to respondents numbers 3 to 12\nand 14 to 39 before the High Court. The High Court further\ndirected the State to redetermine the seniority of the\nregular PMS II officers and the temporary PMS I officers in\nthe light of the observations made and the findings given by\nthe High Court.\n\n Against the order of the High Court two appeals have\nbeen filed to this Court-one by the State of Uttar Pradesh\n(which is Civil Appeal No. 2870 of 1977) and the other by\nthe appellants l to 8 (Civil Appeal No. 2869 of 1977) who\nwere respondents numbers 3 and 33 to 39 before the High\nCourt. For the purpose of brevity and to avoid confusion we\nwould refer to respondents I to 12 before the High Court as\nthe 'petitioners' and respondents numbers 3 and 33 to 39\nbefore the High Court as the 'appellants'.\n\n The main controversy between the parties centered round\nfixation of their seniority in a new service which was\ncreated by an order of the Government dated November 2,\n1964. Shorn of unnecessary details the broad facts which\nhave given rise to the present appeals may be briefly\nsummarised thus .\n\n In the State of U.P. prior to 1945 there were two\nMedical Services consisting of Doctors serving in the State.\nThe senior service was called the P.M.S., that is to say,\nthe Provincial Medical Service. This service was a gazetted\nservice carrying a higher scale of pay than the other\nservice which was known as P.S.M.S. (Provincial Subordinate\nMedical Service) which was a non-gazetted service with a\nlower scale of pay. It may also be noticed that so far as\nPMS was concerned, the incumbents of the posts in the\nService were appointed by the Governor whereas in the case\nof the PSMS, the employees were appointed by the Director,\nHealth Services. We have mentioned these two facts because\nthe nature of the Services, the scales of pay, the mode and\nmember of appointment of incumbents to the two Services\nwould be a very relevant factor in order to determine\nwhether or not the decision rendered by the\n\n259\n\nHigh Court was correct. On June 14, 1945, the Government of\nU.P. framed rules known as The United Provinces Medical\nService (Men's Branch) Rules, 1945' which were applicable to\nPMS only and contained definitions, the relevant parts c f\nwhom being covered by clauses (b), (f) and (h) may be\nextracted thus:-\n\n \"3. (b) 'Direct recruitment' means recruitment under B.\nrule S(l).\n\n (f) 'member of the Service' means a person appointed\n in a substantive capacity under the provisions of\n these rules or of the rules in force previous to\n the promulgation of these rules, to a post in the\n cadre of the service;\n\n (h) 'Subordinate Medical Service' means the\n Subordinate medical Service (Men's Branch) of the\n U.P.\"\n\n Rule 5 provided that recruitment to the Service\ncovered by the Rules (hereinafter referred to as the 'Senior\nService') was to be made by two modes-\n\n (i) by selection from among the persons who were\n eligible for appointment to the Service under the\n provisions of the Rules whether or not they were\n already in the permanent service of the Crown, and\n\n (ii) by promotion from the Subordinate Medical Service\n provided that the number of posts to be filled by\n promotion was limited to 10 per cent of the total\n number of posts borne on the permanent cadre of\n the service.\n\n Rule 9 provided that a candidate for appointment to the\nSenior Service must be between 22 and 32 years of age on the\n1st July of the year in which the recruitment was to be\nmake. By a subsequent amendment it was provided that in the\ncase of scheduled caste candidates the age limit could be\nextended by another five years, and that the Governor could,\nin consultation with the Public Service Commission, relax\nthe upper age limit upto 40 years in favour of any candidate\nor class of candidates. Rule 10 laid down the academic\nqualifications for a candidate to be eligible for\nrecruitment to the Senior Service. The relevant portion of\nthat Rule may be quoted thus:-\n\n \"10. Academic qualifications\n A candidate for recruitment to the Service must-\n\n (a) hold a M.B.B.S. Or an equivalent degree of a\n University established by law in India and\n recognised by the Medical Council in India;\n\n OR\n\n260\n\n (b) possess a foreign qualification recognised by\n the Medical Council of India if he does not\n hold a M.B.B.S. or an equivalent degree of a\n University established by law in India.\n\n A candidate who possesses post-graduate\n degree or diploma recognised by the Medical\n Council of India in any branch of Medical Science\n shall, be given preference in the matter of\n recruitment to the Service.\"\n\nRule 12 provided that selection of candidates for direct\nrecruitment shall be made in consultation with the Public\nService Commission who, when called upon to do so, was to\ninvite applications in the prescribed form. Rule 13\nprescribed the mode in which the interview was to be held in\nrespect of candidates who applied for recruitment to the\nService. The relevant portion of that Rule may be extracted\nthus:-\n\n \"13. Interview-(I) The Commission will\n scrutinise the applications received by them and\n require so many candidates qualified for\n appointment under these rules as seem to them\n desirable to appear before them for interview at\n their own expense.\n\n (2) No candidate will be admitted to the\n interview unless he holds a certificate of\n admission granted by the Commission.\n\n (3) The Commission shall draw up a list of\n such candidates as it considers suitable for\n appointment in order of preference and shall\n forward it to the Government.\n\n (4) Subject to the provisions of rules 6 and\n 16(2) the Governor shall appoint as vacancies\n occur the candidates who stand highest in order of\n preference in the list prepared by the Commission\n under sub-rule (3), provided that he is satisfied\n that they are duly qualified in other respects.\"\n\nRule 15 was the provision which required the recruitment of\ncandidates by promotion and may be quoted thus :-\n\n \"15. Recruitment by promotion-(1) officers of\n the Subordinate Medical Service, who have more\n than 14 years' service and are less than 45 years\n of age on the 1st of August of the year in which\n recruitment is to be made, shall be eligible for\n promotion to the Service.\n\n (2) The principle of selection shall be\n seniority subject to the exclusion of those who\n are not fit for promotion.\n\n261\n\n (3) The Inspector-General shall recommend\n names of officers of the Subordinate Medical\n Service who are eligible and whom he considers\n suitable for promotion to the Service on the basis\n of the record of their work and, if necessary,\n interview.\n\n (4) A preliminary selection from amongst the\n officers recommended by the Inspector General and\n other eligible persons shall be made by\n departmental selection committee consisting of\n the-\n\n (i) Secretary to Government, United\n Provinces, Medical department,\n\n (ii) Inspector-General, and\n\n (iii) Director of Public Health, U.P.\"\n It would thus be seen that so far as promotion from the\nSubordinate Medical Service to the Senior Service was to be\nmade, this could be done on the recommendation of the\nInspector-General which was to be endorsed by a Selection\nCommittee constituted under Rule 15(4), quoted above. It was\nfurther provided under Rule 15 that the Selection Committee\nafter considering the relative merits of the candidates will\nsubmit lists to the Government and Rule 15(5) required the\nGovernment to forward both the lists to the Commission\nalongwith the necessary papers. Sub-rule (6) of Rule 15\nempowered the Governor to make the final selection after\nconsidering the advice of the Commission. Rule 17 which has\nbeen the subject matter of serious controversy between the\nparties may be extracted thus:-\n\n \"17. Appointing authority: (1) Appointment to the\n Service shall be made by the Governor on the occurrence\n of substantive vacancies. Appointment in vacancies to\n be filled by direct recruitment shall be made from\n amongst the persons included in the list prepared under\n rule 13(3). Similarly appointments in vacancies to be\n filled by pro motion shall be made from amongst the\n persons selected under rule 15(6). G-\n (2) The Governor may make appointments in\n temporary or officiating vacancies from amongst persons\n who are eligible for permanent appointment to the\n Service under these rules.\"\n\n A perusal of Rule 17 would reveal that the appointment\nwas to be made to the Senior Service by the Governor on the\noccurrence of substantive vacancies. It is also clear from\nthis rule that appointment\n\n262\n\nin vehicles to be filled by direct recruitment would have to\nbe made from amongst persons included in the lists prepared\nunder rule 13(3) (supra) and appointment in other vacancies\nto be filled by promotion under Rule 15(6) (supra). Sub-rule\n(2) of Rule 17 empowered the Governor to make temporary or\nofficiating appointments in vacancies from amongst persons\nwho were eligible for permanent appointments to the Service\nunder these Rules. We might mention here that the combined\neffect of Rules 12, 13, 15 and 17 is that whereas in the\ncase of direct recruitment, the matter was to be considered\nby the Public Service Commission after advertising the\nvacancies, so far as recruitment to the Service by promotion\nis concerned, a Selection Committee constituted under the\nRules had to send the lists to the Commission. In a third\ncategory of cases which were appointments made purely on a\ntemporary or officiating basis there was no provision for\nreference either to a Selection Committee or the Commission\nand such appointments could be made by the Governor. This is\nrather important because while the High Court had laid very\ngreat emphasis on the fact that appellants I to 8 were\nappointed not in substantive vacancies but on a purely\ntemporary basis, it cannot be contended by any show of force\nthat the appointment of the appellants, who were admittedly\ndirect recruits, could be made under Rule 17(2). The\nadmitted position is that the direct recruits applied to the\nGovernment in pursuance of an advertisement and they were\nappointed to the Senior Service only after they were\nrecommended by the Public Service Commission. The\nappointment of the appellants, therefore, was not a purely\nofficiating, temporary or Gd hoc appointment as contemplated\nby Rule 17(2) (supra). We might also emphasis the fact at\nthis stage that it is undisputed that the petitioners while\nbeing members of PSMS had also applied for promotion to the\nSenior Service sometime in the year 1963 but their cases\nwere not recommended by the Selection Committee at all. We\nshall, however, deal with this aspect of the matter at a\nlater stage of this judgment. Rule 18 is the provision which\nlays down the criterion for determining seniority and may be\nextracted thus, because the High Court has strongly relied\non this provision\n \"18. Seniority\n Seniority in the Service shall be determined by\n the date of order of appointment in a substantive\n vacancy, provided that if two or more candidates are\n appointed on the same date their seniority shall be\n determined according to the order in which their names\n are mentioned in the order of appointment.\"\n\n263\n\n According to this Rule, the yardstick to determine the\nseniority appears to be the date of the order of appointment\nin a substantive vacancy. The sheet-anchor of the argument\nof the petitioners both in the High Court and in this Court\nhas been that as the appellants were not appointed in\nsubstantive vacancies they cannot claim seniority under Rule\n18 whereas the petitioners having been promoted to the\nSenior Service from the PSMS and in more or less substantive\nvacancies, they would be deemed to be senior to the\nappellants. The High Court, as already noticed, accepted the\ncase of the petitioners although the State of U.P. supported\nthe case of the appellants and has also filed an appeal\nagainst the order of the High Court.\n\n Relevant part of Rule 19 which is also important may be\nextracted thus:-\n\n \"19. Probation, Discharge, etc.: (1) All persons\n whether recruited directly or by promotion, shall on\n their appointment in or against a substantive vacancy\n be placed on probation for a period of one year,\n provided that the Government may extend the period of\n probation in individual case. The previous officiating\n or temporary service in a post in the cadre of the\n Service shall count toward the period of probation.\"\nRule 20 lays down the circumstances under which a person\nappointed to a post in the Service on probation may be\nconfirmed. According to this Rule the incumbent can be\nconfirmed if he has completed the period of his probation or\nany extended period and the Governor is satisfied that he is\nfit for promotion.\n\n On the 14th of March 1946, two new Medical Services\nwere constituted, viz., (1) Provincial Medical Service Grade\n1, popularly known as 'PMS I', in the scale of Rs. 200-10-\n320-15-500, and (2) Provincial Medical Service Grade II,\nknown as PMS II, carrying a scale of Rs. 120-4-10-8-200. It\nwas decided that existing members of PMS were to be absorbed\nin PMS I and further recruitment of medical graduates should\nbe made to PMS II in order to replace the PSMS. By order No.\n4534A/V-614/1949 dated July 24, 1951, the Government laid\ndown that 50 per cent of the vacancies in PMS I were to be\nfilled in by direct recruitment and 50 per cent by\npromotion. Unfortunately, the prin. Simple for determination\nof inter se seniority between direct recruits and the\npromotees in PMS I was not laid down at the time when the\nGovernment order was made. It appears that upto the year\n1952, while five PMS II officers were promoted to PMS I and\nfour officers of merged States working in PMS I were\nadjusted against the promotion quota in PMS I, 23 officers\nwere appointed to PMS by direct recruitment\n\n264\n\nagainst substantive vacancies. Certain modifications were\nmade by Government office Memorandum No. 1591/II B-50-1955\ndated May 15, 1956 as modified by another Government office\nMemorandum No. 4760/II B-50-55 dated December 18, 1956. But\nthese changes are not germane for the purpose of the present\nappeals. It appears, however, that in spite of the quota\nfixed by the order dated 24-7-1951, no promotion from PMS II\nto PMS I could be made between the years 1952 to 1963\nexception an ad hoc basis. This brings us to a very\nimportant date which forms the pivotal basis for the\ndecision of the points in controversy and for the\ndetermination of inter se seniority of the petitioners and\nthe appellants. On July 14, 1962 by virtue of an\nadvertisement, the Public Service Commission invited\napplications for recruitment to 56 Gazetted posts out of\nwhich 9 posts were permanent and the rest were temporary but\nwere likely to continue. The relevant portion of the\nadvertisement may be extracted thus:\n\n \"Applications are invited for the following 16\n Gazetted posts (a) For Medicine-8, (b) For Surgery-8,\n\n (c) For orthopaedics-S, (d) For E.N.T. Surgery-4, (e)\n For T.B.-7, (f) For Radiology-8, (g) Mental\n Specialists-3, (h) For Anaesthesia-13; 9 posts of (h)\n are permanent, rest are temporary but likely to\n continue (Advt. No. 671), Dept. No. R.B. 6)\n Qualifications:\n\n (i) M.B.B.S. degree from Lucknow or Agra\n University.\n\n Applicant should be amongst First twenty position\n holders in order of merit from K.G. Medical College.\n Lucknow or S.N. Medical College, Agra or must have any\n of the post graduate qualifications approved by the\n Indian Medical Council.\n\n Desirable: Experience as Resident officer or an\n Equivalent post.. \"\n\n It is not disputed that in pursuance of this\nadvertisement, the. appellants applied for direct\nrecruitment to PMS I and they were ultimately appointed on a\ntemporary basis sometime in June 1963 but before the merger\nof the two Services (PMS I & PMS II) which came into\nexistence on November 2, 1964. One of the dominant questions\nto be determined in this case is whether the appellants were\nappointed purely on a temporary basis or in a substantive\ncapacity though against temporary posts. In our opinion, the\nHigh Court seems to have laid undue stress on the fact that\nthe appellants were appointed on a temporary basis while\noverlooking the surrounding\n\n265\n\ncircumstances and the terms of the advertisement and the\nRules, A referred to above, under which the appellants were\nappointed. We have already indicated that Rule 17(23 was the\nonly Rule under which are temporary or an officiating\nappointment could be made by the Governor without reference\nto the Public Service Commission. In the instant case, it is\nnot disputed that the appellants were appointed after\nreference to and on the recommendations of the Public\nService Com- mission. The appointment of the appellants,\ntherefore. would, not fall under Rule 17(2). What then is\nthe nature of the appointments of the appellants is the\nserious question to be decided. In our opinion, reading the\nadvertisement and the manner and mode of the appointment of\nthe appellants, it must be held that they were appointed in\na substantive capacity to temporary posts which according to\nthe advertisement were likely to continue. There does not\nappear to be any magical formula or special charm in the\nword 'substantive'. The mere use of the term 'appointment in\na temporary vacancy' by itself would not conclude the matter\nor lead to the irresistible inference that the appointment\nwas not made in a substantive capacity because even a\nsubstantive appointment could be made to a purely temporary\nvacancy. In order, therefore, to determine the nature of the\nappointment, we have to look to the heart and substance of\nthe matter, the surrounding circumstances, the mode, the\nmanner and the terms of appointment and other relevant\nfactors. In the instant case, we cannot ignore the\nadvertisement which forms the pivotal basis of the direct\nrecruitment in pursuance of which the appellants were\nappointed. Another circumstances that supports our view is\nthat the appellants were not appointed merely on an ad hoc\nbasis but through the Public Service Commission and in a\nregular way. Finally, the appellants were appointed to PMS I\nwhich was doubtless a superior service carrying a higher\nscale than PMS II of which the petitioners were members. \nThe\nquestion as to what is a 'substantive appointment' is no\nlonger res integra but was clearly expounded in the case of\n\nParshotom Lal Dhingra v. Union of India\n,(l) where this Court\nmade the following observations:\n\n \"The appointment of a Government servant to a\n permanent post may be substantive or on probation or on\n an officiating basis. A substantive appointment to a\n permanent post in public service confers normally on\n the servant so appointed a substantive right to the\n post\n Likewise an appointment to a temporary post in\n Government service may be substantive or on an\n officiating basis. Here also, in the absence of any\n special stipulation\n\n266\n\n or any specific service rule, the servant so appointed\n ac quires no right to the post and his service can be\n terminated at any time except in one case, namely, when\n the appointment to a temporary post is for a definite\n period The substantive appointment to a temporary post,\n under the rules, used to give the servant so appointed\n certain benefits regarding pay and leave, but was\n otherwise on the same footing as appointment to a\n temporary post on probation or on an officiating\n basis.\"\n\n It was contended by Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the\npetitioners that according to the 1945 Rules, the appellants\ncould not be said to have been appointed in a substantive\ncapacity because one of the essential ingredients of such an\nappointment was that they should have been placed on\nprobation for a period of one year. Reference was made in\nthis connection to Rule 19, the relevant portion of which\nmay be again quoted thus:\n\n \"All persons whether recruited directly or by\n promotion, shall on their appointment in or against a\n substantive vacancy be placed on probation for a period\n of one year\n It was submitted that there is nothing to show that the\nappellants were on their appointment to the PMS I placed on\nprobation and, on the other hand, the order of probation was\npassed long afterwards, i.e., in 1970, which was shortly\nbefore their confirmation. It does appear that due to some\noversight on the part of the appointing authority or to\nother fortuitous circumstance, the order placing the\nappellants on probation was not passed for long but that\nwould not give any special advantage to the petitioners who\nwere themselves drawn from a lower service and even if they\nheld a substantive post in such service, they cannot by\nvirtue of promotion to the higher service after the\nappellants, claim seniority over the latter. The petitioners\nalso cannot complain on any discrimination on the ground\nthat \nArticle 14\n or 16 of the Constitution was violated\nbecause a person who is appointed to a higher service\ncarrying a higher scale must ordinarily be deemed to be\nsenior to an employee who is promoted from a lower service\nto the higher service even though his appointment may have\nbeen substantive in the lover service. \nIn the case of \nKewal\nKrishan Baga v. The Chairman, Railway Board & Ors\n (1) this\nCourt observed as follows.\n\n \"It was finally urged that clerks in the old\n establishment were wrongly accorded seniority over\n godown keepers in\n\n267\n\n the cadre of clerks in the Northern Railway in which\n both clerks and godown keepers were assimilated. This\n argument overlooks the basic consideration that clerks\n in the Amritsar godown while working under the Punjab\n Government were placed in a higher scale of pay than\n godown keepers. The decision to treat clerks as senior\n to godown keepers was therefore not arbitrary or\n irrational. In fact, some injustice done earlier to\n clerks by fixing their inter se seniority with godown\n keepers in the new establishment on the basis of their\n length of service in the respective cadres was later\n rectified by providing that clerks will be considered\n as senior to godown keepers.\"\n\n In view of the circumstances discussed above, we are\ninclined to take the view that not much can be made of the\nfact that the order appointing the appellants 1-7 does not\nmention that they were appointed In a substantive capacity\nand that what is said is that they were appointed on a\ntemporary basis. We shall consider this aspect more fully\nafter we have completed the history of the Services and\ntheir ultimate merger as well as the events following\nthereafter. We might mention, however, that Dr. M. J.\nSiddiqui (respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal No. 2870 of 1977)\nhad filed a petition in the High Court regarding his\nseniority and other matters but before the petition could be\nheard the two Services were merged and the petition was\nultimately dismissed on 2-8-1965 as infructuous. 13\n After making promotions from the lower service to the\nhigher. service, the Government finally decided to have one\nmedical service and with this object in view by order No. U-\n1312-A-II/V-2566/63 dated 2-11-64, the Government merged the\ntwo Services, namely, PMS I and PMS II with effect from 1-\n11-64. The relevant portions of this order may be extracted\nthus:-\n\n \"With a view to removing this shortage as also to\n making the service conditions more attractive, the\n Governor is pleased to order that instead of having two\n medical services, viz, P.M.S. I and PMS II and a\n selection grade in PMS I, there shall be, with effect\n from November 1, 1964, one service to be called\n Pradeshik Medical Service (Men/Women), Carrying the\n scale of Rs. 250-25-350-EB-25-475-EB-25-600 EB-25-700,\n ordinary grade, and Rs. 500-50-1000-E.B. 50-1200\n selection grade, and shall consist of the following:\n\n (a) Ordinary Grade:\n\n (i) all the existing posts of P.M.S. I (both Men\n and Women)\n\n268\n\n (ii) all the existing posts of P.M.S. II (both Men\n and Women)\n\n (b) Selection Grade:\n\n 7-1/2 per cent of the total number of\n permanent posts in the ordinary grade.\n\n 2. The permanent and temporary posts in PMS I\n and PMS II cadres shall continue to remain as such on\n their merger into PMS until the temporary posts are\n subsequently converted into permanent ones.\"\n\n A perusal of this order manifestly reveals that the\ndistinction between PMS I and PMS II was abolished and the\ntwo Services were constituted into one designated as\n'Pradeshik Medical Service (Men/Women)' (hereinafter called\nthe 'new Service') which had two grades (1) the ordinary\nGrade which was in the range of Rs. 250-700 and (2) the\nselection grade which was in the range of Rs. 500-1200. It\nwas further provided that 7-1/2 per cent of the total number\nof permanent posts in the ordinary grade would be reserved\nfor the selection grade. Para 2 of the order is rather\nimportant as it appears to have kept alive, to some extent,\nthe distinction between the permanent and the temporary\nposts in PMS I and PMS II. Para 4 of the order is very\nimportant for our purpose and may be extracted thus:\n\n \"4. Orders regarding fixation of the inter\n seniority of the existing P.M.S. I and P.M.S. II\n officers in the P.M.S. will issue separately.\"\n\n It was rather unfortunate that while merging the two\nservices into one, the Government did not consider it\nexpedient to lay down rules for fixing inter se Seniority of\nthe officers of the two erstwhile services. It was, however,\nmentioned in para 4 that rules regarding fixation of the\nsaid seniority would issue separately. Another important\naspect of the matter which is germane to the issues arising\nin these appeals is that while the right to inter se\nseniority of the members of the two services was reserved,\nthere is no provision in the order which either applies or\ncontinues the Rules of 1945 even in respect of the inter se\nseniority of members of each merging service. It was,\ntherefore, rightly contended by the appellants that in the\nabsence of any such provision in the order which was also\npassed under \nArt. 309\n of the constitution and was therefore\nof a statutory character or, at any rate, had a statutory\nflavour, the Rules of 1945 could not be applied to the\nsituation obtaining after 31-15-1964 subsequent orders\npassed by the Government throw some light on this point. As\nthe Government was not in\n\n269\n\na position to lay down the Rules for fixation of inter se\nseniority immediately after the constitution of the new\nservice, by way of a stopgap arrangement, the Government\npassed order No. 20661-AII/V-2566-1963 dated February 20,\n1965, the relevant portions of which may be extracted thus\n \"Subject:-Merger of P.M.S. I and n into P.M.S.\n Sir,\n In continuation of G.O. No. U-1312-A-II/V-\n 2566/1963 dated November 2, 1974 on the subject\n mentioned above, I am directed to say that in\n supersession of all previous orders on the subject the\n Governor has been pleased to order as follows:-\n\n (1) The U.P. Medical Service (Men's Branch) Rules,\n 1945 shall apply to the new, PMS unless otherwise\n ordered.\n\n (2) The appointing authority of P.M.S. shall be\n the Governor.\n\n (3) Disciplinary proceedings against the officers\n of the P.M.S. will be drawn at Secretariat level, as in\n the case of other gazetted officers.\n\n (5) The following will be eligible for appointment\n to P.M.S.\n\n (a) Medical graduate of all Universities in India\n recognised by the Indian Medical Council.\n\n (b) Medical graduates who hold the M.B.B.S.\n degree of Lucknow University, provided they\n have served in house appointment for a term\n of nine months in a teaching hospital before\n they offer themselves for appointment.\n\n .. .. .. .. ... ...\n\n 3. The number of permanent and temporary post in\n P.M.S. I and II (Men and Women) as on the afternoon of\n October 31, 1964 may please be reported to Government\n immediately so that the strength of P.M.S. cadre on\n November 1, 1964 may be fixed. Seniority lists of the\n officers (Men & Women) in P.M.S. I and II also kindly\n be furnished at once in duplicate as in the attached\n proforma.\"\n\n It is, therefore, manifest that during the interregnum,\nthat is to say, 1-11-64 to 22-2-65, the Rules of 1945 were\ninapplicable so far as\n\n270\n\nthe new Service was concerned. It was for the first time on\nthe 20th February 1965 that by the order, extracted above,\nthe U.P. Medical Service (Men's Branch) Rules, 1945 were\nmade applicable to the new Service and that too on a purely\nprovisional basis until fresh Rules were framed by the\nGovernment for determining the inter se seniority 1 of the\nofficers concerned. The words 'unless otherwise ordered'\nclearly show that the application of the 1945 Rules was\npurely provisional and was to remain in force unless fresh\nrules were made. Another order by the Government was passed\non 26-12-67 regarding the mode of recruitment,\nqualifications, etc., which is not very relevant for our\npurpose. Ultimately, a final order laying down the\nprinciples on the basis of which the inter se seniority of\nthe members of the two Services was to be determined in the\nnew Service were laid down. This order was passed by virtue\nof G.O. No.3976 A-II/V-68/1757/65 dated 18-12-68 which may\nbe extracted thus:\n\n \"In supersession of G.O. No. 1004-A-II/V-2566/63\n dated April 23, 1963, on the above subject, I am\n directed to say that the Governor has been pleased to\n order that the inter se seniority of the officers of\n the merged cadre known as PMS should be arranged in the\n following order:-\n\n (a) Permanent PMS I officers in order of their\n seniority already determined by Government\n followed by,\n\n (b) officers appointed/promoted to PMS I on\n permanent or temporary basis prior to the\n merger of PMS I and PMS II in the regular\n manner in consultation with the Lok Sewa Ayog\n in order of their seniority determined by\n Government, followed by,\n\n (c) officers of PMS II in order of their\n seniority in the PMS II cadre prior to the\n merger of PMS I and PMS II.\n\n Note: If a PMS II officer was officiating in PMS I\n but he has not been approved for promotion/appointment\n to PMS I by the Lok Sewa Ayog, he shall rank in the PMS\n in accordance with his seniority in PMS II.\n\n 2. I am to request that a seniority list of PMS\n officers may please be prepared on the lines indicated\n above and it may be sent to Government for their\n approval as early as possible.\"\n\n It was in consonance with these directions that the\nGovernment fixed the seniority of appellants 1 to 7 and\npetitioners 1 to 12. So\n\n271\n\nfar as the appellants were concerned, they clearly fell\nwithin the ambit A of direction (b) which provided for\nofficers appointed to PMS I either on a permanent or\ntemporary basis prior to the merger in a regular manner in\nconsultation with the Lok Sewa Ayog (Public Service\nCommission) in order of their seniority. It may be pertinent\nto note here that direction (b) does not speak of any\nsubstantive appointment whatsoever but equates the officers\nappointed to PMS I on permanent or temporary basis prior to\nmerger. In other words, what the direction contemplates is\nthat any officer appointed to a post whether permanent or\ntemporary in PMS I which was the Senior Service prior to\nmerger, would rank after merger above those officers who\nwere drawn from PMS II. That the appellants fulfilled all\nthe conditions mentioned in direction (b) is not disputed\nbut the constitutionality of that direction was challenged\nbefore the High Court on the ground that it was inconsistent\nwith Rule 18 of the 1945 Rules. This contention found favour\nwith the High Court which held that direction (b) was\ninvalid as being inconsistent with the Rules of 1945. In\ncoming to this finding, the High Court appears to have\noverlooked the fact that the 1945. Rules did not apply to\nthe new Service at its inception and that they were made\napplicable to the new Service only for a short while by\nvirtue of the order dated 20th February 1965, purely on a\nprovisional basis as the Government made it quite clear in\nthat order itself that the 1945 Rules will apply 'unless\notherwise ordered' and thus had reserved the right to pass\nfinal orders regarding seniority later which was done in\n1968. In these circumstances, therefore, the order of the\nHigh Court suffers from two infirmities-\n\n (i) that there was no real or apparent inconsistency\n between rule 18 of the 1945 Rules and the 1968\n directions,.\n\n (ii) that initially the 1945 Rules ceased to apply to\n the new Service but were made applicable thereto\n only for a shortwhile by way of a stop-gap\n arrangement in 1965.\n\n The High Court appears to have interpreted the\ndirections of 1968 completely out of context. On the other\nhand, we feel that those directions seek to strike a just\nbalance between the officers of the erstwhile Services after\nthey were merged into the new Service. We shall immediately\nshow that having regard to the exigencies of the situation\ncreated by the merger, no other mode of seniority, which\nwas just and fair, could be evolved for the new Service.\n\n By a notification dated July 3, 1970 issued under Act.\n309 of the Constitution, the Governor made certain\namendments in the 1945\n\n272\n\nRules including Rule 25 which related to recruitment to the\nposts of Civil Surgeons and other PMS selection grade posts.\nThe amended rule may be extracted thus:-\n\n \"Part IX-Promotion to the post of Civil Surgeon\n and other PMS-Selection grade posts.\n Rule 25 (i) Recruitment to the posts of Civil\n Surgeons and other PMS Selection grade posts, borne on\n the cadre of the Service, shall be made by promotion on\n the basis of seniority subject to rejection of the\n unfit from among the members of the Service who hold\n the M.B.B.S. Or higher degree and who have rendered not\n less than 10 years' service.\"\n\n Under this rule the promotion to the selection grade of\nthe new Service was to be made purely on the basis of\nseniority subject to rejection of the unfit from among the\nmembers of the Service or those who had rendered service for\nless than ten years. The petitioners appear to have put\nforward their claim to seniority as being above the\nappellants in order to earn the selection grade before the\nappellants on the ground that they had been appointed in a\nsubstantive capacity, though in a lower service, prior to\nthe appointments of the appellants to the higher service.\nThereafter, it appears that the Government, after\nconsidering the representations received from the former\nofficers of PMS and in consultation with the Public Service\nCommission, more or less endorsed the principles laid down\nfor fixation of seniority in the 1968 order and directed in\nan order dated 18-12-1971 seniority should be fixed on the\nfollowing principles:-\n\n \"(k) Keeping in view the balance in the seniority list\n among the appointment by direct recruitment upto\n 1951 and the promotee officers. 19 promotee\n officers may be given first 19 posts at the same\n time.\n\n (kh) In the list of the officer by promotion and direct\n recruitment, Ratio of 1: 1 may be kept in the\n seniority list in both the categories of the\n officers from the 20th post, i.e, 20th post to the\n promotee officer and 21st post may be given to\n officer by direct recruitment. This will continue\n until the batch of direct recruits upto 1963.\n\n Thereafter the remaining promotee officers of\n batch 1963 may be placed all together in the\n seniority list. Thereafter, the direct recruits of\n batch 1964 may be placed in the seniority list\n together.\n\n273\n\n (G) The officers selected for permanent posts in a\n year A may be placed over the officers selected\n for temporary posts in the same year.\n\n (GH) Five officers of the reserve list by the direct\n recruitment of the year 1951 who were appointed\n temporarily in 1952 and whose permanent\n appointment was approved by the Commission in 1958\n may be placed below in the list of the officers by\n direct recruitment in 1957 batch.\n\n Note: 1. The lists of the officers by direct\n recruitment and by promotion will contain only the\n names who were appointed temporary and permanent in PMS\n (I) with the approval of the Public Service Commission.\n\n 2. In accordance with the aforesaid principles 'G'\n the names of the officers will be placed in the list by\n direct recruitment after approval by the Commission for\n regular appointment.\n\n 3. The names of the officers will be placed in the\n list of promotee officers in order of the determined\n seniority in accordance with the above mentioned\n principles 'G' vide notification No. 2780 K/5/247/57\n dated the 13th June 1963.\"\n\n It was in consequence of these directions that the\nGovernment by virtue of the order impugned fixed the\nseniority of the members of the new Service, placing the\nappellants above the petitioners and awarding to them the\nselection grade Prior to the petitioners.\n\n Thus, in short, the, heart of the matter is whether the\norder of 1968 as confirmed by the order dated 18-12-1971 was\nin any way inconsistent with Rules 17 and 18 of the 1945\nRules so as to nullify the mode of seniority adopted by the\nGovernment and the promotion to the selection grade made by\nit under the impugned order. In our opinion, the following\npropositions emerge from the history of the new service and\nthe foregoing discussion:-\n\n (1) To begin with, the Rules of 1945 had absolutely no\n application to the new Service. Those Rules\n applied to the old PMS I Service only and,\n therefore, to a situation completely different\n from that which pre vailed after the merger of the\n two Services on 1-11-1964. As the Government order\n merging the two Services was also an order passed\n under \nArt. 309\n of the Constitution,\n\n274\n\n it had statutory force and was binding on all the\n officers of the new Service.\n\n (2) At the time when the 1964 order was passed the\n Government deliberately did not frame any rules in\n order to determine the inter se seniority of the\n members of the new Service but reserved the right\n to do so.\n\n (3) It was under the order dated February 20, 1965\n that for the first time the Rules of 1945 were\n applied to the new Service and that too \"unless\n otherwise ordered\" i.e., purely on a provisional\n basis. The order of 1968 laid down the principles\n for fixing seniority and, being a statutory order,\n superseded all the Rules in question including\n Rules 17 and 18 of the 1945 Rules. It was further\n confirmed by the order dated l 8-12-1971.\n\n We, therefore, find ourselves unable to agree with the\nview taken by the High Court that direction (b) of the 1968\norder should be struck down as being inconsistent with Rule\n18 of the 1945 Rules.\n\n We might further point out that having regard to the\nhistory of PMS I and P.M.S. II if Rule 18 of the 1945 Rules\nwere applied to the parties and the 1968 order ignored, the\nresultant effect would be that equals and unequals would be\ntreated similarly which would amount to a direct infraction\nof \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. In order to\nillustrate our point we give below a chart showing the\ndifferent attributes possessed by the two set of officers,\nnamely, the appellants and the petitioners:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n Appellants Petitioner\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.

The Petitioner belonged to\nadmittedly appointed by the PMS II which was a subordinate\nGovernor to a higher Service, Service with a lower scale ;\nViz., PMS I Carrying a higher their appointing authority\nScale of pay with better being the Director, Medical\nprospects and higher Service and not the Governor.\nresponsibilities.\n\n3. At the time of appointment 3. The petitioner did not put\nto the selection grade the in the requisite experience in\nappellants had put in there- PMS I for promotion to\nquisite experience of more selection grade.\n\nthan eight years in PMS I\nrequired for promotion to the\nselection grade.\n\n Having regard to these factors, it is obvious that the\nappellants and the petitioners were not similarly situate\nand if the petitioners were put above the appellants in the\nmatter of seniority, it would have resulted in a gross and\nwholly unreasonable discrimination by making junior\nofficers senior to superior officers.\n\n A number of authorities were cited before us on the\nquestion of the principles of seniority but they are not at\nall applicable to the peculiar facts of the present case\nwhich have special features of their own and we have\ntherefore not considered it necessary to deal with those\nauthorities.\n\n As regards the case of appellant No. 8, Dr. Sudhir\nGupta, it stands on an altogether different. footing which\nis even higher than those of appellants 1 to 7. To begin\nwith this appellant was recruited directly to PMS I from PMS\nII through the Public Service Commission on 13-7-1959. He\nactually joined the PMS I Service on 11-11-1959. He passed\nM.B.B.S. in 1954 and was among the first ten candidates. In\n1956, he obtained Child Health Diploma. Thus, in all respect\nthe case of appellant No. 8 is exactly similar to that of\nthe other appellants with this difference that he was\nappointed to PMS I about five years before the PMS II was\nmerged into PMS l and therefore the petitioners could not\nclaim seniority over him.\n\n276\n\n Thus, on a careful consideration of all the\ncircumstances of this case, we are clearly of the opinion\nthat the High Court committed an error of law in quashing\nthe order of the Government dated 31-12-1971 and directing\nit to refix the seniority of the parties. Accordingly,\nAppeals Nos. 2869 and 2870 of 1977 are allowed and the\norders passed by the High Court are set aside. The order of\nthe Government dated December 31, 1971 is hereby restored.\nIn the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as\nto costs.\n\nS.R. Appeals allowed.\n\n277",

Medical Services Rules 1945.\n In the State of U.P. there were two Medical Services\nconsisting of doctors serving in the State. The senior\nservice was called the Provincial Medical Service (P.M.S.)\nThis service was a gazetted service carrying a higher scale\nof pay than the other service which was known as P.S.M.S.\n(Provincial Subordinate Medical Service). So far as the\nP.M.S. was concerned, the incumbents of the posts in the\nservice were appointed by the Governor, whereas in the case\nof the P.S.M.S., the employees were appointed by the\nDirector, Health Services. On June 14, 1945, the Government\nof U.P. framed rules known as the \"United Province Medical\nServices (Men's Branch) Rules, 1945\" which were applicable\nto P.M.S. Only. Rule 3(b), (f), and (h) defined \"Direct\nRecruitment\", \"Member of the Service\" and \"Subordinate\nMedical Service\", respectively. Rule 5 provided for two\nmodes of recruitment. Rule 12 provided that selection of\ncandidate for direct recruitment shall be made in\nconsultation with the Public Service Commission Rule 13\nprescribed the mode of interview. Rule 15 laid down modes of\nrecruitment by promotions. Rule 17 specified the \"appointing\nauthority\" and the manner in which the vacancies should be\nfilled in. Under Rule 18, seniority in the service shall be\ndetermined by the date of order of appointment in a\nsubstantive vacancy. Rule 19 required that all persons\nwhether recruited directly or by promotion be placed on\nprobation, while Rule 20 laid down the circumstances under\nwhich a person appointed to a post in the Service on\nprobation may be confirmed.\n On 14-3-1946, two Medical Services were constituted,\nnamely (i) Provincial Medical Service Grade I (popularly\nknown as P.M.S. I ) and (ii) Provincial Medical Service\nGrade II (known as P.M.S. II). It was decided that existing\nmembers of PMS II were to be absorbed in PMS I and further\nrecruitment of medical graduates should be made to PMS II in\norder to replace the PSMS, By an order dated July 24, 1951,\nthe Government laid down that 50 per cent of the vacancies\nin PMS I were to be filled in by direct recruitment and 51\nper cent by promotion. The principle for determination of\ninter se seniority between direct recruits and the promotees\nin PMS I was not laid down at the time when the Government\norder was made. In spite of the quota fixed by the order\ndated 24-7-1951, no promotion from PMS II to PMS I could be\nmade between the years 1952 to 1963, except on an ad hoc\nbasis. On July 14, 1962 by virtue of an advertisement, the\nPublic Service commission invited applications for\nrecruitments to 56 gazetted posts out of which 9 posts were\npermanent and the rest were temporary but were likely to\ncontinue. In pur-\n255\nsuance of this advertisement, the appellants applied for\ndirect recruitment to PMS I and they were ultimately\nappointed on a temporary basis some time in June 1963, but\nbefore the merger of the two services (PMS I and PMS II)\nwhich came into existence on November 1, 1964. This merger\nwas brought about through an order of Government dt. 2-11-\n64. By this order the Pradeshik Medical Service (Men/Women)\nwas constituted which had two grades; namely-ordinary grade\nwhich included all the existing posts of PMS I, and PMS II\nand Selection Grade to consist of 71/2% of the total number\nof permanent posts in the ordinary grade. By para 2 it was\nspecified that \"the permanent and temporary posts in PMS I\nand PMS II grades shall continue to remain as such on their\nmerger until the temporary posts are made permanent\nsubsequently\". By para 4, the Government proposed to issue a\nfurther order regarding the fixation of the inter-se\nseniority while the right to fix inter-se seniority of the\nmembers of the two services was reserved, no provision was\nmade in the order which either applies or continues the\nRules of 1945 even ,3 in respect of inter-se seniority of\nmembers of each merging service. Thereafter another order\nwas passed on 20-2-1965 by which the U.P. Medical Service\n(Men's Branch) Rules 1945 were made applicable provisionally\nto the new PMS with the words \"unless otherwise ordered\".\nUltimately, a final order laying down the principles on the\nbasis of which the inter-se seniority of the members of the\ntwo services was to be determined in the new service was\nmade on 18-12-68. In consonance with the directions\ncontained in this order, the Government fixed the seniority\nof appellants 1 to 7 and petitioners 1 to 12. The appellants\nfell within the ambit of direction (b) of the order dt. 18-\n12-68 which provided for officers appointed to PMS either on\na permanent or temporary basis prior to the merger in a\nregular manner in consultation with The Lok Sewa Ayog\n(Public Service Commission) in order of their seniority. By\na Notification dated July 3, 1970 issued under \nArt. 309\n of\nthe Constitution, the Governor made certain amendments to\nRule 25 of the 1945 Rules, which dealt with promotion to the\npost of Civil Surgeon. The Government Thereafter directed\nthrough its order dt. 18-12-71 certain principles to be\nfollowed regarding fixation of seniority. As per this order\nthe Government by its order dt. 31-12-71 fixed the inter-se\nseniority of the members of the new service, placing the\nappellants above the petitioners/respondents and awarding to\nthem the selection grade prior to the petitioners."

The High Court accepted the plea of the\npetitioners/respondents. Hence the appeals by special leave\nby the appellants and the State.\n Allowing the appeals, the Court\n^\n HELD: 1. The combined effect of Rules 12, 13, IS and 17\nof the United Province Medical Service (Men's Branch),\nRules, 1945 is that whereas in the case of direct\nrecruitment, the matter was to be considered by the Public\nService Commission after advertising the vacancies, so far\nas recruitment to the Service by promotion is concerned, a\nSelection Committee constituted under the Rules had to send\nthe lists to the Commission. In a third category of cases to\nwhich appointments were made purely on a temporary or\nofficiating basis there was no provision for reference\neither to a Selection Committee or to\n256\nthe Commission and such appointments could be made by the\nGovernor under sub-rule (2) of Rule 17. [262B-C]\n In the instant case, the direct recruit applied to the\nGovernment in pursuance of an advertisement and they were\nappointed to the Senior Service only after they were\nrecommended by the Public Service Commission. The\nappointment, therefore, was not a purely officiating,\ntemporary or ad hoc appointment as contemplated by Rule\n17(2). [262D-E]\n 2. There is no magical formula or special charm in the\nword \"substantive\". The mere use of the term 'appointment in\na temporary vacancy' by itself would not conclude the matter\nor lead to the irresistible inference that the appointment\nwas not made in a substantive capacity, because even a\nsubstantive appointment could be made to a purely temporary\nvacancy. In order, therefore, to determine the nature of\nappointment, the Court must look to the substance of the\nmatter, the surrounding circumstances, the mode, the manner\nand the terms of appointment and other relevant factors. In\nthe instant case. Reading the advertisement and the manner\nand mode of the appointment of the appellants it is clear\nthat they were appointed in a substantive capacity lo\ntemporary posts which according to the advertisement were\nlikely to continue. Moreover the appellants were appointed\nto PMS I which was doubtless a [superior service carrying a\nhigher scale than PMS II of which the petitioners were\nmembers. [265B-E]\n Purshottam Lal Dhingra v. Union of India, [1958] SCR\n828; followed.\n 3. The fact that due to some oversight on the part of\nappointing authority or to other fortuitous circumstance the\norder placing the appellants on probation was not passed for\nlong would not give any special advantage to the\npetitioners, (respondents) who were themselves drawn from a\nlower service and even if they held a substantive post in\nsuch service, they cannot by virtue of promotion to the\nhigher service af ter the appellants, claim seniority over\nthe latter. [266E-F]\n 4. \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution have not been\nviolated because a person who is appointed to a higher\nservice carrying a higher scale must r ordinarily be deemed\nto be senior to an employee who is promoted from a lower\nservice to the higher service even though his appointment\nmay have been substantive in the lower service. [266 F-G]\n Kewal Krihsan Bagga v. The Chairman Railway Board and\nOrs., [1976] 4 S.C.C. p. 733; followed.\n 5. In the absence of any provision in the order dated\n2-11-64 either applying or continuing the Rules of 1945 even\nin respect of the inter-se seniority of members of each\nmerging service, which was also passed under \nArt. 309\n of the\nConstitution and was therefore of a statutory character or\nat any rate had a statutory flavour, the Rules of 1945 could\nnot be applied to the situation obtaining after 2-11-64.\n[268G-H]\n 6. The Directions in the order dated 18-12-68 strike a\njust balance between the officers of erstwhile services\nafter they were merge into the New Services. Direction (b)\nof order dt. 18-12-68 regarding fixation of seniority does\nnot speak of any substantive appointment whatsoever but\nequates the\n257\nofficers appointed to PMS I on permanent or temporary basis\nprior to the merger. In other words, the direction\ncontemplates that any officer appointed to a post whether\npermanent or temporary in PMS I which was the Senior Service\nprior to merger, would rank after merger above those\nofficers who were drawn from PMS II. [271B, C, G]\n 7. The 1945 Rules did not apply to the New Service at\nits inception and what they were made applicable to the new\nservice only for a shortwhile by virtue of the order dated\n20th February 1965, purely on a provisional basis as the\nGovernment made it quite clear in that order itself that the\n1945 Rules will apply 'unless otherwise ordered' and thus\nhad reserved the right to pass final orders regarding\nseniority later which was done in 1968. [271D-E]\n 8. Direction (b) of the order dt. 18-12-68 is not\ninconsistent with Rule 18 of the 1945 Rules. Having regard\nto the history of PMS I and PMS II, if Rule 18 of the 1945\nRules were applied to the parties and the 1968 order\nignored, the resultant effect would be that equals and\nunequals would be treated similarly which would amount to a\ndirect infraction of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\nThe appellants and the petitioners were not similarly\nsituate and if the petitioners were put above the appellants\nin the matter of seniority, it would have resulted in a\ngross and wholly unreasonable discrimination by making\njunior officers senior to superior officers. This is clear\nfrom the following propositions: D\n (i) To begin with, the Rules of 1945 had absolutely no\n application to the new Service. Those Rules\n applied to the old PMS I Service only and,\n therefore, to a situation completely different\n from 'hat which prevailed after the merger of the\n two Services on 1-11-1964. As the Government order\n merging the two Services was also an order passed\n under \nArt. 309\n of the Constitution, it had\n statutory force and was binding on all the\n officers of the new Service.\n (ii) At the time when the 1964 order was passed the\n Government deliberately did not frame any rules in\n order to determine the inter se seniority of the\n members of the new Service but reserved the right\n to do so.\n (iii) It was under the order dated February 20, 1965\n that for the first time the Rules of 1945 were\n applied to the new Service and that too \"unless\n otherwise ordered\" i.e., purely on a provisional\n basis. The order of 1968 laid down the principles\n for fixing seniority and, being a statutory order,\n superseded all the Rules in question including\n Rules 17 and 18 of the 1945 Rules. It was further\n confirmed by the order dated 18-12-1971. [273G-H,\n 274A-E, 275D]"

Sub-rule\n(2) of Rule 17 empowered the Governor to make temporary or\nofficiating appointments in vacancies from amongst persons\nwho were eligible for permanent appointments to the Service\nunder these Rules. We might mention here that the combined\neffect of Rules 12, 13, 15 and 17 is that whereas in the\ncase of direct recruitment, the matter was to be considered\nby the Public Service Commission after advertising the\nvacancies, so far as recruitment to the Service by promotion\nis concerned, a Selection Committee constituted under the\nRules had to send the lists to the Commission. In a third\ncategory of cases which were appointments made purely on a\ntemporary or officiating basis there was no provision for\nreference either to a Selection Committee or the Commission\nand such appointments could be made by the Governor. This is\nrather important because while the High Court had laid very\ngreat emphasis on the fact that appellants I to 8 were\nappointed not in substantive vacancies but on a purely\ntemporary basis, it cannot be contended by any show of force\nthat the appointment of the appellants, who were admittedly\ndirect recruits, could be made under Rule 17(2). The\nadmitted position is that the direct recruits applied to the\nGovernment in pursuance of an advertisement and they were\nappointed to the Senior Service only after they were\nrecommended by the Public Service Commission. The\nappointment of the appellants, therefore, was not a purely\nofficiating, temporary or Gd hoc appointment as contemplated\nby Rule 17(2) (supra). We might also emphasis the fact at\nthis stage that it is undisputed that the petitioners while\nbeing members of PSMS had also applied for promotion to the\nSenior Service sometime in the year 1963 but their cases\nwere not recommended by the Selection Committee at all. We\nshall, however, deal with this aspect of the matter at a\nlater stage of this judgment. Rule 18 is the provision which\nlays down the criterion for determining seniority and may be\nextracted thus, because the High Court has strongly relied\non this provision\n \"18. Seniority\n Seniority in the Service shall be determined by\n the date of order of appointment in a substantive\n vacancy, provided that if two or more candidates are\n appointed on the same date their seniority shall be\n determined according to the order in which their names\n are mentioned in the order of appointment.\""

In other words, what the direction contemplates is\nthat any officer appointed to a post whether permanent or\ntemporary in PMS I which was the Senior Service prior to\nmerger, would rank after merger above those officers who\nwere drawn from PMS II. That the appellants fulfilled all\nthe conditions mentioned in direction (b) is not disputed\nbut the constitutionality of that direction was challenged\nbefore the High Court on the ground that it was inconsistent\nwith Rule 18 of the 1945 Rules. This contention found favour\nwith the High Court which held that direction (b) was\ninvalid as being inconsistent with the Rules of 1945. In\ncoming to this finding, the High Court appears to have\noverlooked the fact that the 1945. Rules did not apply to\nthe new Service at its inception and that they were made\napplicable to the new Service only for a short while by\nvirtue of the order dated 20th February 1965, purely on a\nprovisional basis as the Government made it quite clear in\nthat order itself that the 1945 Rules will apply 'unless\notherwise ordered' and thus had reserved the right to pass\nfinal orders regarding seniority later which was done in\n1968. In these circumstances, therefore, the order of the\nHigh Court suffers from two infirmities-"
