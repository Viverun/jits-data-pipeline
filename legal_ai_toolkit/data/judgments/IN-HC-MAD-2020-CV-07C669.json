The writ petitioners state that they are working as\n\nMuzdoor Grade-I in Public Works Department and had completed\n\nmore than 28 years of service. The Government issued various\n\nGovernment Orders granting the benefit of regularization to the\n\ndaily rated employees and temporary employees working in the\n\nPublic Works Department. However, the benefit of the said\n\nGovernment Order is not extended to the writ petitioners and still\n\nthey are continuing as Mazdoors, on daily wages basis. Recently,\n\nthe Government passed an order enhancing the salary of of the\n\nMazdoors, equivalent to the scale of pay fixed for the post of\n\nSweepers in the Government Departments along with Dearness\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nAllowance in G.O.(Ms).No.233, Public Works (C2) Department,\n\ndated 06.12.2019.\n\n3. The learned counsel for the petitioners articulated the case\n\nof the writ petitioners by stating that engagement of daily wage\n\nemployees and allowing them to continue on temporary basis for\n\nlong years is an exploitation. Thus, the grievances of the\n\npetitioners are to be redressed by regularizing their services in the\n\nsanctioned post, in the regular time scale of pay. The petitioners\n\nare in verge of retirement. Therefore, only by granting the benefit\n\nof regularization, they will be in a position to receive the pension\n\nand pensionary benefits. Many changes occurred regarding the\n\nengagement of daily rated employees / NMRs in Public Works\n\nDepartment. Many such temporary employees were regularized in\n\nthe sanctioned post and working as regular employees. However,\n\nanother set of people are denied the benefit of regularization,\n\nwithout any valid reason.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners solicited the\n\nattention of this Court with reference to the Judgments wherein\n\nsuch engagements are considered as exploitation and the relief was\n\nalso granted. However, some of the Judgments in relation to the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\norders of the Inspector of Labour or under the\nTamil Nadu\n\nIndustrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to\n\nWorkmen) Act\n, this Court is of the considered opinion that those\n\nLabour Law may not have direct application with reference to the\n\nappointments made in public services in Government Departments.\n\nThe Service Rules in Government Departments are independent\n\nand the Industrial or Labour Laws are not applicable to the\n\nappointments made in Government services. When the posts are\n\ngoverned under the Special Rules, the said Rules alone will prevail\n\nover the General Law. In other words, the Special Rules for a\n\nparticular post or the Recruitment Rules for a particular post in a\n\nGovernment alone will prevail over in General Laws, including the\n\nLabour Law or Industrial Law.\n\n5. This being the principles, the application of the\nTamil Nadu\n\nIndustrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to\n\nWorkmen) Act\n, cannot be applied in the present case, as the\n\npetitioners are engaged in the Department of Public Works to\n\nperform the Government work. The Government undoubtedly\n\npassed several orders periodically granting the benefit of\n\nregularization and permanent absorption. Certain conditions were\n\nimposed for grant of regularization and permanent absorption.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nInitially, the Government issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and\n\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006 and the\n\nsaid Government Order was withdrawn and a revised order was\n\npassed in G.O.(Ms).No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n\n(F) Department, dated 27.06.2013. As per the said G.O.Ms.No.74,\n\ncertain conditions were stipulated for grant of benefit of\n\nregularization.\n\n6. Beyond all these Government Orders, the Constitutional\n\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, settled the legal\n\nprinciples in the matter of grant of regularization and permanent\n\nabsorption.\nIn the case of\nUmadevi Vs. State of Karnataka\n\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC (1), the Constitution Bench in\n\nunequivocable terms held that regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption cannot be granted in violation of Service Rules in force.\n\nThe very practice of engaging the temporary employees and\n\nconsidering their length of services granting regularization or\n\npermanent absorption is opposed to Constitutional Principles.\n\nThus, the Constitution Bench in\nUmadevi\ncase settled the legal\n\nprinciples in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption\n\nand in para 54 of the Judgment, more specifically, held that all\n\nother judgments, including the Judgments of Supreme Court\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nrendered earlier in the matter of regularization and permanent\n\nabsorption denuded to loose its status as precedent.\n\nThus, the\n\nConstitution Bench Judgment in\nUmadevi\ncase is the guiding\n\nprinciples to be followed by all the Courts and Government across\n\nthe Country for grant of regularization and permanent absorption,\n\nwith reference to the temporary appointments made.\n\n7. In this context, it is relevant to look in to the subsequent\n\nJudgments of the Supreme Court and in the subsequent Judgments,\n\nwhere the relief of regularization is granted must be only based on\n\nsome facts and circumstances and such Judgments of the Two\n\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cannot be considered\n\nas precedent so as to dilute the legal principles settled by the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\nUmadevi. When the cases fall under the principles settled by the\n\nConstitution Bench, then, the decision is to be rendered based on\n\nthe Constitution Bench Judgment and no other Judgment can be\n\nconsidered as the binding precedents.\n\n8. The learned counsel for the writ petitioners made a\n\nsubmission that it is the duty mandatory on the part of the\n\nrespondents to consider the case of the writ petitioners for\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nregularisation in the existing vacancies since the writ petitioners\n\nhave put in more than 28 years of their services as daily wage\n\nemployees and their names are registered under the Nominal\n\nMuster Roll maintained by the respondents. It is not the case of\n\nappointment of the writ petitioners but the case of their\n\nregularisation is the contention of the writ petitioners. When the\n\nemployees have completed 10 years of their services, without the\n\nintervention of any Court order then their services to be\n\nregularised as per paragraph 53 of the Constitution Bench\n\njudgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of India, in the case of\n\nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n[(2006) 4 SCC 1], laid down\n\nthe legal principles in the matter of regularisation, permanent\n\nabsorption. The relevant Paragraph 53 of the judgment, cited\n\nsupra, is extracted hereunder:-\n\n“53.One aspect needs to be clarified.\n\nThere may be cases where irregular\nappointments (not illegal appointments) as\nexplained in S.V. Narayanappa [(1967) 1\nSCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\nNanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2\nSCR 799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC\n507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937]\nand referred to in para 15 above, of duly\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nqualified persons in duly sanctioned vacant\nposts might have been made and the\nemployees have continued to work for ten\nyears or more but without the intervention\nof orders of the courts or of tribunals. The\nquestion of regularisation of the services of\nsuch employees may have to be considered\non merits in the light of the principles\nsettled by this Court in the cases\nabovereferred to and in the light of this\njudgment. In that context, the Union of\nIndia, the State Governments and their\ninstrumentalities should take steps to\nregularise as a one-time measure, the\nservices of such irregularly appointed, who\nhave worked for ten years or more in duly\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of\norders of the courts or of tribunals and\nshould further ensure that regular\nrecruitments are undertaken to fill those\nvacant sanctioned posts that require to be\nfilled up, in cases where temporary\nemployees or daily wagers are being now\nemployed. The process must be set in\nmotion within six months from this date. We\nalso clarify that regularisation, if any\nalready made, but not sub judice, need not\nbe reopened based on this judgment, but\nthere should be no further bypassing of the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nconstitutional requirement and regularising\nor making permanent, those not duly\nappointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n9. The writ petitioners, though admit the fact that their\n\nappointment was irregular, contended that their appointments are\n\nnot illegal and therefore their services ought to have been\n\nregularised in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nof India.\n\n10. Further, it is contended that the right to life is a\n\nFundamental Right enshrined in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, time and again,\n\nreiterated and emphasised that the right to life cannot be\n\ninterpreted as a mere animal life and it is a decent life, which is to\n\nbe ensured. The writ petitioners are deprived of their livelihood in\n\nview of the denial of regularisation which amounts to deprivation of\n\ntheir life. At the outset, it is stated that the writ petitioners have\n\nworked for 10 years or more and without the intervention of\n\norders of the courts or of tribunals. In other words, the State\n\nGovernments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\n\nregularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nappointed, who have worked for ten years or more in duly\n\nsanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of the courts or of\n\ntribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments are\n\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\n\nfilled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are\n\nbeing now employed. The appointments of such employee should\n\nnot be illegal. Even if irregular, where the appointments are not\n\nmade against the sanctioned posts. Where a person employed\n\nunder the open competitive process of prescribed qualifications and\n\nwas working against the sanctioned posts, he had been selected\n\nwithout undergoing the open competitive process, such\n\nappointments are considered to be irregular.\n\n11. Mooting out the above two principles, the learned counsel\n\nfor the writ petitioners urged this Court by stating that in respect\n\nof the irregular appointments, there is no bar for granting\n\nregularisation. But the learned counsel is of the opinion that the\n\nillegal appointments alone, cannot be regularised. As far as the\n\nirregular appointments are concerned, the length of service is to be\n\ntaken into account for the purpose of granting regularisation.\n\nAccordingly, the writ petitioners are entitled for regularisation in\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nview of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, cited\n\nsupra.\n\n12. The learned Additional Government Pleader, appearing\n\non behalf of the respondents, submit that the writ petitioners were\n\nengaged as casual labourers for certain specific works under the\n\nprovisions of paragraph 290 of T.N.PWA Code which is in\n\nconnection with the execution of work. The writ petitioners have\n\nnot been accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ\n\npetitioners were not engaged in connection with any affairs of the\n\nState Government. The Hon'ble High Court of Madras had already\n\nheld that PWD is not an industry to involve the Industrial\n\nEstablishment Rules. Further, it is submitted that the writ\n\npetitioners have not been appointed in sanctioned posts. The writ\n\npetitioners were engaged only to execute certain special and\n\nspecified works on daily wage basis and therefore, the benefit of\n\nregularisation, cannot be granted.\n\n13. Further, it is submitted that in Government Offices, there\n\nare specified sanction as to the category of post, number of such\n\nposts, scale of pay etc., and the method of recruitment to the posts\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nare defined by statutory rules such as Tamil Nadu State and\n\nSubordinate Service Rules and no deviation is permitted from the\n\nmethod of recruitment, howsoever, save the previous approval of\n\nthe Government.\n\n14. Paragraph 290 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Account Code\n\nspecifies that with the following exceptions, all persons engaged\n\ndepartmentally for the execution of works are considered as day\n\nlabourers and their wages should be drawn on Muster Rolls, Form\n\n21 (C.Form Nos.474 and 475) and charged to the estimates of the\n\nworks on which they are employed:-\n\n(i) Permanent and temporary employees of the division whose\n\npay is charged to the head 'Establishment';\n\n(ii) Members of the works charged establishment as defined\n\nin paragraphs 58 to 62 of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department\n\nCode.\n\n15. Thus, the above two categories only form part of the\n\nestablishment concerning with the PWD Office in the State and the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nrecruitment to the posts are made in accordance with the rules of\n\nthe different services codified in Tamil Nadu Service Manual\n\nVolume I to III and therefore, the writ petitioners were engaged as\n\ncasual labourers for the purpose of specified nature of work to\n\nwhich an estimate is got sanctioned as per Tamil Nadu Public\n\nWorks Department Code, to the extent necessary.\n\n16. Paragraph 290 of the TNPWD Code states that for the\n\nwork done by daily labour, the subordinate incharge of the work\n\nwill prepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on\n\nwhen practicable the work done and the amount payable.\n\n17. As the writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\n\nfor a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\n\ncasual labour virtually stopped as and when the work is completed.\n\nThe engagement was not made on daily wage basis or not made on\n\nany Service Rules. Thus, the question of regularisation of\n\npetitioners' NMR services do not arise.\n\n18. The learned Additional Government Pleader for the\n\nrespondents, further stated that paragraphs 6(i), (ii), (vi), (vii), (ix)\n\nof Government Order No.74, Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n\n(F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, the Government have ordered\n\nthat\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“6(i) This order shall be deemed to\nhave been come into force with retrospective\neffect from 1.1.2006;\n\n6(ii) The services of the full time daily\nwage employees, who were initially\nappointed on full time basis in consultation\nwith the Employment Exchange, to\ndischarge the function of the post in the\nTamil Nadu Basic Service and completed 10\n(ten) years of service as on 1.1.2006 shall be\nregularised against regular vacancies in the\nsanctioned cadre strength; Further, in\nparagraph 6(ii), it is stated that the service\nof the full time daily wage employees who\nwere initially appointed on full time basis in\nconsultation with the Employment Exchange\nto discharge the function of the post in the\nTamil Nadu Basic Service and completed ten\nyears of service as on 1.1.2006 shall be\nregularised against regular vacancies in the\nsanctioned cadre strength;\n\n6(vi) The part-time and casual\nemployees are not entitled to the concession\nreferred to at paragraph (ii) above;\n\n6(vii) The services of the full time daily\nwage employees, who have completed 10\nyears of service, after 1.1.2006, shall not be\nregularised;\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n6(ix) Stipulates that all the proposals\nfor regularisation of the services of full time\ndaily wages employees should be sent to the\nGovernment even in case where relaxation\nof rules are not involved”.\n\n19. Whereas the writ petitioners in these writ petitions have\n\nnot completed 10 years of service as on 1.1.2006 by daily wage\n\nbasis. But, the writ petitioners were not appointed in consultation\n\nwith the Employment Exchange as daily wagers. The Government\n\nOrders issued with regard to the regularisation of Contingent Staff\n\nto regular servants are only on completion of 10 years of\n\ncontinuous service as contingent servants. Thus, the question of\n\nregularisation of service of the writ petitioners do not arise.\n\n20. In this regard, this Court delivered a judgment in WP No.\n\n41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 regarding NMR case as follows:-\n\n“The petitioner produced a Certificate\nissued by one Assistant Engineer\nWRO/Public Works Department, Irrigation\nSection, Vadakkankulam to the effect that\nhas been working as NMR from 1.6.1992. It\nis also not stated whether pursuant to any\norder, the petitioner has been working on\nthe contrary, the petitioner's claim was that\nthey should be absorbed by reglarising her\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nservice. It is also admitted that she was not\nrouted through Employment Exchange and\nthe G.O.Ms.No.177, dated 4.6.1998, does\nnot ensure to the benefit.\n\nThe Supreme Court in\nSecretary, State\nof Karnataka vs. Umadevi\n, reported in\n(2006) 4 SCC 1, has held that regularisation\ncannot be a method of recruitment unless\nthe petitioner has the case for absorption.\n\nAs per the orders of the Government in the\nOriginal Application (later converted into\nthe writ petition) the relief claimed by the\npetitioner, cannot be countenanced by this\nCourt. Hence, the writ petition stands\ndismissed.”\n\n21. It is further submitted by the learned Additional\n\nGovernment Pleader for the respondents that the related issue was\n\ndealt with by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal\n\nNos.2726-2729 of 2014 and referred the case between State of\n\nKarnataka and others vs. Uma Devi and others in AIR 2006\n\nSC 1806, held as under:-\n\n“There is no fundamental right in those\nwho have been employed on daily wages or\ntemporarily or on contractual basis, to claim\nthat they have a right to be absorbed in\nservice. As has been held by this Court, they\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\ncannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a\nregular appointment could be made only by\nmaking appointments consistent with the\nrequirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. The right to be treated equally\nwith the other employees employed on daily\nwages, cannot be extended to a claim for\nequal treatment with those who were\nregularly employed. That would be treating\nunequals as equals. It cannot also be relied on\nto claim a right to be absorbed in service even\nthough they have never been selected in\nterms of the relevant recruitment rules.”\n\n22. The learned Additional Government Pleader also referred\n\nto the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court case in\nState of\n\nRajasthan and others vs. V.Dayal Lal and Others\n[AIR 2011\n\nSC 1193] held as under:-\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising\npower under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\nwill not issue directions for regularisation,\nabsorption or permanent continuance,\nunless the employees claiming\nregularisation had been appointed in\npursuance of a regular recruitment in\naccordance with relevant rules in an open\ncompetitive process, against sanctioned\nvacant posts. The equality clause contained\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nin\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be\nscrupulously followed and Courts should\nnot issue a direction for regularisation of\nservices of an employee which would be\nviolative of the constitutional scheme.\nWhile something that is irregular for want\nof compliance with one of the elements in\nthe process of selection which does not go\nto the root of the process, can be\nregularised, back door entries,\nappointments contrary to the constitutional\nscheme and/or appointment of ineligible\ncandidates cannot be regularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a\ntemporary or ad hoc or daily-wage\nemployee, under cover of some interim\norders of the Court, would not confer upon\nhim any right to be absorbed into service,\nas such service would be “litigious\nemployment”. Even temporary, ad hoc or\ndaily-wage service for a long number of\nyears, let alone service for one or two\nyears, will not entitle such employee to\nclaim regularisation, if he is not working\nagainst a sanctioned post. Sympathy and\nsentiment cannot be grounds for passing\nany order of regularisation in the absence\nof a legal right.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is\nformulated for regularisation with a cut-off\ndate (that is a scheme providing that\npersons who had put in a specified number\nof years of service and continuing in\nemployment as on the cut-off date), it is not\npossible to others who were appointed\nsubsequent to the cut-off date, to claim or\ncontend that the scheme should be applied\nto them by extending the cut-off date or\nseek a direction for framing of fresh\nschemes providing for successive cut-off\ndates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not\nentitled to seek regularisation as they are\nnot working against any sanctioned posts.\n\nThere cannot be a direction for absorption,\nregularisation or permanent continuance of\npart-time temporary employees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in\ngovernment-run institutions cannot claim\nparity in salary with regular employees of\nthe Government on the principle of equal\npay for equal work. Nor can employees in\nprivate employment, even if serving full\ntime, seek parity in salary with government\nemployees. The right to claim a particular\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nsalary against the State must arise under a\ncontract or under a statute.”\n\nBased on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, cited supra,\n\nCodal Rules and Government orders, the claim of the writ\n\npetitioners cannot be considered.\n\n23. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\n\nsubmitted that paragraph 290 of TNPWD Code states that “for\n\nwork done by daily labour the subordinate incharge of the work will\n\nprepare a Muster or Casual Labour Roll recording there on when\n\npracticable the work done and the amount payable”. The writ\n\npetitioners were engaged as casual labour for a specified work and\n\nthat necessity for engagement of such casual labour virtually\n\nstopped as and when the work is completed. The writ petitioners\n\nhave not been accommodated in any sanctioned posts. The writ\n\npetitioners cannot claim any right for this casual labour work.\n\n24. The learned Additional Government Pleader further\n\nsubmitted that as per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\n\nDepartment dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\n\nDepartment, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court in W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.\n\n2726-2729 of 2014, dated 21.2.2014 judgment, cited supra, the\n\nclaim of the writ petitioners cannot be considered.\n\n25. The writ petitioners were not employed in connection\n\nwith the affairs of the State as defined in\nArticle 323-A\nof the\n\nConstitution of India and they were only casual labourers co-\n\nterminus with the purposeful completion of the work concerned as\n\nper the Acts and the Rules, in which such provision for the\n\ndeployment of casual labour is made. Thus, the writ petitioners are\n\nestopped from invoking the lofty jurisdiction of this Apex Forum\n\noutside the ambit of the constitutional provisions.\n\n26. At the outset, the grounds relied on by the learned\n\nAdditional Government Pleader, appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondents, are enumerated as under:-\n\n(i) The engagement of casual labour and payment made by\n\nway of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\n\nChapter X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n\n291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n(ii) The casual labourers thus engaged for a particular work\n\ncannot be regularised how so ever in any manner, without sanction\n\nof the post, scale of pay etc., by the Government;\n\n(iii) The writ petitioners were not employed in connection\n\nwith the affairs of the State as defined in\nArticle 323-A\nof the\n\nConstitution of India and the writ petitioners were only casual\n\nlabourers co-terminus with the purposeful completion of the works\n\nconcerned as per the Acts and the Rules in which such provisions\n\nfor the deployment of casual labour is made;\n\n(iv) The engagement of casual labourers and payment made\n\nby way of wages from part and parcel of the work accounts vide\n\nChamber X-B and in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 290 and\n\n291 of TNPWA Code, exclusively for the execution of works;\n\n(v) As per Code Rules, G.O.Ms.No.12, Public Works (C2)\n\nDepartment, dated 20.1.2009, G.O.Ms.No.338, Finance (Pay Cell)\n\nDepartment, dated 26.8.2010, G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and\n\nAdministrative Reforms (F) Department, dated 27.6.2013, this\n\nCourt in W.P.No.41594 of 2006 dated 3.1.2011 judgment and the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Civil Appeal No.\n\n2726-2729 of 2014 dated 21.2.2014, judgment cited supra, the\n\nclaim of the writ petitioners cannot be considered;\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n(vi) The Government have issued orders in G.O.Ms.No.680,\n\nPublic Works (C2) Department, dated 16.8.1995 for complete ban\n\non appointing new Nominal Muster Rolls, which is already in force.\n\nIn this regard, D.O.Letter No.26860/C2/2009-2 dated 15.10.2009\n\nreceived from the Principal Secretary to Government, PWD,\n\nChennai, is submitted for perusal. Thus, the Article quoted in the\n\napplication, cannot be correlated with the affairs of the State;\n\n(vii) The writ petitioners were not borne on any cadre\n\nstrength of the erstwhile work charged establishment (now\n\namended in Tamil Nadu Engineering Subordinate Service) and the\n\nservice and the writ petitioners were not connected with the affairs\n\nof the State Government;\n\n(viii) The writ petitioners were engaged as casual labourers\n\nfor a specified work and that necessity for engagement of such\n\ncasual labourers virtually stopped as and when the work was\n\ncompleted. In view of the above, the claim of the writ petitioners\n\ncannot be considered.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n27. Considering the arguments advanced both by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners as well as the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents, this Court has to first consider the factual matrix\n\ninvolved in these writ petitions on hand. The writ petitioners,\n\nundoubtedly, were appointed as daily wage employees in the year\n\n2003 and they are continued in service for more than ten years, is\n\nthe claim set out in these writ petitions. However, pursuant to the\n\nJudgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nof India in the case of\nThe State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi\n,\n\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 [herein after referred to as\n\n“Umadevi Case”], one time benefit was granted by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India in Paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n28. Even before\nthe said judgment\n, the State of Tamil Nadu\n\nissued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (F)\n\nDepartment, dated 28.02.2006. As per the said Government Order,\n\nthe temporary employees who have completed ten years of service\n\nas on the date of the Government Order can be regularised. Even\n\nprior to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the\n\nGovernment issued G.O.Ms.No.22, Personnel and Administrative\n\nReforms (F) Department, dated 28.02.2006, granting the benefit of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\none time regularization in respect of the temporary employees who\n\nhave completed ten years of service as on 28.02.2006. Thus, the\n\nState was extending the benefit of regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption to the temporary/daily rated employees who have\n\ncompleted ten years of service as on 28.02.2006.\n\n29. Pursuant to the said Government order, large number of\n\ntemporary employees were conferred with the benefit of\n\nregularization and based on that, the writ petitioner also raised his\n\nclaim for regularization. However, after the Constitution Bench\n\njudgment rendered in “Umadevi Case”, the State Government\n\nissued G.O.Ms.No.74, Personnel and Administrative Department,\n\ndated 27.06.2013. In the above said G.O.Ms.No.74, the\n\nGovernment have imposed certain conditions and those conditions\n\nare akin to that of the recruitment rules in force. The very idea of\n\nissuing G.O.Ms.No.74, is to provide certain restricted concession to\n\nthe temporary employees who were otherwise appointed by\n\nfollowing the recruitment rules in force. Therefore, the prospectus\n\nof the large number of employees who have served on daily wage\n\nbasis are prevented from getting their regularization. In other\n\nwords, the said G.O.Ms.No.74 prescribes certain conditions and\n\nrestrictions for regularization and for granting permanent\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nabsorption. Thus, the persons who are eligible to be regularized\n\nunder G.O.Ms.No.22, are prevented from getting the benefit from\n\nand out of the said Government order and G.O.Ms.No.74, imposes\n\ncertain restrictions.\n\n30. Thus, the learned counsel brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt that in the similar circumstances, the learned Single Judge of\n\nthis Court dealt with the issues in W.P.No.29346 of 2014 &\n\netc.,batch and delivered a judgment on 22.09.2017, setting aside\n\nthe said G.O.Ms.No.74, in respect of extending the same with\n\nretrospective effect. In other words, the implementation of the\n\nGovernment orders was restricted only prospectively and\n\naccordingly, the relief of regularization was granted to those writ\n\npetitioners.\n\n31. The learned Additional Government Pleader brought to\n\nthe notice of this Court that the State preferred Writ Appeals in\n\nW.A.Sr.No.89134/17 in W.P.29346/14, W.A.Sr.No.89136/17 in\n\nW.P.No. 7594/14, W.A.Sr. No.89142/17 in W.P.No.15668/14,\n\nW.A.Sr.No.89143/17 in W.P. No.13545/14,W.A.Sr.No. 89138/17 in\n\nW.P.No.29212/14 on 13.11.2017, against\nthe said judgment\nand the\n\nsame is pending.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n32. Thus, this Court has to consider the issues independently\n\nand based on the judgments of the Apex Court of India in the\n\nmatter of regularization and permanent absorption. However, the\n\nlearned Additional Government Pleader brought to the notice of\n\nthis Court that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court passed an\n\norder in the batch of Writ Appeals in W.A.No.2911 of 2012 and etc.,\n\nbatch on 10.07.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench has\n\nconsidered the terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 and\n\npassed an order stating that the services shall not be disturbed in\n\nthe light of the Government Order passed in G.O.Ms.No.74,\n\nPersonnel and Administrative Reforms Department dated\n\n27.06.2013 as well as the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India in Civil Appeal Nos.2726-2729 of 2014 with Nos.\n\n2730-31 of 2014.\n\n33. The Additional Government Pleader is of the opinion that\n\nthe terms and conditions imposed in G.O.Ms.No.74 had already\n\nbeen taken note of by the Hon'ble Division Bench and the entire\n\nGovernment Order was upheld and the direction was issued to pass\n\norders in the light of the G.O.Ms.No.74 and therefore, the judgment\n\ndelivered by the learned Single Judge, need not be relied upon and\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nmore so, the State also preferred writ appeals against the said\n\norders.\n\n34. Under these circumstances, this Court has to consider the\n\nissues independently based on the judgments of the Apex Court of\n\nIndia.\n\n35. The authoritative judgment in the subject of\n\nregularization and permanent absorption is the judgment of the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\n“Umadevi Case”. All other subsequent judgments cited by the\n\nrespective counsels are by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n\nSupreme Court of India. Thus, the binding nature of the judgments\n\nrendered in respect of other cases has to be cogently read and\n\nharmoniously interpreted based on the legal principles settled by\n\nthe Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n36. Before considering the subject of regularization and\n\npermanent absorption, this Court has to consider the interpretation\n\nof the judgments on “binding nature” or “binding precedent” . In\n\nview of the fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner has cited\n\nnumber of judgments, which were passed subsequent to the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nConstitution Bench judgment, stating that Paragraph (53) of the\n\n“Umadevi Case” has been interpreted in different ways and under\n\ndifferent circumstances and the present case is also to be\n\nconsidered and a direction to be issued for regularization. In view\n\nof the fact that large number of judgments are cited before this\n\nCourt in the matter of regularization and permanent absorption,\n\nnow, this Court has to first decide what all are the judgments which\n\nall are having a “binding precedent” and on this reason, this Court\n\nhas to consider very interpretation of the concept regarding\n\n“binding precedent”.\nIn respect of judgments in relation to the\n\ninterpretation of “binding precedent”, this Court is inclined to\n\nconsider the very recent judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in the case of\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi\n\nand Others\n, reported in JT 2017 (10) SC 450. It is pertinent to\n\nnote that it is a judgment by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India headed by His Lordship, Hon'ble Chief\n\nJustice of India, Dipak Misra.CJI,. The Hon'ble Chief Justice of\n\nIndia delivered this judgment and it is relevant to quote paragraphs\n\n(15 to 26):\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n16. Presently, we may refer to certain decisions which\ndeal with the concept of binding precedent.\n\n17.\nIn\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\nalias Kalika\nSingh and others [JT (2003) (4) SC 489], it has\nbeen held:-\n\n“10. … an earlier decision may seem to be incorrect to a\nBench of a coordinate jurisdiction considering the\nquestion later, on the ground that a possible aspect of\nthe matter was not considered or not raised before the\ncourt or more aspects should have been gone into by\nthe court deciding the matter earlier but it would not be\na reason to say that the decision was rendered per\nincuriam and liable to be ignored. The earlier judgment\nmay seem to be not correct yet it will have the binding\neffect on the later Bench of coordinate jurisdiction. …”\n\n17.1.The Court has further ruled:-\n\n“10. … Easy course of saying that earlier decision was\nrendered per incuriam is not permissible and the\nmatter will have to be resolved only in two ways —\neither to follow the earlier decision or refer the matter\nto a larger Bench to examine the issue, in case it is felt\nthat earlier decision is not correct on merits.”\n\n18. In G.L. Batra v. State of Haryana and others\n(2014) 13 SCC 759), the Court has accepted the said\nprinciple on the basis of judgments of this Court\nrendered in Union of India v. Godfrey Philips India\nLtd. (1985) 4 SCC 369), Sundarjas Kanyalal Bhatija\nv. Collector, Thane, Maharashtra (1989) 3 SCC\n\n396)and Tribhovandas Purshottamdas Thakkar v.\n\nRatilal Motilal Patel (AIR 1968 SC 372). It may be\nnoted here that the Constitution Bench in\nMadras Bar\nAssociation v. Union of India and another\n[JT\n2015(5)SC 33]has clearly stated that the prior\nConstitution Bench judgment in\nUnion of India v.\nMadras Bar Association [JT\n2010 (5) SC 553]is a\nbinding precedent.\nBe it clarified, the issues that were\nput to rest in the earlier Constitution Bench judgment\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n37. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia, while dealing with the cases of accident claims, has\n\nelaborately discussed about the “binding precedent”. The case in\n\nrelation to the Motor Accident Claims, the case of “Sarla Verma”\n\nwas being followed by all the Courts across the Country for the\n\npurpose of awarding compensation. When the question arosed that\n\nthe “binding nature” of the said case of “Sarla Verma” delivered\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Constitution Bench\n\nheaded by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India held that the principles\n\nlaid down in\nthe case of “\nVirayya v. Venkata Subbayya”\n, it has\n\nbeen held by the Andhra Pradesh High Court that under the\n\ncircumstances aforesaid the Bench is free to adopt that view which\n\nis in accordance with justice and legal principles after taking into\n\nconsideration the views expressed in the two conflicting Benches, it\n\nis further held that in the case of\nState of Bihar v. Kalika Kuer\n\nalias Kalika Singh and others, reported in [JT (2003) 4 SC\n\n489], held that the earlier judgment may seem to be not correct\n\nyet it will have the binding effect on the later Bench of coordinate\n\njurisdiction.\n\nTheir Lordships rendered the case of\nChandra\n\nPrakash and others v. State of U.P. and another\n, reported in\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n[JT 2002 (3) SC 493], held that the doctrine of binding precedent\n\nis of utmost importance in the administration of our judicial system.\n\nIt promotes certainty and consistency in judicial decisions. Judicial\n\nconsistency promotes confidence in the system, therefore, there is\n\nthis need for consistency in the enunciation of legal principles in\n\nthe decisions of this Court.\n\n38. By enumerating the legal principle in this regard, the\n\nApex Court of India held that the judgment by the Larger Bench of\n\nthe Courts are to be treated as “binding precedent”, while deciding\n\nthe legal principles involved in the particular case.\n\n39. Another Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India in the case of Padma Sundara Rao and Others Vs.\n\nState of Tamil Nadu and others, reported in (2002) 3 SCC\n\n533, and the relevant paragraph (9) of the Judgment is extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\n“9. Courts should not place reliance on decisions\nwithout discussing as to how the factual situation fits in\nwith the fact situation of the decision on which reliance\nis placed. There is always peril in treating the words of\na speech or judgment as though they are words in a\nlegislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\njudicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts\nof a particular case, said Lord Morris in Herrington v.\nBritish Railways Board [(1972) 2 WLR 537 : 1972 AC\n877 (HL) [Sub nom British Railways Board v.\n\nHerrington, (1972) 1 All ER 749 (HL)]] . Circumstantial\nflexibility, one additional or different fact may make a\nworld of difference between conclusions in two cases.”\n\n40. In view of the legal principle settled in the matter of\n\n“binding precedent”, now, this Court is bound by the legal\n\nprinciples settled by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India in the “Umadevi Case”. Admittedly, there\n\nis no other subsequent Constitution Bench judgment in respect of\n\nthe subject of regularization and permanent absorption. The last\n\njudgment rendered by the Constitution Bench in the subject matter\n\nis “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the legal principles settled by the\n\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case” are of “binding precedent”\n\nor to be followed as “binding precedent”. Thus, the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present writ petition has to be considered only\n\nin the light of the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench.\n\nAll other judgments subsequently passed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India may have certain distinctions far and against.\n\nHowever, these judgments are to be interpreted only based on the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nfacts and circumstances prevailing in that particular case and\n\ntherefore, this Court cannot consider those judgments delivered on\n\na particular facts in relation to that particular case. However, the\n\nlegal principles are to be considered in relation to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present case on hand.\n\n41. Let us look into the basic principles enunciated by the\n\nConstitution Bench in the matter of regularization and permanent\n\nabsorption. Paragraph (5) of the “Umadevi Case” is extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\n“5. This Court has also on occasions issued directions\nwhich could not be said to be consistent with the\nconstitutional scheme of public employment. Such\ndirections are issued presumably on the basis of\nequitable considerations or individualisation of justice.\nThe question arises, equity to whom? Equity for the\nhandful of people who have approached the court with a\nclaim, or equity for the teeming millions of this country\nseeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for\ncompeting for employment? When one side of the coin\nis considered, the other side of the coin has also to be\nconsidered and the way open to any court of law or\njustice, is to adhere to the law as laid down by the\nConstitution and not to make directions, which at times,\neven if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\ncertainly tend to water down the constitutional\nrequirements. It is this conflict that is reflected in these\ncases referred to the Constitution Bench”\n\n42. This Court wants to look into the very findings made by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above said paragraph\n\n(5), the Apex Court has conceded that the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nof India had also on occasions, issued directions, which could not\n\nbe said to be consistent with the Constitutional schemes of public\n\nemployment. Such directions are issued presumably on the basis of\n\nequitable considerations or individualisation of justice. The\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India raised a question that equity to\n\nwhom? Equity for the handful of people who have approached the\n\nCourt with the claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this\n\nCountry seeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for\n\ncompeting for employment? When one side of the coin is\n\nconsidered, the other side of the coin has also to be considered and\n\nthe way open to any Court of law or justice, is to adhere to the law\n\nas laid down by the Constitution and not to make directions, which\n\nat times, even if do not run counter to the constitutional scheme,\n\ncertainly tend to water down the constitutional requirements. It is\n\nthis Conflict that reflected in these cases referred to the\n\nConstitution Bench.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n43. This Court is able to vitualize the strong concern\n\nrecorded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The concern\n\nraised by the Constitution Bench is that by granting relief to a\n\nhandful of people, the large sector of meritorious youth of this\n\ngreat nation cannot be deprived of their constitutional rights.\n\nUnder this pretext, the Constitution Bench commenced its\n\nconsideration in “Umadevi Case”. Thus, the very enumeration in\n\nthe above paragraph is crystal clear that the Constitution Bench\n\nhas laid down the principle in the matter of regularization and\n\npermanent absorption and the idea of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nof India has to stop the practice of appointing employees, through\n\nback door on extraneous consideration by showing favoritism and\n\nnepotism.\n\n44.Further, Paragraph (10) of the “Umadevi Case” is\n\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“10. When these matters came up before a Bench of\ntwo Judges, the learned Judges referred the cases to a\nBench of three Judges. The order of reference is\nreported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(1)\n[(2004) 7 SCC 132 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 935 : (2003) 9\nScale 187] . This Court noticed that in the matter of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nregularisation of ad hoc employees, there were\nconflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this\nCourt and by two-Judge Benches and hence the\nquestion required to be considered by a larger Bench.\nWhen the matters came up before a three-Judge Bench,\nthe Bench in turn felt that the matter required\nconsideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the\nconflict and in the light of the arguments raised by the\nAdditional Solicitor General.\n\nThe order of reference is\nreported in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(2)\n[(2006) 4 SCC 44 : (2003) 10 Scale 388] . It appears to\nbe proper to quote that order of reference at this stage.\nIt reads: (SCC p. 45, paras 1-5)\n\n“1.\n\nApart from the conflicting opinions between the\nthree-Judge Bench decisions in\nAshwani Kumar v.

On the other hand, Mr M.C. Bhandare, learned\nSenior Counsel, appearing for the employees urged that\nsuch a scheme for regularisation is consistent with the\nprovisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n3. Mr V. Lakshmi Narayan, learned counsel appearing in\nCCs Nos. 109-498 of 2003, has filed the GO dated\n19-7-2002 and submitted that the orders have already\nbeen implemented.\n\n4. After having found that there is conflict of opinion\nbetween the three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court,\nwe are of the view that these cases are required to be\nheard by a Bench of five learned Judges.\n\n5. Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the\nChief Justice for appropriate orders.”\n\nWe are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue\nhere. We have to lay down the law. We have to approach\nthe question as a constitutional court should.”\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n45. The above said Paragraph (10), stipulates that there were\n\nconflicting decisions by three-Judge Benches of this Court and by\n\ntwo-Judge Benches of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and\n\ntherefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has considered that\n\nthe question required to be considered by a larger Bench. It is\n\nfurther observed that when the matters came up before a three-\n\nJudge Bench, the Bench in turn felt that the matter required\n\nconsideration by a Constitution Bench in view of the conflict and in\n\nthe light of the arguments raised by the Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral. In the reference made by the Hon'ble three-Judge Bench\n\nitself decided that the scheme for regularisation is repugnant to\n\nArticles 16(4)\n, 309\n, 320\nand\nof the Constitution and, therefore,\n\nthese cases are required to be heard by a Bench of five learned\n\nJudges(Constitution Bench).\n\n46. In paragraph (11) of the “Umadevi Case”, it is stated\n\nthat in addition to the equality clause represented by\nArticle 14\nof\n\nthe Constitution,\nArticle 16\nhas specifically provided for equality of\n\nopportunity in matters of public employment. Buttressing these\n\nfundamental rights,\nArticle 309\nprovides that subject to the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution, Acts of the legislature may regulate\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nthe recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to\n\npublic services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union\n\nor of a State.\n\n47. In view of the interpretation placed on\nArticle 12\nof the\n\nConstitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also govern\n\nthe instrumentalities that come within the purview of\nArticle 12\nof\n\nthe Constitution. With a view to make the procedure for selection\n\nfair, the Constitution by\nArticle 315\nhas also created a Public\n\nService Commission for the Union and the Public Service\n\nCommissions for the States.\nArticle 320\ndeals with the functions of\n\nthe Public Service Commissions and mandates consultation with\n\nthe Commission on all matters relating to methods of recruitment\n\nto civil services and for civil posts and other related matters. As a\n\npart of the affirmative action recognised by\nArticle 16\nof the\n\nConstitution,\nArticle 335\nprovides for special consideration in the\n\nmatter of claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and\n\nScheduled Tribes for employment.\n\n48.Further, Paragraph (12) of the“Umadevi Case” reads as\n\nfollows:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“12. In spite of this scheme, there may be\noccasions when the sovereign State or its\ninstrumentalities will have to employ persons, in\nposts which are temporary, on daily wages, as\nadditional hands or taking them in without\nfollowing the required procedure, to discharge\nthe duties in respect of the posts that are\nsanctioned and that are required to be filled in\nterms of the relevant procedure established by\nthe Constitution or for work in temporary posts\nor projects that are not needed permanently.\nThis right of the Union or of the State\nGovernment cannot but be recognised and there\nis nothing in the Constitution which prohibits\nsuch engaging of persons temporarily or on\ndaily wages, to meet the needs of the situation.\nBut the fact that such engagements are resorted\nto, cannot be used to defeat the very scheme of\npublic employment. Nor can a court say that the\nUnion or the State Governments do not have the\nright to engage persons in various capacities for\na duration or until the work in a particular\nproject is completed. Once this right of the\nGovernment is recognised and the mandate of\nthe constitutional requirement for public\nemployment is respected, there cannot be much\ndifficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nordinarily not proper for the Courts whether\nacting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution or\nunder\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to direct\nabsorption in permanent employment of those\nwho have been engaged without following a due\nprocess of selection as envisaged by the\nconstitutional scheme.”\n\n49. The spirit of Paragraph (12) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\njudgment is that the temporary engagements like daily wage\n\nappointments, consolidated pay appointments and temporary\n\nappointments and engagements are resorted to, cannot be used to\n\ndefeat the very scheme of public employment. Nor can a Court say\n\nthat the Union or the State Governments do not have the right to\n\nengage persons in various capacities for a duration or until the\n\nwork in a particular project is completed. Once this right of the\n\nGovernment is recognised and the mandate of the constitutional\n\nrequirement for public employment is respected, there cannot be\n\nmuch difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it is ordinarily not\n\nproper for the Courts, whether acting under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution or under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, to direct\n\nabsorption in permanent employment of those who have been\n\nengaged without following a due process of selection as envisaged\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nby the constitutional scheme. Thus, it is made clear by the\n\nConstitutional Bench that regular recruitment rules in force,\n\nfollowed scrupulously by the competent authorities and\n\nengagements on temporary basis cannot be resorted or the same\n\ncannot lead to permanent absorption or regularization. Further, it\n\nis stated that the Government is entitled to appoint the persons on\n\ndaily wages/consolidated pay/temporary basis, if a Government is\n\nof the opinion that a project has to be implemented or a special\n\nworks to be carried out, then they are at liberty to do so, by\n\nengaging the temporary employees. Such being the concept\n\naccepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, no doubt, a mere\n\nappointment on temporary/daily wage basis cannot constitute a\n\nright for the employees to claim regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption.\n\n50. Further, Paragraph (13) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13. What is sought to be pitted against\nthis approach, is the so-called equity\narising out of giving of temporary\nemployment or engagement on daily\nwages and the continuance of such\npersons in the engaged work for a certain\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nlength of time. Such considerations can\nhave only a limited role to play, when\nevery qualified citizen has a right to\napply for appointment, the adoption of\nthe concept of rule of law and the scheme\nof the Constitution for appointment to\nposts. It cannot also be forgotten that it is\nnot the role of the courts to ignore,\nencourage or approve appointments\nmade or engagements given outside the\nconstitutional scheme. In effect, orders\nbased on such sentiments or approach\nwould result in perpetuating illegalities\nand in the jettisoning of the scheme of\npublic employment adopted by us while\nadopting the Constitution. The approving\nof such acts also results in depriving\nmany of their opportunity to compete for\npublic employment. We have, therefore,\nto consider the question objectively and\nbased on the constitutional and statutory\nprovisions.\nIn this context, we have also\nto bear in mind the exposition of law by a\nConstitution Bench in\nState of Punjab v.\nJagdip Singh\n[(1964) 4 SCR 964 : AIR\n1964 SC 521] . It was held therein: (SCR\npp. 971-72)\n“In our opinion where a government\nservant has no right to a post or to a\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nparticular status, though an authority\nunder the Government acting beyond its\ncompetence had purported to give that\nperson a status which it was not entitled\nto give he will not in law be deemed to\nhave been validly appointed to the post\nor given the particular status.”\n\n51. This Court cannot omit the powerful statement made by\n\nthe Constitution Bench in respect of providing equal opportunity\n\nand in respect of implementing the equality clause enshrined under\n\nArticle 14\n\n& 16\nof the Constitution. In the above said paragraph\n\n(13), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has emphasized that it\n\ncannot also be forgotten that it is not the role of the Courts to\n\nignore, encourage or approve appointments made or engagements\n\ngiven outside the constitutional scheme. In effect, orders based on\n\nsuch sentiments or approach would result in perpetuating\n\nillegalities and in the jettisoning of the scheme of public\n\nemployment adopted by us, while adopting the Constitution. We,\n\nthe people of India, while adopting the Constitution.\n\n52. The approving of such acts also results in depriving many\n\nof their opportunity to compete for public employment. The\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nConstitution Bench of “Umadevi Case”, considered the proposition\n\nof law\nlaid down by\nthe previous Constitution Bench in the case of\n\nState of Punjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, reported in [AIR (1964) SC\n\n521].\n\nThe earlier Constitution Bench in the case of\nState of\n\nPunjab Vs. Jagdip Singh\n, held that where a Government Servant\n\nhas no right to a post or to a particular status, though an authority\n\nunder the Government acting beyond its competence had purported\n\nto give that person a status which it was not entitled to give he will\n\nnot in law be deemed to have been validly appointed to the post or\n\ngiven the particular status.\n\n53. In paragraph (14) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has elaborately discussed about\n\nvarious orders of the Courts either interim orders or final orders\n\nwhich were brought to the notice of the Constitution Bench. The\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India came to the conclusion that those\n\norders more or less was the issue of directions for continuation or\n\nabsorption without referring to the legal position obtaining. It was\n\nbrought to the notice of this Court that chaos has been created by\n\nsuch orders without reference to the legal principles and it is time\n\nthat this Court settled the law once and for all so that in case the\n\nCourt finds that such orders should not be made, the Courts,\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nespecially, the High Courts would be precluded from issuing such\n\ndirections or passing such orders.\n\n54. The very arguments advanced by the learned counsel for\n\nthe State of Karnataka is that a chaos was created on account of\n\nvarious contradicting orders passed by the High Courts in the\n\nmatter of regularization or permanent absorption in order to settle\n\nthe legal principles. The learned counsel urged the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India to take note of the fact that there is a chaos\n\nprevailing in respect of the regularization and permanent\n\nabsorption of the temporary/daily wages employees and brought to\n\nthe notice of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the High\n\nCourts would be precluded from issuing any such directions or\n\npassing such orders in contrary to the legal principles in the\n\nmatters of regularization or permanent absorption or appointment.\n\nThe observation made in this regard is that bypassing of the\n\nConstitutional scheme cannot be perpetuated by the passing of\n\norders without dealing with and deciding the validity of such orders\n\non the touchstone of Constitutionality.\n\n55. Let us come to paragraph (20) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\njudgment which is extracted hereunder:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“20. The decision in Dharwad Distt.\nPWD Literate\nDaily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka\n\n[(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12\nATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] dealt with a scheme\nframed by the State of Karnataka, though at the\ninstance of the Court. The scheme was essentially\nrelating to the application of the concept of equal pay\nfor equal work but it also provided for making\npermanent, or what it called regularisation, without\nkeeping the distinction in mind, of employees who had\nbeen appointed ad hoc, casually, temporarily or on\ndaily-wage basis. In other words, employees who had\nbeen appointed without following the procedure\nestablished by law for such appointments. This Court,\nat the threshold, stated that it should individualise\njustice to suit a given situation. With respect, it is not\npossible to accept the statement, unqualified as it\nappears to be. This Court is not only the constitutional\ncourt, it is also the highest court in the country, the\nfinal court of appeal. By virtue of\nArticle 141\nof the\nConstitution, what this Court lays down is the law of the\nland. Its decisions are binding on all the courts. Its main\nrole is to interpret the constitutional and other\nstatutory provisions bearing in mind the fundamental\nphilosophy of the Constitution. We have given unto\nourselves a system of governance by rule of law. The\nrole of the Supreme Court is to render justice according\nto law. As one jurist put it, the Supreme Court is\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nexpected to decide questions of law for the country and\nnot to decide individual cases without reference to such\nprinciples of law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders\nnot consistent with its own decisions on law, is bound to\nsend out confusing signals and usher in judicial chaos.\nIts role, therefore, is really to interpret the law and\ndecide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders\nwhich are inconsistent with the legal conclusions\narrived at by the court in the selfsame judgment not\nonly create confusion but also tend to usher in\narbitrariness highlighting the statement, that equity\ntends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.”\n\n56. The decision in the case of Dharwad Distt.\nPWD\n\nLiterate Daily Wage Employees Assn. Vs. State of Karnataka\n,\n\nreported in (1990) 2 SCC 396, was considered in the above\n\nparagraph. It is observed that the role of the Court to interpret the\n\nlaw and decide cases coming before it, according to law. Orders\n\nwhich are inconsistent with the legal conclusions arrived at by the\n\nCourt in the self same judgment not only create confusion but also\n\ntend to usher in arbitrariness highlighting the statement, that\n\nequity tends to vary with the Chancellor's foot.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n57. As one Jurist put it, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n\nhas accepted the decision, the question of law for the country and\n\nnot to decide individual cases without reference to such principles\n\nof law. Consistency is a virtue. Passing orders not consistent with\n\nits own decisions on law, is bound to send out confusing signals and\n\nresult in judicial chaos. The observation made in this regard are\n\ncertainly to be followed by all the Courts across the Country.\n\n58.\nIn paragraph (40) of the Judgment, the Apex Court\n\nreferred the spirit of\nKesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala\n,\n\nreported in (1973) 4 SCC 225, the Court held that\nArticle 14\n\n&\nwhich was described as a facet of\nArticle 14\nis part of the basic\n\nstructure of the Constitution.\n\nIn the case of\nIndra Sawhney Vs.\n\nUnion of India\n, reported in (2000) 1 SCC 168\n,\nthe said decision\n\nwas reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the legislature could\n\ntransgress the basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the\n\nprinciple of equality enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof which\nArticle 16(1)\n\nis a facet.\n\n59.\nIn paragraph (41), the earlier decision in the above said\n\ncase of\nIndra Sawhney Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (2000)\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n1 SCC 168, it is held that equality and equal opportunity is a basis\n\nfeature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant position of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution in the scheme of things.\n\n60. The judgment of the another Constitution Bench in the\n\ncase of\nD.C.Wadhwa(Dr.) Vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in\n\n(1987) 1 SCC 378 and the relevant paragraph (3) is extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\n“3.The rule of law constitutes the core of our\nConstitution and it is the essence of the rule of law\nthat the exercise of the power by the State whether it\nbe the legislature or the executive or any other\nauthority should be within the constitutional\nlimitations and if any practice is adopted by the\nexecutive which is in flagrant and systematic violation\nof its constitutional limitations, Petitioner 1 as a\nmember of the public would have sufficient interest to\nchallenge such practice by filing a writ petition and it\nwould be the constitutional duty of this Court to\nentertain the writ petition and adjudicate upon the\nvalidity of such practice”\n\n61. Let us now look into the way in which the Constitution\n\nBench has arrived the conclusion in the matter of regularization\n\nand permanent absorption in “Umadevi Case” and the relevant\n\nparagraphs (43) to (50), which all are extracted hereunder:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of\nequality in public employment is a basic feature of our\nConstitution and since the rule of law is the core of our\nConstitution, a court would certainly be disabled from\npassing an order upholding a violation of\nArticle 14\nor\nin ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with\nthe requirements of\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticle 16\nof\nthe Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme\nfor public employment, this Court while laying down\nthe law, has necessarily to hold that unless the\nappointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a\nproper competition among qualified persons, the same\nwould not confer any right on the appointee. If it is a\ncontractual appointment, the appointment comes to an\nend at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement\nor appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\nsame would come to an end when it is discontinued.\nSimilarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be\nmade permanent on the expiry of his term of\nappointment. It has also to be clarified that merely\nbecause a temporary employee or a casual wage\nworker is continued for a time beyond the term of his\nappointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in\nregular service or made permanent, merely on the\nstrength of such continuance, if the original\nappointment was not made by following a due process\nof selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not\nopen to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the\ninstance of temporary employees whose period of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nemployment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees\nwho by the very nature of their appointment, do not\nacquire any right. The High Courts acting under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue\ndirections for absorption, regularisation, or permanent\ncontinuance unless the recruitment itself was made\nregularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.\n\nMerely because an employee had continued under\ncover of an order of the court, which we have described\nas “litigious employment” in the earlier part of the\njudgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be\nabsorbed or made permanent in the service. In fact, in\nsuch cases, the High Court may not be justified in\nissuing interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately\nthe employee approaching it is found entitled to relief,\nit may be possible for it to mould the relief in such a\nmanner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to\nhim, whereas an interim direction to continue his\nemployment would hold up the regular procedure for\nselection or impose on the State the burden of paying\nan employee who is really not required. The courts\nmust be careful in ensuring that they do not interfere\nunduly with the economic arrangement of its affairs by\nthe State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the\ninstruments to facilitate the bypassing of the\nconstitutional and statutory mandates.\n\n44. The concept of “equal pay for equal work” is\ndifferent from the concept of conferring permanency on\nthose who have been appointed on ad hoc basis,\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\ntemporary basis, or based on no process of selection as\nenvisaged by the rules. This Court has in various\ndecisions applied the principle of equal pay for equal\nwork and has laid down the parameters for the\napplication of that principle. The decisions are rested\non the concept of equality enshrined in our Constitution\nin the light of the directive principles in that behalf. But\nthe acceptance of that principle cannot lead to a\nposition where the court could direct that appointments\nmade without following the due procedure established\nby law, be deemed permanent or issue directions to\ntreat them as permanent. Doing so, would be negation\nof the principle of equality of opportunity. The power to\nmake an order as is necessary for doing complete\njustice in any cause or matter pending before this\nCourt, would not normally be used for giving the go-by\nto the procedure established by law in the matter of\npublic employment. Take the situation arising in the\ncases before us from the State of Karnataka. Therein,\nafter Dharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC\n(L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] the\nGovernment had issued repeated directions and\nmandatory orders that no temporary or ad hoc\nemployment or engagement be given. Some of the\nauthorities and departments had ignored those\ndirections or defied those directions and had continued\nto give employment, specifically interdicted by the\norders issued by the executive. Some of the appointing\nofficers have even been punished for their defiance. It\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nwould not be just or proper to pass an order in exercise\nof jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nor 32 of the\nConstitution or in exercise of power under\nArticle 142\n\nof the Constitution permitting those persons engaged,\nto be absorbed or to be made permanent, based on\ntheir appointments or engagements. Complete justice\nwould be justice according to law and though it would\nbe open to this Court to mould the relief, this Court\nwould not grant a relief which would amount to\nperpetuating an illegality.\n\n45. While directing that appointments, temporary\nor casual, be regularised or made permanent, the\ncourts are swayed by the fact that the person\nconcerned has worked for some time and in some cases\nfor a considerable length of time. It is not as if the\nperson who accepts an engagement either temporary or\ncasual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his\nemployment. He accepts the employment with open\neyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to\nbargain—not at arm's length—since he might have been\nsearching for some employment so as to eke out his\nlivelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that\nground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the\nconstitutional scheme of appointment and to take the\nview that a person who has temporarily or casually got\nemployed should be directed to be continued\npermanently. By doing so, it will be creating another\nmode of public appointment which is not permissible. If\nthe court were to void a contractual employment of this\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nnature on the ground that the parties were not having\nequal bargaining power, that too would not enable the\ncourt to grant any relief to that employee. A total\nembargo on such casual or temporary employment is\nnot possible, given the exigencies of administration and\nif imposed, would only mean that some people who at\nleast get employment temporarily, contractually or\ncasually, would not be getting even that employment\nwhen securing of such employment brings at least some\nsuccour to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our\nvast country are in search of employment and one is not\ncompelled to accept a casual or temporary employment\nif one is not inclined to go in for such an employment. It\nis in that context that one has to proceed on the basis\nthat the employment was accepted fully knowing the\nnature of it and the consequences flowing from it. In\nother words, even while accepting the employment, the\nperson concerned knows the nature of his employment.\nIt is not an appointment to a post in the real sense of\nthe term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\nwhich he is temporarily employed or the interest in that\npost cannot be considered to be of such a magnitude as\nto enable the giving up of the procedure established,\nfor making regular appointments to available posts in\nthe services of the State. The argument that since one\nhas been working for some time in the post, it will not\nbe just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of\nthe nature of the employment when he first took it up,\nis not one that would enable the jettisoning of the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nprocedure established by law for public employment\nand would have to fail when tested on the touchstone of\nconstitutionality and equality of opportunity enshrined\nin\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n46. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the\nrespondents argued that on the basis of the doctrine of\nlegitimate expectation, the employees, especially of the\nCommercial Taxes Department, should be directed to\nbe regularised since the decisions in Dharwad [(1990) 2\nSCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 :\n\n(1990) 1 SCR 544] , Piara Singh [(1992) 4 SCC 118 :\n\n1992 SCC (L&S) 825 : (1992) 21 ATC 403 : (\n1992) 3\nSCR 826] , Jacob [Jacob M. Puthuparambil v. Kerala\nWater Authority\n, (1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S)\n25 : (\n1991) 15 ATC 697] and Gujarat Agricultural\nUniversity [Gujarat Agricultural University v. Rathod\nLabhu Bechar\n, (2001) 3 SCC 574 : 2001 SCC (L&S)\n613] and the like, have given rise to an expectation in\nthem that their services would also be regularised. The\ndoctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\nadministrative authority affect the person by depriving\nhim of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he\nhad in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to\nenjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be\npermitted to continue to do until there have been\ncommunicated to him some rational grounds for\nwithdrawing it on which he has been given an\nopportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received\nassurance from the decision-maker that they will not be\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nwithdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of\nadvancing reasons for contending that they should not\nbe withdrawn.\n\n[See Lord Diplock in Council for Civil\nServices Union v. Minister of Civil Service [1985 AC\n374 : (1984) 3 All ER 935 : (\n1984) 3 WLR 1174 (HL)] ,\nNational Buildings Construction Corpn. v. S.\nRaghunathan\n[(1998) 7 SCC 66 : 1998 SCC (L&S)\n1770] and Chanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of Rajasthan\n[(2003) 3 SCC 485 : 2003 SCC (L&S) 322] .] There is no\ncase that any assurance was given by the Government\nor the department concerned while making the\nappointment on daily wages that the status conferred\non him will not be withdrawn until some rational reason\ncomes into existence for withdrawing it. The very\nengagement was against the constitutional scheme.\n\nThough, the Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes\nDepartment sought to get the appointments made\npermanent, there is no case that at the time of\nappointment any promise was held out. No such\npromise could also have been held out in view of the\ncirculars and directives issued by the Government after\nDharwad decision [(1990) 2 SCC 396 : 1990 SCC (L&S)\n274 : (1990) 12 ATC 902 : (1990) 1 SCR 544] . Though,\nthere is a case that the State had made regularisations\nin the past of similarly situated employees, the fact\nremains that such regularisations were done only\npursuant to judicial directions, either of the\nAdministrative Tribunal or of the High Court and in\nsome cases by this Court. Moreover, the invocation of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nthe doctrine of legitimate expectation cannot enable the\nemployees to claim that they must be made permanent\nor they must be regularised in the service though they\nhad not been selected in terms of the rules for\nappointment. The fact that in certain cases the court\nhad directed regularisation of the employees involved\nin those cases cannot be made use of to found a claim\nbased on legitimate expectation. The argument if\naccepted would also run counter to the constitutional\nmandate. The argument in that behalf has therefore to\nbe rejected.\n\n47. When a person enters a temporary\nemployment or gets engagement as a contractual or\ncasual worker and the engagement is not based on a\nproper selection as recognised by the relevant rules or\nprocedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual in\nnature. Such a person cannot invoke the theory of\nlegitimate expectation for being confirmed in the post\nwhen an appointment to the post could be made only by\nfollowing a proper procedure for selection and in cases\nconcerned, in consultation with the Public Service\nCommission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate\nexpectation cannot be successfully advanced by\ntemporary, contractual or casual employees. It cannot\nalso be held that the State has held out any promise\nwhile engaging these persons either to continue them\nwhere they are or to make them permanent. The State\ncannot constitutionally make such a promise. It is also\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nobvious that the theory cannot be invoked to seek a\npositive relief of being made permanent in the post.\n\n48. It was then contended that the rights of the\nemployees thus appointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution, are violated. It is stated that the State\nhas treated the employees unfairly by employing them\non less than minimum wages and extracting work from\nthem for a pretty long period in comparison with those\ndirectly recruited who are getting more wages or\nsalaries for doing similar work. The employees before\nus were engaged on daily wages in the department\nconcerned on a wage that was made known to them.\nThere is no case that the wage agreed upon was not\nbeing paid. Those who are working on daily wages\nformed a class by themselves, they cannot claim that\nthey are discriminated as against those who have been\nregularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.\nNo right can be founded on an employment on daily\nwages to claim that such employee should be treated on\na par with a regularly recruited candidate, and made\npermanent in employment, even assuming that the\nprinciple could be invoked for claiming equal wages for\nequal work. There is no fundamental right in those who\nhave been employed on daily wages or temporarily or\non contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to\nbe absorbed in service. As has been held by this Court,\nthey cannot be said to be holders of a post, since, a\nregular appointment could be made only by making\nappointments consistent with the requirements of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The right to be\ntreated equally with the other employees employed on\ndaily wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal\ntreatment with those who were regularly employed.\nThat would be treating unequals as equals. It cannot\nalso be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in\nservice even though they have never been selected in\nterms of the relevant recruitment rules. The arguments\nbased on\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution are\ntherefore overruled.\n\n49. It is contended that the State action in not\nregularising the employees was not fair within the\nframework of the rule of law. The rule of law compels\nthe State to make appointments as envisaged by the\nConstitution and in the manner we have indicated\nearlier. In most of these cases, no doubt, the employees\nhad worked for some length of time but this has also\nbeen brought about by the pendency of proceedings in\ntribunals and courts initiated at the instance of the\nemployees. Moreover, accepting an argument of this\nnature would mean that the State would be permitted\nto perpetuate an illegality in the matter of public\nemployment and that would be a negation of the\nconstitutional scheme adopted by us, the people of\nIndia. It is therefore not possible to accept the\nargument that there must be a direction to make\npermanent all the persons employed on daily wages.\nWhen the court is approached for relief by way of a\nwrit, the court has necessarily to ask itself whether the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nperson before it had any legal right to be enforced.\nConsidered in the light of the very clear constitutional\nscheme, it cannot be said that the employees have been\nable to establish a legal right to be made permanent\neven though they have never been appointed in terms\nof the relevant rules or in adherence of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n50. It is argued that in a country like India where\nthere is so much poverty and unemployment and there\nis no equality of bargaining power, the action of the\nState in not making the employees permanent, would\nbe violative of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. But the\nvery argument indicates that there are so many waiting\nfor employment and an equal opportunity for competing\nfor employment and it is in that context that the\nConstitution as one of its basic features, has included\n\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nso as to ensure that public\nemployment is given only in a fair and equitable\nmanner by giving all those who are qualified, an\nopportunity to seek employment. In the guise of\nupholding rights under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a\nset of persons cannot be preferred over a vast majority\nof people waiting for an opportunity to compete for\nState employment. The acceptance of the argument on\nbehalf of the respondents would really negate the rights\nof the others conferred by\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution, assuming that we are in a position to hold\nthat the right to employment is also a right coming\nwithin the purview of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. The\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nargument that\nArticle 23\nof the Constitution is breached\nbecause the employment on daily wages amounts to\nforced labour, cannot be accepted. After all, the\nemployees accepted the employment at their own\nvolition and with eyes open as to the nature of their\nemployment. The Governments also revised the\nminimum wages payable from time to time in the light\nof all relevant circumstances. It also appears to us that\nimporting of these theories to defeat the basic\nrequirement of public employment would defeat the\nconstitutional scheme and the constitutional goal of\nequality.”\n\n62. In paragraph (43), it is clear that adherence to the rule\n\nof equality in public employment is a basic feature of our\n\nConstitution when it is clarified that adherence to the rule of\n\nequality in public employment is a basic feature of the Constitution,\n\ncertainly, no person can deviate the principles in this regard and\n\ntherefore, appointment in accordance with the recruitment rules in\n\nforce by the competent authorities is the constitutional mandate\n\nand any deviation to be construed as violation of the constitutional\n\nprinciples. It is observed that if it is a contractual appointment, the\n\nappointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were\n\nan engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nsame would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly\n\ntemporary employee could not claim to be made permanent on the\n\nexpiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that\n\nmerely because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is\n\ncontinued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would\n\nnot be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made\n\nappointment, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the\n\noriginal appointment was not made by following a due process of\n\nselection as envisaged by the relevant rules.\n\n63. It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment\n\nat the instance of temporary employees whose period of\n\nemployment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the\n\nvery nature of their appointment do not acquire any right. The\n\nHigh Courts acting under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution, should\n\nnot ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularization, or\n\npermanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made\n\nregularly and in terms of constitutional scheme.\n\n64. The spirit of Paragraph (43) is applicable to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present writ petition on hand. In the present\n\nwrit petition, the writ petitioners were appointed on daily wage\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nbasis as Nominal Muster Rolls employees. The mere continuance\n\nor the length of service rendered alone cannot be a ground for\n\ngranting the relief of regularization. Thus, the very legal principles\n\nsettled by the Constitution Bench has to be fit in with the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present writ petition. Further, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India deals with the “litigious employment”. Of\n\ncourse, the situation does not arise in the present case. The\n\ninterim order of Status Quo granted by this Court has not been\n\nproperly implemented by reinstating the petitioners in service and\n\nthe Contempt petition filed by the writ petitioners were also posted\n\nalong with the writ petition for final disposal. Thus, the concept of\n\n“litigious employment” would not arise in respect of the present\n\nwrit petition. Therefore, the petitioners have not continued in\n\nservice by virtue of the interim order of Status Quo granted by this\n\nCourt. However, their services were ousted, after filing of the writ\n\npetition.\n\n65. Paragraph (44) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment deals\n\nwith the concept of “equal pay for equal work”. Thus, it may not be\n\nrequired to elaborate the paragraph as far as the present case on\n\nhand is concerned.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n66. Paragraph (45) of the above said judgment states that the\n\nApex Court of India held that, while directing that appointments,\n\ntemporary or casual, be regularized or made permanent, the Courts\n\nare swayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for\n\nsome time and in some cases for a considerable length of time. It is\n\nnot as if the person who accepts an engagement either temporary\n\nor casual in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment.\n\nHe accepts the employment with open eyes. It may be true that he\n\nis not in a position to bargain- not at arm's length – Since he might\n\nhave been searching for some employment so as to eke out his\n\nlivelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground alone,\n\nit would not be appropriate to jettison the constitutional scheme of\n\nappointment and to take the view that a person who has\n\ntemporarily or casually got employed should be directed to be\n\ncontinued permanently. By doing so, it will be creating another\n\nmode of public appointment which is not permissible. A total\n\nembargo of such casual or temporary employment is not possible,\n\ngiven the exigencies of administration and if imposed, would only\n\nmean that some people who at least get employment temporarily,\n\ncontractually or casually, would not be getting even that\n\nemployment when securing of such employment brings at least\n\nsome succour to them.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n67. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast country are in\n\nsearch of employment and one is not compelled to accept a casual\n\nor temporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such an\n\nemployment. It is in this context that one has to proceed on the\n\nbasis that the employment was accepted fully knowing the nature\n\nof it and the consequences flowing from it. In other words, even\n\nwhile accepting the employment, the person concerned knows the\n\nnature of his employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the\n\nreal sense of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in\n\nwhich he is temporarily employed or the interest in that post\n\ncannot be considered to be of such a magnitude, so as to enable the\n\ngiving up of the procedure established, for making regular\n\nappointments to available posts in the services of the State.\n\n68. In Paragraph (46) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment,\n\ntheir Lordships held that the invocation of the doctrine of\n\nlegitimate expectation cannot enable the employees to claim that\n\nthey must be made permanent or they must be regularised in the\n\nservice though they had not been selected in terms of the rules for\n\nappointment. The fact that in certain cases the court had directed\n\nregularization of the employees involved in those cases cannot be\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nmade use of, to found a claim based on legitimate expectation. The\n\nargument if accepted would also run counter to the constitutional\n\nmandate. The argument in that behalf has therefore to be rejected.\n\n69. Paragraph (47) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment\n\nenumerates that when a person enters a temporary employment or\n\ngets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the\n\nengagement is not based on a proper selection as recognised by the\n\nrelevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the consequences of the\n\nappointment being temporary, casual or contractual in nature.\n\nSuch a person cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation\n\nfor being confirmed in the post when an appointment to the post\n\ncould be made only by following a proper procedure for selection\n\nand in cases concerned, in consultation with the Public Service\n\nCommission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation\n\ncannot be successfully advanced by temporary, contractual or\n\ncasual employees.\n\n70. In paragraph (48) of the “Umadevi Case” Judgment, the\n\nConstitution Bench considered the right of the employees thus\n\nappointed, under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, are\n\nviolated. Even in “Umadevi Case”, those employees before the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nSupreme Court of India were engaged on daily wages in the\n\ndepartment concerned on a daily wage that was made known to\n\nthem. There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not being\n\npaid. Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by\n\nthemselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as\n\nagainst those who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the\n\nrelevant rules. No right can be founded on an employment on daily\n\nwages to claim that such employee should be treated on par with a\n\nregularly recruited candidate, and made permanent in employment,\n\neven assuming that the principle could be invoked for claiming\n\nequal wages for equal work. There is no fundamental right for\n\nthose who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on\n\ncontractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in\n\nservice. As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be\n\nholders of a post, since, a regular appointment could be made only\n\nby making appointments consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n71. In paragraph (49), it is ruled that the rule of law compels\n\nthe State to make appointments as envisaged by the Constitution\n\nand in the manner we have indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India in the judgment of “Umadevi Case”. When the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nCourt is approached by way of a writ, the Court has necessarily to\n\nask itself whether the person before it had any legal right to be\n\nenforced. Even, the Constitution Bench dealt with the\nArticle 21\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India, in a Country like India, where there is so\n\nmuch poverty and unemployment and there is no equality of\n\nbargaining power, the action of the State in not making the\n\nemployees permanent, would be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution. But the very argument indicates that there are so\n\nmany waiting for employment and an equal opportunity for\n\ncompeting for employment and it is in that context, the Constitution\n\nas one of its basic features, has included Articles 14,16 and 309 so\n\nas to ensure that public employment is given only in a fair and\n\nequitable manner by giving all those who are qualified, an\n\nopportunity to seek employment. In the guise of upholding rights\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, a set of persons cannot be\n\npreferred over a vast majority of people waiting for an opportunity\n\nto compete for State employment.\n\n72. Now, let us look into the important paragraph urged by\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner, i.e., paragraph (53) of the\n\nJudgment of “Umadevi Case”.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nParagraph (53) of the Judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may\nbe cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\nappointments) as explained in S.V. Narayanappa\n[(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC 1071] , R.N.\nNanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972) 2 SCR 799]\nand B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC\n(L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937] and referred to in para 15\nabove, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\nvacant posts might have been made and the employees\nhave continued to work for ten years or more but\nwithout the intervention of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\nof such employees may have to be considered on merits\nin the light of the principles settled by this Court in the\ncases abovereferred to and in the light of this\njudgment. In that context, the Union of India, the State\nGovernments and their instrumentalities should take\nsteps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services\nof such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten\nyears or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should\nfurther ensure that regular recruitments are\nundertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that\nrequire to be filled up, in cases where temporary\nemployees or daily wagers are being now employed.\nThe process must be set in motion within six months\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nfrom this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any\nalready made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened\nbased on this judgment, but there should be no further\nbypassing of the constitutional requirement and\nregularising or making permanent, those not duly\nappointed as per the constitutional scheme.”\n\n73. The above said paragraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case”\n\nis a one time relief, of Course, granted by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India to mitigate the hardship, if any, caused to the\n\ntemporary employees. Now, the question arises how long the\n\nbenefit granted under paragraph (53) can be extended to the\n\nemployees and what is the interpretation of the subsequent\n\njudgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in respect of\n\nparagraph (53) of the judgment of the Constitution Bench.\n\n74. No doubt, the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India, while stopping the entire irregular appointments\n\nand back door appointments had taken note of the fact that certain\n\nreliefs are required in respect of the employees who are already\n\nregularized or in respect of those persons, a proposal is already\n\nkept pending. Certainly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India have\n\nnever intended to grant the relief of regularization or permanent\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nabsorption in public employment contrary to the legal principles\n\nsettled in earlier paragraphs. Thus, paragraph (53) of the\n\njudgment has to be understood harmoniously and together with the\n\nlegal principles settled by the Constitution Bench in earlier\n\nparagraphs.\n\n75. Thus, this Court is of an undoubted opinion that\n\nparagraph (53) of the “Umadevi Case” judgment cannot be\n\ntreated as an isolation and it should be considered along with the\n\nother legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench. Keeping in\n\nmind, the legal principles settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in earlier paragraphs, this Court is of the opinion that one\n\ntime relief granted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has to be\n\nextended in its real sense and the High Courts cannot travel\n\nbeyond the scope of the intention expressed by the Constitution\n\nBench in paragraph (53) of the Judgment.\n\n76. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited the judgment\n\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\nU.P.State\n\nElectricity Board Vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey and Others\n,\n\nreported in (2007) 11 SCC 92, and the paragraph (11) of the\n\njudgment is relevant and is extracted hereunder:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“11. Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon\nthe decision of this Court in\nSecy., State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nand has urged that no direction for regularisation can\nbe given by the Court. In our opinion, the decision in\nUmadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] is clearly distinguishable. The said decision cannot\nbe applied to a case where regularisation has been\nsought for in pursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution.”\n\n77. In the above said case, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench\n\ndistinguished that case with the “Umadevi Case”. The very\n\nlanguage used in Paragraph (11) states that “in our opinion, the\n\ndecision in “Umadevi Case” is clearly distinguishable. The said\n\ndecision cannot be applied to a case where regularization has been\n\nsought for in pursuance of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. However,\n\nthis Court is of the opinion that their Lordships have distinguished\n\nthe “Umadevi Case” in respect of the facts and circumstances that\n\nthe case. When their Lordships have distinguished that case, this\n\nCourt is of the opinion that the legal principles settled in\n\n“Umadevi Case” has not been deviated by the Hon'ble Two Judges\n\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, as it is a “binding\n\nprecedent” as stated by this Court in earlier paragraphs.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n78. “Umadevi Case” being a “binding precedent” and when\n\nthe case was distinguished from “Umadevi Case” on factual\n\ncircumstances, the same cannot be applied in the present case\n\nbefore this Court.\n\n79. The judgment in the case of State of Uttaranchal and\n\nanother Vs. Prantiya Sinchai Avam Bandh Yogana Shramik\n\nMahaparishad, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 483 and the\n\nrelevant paragraph (5) is cited by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner which is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. A writ petition was filed before the\nUttaranchal High Court which was dismissed by the\nimpugned order. The High Court was of the view that\nall the 14 workmen, in question, were working on daily\nwages for more than six years and had completed 240\ndays in each calendar year and they ought to be\nregularised. Accordingly, the writ petition was\ndismissed.”\n\n80. On a perusal of the above said judgment, this Court is of\n\nthe opinion that the case relates to an award passed by the Labour\n\nCourt and an Award passed by the Labour Court under the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nprovisions of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, cannot have any relevance\n\nin respect of the Government employments made by virtue of the\n\nrules framed by the State in this regard. However, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India in that case, remanded the matter back for\n\nreconsideration by the High Court in the light of the legal\n\nprinciples settled in the “Umadevi Case”. Thus, in all respects,\n\nthe case cannot have any application in respect of the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present writ petition.\n\n81. It has further cited the case of\nState of Karnataka and\n\nOthers Vs. M.L.Kesari and Others\n, reported in (2010) 9 SCC\n\n247 and the relevant paragraph (7) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n“regularisation” enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\nSCC 1] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court\nor tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee\nand continued him in service voluntarily and\ncontinuously for more than ten years.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n82. In\nthe above case\n, an exception has been carved out in\n\nrelation to the one time relief granted in paragraph (15) of the\n\n“Umadevi Case”.\n\n83. In the case of State of Rajastan and Others Vs. Daya\n\nLal and Others, reported in (2011) 2 SCC 429 and the relevant\n\nparagraph (12), enumerates the settled principles in respect of\n\nregularization and parity in pay, relevant in the context of the case\n\nand those principles carved out in paragraph (12) of the above\n\njudgment are akin to that of the legal principles settled by the\n\nConstitution Bench in “Umadevi Case”.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n84. The learned counsel for the petitioner solicited the\n\nattention of this Court relying the case decided by the Hon'ble Two\n\nJudges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of\n\nNihal Singh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n,\n\nreported in (2013) 14 SCC 65 and the paragraph (31) and (33)\n\nof the judgments are extracted hereunder:\n\n“31. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\nprocess of selection adopted in identifying the\nappellants herein cannot be said to be unreasonable or\narbitrary in the sense that it was devised to eliminate\nother eligible candidates. It may be worthwhile to note\nthat in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] ,\nthis Court was dealing with appointments made without\nfollowing any rational procedure in the lower rungs of\nvarious services of the Union and the States.\n\n33. It is no doubt that the assessment of the need\nto employ a certain number of people for discharging a\nparticular responsibility of the State under the\nConstitution is always with the executive government of\nthe day subject to the overall control of the legislature.\n\nThat does not mean that an examination by a\nconstitutional court regarding the accuracy of the\nassessment of the need is barred.”\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n85. On a plain reading of the judgment, this Court is of an\n\nundoubted opinion that there is a slight deviation in respect of the\n\nlegal principles carved out by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench in\n\n“Umadevi Case”. This Court wishes to remind the language used\n\nby the Constitution Bench in paragraph (5) of “Umadevi Case”.\n\nTo reiterate the language used by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia emphatically in paragraph (5) that this Court has also\n\noccasions to issue directions which could not be said to be\n\nconsisted by the public employment. Such directions are issued\n\npresumably on the basis of equitable consideration or\n\nindividualization of justice. The question arises, equity to whom?\n\nEquity for the handful of people who have approached the Court\n\nwith a claim, or equity for the teeming millions of this Country\n\nseeking employment and seeking a fair opportunity for competing\n\nfor employment?\n\n86. In paragraph (54) of the said “Umadevi Case” judgment,\n\nagain the Constitution Bench reiterated that “It is also clarified that\n\nthose decisions which run counter to the principle settled in this\n\ndecision, or in which directions running counter to what we have\n\nheld herein, will stand denuded of their status as precedents.”\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n87. This Court has no hesitation in holding that the judgment\n\ncited by the learned counsel for the petitioner in the case of\nNihal\n\nSingh and Others Vs. State of Punjab and Others\n, reported in\n\n(2013) 14 SCC 65, is to be considered as denuded of their status\n\nas precedents. Thus, this Court is not inclined to consider and\n\nfollow the same.\n\n88.\nIn the case of\nAmarendra Kumar Mohapatra and\n\nothers Vs. State of Orissa and others\n, reported in (2014) 4\n\nSCC 583, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia held that and the paragraphs (42) & (43) of the above said\n\njudgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“42.The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , as noticed earlier, permitted regularisation\nof regular appointments and not illegal appointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is whether the appointments in the\ninstant case could be described as illegal and if they\nwere not, whether the State could be directed to\nregularise the services of the degree-holder Junior\nEngineers who have worked as ad hoc Assistant\nEngineers for such a long period, not only on the\nanalogy of the legislative enactment for regularisation\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nbut also on the principle underlying para 53 of the\ndecision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] .\n\n43.As to what would constitute an irregular\nappointment is no longer res integra.

Kesari\n[(2010) 9\nSCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , has examined that\nquestion and explained the principle regarding\nregularisation as enunciated in Umadevi (3) case [\nState\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] . The decision\nin that case\nsummed up\nthe following three essentials for regularisation: (1) the\nemployees have worked for ten years or more, (2) that\nthey have so worked in a duly sanctioned post without\nthe benefit or protection of the interim order of any\ncourt or tribunal, and (3) they should have possessed\nthe minimum qualification stipulated for the\nappointment. Subject to these three requirements being\nsatisfied, even if the appointment process did not\ninvolve open competitive selection, the appointment\nwould be treated irregular and not illegal and thereby\nqualify for regularisation.\n\nPara 7 in this regard is\napposite and may be extracted at this stage: (\nM.L.\nKesari\ncase [(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n826] , SCC p. 250)\n\n“7.\n\nIt is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n‘regularisation’ enunciated in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n(L&S) 753] , if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in a duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court or\ntribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee and\ncontinued him in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n89. It is important to cite the case of\nSECRETARY TO\n\nGOVERNMENT, SCHOOL EDUCATION\n\nDEPARTMENT,CHENNAI v. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND ORS.\n\n[ (2014) 4 SCC 769]. In paragraph No.(8), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt has observed as follows:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“8.this Court in\nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Daya Lal &\nOrs.\n, AIR 2011 SC 1193, has considered the scope of\nregularisation of irregular or part-time appointments in\nall possible eventualities and laid down well-settled\nprinciples relating to regularisation and parity in pay\nrelevant in the context of the issues involved therein.\nThe same are as under:\n\n“(i) The High Courts, in exercising power under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution will not issue\ndirections for regularisation, absorption or\npermanent continuance, unless the employees\nclaiming regularisation had been appointed in\npursuance of a regular recruitment in\naccordance with relevant rules in an open\ncompetitive process, against sanctioned vacant\nposts. The equality clause contained in\nArticles\nand\nshould be scrupulously followed and\nCourts should not issue a direction for\nregularisation of services of an employee which\nwould be violative of the constitutional scheme.\n\nWhile something that is irregular for want of\ncompliance with one of the elements in the\nprocess of selection which does not go to the\nroot of the process, can be regularised, back\ndoor entries, appointments contrary to the\nconstitutional scheme and/or appointment of\nineligible candidates cannot be regularised.\n\n(ii) Mere continuation of service by a temporary\nor ad hoc or daily-wage employee, under cover\nof some interim orders of the court, would not\nconfer upon him any right to be absorbed into\nservice, as such service would be “litigious\nemployment”. Even temporary, ad hoc or daily-\nwage service for a long number of years, let\nalone service for one or two years, will not\nentitle such employee to claim regularisation, if\nhe is not working against a sanctioned post.\nSympathy and sentiment 5 Page 6 cannot be\ngrounds for passing any order of regularisation\nin the absence of a legal right.\n\n(iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for\nregularisation with a cut-off date (that is a\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nscheme providing that persons who had put in a\nspecified number of years of service and\ncontinuing in employment as on the cut-off\ndate), it is not possible to others who were\nappointed subsequent to the cut-off date, to\nclaim or contend that the scheme should be\napplied to them by extending the cut-off date or\nseek a direction for framing of fresh schemes\nproviding for successive cut-off dates.\n\n(iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek\nregularisation as they are not working against\nany sanctioned posts. There cannot be a\ndirection for absorption, regularisation or\npermanent continuance of part-time temporary\nemployees.\n\n(v) Part-time temporary employees in\ngovernment-run institutions cannot claim parity\nin salary with regular employees of the\nGovernment on the principle of equal pay for\nequal work. Nor can employees in private\nemployment, even if serving full time, seek\nparity in salary with government employees.\nThe right to claim a particular salary against\nthe State must arise under a contract or under\na statute.” (Emphasis added) “\n\n90. Reiterating the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\nCase of\n\nSecretary to Government, School Education Department,\n\nChennai Vs. R.Govindaswamy and others\n, reported in (2014)\n\n4 SCC 769, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India emphatically ruled\n\nthat the High Courts, in exercising power under\nArticle 226\nof the\n\nConstitution of India will not issue directions for regularization,\n\nabsorption or permanent continuance. Unless the employees\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nclaiming regularization had been appointed in pursuance of a\n\nregular recruitment in accordance with relevant rules in an open\n\ncompetitive process against sanctioned vacant posts, the equality\n\nclause contained in\nArticles 14\nand\nshould be scrupulously\n\nfollowed and Courts should not issue a direction for regularization\n\nof services of an employee which would be violative of the\n\nConstitutional scheme.\n\n91.\nIn the case of\nNand Kumar Vs. State of Bihar and\n\nOthers\n, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 300, paragraph (25) & (26)\n\nare extracted hereunder:\n\n“25.We have consciously noted the aforesaid\ndecisions of this Court. The principle as has been\nlaid\ndown in\n\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has also\nbeen applied in relation to the persons who were\nworking on daily wages. According to us, the daily\nwagers are not appointees in the strict sense of the\nterm “appointment”. They do not hold a post. The\nscheme of alternative appointment framed for regular\nemployees of abolished organisation cannot, therefore,\nconfer a similar entitlement on the daily wagers of\nabolished organisation to such alternative employment.\n\n(See\nAvas Vikas Sansthan v. Engineers Assn.\n[(2006) 4\nSCC 132 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 613] ) Their relevance in\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nthe context of appointment arose by reason of the\nconcept of regularisation as a source of appointment.\n\nAfter Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3),\n(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , their position\ncontinued to be that of daily wagers. Appointment on\ndaily-wage basis is not an appointment to a post\naccording to the rules. Usually, the projects in which\nthe daily wagers were engaged, having come to an end,\ntheir appointment is necessarily terminated for want of\nwork. Therefore, the status and rights of daily wagers\nof a government concern are not equivalent to that of a\ngovernment servant and his claim to permanency has to\nbe adjudged differently.\n\n26.In these circumstances, in our considered\nopinion, the regularisation/absorption is not a matter of\ncourse. It would depend upon the facts of the case\nfollowing the rules and regulations and cannot be\ndehors the rules for such regularisation/absorption.”\n\n92. Once again, this Court is of the opinion that the above\n\ntwo paragraphs are running contrary to the legal principles settled\n\nby the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\nThus, the rules\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution\n\nBench to be applied in respect of\nthe above case\ncited.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n93.\nIn the case of\nMalathi Das and Others, Vs. Suresh\n\nand Others\n, reported in (2014) 13 SCC 249 and the relevant\n\nparagraph (13) is extracted hereunder:\n\n“13.In the aforesaid undisputed facts it is wholly\nunnecessary for us to consider as to whether the cases\nof persons who were awaiting regularisation on the date\nof the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] is\nrequired to be dealt with in accordance with the\nconditions stipulated in para 53 of\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] inasmuch as the claims of the respondent\nemployees can well be decided on principles of parity.\n\nSimilarly placed employees having been regularised by\nthe State and in case of some of them such\nregularisation being after the decision in\nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 753] we are of the view that the stand\ntaken by the appellants in refusing regularisation to the\nrespondents cannot be countenanced. However, as the\nsaid stand of the appellants stems from their perception\nand understanding of the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] we do not hold them liable for\ncontempt but make it clear that the appellants and all\nthe other competent authorities of the State will now be\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nobliged and duty-bound to regularise the services of the\nrespondents (74 in number) which will now be done\nforthwith and in any case within a period of two months\nfrom the date of receipt of this order.”\n\n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India once again taken a\n\ndeviation in respect of the legal principles settled by the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\nTherefore, such deviation to be held as denuded of their status as\n\nprecedent, as\nlaid down in\nparagraph (54) of the Constitution\n\nBench.\n\n95.\nIn the case of\nAmarkant Rai Vs. State of Bihar and\n\nOthers\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC 265, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India in paragraph (11) and (14) are held as follows:\n\n“11.Elaborating upon the principles\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi (3) case [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S)\n753] and explaining the difference between irregular\nand illegal appointments in\nState of Karnataka v. M.L.\nKesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] ,\nthis Court held as under: (\nM.L. Kesari\ncase [(2010) 9\nSCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826] , SCC p. 250, para\n\n7)\n“7. It is evident from the above that there is an\nexception to the general principles against\n‘regularisation’ enunciated in Umadevi (3) [(2006) 4\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] , if the following\nconditions are fulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have worked for 10\nyears or more in duly sanctioned post without the\nbenefit or protection of the interim order of any court\nor tribunal. In other words, the State Government or its\ninstrumentality should have employed the employee\nand continued him in service voluntarily and\ncontinuously for more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should not be\nillegal, even if irregular. Where the appointments are\nnot made or continued against sanctioned posts or\nwhere the persons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the appointments\nwill be considered to be illegal. But where the person\nemployed possessed the prescribed qualifications and\nwas working against sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of open\ncompetitive selection, such appointments are\nconsidered to be irregular.”\n\n14.Considering the facts and circumstances of\nthe case that the appellant has served the University\nfor more than 29 years on the post of night guard and\nthat he has served the College on daily wages, in the\ninterest of justice, the authorities are directed to\nregularise the services of the appellant retrospectively\nw.e.f. 3-1-2002 (the date on which he rejoined the post\nas per the direction of the Registrar).\"\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n96. In paragraph (14) of the above cited judgment, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India held that the appellant has served\n\nin the University for more than 29 years in the post of night guard\n\nand that he has served the College on daily wages, in the interest of\n\njustice, the authorities are directed to regularise the services of the\n\nappellant retrospectively w.e.f. 3-1-2002.\n\n97. Again, in this case also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia has deviated the principles\nlaid down in\n“Umadevi Case”.\n\nThus, this Court has to derive an opinion that the decision would be\n\ndenuded of its status as precedents. For all these reasons, this\n\nCourt has to independently apply the legal principles settled by the\n\nConstitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case”.\n\n98.\nIn the case of\nPrem Ram Vs. Managing Director,\n\nUttarakhand Pey Jal & Nirman Nigam, Dehradun and Others\n,\n\nreported in (2015) 11 SCC 255, undoubtedly, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India has decided the case based on the facts\n\nand circumstances of the case. However, on a plain reading of the\n\njudgment, this Court is of the opinion that the legal principles\n\nsettled by the Constitution Bench has not been considered by the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\nThus, this Court is not inclined to follow the judgment for the\n\npurpose of deciding the case on hand.\n\n99.\nIn the case of\nSurendra Kumar and Others Vs.\n\nGreater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Others\n,\n\nreported in (2015) 14 SCC 382, while, the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in paragraph (13) held as follows:\n\n“13.Considering the facts of the present case on\nthe touchstone\nlaid down in\nUmadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC\n(L&S) 753] , it will be seen that the Division Bench was\nnot right in setting aside the appointment of the\nappellants. More so, it was nobody's case challenging\nthe appointment of the appellants. Admittedly, the\nappellants were engaged as contractual employees\nfrom 1994 and have completed more than ten years of\ncontinuous service with Respondent 1. They continued\nin service not by the orders of the Court/Tribunal, but\nby the decision of the respondents. The appellants were\nregularised as per the policy decision dated 16-4-2003\ntaken by Respondent 1 and approved by the State\nGovernment vide Letter dated 5-3-2008. Since the\nappointment of the appellants were made pursuant to\nthe policy of regularisation, the High Court was not\nright in quashing the appointment of the appellants as\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nthe same were never in question before the High Court.\nThe plea that was raised by the appellants was only to\nseek regularisation with retrospective effect from\n20-11-2002 and the consequential seniority.”\n\n100. In this case also, the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India has taken note of the one time\n\nbenefit granted by the Constitution Bench in paragraph (53) of the\n\nJudgment in “Umadevi Case”. However, the legal principles\n\nsettled in paragraphs 5,10,12,14,20 and 43 to 50 and 54 of the\n\njudgment has not been considered by their Lordships. Since the\n\nlegal principles enunciated in the above paragraphs of the\n\nConstitution Bench has not been considered and the case was\n\ndecided based on the particular facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase, this Court is not bound to consider it as a “binding precedent”\n\nas enumerated in the first portion of this Judgment. This Court has\n\nearlier considered the nature of the “binding precedents” and the\n\ninterpretation of binding precedents as enumerated by the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\n\nrecent case of\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pranay Sethi and\n\nOthers\n, reported in [JT 2017 10 SC 450] cited supra.\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n101. In all the cases cited supra, this Court is able to find out\n\nthat those cases by the Hon'ble Two Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India were decided based on certain facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case. However, all those circumstances and\n\nthe legal principles were well settled by the Constitution Bench in\n\n“Umadevi Case”. Various paragraphs of the Constitution Bench\n\njudgment as discussed above made it very clear that all the\n\ncircumstances arisen out of the temporary/casual/daily wages\n\nemployees were dealt with elaborately and a findings are provided.\n\nThis being the factum of the case, this Court is not inclined to\n\nfollow the above judgment of the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India as a “binding precedent” and this\n\nCourt is bound by the legal principles settled by the Constitution\n\nBench in “Umadevi Case” which remains as the law of the land\n\nunder\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n102. This Court is willing to cite another judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\n\nin the case of\nPunjab Water Supply & Sewerage Board Vs.\n\nRanjodh Singh and Others\n, reported in (2007) 2 SCC Page\n\n491. In the above judgment paragraph (17) & (18) are extracted\n\nhereunder:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“17.A combined reading of the aforementioned\nparagraphs would clearly indicate that what the\nConstitution Bench had in mind in directing\nregularisation was in relation to such appointments,\nwhich were irregular in nature and not illegal ones.\n\n18.Distinction between irregularity and illegality is\nexplicit. It has been so pointed out in\nNational\nFertilizers Ltd. v. Somvir Singh\n[(2006) 5 SCC 493 :\n\n2006 SCC (L&S) 1152] in the following terms: (SCC pp.\n500-01, paras 23-25)\n“23. The contention of the learned counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the respondents that the appointments were\nirregular and not illegal, cannot be accepted for more\nthan one reason. They were appointed only on the basis\nof their applications. The Recruitment Rules were not\nfollowed. Even the Selection Committee had not been\nproperly constituted. In view of the ban on employment,\nno recruitment was permissible in law. The reservation\npolicy adopted by the appellant had not been\nmaintained. Even cases of minorities had not been given\ndue consideration.\n\n24. The Constitution Bench thought of directing\nregularisation of the services only of those employees\nwhose appointments were irregular as explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa [AIR 1967 SC\n1071 : (1967) 1 SCR 128] , R.N. Nanjundappa v. T.\nThimmiah [(1972) 1 SCC 409] and B.N.

Judged by the standards\nlaid down by\nthis Court in\nthe aforementioned decisions, the appointments of the\nrespondents are illegal.\n\nThey do not, thus, have any\nlegal right to continue in service.”\n\n(See also\nState of M.P. v.

The Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India has dealt with the interpretation of paragraphs 16,\n\n17, 19 and 22 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (16), (17),\n\n(19) and (22) are extracted hereunder:\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n“16.\nIn\nB.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n\n[(1979) 4 SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR\n937] this Court clearly held that the words “regular” or\n“regularisation” do not connote permanence and cannot\nbe construed so as to convey an idea of the nature of\ntenure of appointments. They are terms calculated to\ncondone any procedural irregularities and are meant to\ncure only such defects as are attributable to\nmethodology followed in making the appointments. This\nCourt emphasised that when rules framed under\nArticle\nof the Constitution are in force, no regularisation is\npermissible in exercise of the executive powers of the\nGovernment under\nArticle 162\nof the Constitution in\ncontravention of the rules. These decisions and the\nprinciples recognised therein have not been dissented\nto by this Court and on principle, we see no reason not\nto accept the proposition as enunciated in the above\ndecisions. We have, therefore, to keep this distinction in\nmind and proceed on the basis that only something that\nis irregular for want of compliance with one of the\nelements in the process of selection which does not go\nto the root of the process, can be regularised and that it\nalone can be regularised and granting permanence of\nemployment is a totally different concept and cannot be\nequated with regularisation.\n\n17. We have already indicated the constitutional\nscheme of public employment in this country, and the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nexecutive, or for that matter the court, in appropriate\ncases, would have only the right to regularise an\nappointment made after following the due procedure,\neven though a non-fundamental element of that process\nor procedure has not been followed. This right of the\nexecutive and that of the court would not extend to the\nexecutive or the court being in a position to direct that\nan appointment made in clear violation of the\nconstitutional scheme, and the statutory rules made in\nthat behalf, can be treated as permanent or can be\ndirected to be treated as permanent.\n\n19. One aspect arises. Obviously, the State is also\ncontrolled by economic considerations and financial\nimplications of any public employment. The viability of\nthe department or the instrumentality of the project is\nalso of equal concern for the State. The State works out\nthe scheme taking into consideration the financial\nimplications and the economic aspects. Can the court\nimpose on the State a financial burden of this nature by\ninsisting on regularisation or permanence in\nemployment, when those employed temporarily are not\nneeded permanently or regularly? As an example, we\ncan envisage a direction to give permanent employment\nto all those who are being temporarily or casually\nemployed in a public sector undertaking. The burden\nmay become so heavy by such a direction that the\nundertaking itself may collapse under its own weight. It\nis not as if this had not happened. So, the court ought\nnot to impose a financial burden on the State by such\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\ndirections, as such directions may turn\ncounterproductive.\n\n22. With respect, it appears to us that the question\nwhether the jettisoning of the constitutional scheme of\nappointment can be approved, was not considered or\ndecided. The distinction emphasised in\nR.N.\nNanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(1972) 1 SCC 409 : (1972)\n2 SCR 799] was also not kept in mind. The Court\nappears to have been dealing with a scheme for “equal\npay for equal work” and in the process, without an\nactual discussion of the question, had approved a\nscheme put forward by the State, prepared obviously at\nthe direction of the Court, to order permanent\nabsorption of such daily-rated workers. With respect to\nthe learned judges, the decision cannot be said to lay\ndown any law, that all those engaged on daily wages,\ncasually, temporarily, or when no sanctioned post or\nvacancy existed and without following the rules of\nselection, should be absorbed or made permanent\nthough not at a stretch, but gradually. If that were the\nratio, with respect, we have to disagree with it.”\n\n104.\nIn the case of\nPost Master General, Kolkata and\n\nOthers Vs.

The said contempt petition was dismissed\nwith liberty to the respondent to file a fresh original\napplication. Pursuant to the said observations, the\nrespondent filed an application before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench, Calcutta which\nwas marked as OA No. 484 of 2002.\n\n18.There are two distinctive features in the\npresent case, which are:\n\n(i) Equality is a positive concept. Therefore, it cannot be\ninvoked where any illegality has been committed or\nwhere no legal right is established.\n\n(ii) According to the appellant the respondent having\ncompleted 240 days, does not fulfil the requisite\ncriteria. A disputed question of fact has been raised.\n\nThe High Court did not come to a positive finding that\nshe had worked for more than 240 days in a year.”\n\n105.\nIn the case of\nC.Balachandran and Others Vs. State\n\nof Kerala and Others\n, reported in (2009) 1 SCC (L& S) 610,\n\nwherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India interpreted the scope\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nof paragraph 153 of “Umadevi Case” and the paragraphs (17) &\n\n(18) of\nthe said judgment\nand the same is extracted hereunder:\n\n“17. Dr. Pillay, however, strongly relied upon the\nobservations made in Para 53 in Umadevi [(2006) 4 SCC\n1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] which reads as under: (SCC p.\n\n42, para 53)\n“53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\ncases where irregular appointments (not illegal\nappointments) as explained in\nState of Mysore v. S.V.\nNarayanappa\n[AIR 1967 SC 1071 : (\n1967) 1 SCR 128] ,\nR.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n[(\n1972) 1 SCC 409]\nand B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n[(1979) 4 SCC\n507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4] and referred to in para 15\nabove, of duly qualified persons in duly sanctioned\nvacant posts might have been made and the employees\nhave continued to work for ten years or more but\nwithout the intervention of orders of the courts or of\ntribunals. The question of regularisation of the services\nof such employees may have to be considered on merits\nin the light of the principles settled by this Court in the\ncases abovereferred to and in the light of this judgment.\nIn that context, the Union of India, the State\nGovernments and their instrumentalities should take\nsteps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services\nof such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten\nyears or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under\ncover of orders of the courts or of tribunals and should\nfurther ensure that regular recruitments are undertaken\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nto fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\nfilled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily\nwagers are being now employed. The process must be\nset in motion within six months from this date. We also\nclarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not\nsub judice, need not be reopened based on this\njudgment, but there should be no further bypassing of\nthe constitutional requirement and regularising or\nmaking permanent, those not duly appointed as per the\nconstitutional scheme.”(emphasis in original)\n\nA case of regularisation which thus attained finality and\nwas not sub judice would not come within the purview\nof exception to the rule contained in Para 53 of\nthe said\njudgment\n. The appellants' case, thus, does not come\nwithin the purview thereof. Only those cases where\nregularisations had already been made were not to be\nreopened. It is not in dispute that services of the\nappellants were terminated as far back as in 1987 and\nthey did not question the legality or validity of the said\norder.\n\nIt is only after the decision of this Court in\nJacob\n\ncase [(1991) 1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15\nATC 697] that representations were filed. Such\nrepresentations were rejected both by the Kerala Water\nAuthority as also the State of Kerala.\n\n18. The appellants, in our opinion, thus, neither in\nlaw nor in equity were entitled to be reinstated in\nservice. The decision of this Court in\nJacob\ncase [(1991)\n1 SCC 28 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 25 : (1991) 15 ATC 697]\nbeing not applicable to the case of the appellants, we\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nare bound by the\nratio\nlaid down in\nUmadevi [(2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] . So far as Para 53 of the\njudgment of the Constitution Bench in the said case is\nconcerned, the same has been considered by this Court\nin a large number of decisions.\n\nIn\nPunjab Water Supply\n& Sewerage Board v. Ranjodh Singh\n[(2007) 2 SCC\n491 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 713] it was held: (SCC p. 498,\npara 15)\n\n“15.\n\nThe question came up for consideration before a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in\nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3) [(2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nwherein it was held that no person who was temporarily\nor casually been employed could be directed to be\ncontinued permanently.\n\nIt was opined that by doing so it\nwould be creating another mode of public employment\nwhich is not permissible.”\n\n[See\nEmployees' Union v. Mineral Exploration Corpn.\nLtd.\n[(2006) 6 SCC 310 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 1318] , State\nof M.P. v. Lalit Kumar Verma\n[(2007) 1 SCC 575 : (\n2007)\n1 SCC (L&S) 405] and Post Master General v. Tutu Das\n(Dutta\n) [(2007) 5 SCC 317 : (2007) 2 SCC (L&S) 179] .]”\n\n106. When the scope of the paragraph (53) of the judgment,\n\nis well enumerated by the Hon'ble Two Judges Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India as cited above, this Court is not inclined to\n\nconsider the other judgments referred by the learned counsel for\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nthe petitioner. However, on a perusal of all these judgments cited\n\nsupra, this Court is of the opinion that ultimately the legal principle\n\nsettled in by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi Case” is\n\nbinding over the subject and the same is to be followed\n\nscrupulously by all the Courts across the country and the same\n\nbecomes the law of the land in the matter of regularization,\n\npermanent absorption and appointment.\n\n107. Now, considering the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase on hand, it remains that the writ petitioners were appointed as\n\ndaily rated employees for a particular period and, this Court has to\n\ndraw an inference that all the Government orders passed\n\nsubsequent to the Constitution Bench Judgment, if runs contrary to\n\nthe legal principles settled by the Constitution Bench, would\n\nbecome invalid and the same cannot be implemented or followed.\n\nIn other words, it is to be noted that the Government has no\n\nauthority to issue any orders granting regularization, permanent\n\nabsorption or appointment in violation of the Constitutional\n\nschemes and in violation of the recruitment rules in force. The\n\npower of the Government in this regard is certainly abrogated by\n\nthe principles settled by the Constitution Bench in the “Umadevi\n\nCase”. Such being the factum of the case, the State Government is\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nto be precluded as well as its authority are to be regularized in\n\nrespect of appointing employees in contravention with the\n\nrecruitment rules in force and effecting appointments through back\n\ndoors.\n\n108. This Court has to place on record that the State is\n\nbound to over see the appointments made in this regard illegally or\n\nirregularly by the competent authorities and the same is to be\n\nconstrued as the fraud on the Constitution and such authorities are\n\nliable for prosecution under the Discipline and Appeal Rules and\n\nother relevant rules. The State shall be vigilant in this regard and\n\nthe authorities indulging in such activities of exercising powers by\n\nissuing illegal or irregular appointments are to be booked under\n\nthe Discipline and Appeal Rules. No leniency can be shown by the\n\nState in this regard, since these all are the Constitutional principles\n\nrequired for the State to be followed and the State being a modal\n\nemployer, has to implement the Constitutional perspectives and the\n\nprinciples scrupulously and without any deviation.\n\n109. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in\n\nparagraph (15) of the judgment in “Umadevi Case”, the\n\nConstitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\na distinction between regularisation and conferment of permanent\n\nstatus in service jurisprudence has to be drawn. This Court is of the\n\nopinion that the conferment of permanent status Act, is a general\n\nlaw applicable to the employees, in the absence of any special law\n\ngoverning the particular subject. However, if any such law prevails\n\nand covering the field of appointment of regularisation and\n\npermanent absorption, then the general law would not apply. In\n\nnutshell, the special law and rules will prevail over the general law\n\nand the special rules in force are to be applied in the relevant case.\n\n110. The very concept of public employment are elaborately\n\nadjudicated and the principles are\nlaid down in\n\nUmadevi\ncase.\n\nThis Court is of the considered opinion that all appointments are to\n\nbe made strictly in accordance with the Service Rules in force.\n\nEqual opportunity in public employment is the constitutional\n\nmandate. All eligible persons, who are all aspiring to secure public\n\nemployment, must be provided with an opportunity to participate in\n\nthe open competitive process under the Constitutional scheme and\n\nany violation would result in denial of equal opportunity enunciated\n\nunder the Constitution of India. Thus, equality clause being the\n\nFundamental Right. Public employment cannot be denied to the\n\nmeritorious candidates, who are all longing to secure public\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nemployment, by participating in the process of selection more so,\n\nby availing the Rules of Reservation. The practice of engaging\n\ntemporary employees, allowing them to continue in an irregular\n\nmanner and thereafter, granting the benefit of regularization and\n\npermanent absorption is not only in violation of the Constitutional\n\nPrinciples, but depriving the Fundamental Rights of the citizen of\n\nthis great Nation, who are all otherwise meritorious and waiting to\n\nparticipate in the process of selection.\n\n111. In the event of large scale back door appointments\n\nundoubtedly, the efficiency level in the public administration would\n\nbe diluted. One can easily visualize that in the absence of any\n\nmerit selection, the efficiency level cannot be ensured or\n\nmaintained. Beyond the deprival of opportunity of public\n\nemployment to the meritorious candidates, the efficiency in the\n\npublic administration is also contemplated under the Constitutional\n\nPrinciples. Efficient public administration is mandate. In order to\n\nmaintain the efficient Public Administration, the appointments are\n\nto be made by selecting meritorious candidates for public services.\n\nDilution on the Constitutional Principles would result in disaster\n\nconsequences. In the event of lack of efficiency in public\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nadministration, the public at large would suffer in respect of\n\navailing the benefits and services of Government schemes and\n\npolicies. Once there is a dilution of efficiency level in public\n\nadministration, then the Constitutional Principles are thrown on\n\nthe wind. Thus, the Courts cannot show any leniency or misplaced\n\nsympathy in the matter of upholding the constitutional mandates,\n\nPhilosophy and Ethos. In the event of dilution of these\n\nConstitutional Principles, the efficiency level in public\n\nadministration will get affected and consequently, the\n\nadministration and implementation of Government schemes will get\n\naffected.\n\n112. All these aspects are to be borne in mind. It is not as if\n\nCourts can decide certain issues on sympathy or by taking a lenient\n\nview. Such misplaced sympathy or lenient view may result in\n\ndenial of social justice to all the citizen of this great Nation. If the\n\nimplication of such misplaced sympathy would result in adverse\n\nconsequences, then Courts should not prefer to grant relief in such\n\ncases merely based on the length of services or the manner in\n\nwhich the irregular or illegal appointments are made.\n\n................. (W.P.No.28633 of 2014...............\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\n113. In the present case, the order impugned states that the\n\nwrit petitioners are not satisfying the conditions stipulated in\n\nG.O.Ms.No.74, Personal Administrative Reforms Department, dated\n\n27.06.2013. Therefore, their claim for regularization is not\n\nfeasible.\n\n114. Even in case they are not satisfying the conditions, this\n\nCourt is of the opinion that such Government Orders, which are all\n\npassed and running counter to the principles settled by the\n\nConstitutional Bench cannot be considered as valid Government\n\nOrders. Any Government Orders running counter to the principles\n\nlaid down by\nthe Constitutional Bench are unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, the Government is also restrained from granting the\n\nbenefit of regularization or permanent absorption through back\n\ndoor method. It is not as if the Government can take a decision,\n\nwhich is otherwise not inconsonance with the Constitutional\n\nPrinciples. Periodically granting regularization in violation of Rules\n\nis impermissible both under the Constitution of India as well as\n\nbased on the principles\nlaid down by\nthe Constitution Bench.\n\nTherefore, relying on a Government Order Court cannot decide the\n\nmatter contrary to the principles\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nof India, more specifically, by the Constitution Bench. Thus, such\n\nGovernment Orders, which are all running counter to the\n\nprinciples, cannot be approved by this Court. However, if the\n\nGovernment Orders are running in consonance with the legal\n\nprinciples, the said Government Order can be approved for the\n\npurpose of grant of the benefit of regularization or permanent\n\nabsorption.\n\n115. In view of the discussions made above, this Court is of\n\nthe opinion that the writ petitioners are not entitled for the relief\n\nof regularization or permanent absorption as such sought for in\n\nthese writ petitions.\n\n116. Accordingly, all the writ petitions stand dismissed.\n\nHowever, there shall be no order as to costs. Consequently,\n\nconnected miscellaneous petitions also stand dismissed.\n\n04.11.2020\nIndex :Yes / No\nInternet :Yes / No\n\nMPK\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nTo\n\n1.The Secretary to Government,\nPublic Works Department,\nThe Government of Taminadu,\nFort St.George,\nChennai 600 009.\n\n2.The Engineer in Chief (WRO),\nPublic Works Department,\nCheppakkam,\nChennai – 600 005.\n\n3.The Chief Engineer (WRO),\nPWD Madurai Region,\nTallakulam, Madurai.\n\n4.Superintending Engineer (WRO),\n\nThamaraiparani Irrigation Circle, (Regular)\nPalayamkottai,\nTirunelveli District.\n\n5.Superintending Engineer,\nWRO - PWD Project Circle,\nTirunelveli – 2\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nS.M.SUBRAMANIAM, J.\n\nMPK\n\nW.P.(MD)No.10066 of 2014\n\nW.P.(MD)No.14276 of 2017\n\nand\n\nW.P.(MD)No.14503 of 2017\n\n04.11.2020\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in",
