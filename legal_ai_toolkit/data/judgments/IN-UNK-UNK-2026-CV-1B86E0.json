A perusal of the Deed of agreements to sell given in the\n table indicates that 16 agreements to sell were executed\n on different dates between 29.03.2007 to 25.03.2008. It\n was the case of the claimant-appellant herein before the\n learned arbitrator that the respondents executed in the\n form of agreements to sell, an irrevocable Power of\n Attorney, appointing the claimant as true and lawful\n person to transfer the said property. The respondents\n were required to get the properties converted from\n agricultural lands to non-agricultural lands at their own\n cost and expenses and sale consideration was to be paid\n only at the time of execution of the conveyance deed.\n However, till date, the respondents had not got the\n properties converted from agricultural lands to non-\n agricultural lands nor had obtained and produced the\n title clearance certificate from reputed solicitor nor they\n appear to have made attempt to do so and further for\n conversion of the lands from new tenure to old tenure.\n\n 5.

It was further contended before the\n learned arbitrator that the claimant was always ready\n and willing to perform the terms and conditions of the\n agreements to sell and the application for conversion of\n the lands in question from agricultural lands to non-\n agricultural lands was required to be moved by the\n vendor and the claimant had no role to play. It was\n further argued that since the agreement to sell was for\n purchase of lands in question as non-agricultural lands\n after conversion, no invalidity can be attached to the\n agreements in view of \nSection 63(1)(c)\n of the Gujarat\n Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (for short\n \"Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948\"). It was argued that the\n provisions of the Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948 would not\n be applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n 6. The stand of the claimant was that the irrevocable Power\n of Attorney executed in favour of the claimant being\n coupled with the pecuniary interest could not be revoked\n yet the respondents had issued public notices dated\n 29.06.2012 and 30.06.2012 to cancel or to revoke the\n Power of Attorney. The total payment of consideration\n made by the claimant to the owners with respect to the\n entire sale transaction of all the properties is\n approximately Rs. 51,08,04,634/- (Rs.

When nothing was done for a long time, the claimant\n inspected the records of the Revenue Department in the\n month of January 2011 and came to know that the\n respondents executed a sale deed in favour of third\n parties for some of the properties, which however, have\n not been included in the claim petition. It was,\n thereafter, agreed between the parties that the\n respondents shall not transfer, assign, mortgage the\n properties, subject matter of agreements to sell, to third\n parties and they will get the title clearance certificate for\n the property in question and would get it converted from\n agricultural to non-agricultural use before execution of\n the sale deed in favour of the claimant.\n\n 8. However, in the month of June 2012, the claimant came\n across a public notice in the newspapers \"Gujarat\n Samachar\" daily and \"Times of India\" daily stating that\n four respondents, viz. Mr. Ajay Patel, Mr. Atul Amin, Mr.\n Chirag Amin and Mr. Pragnesh Patel have revoked the\n Power of Attorney given by them to the claimant with\n respect to the properties in question and other\n properties which were part of Exhibit 16 with respect to\n which the sale deeds were executed by them in favour of\n the third party.

An application under \nSection 9\n of the Act' 1996 for\n interim relief was then moved by the claimants and\n before the civil court at Viramgam, a consent term had\n been arrived at between the parties whereunder, they\n have submitted their consent/compromise purshis\n agreeing for appointment of the learned sole arbitrator\n who happened to be a retired Judge of the High Court of\n Gujarat.

The resignation of\n Mr. Mahendra G.

Mr. Ajay Patel, one of the respondents before the\n learned arbitrator, in his application dated 24.09.2016,\n has clearly stated that because of the close relationship\n of Mr. Mahendra G.

It was, thus, opined\n that in view of these conditions, it cannot be said that\n there was no concluded contract between the parties.\n The clauses in the contract like arbitration clause in the\n agreement cannot be modified, amended or\n supplemented, except by an agreement in writing,\n signed by both the parties thereto, is proof of the fact\n that there was no uncertainty and the agreements\n cannot be said to be inconclusive. \nSection 17\n of the\n Specific Relief Act, thus, has no application. It was\n further noted that the arbitrator is competent to grant\n specific relief for part performance of the contract as it\n can equally grant specific relief for performance of the\n entire contract.\n\n 25. On the issue about revocation of the Power of Attorney\n executed by the vendors, it was held that the Power of\n Attorney given in favour of the claimant as the true and\n lawful attorney to do all or any of the acts, deeds,\n matters and things mentioned thereto, was irrevocable.\n Moreover, the claimant had paid more than 50% of the\n sale consideration and the said fact is not disputed.\n Under these circumstances, the Power of Attorney being\n coupled with pecuniary interest in the lands agreed to be\n purchased by the claimant cannot be revoked.\n\n 26.

There\n is no question of invalidity of the said agreement as\n such. As regards the provisions of Section 43 of the\n Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948, it was opined that in Exhibit\n 9, there is a specific condition that after getting the\n lands converted into non-agricultural use and also\n getting the lands converted from old tenure to new\n tenure, the sale deed is to be executed. A conditional\n decree, as such, can be passed requiring the vendor to\n get the lands in question converted into non-agricultural\n use and new tenure and then execute the sale deed.\n\n 27. It was, thus, opined that a proper reading of Exhibit 9\n makes it clear that the Sale Deed is to be executed only\n after the NA permission is obtained and, therefore, it can\n be said that the agreement is in two parts like reciprocal\n promises. The first part is of getting NA, title clearance\n and tenure changed, which was the obligation of the\n vendors to perform and on compliance of these\n conditions, second part for execution of the sale deed\n would arise and, thus, for payment of balance sale\n consideration.\n\n Page 21 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

The argument with regard to the invalidity of the\n agreements to sell being hit by \nSection 43(2)\n and\n Section 63(1)(c) was, thus, answered in negative. It was\n further held that there was no clause in Exhibit 9\n (Agreement), which can be read over to give either party\n right to determine the agreement. Moreover, the\n vendors in the written arguments had admitted that they\n had neither repudiated nor renunciated the agreement\n and hence, even according to the respondents, the\n Agreement Exhibit 9 is in force.\n\n 29. On the issue of limitation and the readiness and\n willingness of the claimant to perform its part of the\n Agreement, it was held that though in every agreement,\n the respondents vendors stated that the time of three\n months was given for obtaining NA, but no time was\n fixed or stipulated to complete the transaction, except in\n five claim petitions where six months' time was\n indicated. The contention of the vendors that the\n claimant was required to file the claim within three\n years on the expiry of the period of six months and in\n case, six months' time is not stipulated in the contract,\n they were required to file the claim within reasonable\n time, was rejected with the observation that the cause of\n action for filing the claim petition arose when the\n performance of contract was refused by the respondents.\n Reference has been made to \nArticle 54\n to the \nSchedule\n of the Limitation Act\n to hold that the period of three\n years begins to run either from the date of performance,\n\n Page 22 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

It\n was held that in five claims though time stipulated to\n complete the transaction is indicated as six months, but\n no date is fixed.\n\n 30. The claimant came to know about refusal of the vendors\n to perform its part of contract when public notice was\n published in the newspapers on 30.06.2012 and\n 29.06.2012. These notices were duly replied by the\n claimant and all the claim petitions have been filed\n within the period of limitation, which is to reckon from\n the date of the public notice to cancel the Power of\n Attorney, i.e., the date when the vendors refused\n performance.

The Agreements for\n Sale being prohibited and forbidden by the provisions of\n Sections 43 and 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948, in\n contravention of the statutory provisions, cannot be put\n into execution by directing the respondents to execute\n the sale deed after seeking NA permission or conversion\n of the land in question from new tenure to old tenure.\n\n 33. The Court under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act' 1996\n has further proceeded to examine the issue pertaining to\n the readiness and willingness on the part of the claimant\n and the delay in approaching the Tribunal for specific\n performance of the Agreements to Sell. It was held that\n as per \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act\n, the limitation for\n specific performance of an agreement is three years\n from the date fixed for the performance and if no such\n date is fixed, when the plaintiff has noticed that the\n performance is refused. Out of 16 agreements, 5\n transactions stipulated time period of six months for\n completion of transaction from the date of the respective\n agreements. With reference to such contracts, which\n were executed in the year 2007, proceedings were\n initiated by filing application under \nSection 9\n of the\n Arbitration Act' 1996 before the civil court only on\n 17.10.2012.

The claim for\n specific performance of the Agreements to Sell in five\n References Nos. 5/12, 6/12, 8/12, 15/12 and 18/12,\n therefore, was barred by limitation.\n\n 34. With respect to other agreements, the stipulated time is\n of three months for obtaining NA permission from the\n date of the agreement. The vendors had executed the\n Power of Attorney in favour of the claimant and hence,\n the claimant was required to take steps for obtaining the\n requisite permission within the specified time limit. No\n steps had been taken by the claimant for taking requisite\n permission till the Power of Attorney was cancelled and\n the claimant had approached the Arbitral Tribunal after\n five years, which itself shows that the claimant was not\n ready and willing to perform its part of the contract.\n This delay itself dis-entitles the claimant to seek specific\n performance of Agreements to Sell. The Arbitral\n Tribunal ought to have refused specific performance for\n this reason. On the contrary, if assumed for the moment\n that the vendors were required to obtain NA permission\n and the claimant was obliged to start any process for\n conversion of the lands into NA, then when the vendors\n did not initiate steps for conversion of lands within the\n stipulated period of three months, it would clearly\n suggest that the vendors had refused the performance of\n the agreement and the period of limitation of three years\n would start from the expiry of the stipulated period of\n three months from the date of the agreement.

The\n agreements to sell were for aggregation of land and\n some part of the land was non-agricultural with respect\n to which there was an obligation of the vendors to obtain\n permission of the competent authority to clear his title\n and execute the sale deed. In any case, the appellant\n was not handed over possession of the lands in question\n and there was no transfer, which can be said to be hit by\n \nSection 43\n or Section 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy Act'\n 1948.\n\n \n49.

It was, thus, held by the full bench that an instrument of\n transfer or an agreement made by an instrument in\n writing for transfer in favour of a non-agriculturist\n become valid on the permission being granted by the\n Collector or an officer authorised by the State\n Government on the condition as may be prescribed in\n the order of permission. Such transfer as such can be\n validated. It was, thus, held that there is no absolute bar\n in Section 63 about the transfer of a land though there is\n a restriction like Section 63, which contemplates\n absolute bar by making transfer of a land of restricted\n nature illegal without previous permission of the\n Collector.\n\n 51.

The agreement itself puts an obligation upon\n the vendors to move application before the Collector or\n authorised officer to seek permission.

It was further argued that the decree for specific\n performance of the contract could not have been\n awarded by the learned arbitrator, inasmuch as, the\n claim was barred by limitation. The agreements to sell\n were executed between March 2007 to March 2008 over\n a period of one year and as against total sale\n consideration of Rs. 6,91,72,700/-, an amount of\n Rs.2,93,37,961/- had been paid as against the\n outstanding of Rs. 3,98,34,749/-. There has been no\n expression of readiness and willingness on the part of\n the claimant for more than three years, the limitation\n prescribed for seeking a decree of specific performance\n of agreement.

There was complete silence and the claimant,\n in fact have themselves abandoned the project. The\n cancellation of the Power of Attorney in the year 2012\n cannot be taken as a refusal of the vendors of the\n performance of the contract on its part, inasmuch as, the\n Power of Attorney was cancelled much after the expiry\n of the time period of six months for completion of the\n formalities provided under the contract when the\n limitation under \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act, 1963\n of\n three years from the date fixed for the performance or if\n no such date is fixed when the plaintiff has noticed that\n the performance is refused, had expired.

There has\n been failure on the part of the vendee to adhere to the\n said condition of the agreement. The agreements which\n are invalid under Section 63(1)(c) of the Gujarat Tenancy\n Act' 1948 are in their nature determinable. \nSection\n 14(1)(c)\n of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides inter\n alia that a contract which is in its nature determinable\n cannot be specifically enforced.

It is only if one of these conditions is met\n that the Court may interfere with an arbitral\n award in terms of \nSection 34(2)(b)(ii)\n, but\n such interference does not entail a review of\n the merits of the dispute, and is limited to\n situations where the findings of the arbitrator\n are arbitrary, capricious or perverse, or when\n the conscience of the Court is shocked, or\n when the illegality is not trivial but goes to the\n root of the matter.

Pursuant to the\n insertion of Explanation 1 to \nSection 34(2)\n,\n the scope of contravention of Indian public\n policy has been modified to the extent that it\n now means fraud or corruption in the making\n of the award, violation of Section 75 or\n \nSection 81\n of the Act, contravention of the\n fundamental policy of Indian law, and conflict\n with the most basic notions of justice or\n morality. Additionally, sub-section (2-A) has\n been inserted in \nSection 34\n, which provides\n that in case of domestic arbitrations, violation\n of Indian public policy also includes patent\n illegality appearing on the face of the award.\n The proviso to the same states that an award\n shall not be set aside merely on the ground of\n an erroneous application of the law or by\n reappreciation of evidence.\n\n 14. As far as interference with an order made\n under \nSection 34\n, as per \nSection 37\n, is\n concerned, it cannot be disputed that such\n interference under \nSection 37\n cannot travel\n beyond the restrictions laid down under\n \nSection 34\n. In other words, the Court cannot\n undertake an independent assessment of the\n merits of the award, and must only ascertain\n that the exercise of power by the Court under\n \nSection 34\n has not exceeded the scope of the\n provision. Thus, it is evident that in case an\n arbitral award has been confirmed by the\n Court under \nSection 34\n and by the Court in an\n appeal under \nSection 37\n, this Court must be\n extremely cautious and slow to disturb such\n concurrent findings.\"\n\n 27. \nIn \nSsangyong Engg.

Insofar as domestic awards made in India\n are concerned, an additional ground is now\n available under sub-section (2-A), added by\n the Amendment Act, 2015, to \nSection 34\n.\n\n Here, there must be patent illegality\n appearing on the face of the award, which\n refers to such illegality as goes to the root of\n the matter but which does not amount to mere\n erroneous application of the law. In short,\n what is not subsumed within \"the fundamental\n policy of Indian law\", namely, the\n contravention of a statute not linked to public\n policy or public interest, cannot be brought in\n by the backdoor when it comes to setting\n aside an award on the ground of patent\n illegality.\n\n 38. Secondly, it is also made clear that\n reappreciation of evidence, which is what an\n appellate court is permitted to do, cannot be\n permitted under the ground of patent\n illegality appearing on the face of the award.\n\n \n39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of \nAssociate\n Builders [Associate Builders v.

This ground\n of challenge will now fall within the new\n ground added under \nSection 34\n(2-A).\n\n \n41. What is important to note is that a\n decision which is perverse, as understood in\n paras 31 and 32 of \nAssociate Builders\n [Associate Builders v.

Thus, a finding based on no evidence\n at all or an award which ignores vital evidence\n in arriving at its decision would be perverse\n and liable to be set aside on the ground of\n patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based\n on documents taken behind the back of the\n parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as\n a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as\n such decision is not based on evidence led by\n the parties, and therefore, would also have to\n be characterised as perverse.\"\n\n \n28.

The interference would\n be so warranted when the award is in\n violation of \"public policy of India\", which has\n been held to mean \"the fundamental policy of\n Indian law\". A judicial intervention on account\n of interfering on the merits of the award\n would not be permissible. However, the\n principles of natural justice as contained in\n \nSections 18\n and \n34(2)(a)(iii)\n of the Arbitration\n Act would continue to be the grounds of\n challenge of an award. The ground for\n interference on the basis that the award is in\n conflict with justice or morality is now to be\n understood as a conflict with the \"most basic\n notions of morality or justice\". It is only such\n arbitral awards that shock the conscience of\n the Court, that can be set aside on the said\n ground. An award would be set aside on the\n ground of patent illegality appearing on the\n face of the award and as such, which goes to\n the roots of the matter.

There is a disturbing tendency of\n Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after\n dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of\n the cases to come to a conclusion that the\n award needs intervention and thereafter,\n dubbing the award to be vitiated by either\n perversity or patent illegality, apart from the\n other grounds available for annulment of the\n award. This approach would lead to corrosion\n of the object of the 1996 Act and the\n endeavours made to preserve this object,\n which is minimal judicial interference with\n arbitral awards. That apart, several judicial\n pronouncements of this Court would become\n a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside\n by categorising them as perverse or patently\n illegal without appreciating the contours of\n the said expressions.\n\n 29. Patent illegality should be illegality which\n goes to the root of the matter. In other words,\n every error of law committed by the Arbitral\n Tribunal would not fall within the expression\n \"patent illegality\". Likewise, erroneous\n application of law cannot be categorised as\n patent illegality. In addition, contravention of\n law not linked to public policy or public\n interest is beyond the scope of the expression\n \"patent illegality\". What is prohibited is for\n Courts to reappreciate evidence to conclude\n that the award suffers from patent illegality\n appearing on the face of the award, as Courts\n do not sit in appeal against the arbitral award.\n\n Page 60 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

An arbitral\n award stating no reasons for its findings\n would make itself susceptible to challenge on\n this account. The conclusions of the arbitrator\n which are based on no evidence or have been\n arrived at by ignoring vital evidence are\n perverse and can be set aside on the ground\n of patent illegality. Also, consideration of\n documents which are not supplied to the other\n party is a facet of perversity falling within the\n expression \"patent illegality\".\n\n 30. \nSection 34(2)(b)\n refers to the other\n grounds on which a court can set aside an\n arbitral award.

It was argued before the Apex\n Court that the contract was contingent upon the grant of\n permission by the Prant Officer and on refusal thereof,\n the parties would be governed by \nSection 56\n of the\n Contract Act, according to which, a contract becomes\n void if something supervenes after its execution which\n renders it impracticable.

The general principle is that if a condition is laid down\n that the transferor is bound to do everything to give\n effect to the contract, specific performance can be\n obtained with a direction to the transferor to obtain the\n requisite consent or permission. The principle is that\n unless and until the transaction itself is unlawful, it may\n be enforced directing the defendant/transferor to take\n such steps as are necessary for affecting the contract.\n The principle is that if the vendor has agreed to sell the\n property, which can be transferred only with the\n sanction of some Government authority, the Court has\n jurisdiction to order the vendor to apply to the authority\n and if the sanction is not forthcoming, to convey to the\n purchaser the same, but on the ground that the sanction\n is not available, decree for specific performance cannot\n be refused. It is settled that when permission from some\n authority is required to be obtained, prior obtaining of\n the same is not a condition precedent for grant of decree\n for specific performance, if after grant of the decree\n permission can be obtained. The conditional decree for\n specific performance can be granted making it subject to\n obtaining permission or exemption, as contemplated in\n the Statute. The relief can be moulded to such an extent\n that the vendor is required to obtain permission or\n consent. It has been the consistent view that on the\n ground of non-availability of consent or permission, the\n vendor cannot avoid such an agreement. There are\n\n Page 77 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

The distinction between two statutory provisions under\n Sections 43 and 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy Act' 1948 has\n been noticed by the Full Bench of this Court in \nShaikh\n Ismailbhai Hushainbhai\n (supra), wherein it was held\n that there is a radical difference between the language\n of two statutes. The provisions of Section 43 of the\n Gujarat Tenancy Act puts complete prohibition in\n execution of even an agreement in writing to transfer a\n land of restricted tenure without the previous sanction of\n the Collector. In view of the negative language of the\n statute, the two conditions of transfer in Sub-section (1)\n of \nSection 43\n are of mandatory character. \nSection 43\n,\n thus, not only prohibits transfer by sale, lease, etc, but it\n expressly prohibits execution of agreement in writing to\n transfer a land by sale, lease, etc. without complying\n with the conditions in Sub-section (1) of \nSection 43\n.\n\n 84. On the other hand, Section 63 (1) though couched in\n negative language, but the first proviso attached to Sub-\n section (1) qualifies the negative language employed in\n the main sub-section, which makes an agreement made\n by an instrument in writing for sale, lease etc. to a non-\n agriculturist invalid. The first proviso to Sub-section (1)\n of Section 63 attaches validity to such transfer on the\n permission being granted by the Collector or an\n authorised officer, on such conditions as may be\n prescribed.

If any of these circumstances as mentioned\n in the Fifth Schedule exists, it will give rise to justifiable\n apprehension of bias. The Fifth Schedule enumerates\n the grounds as guidance in determining whether\n circumstances exist, which give rise to justifiable doubts\n of this nature. Likewise, the Seventh Schedule mentions\n those circumstances which would attract the provisions\n of Sub-section (5) of \nSection 12\n and nullify any prior\n agreement of the contrary. A comprehensive list is\n enumerated in the Fifth Schedule and Seventh Schedule\n and it was the bounden duty of the learned arbitrator to\n make a disclosure if any of the circumstances\n enumerated in the Fifth Schedule exist or surfaced\n during the course of arbitration proceedings. \nSection\n 12(2)\n mandates the learned arbitrator to disclose to the\n parties in writing any circumstances referred to in Sub-\n section (1) of \nSection 12\n, from the time of his\n appointment and throughout the arbitration\n proceedings, unless the parties have already been\n\n Page 91 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

As observed by the Apex Court in \nVoestalpine\n Schienen GmbH\n (supra), the judgment relied by the\n relied by the learned counsel for the respondents,\n independence and impartiality are two different\n concepts. An arbitrator may be independent and yet,\n lacks impartiality, or vice versa. Impartiality, as is well\n accepted, is a more subjective concept as compared to\n independence. Independence, which is more an objective\n concept may thus, be more straightforwardly\n ascertained by the parties at the outset of the arbitration\n proceedings in light of the circumstances disclosed by\n the arbitrator, while impartiality will more likely surface\n during the arbitration proceedings.\n\n 103. In our considered opinion, once the circumstances\n enumerated in Clause 9 of the \nFifth Schedule to the\n Arbitration Act\n' 1996 has surfaced during the course of\n arbitration proceedings and it was brought on record\n that the learned arbitrator has a close family\n relationship with one of the persons controlling the\n claimant Company having 51% share of the claimant\n Company, it was incumbent for the learned arbitrator to\n keep his hands off, inasmuch as, there has been no\n disclosure on the part of the learned arbitrator when the\n said fact came on record for the first time in the year\n 2015 during the course of the cross-examination of Mr.\n Rajesh Lodha. We are also inclined to give benefit of\n doubt to the learned arbitrator that he was not aware of\n\n Page 92 of 94\n\nUploaded by BIJOY B.

For the above discussion, we are of the view that the\n award of the learned arbitrator is found to be vitiated by\n patent illegality appearing on the face of the record\n being in conflict with the basic notions of justice and\n morality and, thus, being in conflict with the public\n policy of India. The illegality found in the award is not\n trivial, but goes to the very root of the matter and, thus,\n the interference made by the court in setting aside the\n award in terms of \nSection 34(2) (b)(iii)\n and Sub-section\n (2A) cannot be said to suffer from any error of law. This\n is not a case where the award has been found to be bad\n on review of the case of the parties on merits by re-\n appreciation of the evidence or on the premise that the\n award is a result of erroneous application of the\n statutory provision.

This approach would lead to corrosion\n of the object of the 1996 Act and the\n endeavours made to preserve this object,\n which is minimal judicial interference with\n arbitral awards.

The illegality found in the award is not\n trivial, but goes to the very root of the matter and, thus,\n the interference made by the court in setting aside the\n award in terms of \nSection 34(2) (b)(iii)\n and Sub-section\n (2A) cannot be said to suffer from any error of law. This\n is not a case where the award has been found to be bad\n on review of the case of the parties on merits by re-\n appreciation of the evidence or on the premise that the\n award is a result of erroneous application of the\n statutory provision. The claim was found to be hit by\n \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act\n on the face of the record\n and as such could not have been awarded and further,"
