  "text": "Madhya Pradesh High Court\n\nSmt. Rajabeti vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 11 May, 2016\n\nMCRC-5360-2016\n(SMT. RAJABETI Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)\n\n11-05-2016\n\nShri Brijesh Tyagi, learned counsel for the applicant.\nShri Kuldeep Singh, learned PL for the respondents/state.\n\nThe case diary is available.\n\nThis is fourth bail application filed by the applicant/accused under\n\nSection 438\nof Cr.P.C for grant of anticipatory bail apprehending\nher arrest by PS Bagchini district Morena in connection with Crime\nNo.148 of 2015 registered for the offences punishable under\n\nSection 498A\nand\n304B\nof IPC and Â¾ of\nDowry Prohibition Act\n.\nThree bail applications filed by the applicant under\nsection 438\nof\nCr.P.C for grant of anticipatory bail were dismissed by this court as\nwithdrawn.\n\nLearned counsel for the applicant-accused submits that co-accused\nRavi son of the applicant was granted bail by this court vide order\ndated 29.4.2016 on the ground that the witnesses Shyamlal (PW1)\nthe father, Smt. Saroopi, the mother and Durgesh (PW3) the\nbrother of the deceased have not corroborated the prosecution\nstory. Hence, the applicant accused be granted anticipatory bail.\nLearned PL opposing the submissions made on behalf of the\napplicant-accused submits that the applicant-accused has been\nabsconding since the happening of the alleged incident because of\nthat, she is not entitled to get anticipatory bail as per judgment of\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of The state of\nM.P. Vs.\nPradeep Sharma\n(2014) Volume 2 SCC 171. Learned PL further\ncontends that the statements of the witnesses recorded in the trial\ncourt relating to the co-accused cannot be read in this case. The\ncounsel further argues that earlier, three bail applications filed by\nthe applicant-accused have been dismissed by this court having\nconsidered the arguments of both the parties and the case diary\nevidence but the applications were withdrawn by the counsel for\nthe applicant when he found that the court was not inclined to\ngrant anticipatory bail. As no change of circumstances has been\nfound to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant-accused, this\napplication be dismissed.\n\nHeard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.\nThe applicant-accused has been absconding since the happening of\nthe alleged incident becasue of that only, she is not entitled to get\nanticipatory bail. Moreover, three bail applications filed on behalf of\nthe applicant were dismissed by this court after hearing the\narguments of both the parties as the applications were withdrawn\nby the counsel for the accused when he found that the court was\nnot inclined to grant bail.\n\nSo far as the order dated 29.4.2016 passed by this court in relation\nto the co-accused Ravi is concerned, the said order was passed\nunder section 439 of Cr.P.C.\n\nConsidering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, this\ncourt does not deem it fit to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant-\naccused. However, the concerned PS is directed to take\nappropriate steps against the applicant-accused to arrest her\nbecause, she has been repeatedly filing applications for\nanticipatory bail unnecessarily before this court.\n\n(M.K. MUDGAL)\nJUDGE",
