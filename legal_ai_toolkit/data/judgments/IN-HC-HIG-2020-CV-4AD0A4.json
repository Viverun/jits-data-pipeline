The learned counsel for the Respondent No.-2 has submitted\nthat the maintainability of the present writ petition challenging\nthe award passed by the Respondent No.-1 may be decided as\npreliminary issue.\n\nArgument of the petitioners on the point of maintainability of the\nwrit petition\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\nimpugned award passed by the Respondent No.1 is wholly\nwithout jurisdiction and accordingly, a nullity in the eyes of\nlaw and submits that there has been gross violation of\nprinciples of natural justice while passing the impugned\naward. It is submitted that considering aforesaid two points,\nthe present writ petition has been filed.\n\n6. The learned counsel has also submitted that the plea of\njurisdiction to entertain the claim of the respondent no.2 was\nraised before the Respondent No.-1. During the proceedings,\nstill the Respondent No.-1 entertained the claim and rejected\nthe point of jurisdiction raised by the petitioners by the\nimpugned award. The learned counsel reiterates that as the\npoint of jurisdiction is involved in this case, therefore, the writ\npetition is maintainable.\n\n7. The learned counsel has referred to following judgements: -\n\ni. Judgment in the case of\nWhirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar\nof Trade Marks, Mumbai and Others\nreported in (1998) 8\nSCC 1(Para-14 and 15 ) to submit that it has been held by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court that alternative remedy\ndoes not to operate as a bar to writ petition in at least\nthree contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has\nbeen filed for the enforcement of any of the\nFundamental Rights or where there has been a violation\nof the principle of natural justice or where the order or\nproceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the\nvalidity of an Act is challenged.\n\nii. Judgment reported in (2017) 8 SCC 830 (\nS.N.D.P.\nSakhayogam vs. Kerala Atmavidya Sangham and Others\n)\n(Para-16 and 17) to submit that the issue of jurisdiction,\nwhich goes to the root of the case, if found involved, has\nto be tried at any stage of the proceedings, once brought\nto the notice of the Court.\n\niii. Judgment reported in 2019 (4) JCR 243 (Jhr.) [State Project\nDirector, through Uma Shankar Singh versus M/s. Raj\nEnterprises, Nainital (Uttarakhand)] to submit that it has\nbeen held by this Court that a writ petition under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India is maintainable against\nthe order passed by the commercial court, but the\nCourts would be slow in entertaining such writ petition\nconsidering the object of the\nCommercial Courts Act,\n.\n\niv. Judgment passed by this court being W.P. (C) No. 6378\nof 2014 dated 14.06.2018 wherein it has been held that\npower of the High Court under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution of India is plenary in nature and\ninvolvement of contractual dispute or availability of\nalternative remedy cannot, ipso-facto, be a ground for\ndismissal of a writ petition. It has been held that public\nlaw element was involved in the said case, and it has\nbeen held that the respondent of the said case was\nrequired to act fairly and reasonably and has also been\nheld that arbitrariness in State action can be examined\nunder\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India.\nv. Judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nreported in (2018) 13 SCC 462 (\nBank of India vs. Yadav\nConsultancy Services Private Limited and another\n)\n(Paragraph No. 13 and 14) to submit that in the said case,\nthe concerned High Court did not decide the point of\njurisdiction and accordingly, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt held that the order of the High Court suffered\nfrom serious infirmity and was liable to be set aside.\nLearned counsel submits that the said case before the\nHon'ble Supreme Court also arose out of a case under\n\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development\nAct, 2006\n(hereinafter '\nMSMED Act\n') and accordingly,\nthe point regarding lack of jurisdiction of Respondent\nNo. 1 having been raised in the present case, it is the\nduty of this court to consider and decide such point.\n\nArgument of Respondent No. 2\n\n8. Learned counsel on behalf of the respondent No. 2 on the other\nhand, has relied upon following judgements: -\n\na. Judgment passed by this court in W.P. (C) No. 6 of 2002\ndated 3.3.2006 (paragraph no. 9) to submit that the present\nwrit petition has been filed challenging the award and\nthere is no dispute that the impugned award is\ngoverned by the provisions of\nArbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996\n(hereinafter referred to as the Act\nof 1996) and appropriate remedy to challenge the award\nis under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996. He submits that this court, in paragraph 9 of\n\nthe said judgment\n, has held that in view of the Scheme\nof the Act of 1996, and particularly the spirit of\nSection 5\n\nthereof, there was no reason for the writ court to\nexercise its discretionary jurisdiction to entertain the\nchallenge to the award on the grounds which were\nurged in the said case.\n\nb. Judgment reported in (2003) 5 SCC 399 (para 13 ) (\nSeth\nChand Ratan versus Pandit Durga Prasad and others\n) to\nsubmit that the statutory remedies which are provided\nunder the statute cannot be bypassed to take recourse to\nproceeding under\nArticles 226\nand\nof the\nConstitution of India and such a course of action may\nenable a litigant to defeat the provisions of the statute\nwhich may provide for certain conditions for filing the\nappeal, like limitation, payment of court fees or deposit\nof some amount or fulfilment of some other conditions\nfor entertaining the appeal. Learned counsel submits\nthat as per the provisions of the\nMSMED Act\n, there is\ncondition of pre-deposit to the extent of 75% of the\naward for challenging the same and in the instant case,\nthe petitioner cannot be permitted to by-pass the\nstatutory remedies and pre-deposit and challenge the\naward under\nArticle 226\nand\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\nc. The learned counsel for the respondent has also referred\nto a judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nreported in (2005) 8 SCC 618 (SBP and CO Limited versus\nPatel Engineering Limited and another) para 45 and\njudgment reported in (2010) 8 SCC 110, para 44,to submit\nthat the present writ petition is not maintainable against\nan award.\n\n9. Learned counsel referred to the impugned award to submit\nthat the point of jurisdiction has been decided by the\nrespondent no. 1. He further refers to\nSection 16\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to submit that the plea,\nthat the arbitral tribunal does not have the jurisdiction, has to\nbe raised before the Arbitral Tribunal itself and the same once\ndecided by the Arbitral Tribunal can be challenged under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. He\nsubmits that the point of jurisdiction and other points which\nwere raised and considered by the respondent no. 1 while\npassing the award could have been challenged by the\npetitioner under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996 which has to be filed within the stipulated time\nframe and has limited scope for interference against the\narbitral award. Learned counsel has also submitted that the\nsubject matter of dispute was within the jurisdiction of the\nrespondent no. 1 and it cannot be said that the award suffers\nfrom patent lack of jurisdiction. The learned counsel hastens to\nadd that the jurisdiction once decided in terms of\nSection 16\nof\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, whatever be its\nnature, can be raised only by way of objection under\nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n10. Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions regarding the\nproper remedy under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, learned counsel also submits that the\npresent case cannot be said to be a case of patent lack of\njurisdiction, in as much as, in order to examine the jurisdiction\nof the respondent no. 1 the records as well as other plea of the\nparties is required to be examined requiring appreciation of\nmaterials on record and legality of the arbitral award on\nmerits.\n\nRejoinder Argument of the petitioners\n\n11. In response, Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\npetitioners submits that there is no dispute that the arbitration\naward passed by the respondent no. 1 could have been\nchallenged under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, but this by itself does not ousted the\njurisdiction of this court to entertain challenge to the\nimpugned award under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of\nIndia particularly when a plea of jurisdiction and gross\nviolation of principles of natural justice while passing the\nimpugned award are grounds of challenge. The learned\ncounsel has also referred to the judgment which has been\nrelied upon by the respondent passed in W.P. (C) No. 6 of\n2002, and he refers to paragraph 7 thereof to submit that this\ncourt, while considering the challenge to another award\npassed by the Respondent No. 1, refused to entertain the writ\npetition as it was not the case that the reference itself was not\nmaintainable and the supplier was not an enterprises covered\nunder the provisions of\nMSMED Act, 2006\n. The learned\ncounsel for the petitioners submits that the aforesaid grounds\nare the points of challenge in the present case and therefore the\nwrit petition is maintainable and accordingly the said\njudgment which has been relied upon by the respondent No. 2\nis actually in favour of the writ petitioners.\nFindings of the Court\n\n12. After hearing the learned counsels for the parties, this court\nfinds that there is no dispute that the impugned arbitration\naward in the present case is dated 28.06.2018 which has been\nchallenged before this Court by filing the present writ petition\non 12.09.2018. The notices were issued to the respondent no. 2\nvide order dated 04.10.2018 and the respondent no. 2 appeared\nby filing a Vakalatnama.\n\n13. After hearing counsel for the parties and after going through\nthe materials on record, this court finds that the present\npetitioners had raised the plea before the respondent no. 1\nchallenging the maintainability of the case filed by the\nRespondent No. 2. It was also pleaded that the claimant is not\ncovered within the definition of supplier as defined under\n\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006\n\nand that the claimant became a supplier within the meaning of\nthe said Act of 2006 w.e.f. 26.03.2015 and accordingly, the\nclaimant could not claim benefit under the Act for supply of\nservices rendered by it before 26.03.2015. It was also the case of\nthe petitioners before the respondent no. 1 that the claim itself\nwas barred by limitation. The aforesaid plea was objected by\nthe respondent no.2 in the proceedings before the respondent\nno.1. The respondent no. 1 decided the aforesaid points vide\nanother order dated 25.05.2018 and has been recorded in the\nimpugned award. Upon going through the impugned award,\nthis court finds that the point of jurisdiction was raised and\nargued by the parties and was decided on 25.05.2018 by citing\nreasons.\n\n14. This Court finds that in the judgment passed by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the case reported in (2005) 8 SCC 618 (\nS.B.P.\nand Company vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Another\n), it has been\nheld in paragraph 45 and 46 as under:-\n\n45. It is seen that some High Courts have proceeded on the basis that\nany order passed by an Arbitral Tribunal during arbitration, would be\ncapable of being challenged under\nArticle 226\nor 227 of the\nConstitution. We see no warrant for such an approach.\nSection 37\n\nmakes certain orders of the Arbitral Tribunal appealable. Under\nSection\n, the aggrieved party has an avenue for ventilating its grievances\nagainst the award including any in-between orders that might have been\npassed by the Arbitral Tribunal acting under\nSection 16\nof the Act. The\nparty aggrieved by any order of the Arbitral Tribunal, unless has a right\nof appeal under\nSection 37\nof the Act, has to wait until the award is\npassed by the Tribunal. This appears to be the scheme of the Act. The\nArbitral Tribunal is, after all, a creature of a contract between the\nparties, the arbitration agreement, even though, if the occasion arises,\nthe Chief Justice may constitute it based on the contract between the\nparties. But that would not alter the status of the Arbitral Tribunal. It\nwill still be a forum chosen by the parties by agreement. We, therefore,\ndisapprove of the stand adopted by some of the High Courts that any\norder passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is capable of being corrected by the\nHigh Court under\nArticle 226\nor 227 of the Constitution. Such an\nintervention by the High Courts is not permissible.\n\n46. The object of minimising judicial intervention while the matter is in\nthe process of being arbitrated upon, will certainly be defeated if the\nHigh Court could be approached under\nArticle 227\nor under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution against every order made by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to indicate that once the arbitration has\ncommenced in the Arbitral Tribunal, parties have to wait until the\naward is pronounced unless, of course, a right of appeal is available to\nthem under\nSection 37\nof the Act even at an earlier stage.\n\n15. There is no dispute that objection to jurisdiction can be raised\nunder\nsection 16\nof the aforesaid Act of 1996 and has been\nraised in the present case before the Respondent no.1 and has\nbeen decided vide order dated 25.05.2018 against the present\npetitioners. Applying the law\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in (2005) 8 SCC 618 (supra), such decision on\nthe point of jurisdiction is also subject to challenge under\nSection 34\nand also under\nSection 37\nof the said Act of 1996\nonce the final award is passed. In the present case,\nappreciation of facts and law would be required for the\npurpose of deciding the jurisdiction of the respondent no. 1.\nThere is no dispute, even from the side of the petitioners that\nthe application for setting aside the award under\nSection 34\nof\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is maintainable\nbefore the competent court, even on the point of jurisdiction.\n\n16. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported in (2003)\n5 SCC 399 (Seth Chandra Pd. Versus Pandit Durga Prasad) at\nParagraph No. 13 has categorically held that the litigant cannot\nbe permitted to defeat the provisions of the Statute which may\nprovide for certain conditions for filing of appeal, like\nlimitation, payment of court fee or deposit of some amount or\nfulfilment of some other conditions for entertaining the appeal\nand they may not be permitted to bypass the said remedy to\ntake recourse to proceeding under\nArticle 226\nand\nof the\nConstitution of India. Paragraph No. 13 of the aforesaid\njudgment is quoted hereunder for ready reference.\n\nPara-13. Even otherwise, the view taken by the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court for repelling the objection of the appellant regarding the\nmaintainability of the writ petition that an alternative remedy does not\ndivest the High Court of its powers to entertain petitions under\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution, has hardly any application on the facts\nof the present case. It has been settled by a long catena of decisions that\nwhen a right or liability is created by a statute, which itself prescribes the\nremedy or procedure for enforcing the right or liability, resort must be\nhad to that particular statutory remedy before seeking the discretionary\nremedy under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of\nstatutory remedies is no doubt a rule of policy, convenience and\ndiscretion and the court may in exceptional cases issue a discretionary\nwrit of certiorari. Where there is complete lack of jurisdiction for the\nofficer or authority or tribunal to take action or there has been a\ncontravention of fundamental rights or there has been a violation of rules\nof natural justice or where the Tribunal acted under a provision of law,\nwhich is ultra vires, then notwithstanding the existence of an alternative\nremedy, the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief. In the\npresent case, the alternative remedy of challenging the judgment of the\ncourt was not before some other forum or tribunal. On the contrary, by\nvirtue of sub-section (3) of\nSection 27\nof the Act, the order passed by the\ncourt amounted to a decree against which an appeal lay to the High\nCourt. When the party had statutory remedy of assailing the order passed\nby the District Court by filing an appeal to the High Court itself, he could\nnot bypass the said remedy and take recourse to proceedings under\n\nArticles 226\nand\nof the Constitution. Such a course of action may\nenable a litigant to defeat the provisions of the statute which may provide\nfor certain conditions for filing the appeal, like limitation, payment of\ncourt fee or deposit of some amount or fulfilment of some other conditions\nfor entertaining the appeal.\n\n17. So far as the judgement relied upon by the petitioners in the\ncase of\nWhirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks,\nMumbai and Others\nreported in (1998) 8 SCC 1 is concerned, it\nhas been clearly held in Para 15 that under\nArticle 226\nof the\nconstitution , the High Court, having regard to the facts of the\ncase, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ\npetition, but the High Court has imposed upon itself certain\nrestrictions, one of which is that if an efficacious remedy is\navailable, the High Court would not normally exercise its\njurisdiction. In this background, it has been held that the\nalternative remedy would not be a bar at least in three\ncontingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed\nfor the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where\nthere has been a violation of the principle of natural justice or\nwhere the order or proceedings are wholly without\njurisdiction or the validity of an Act is challenged. Thus, it is\nclear that while entertaining the writ petition also, the court\nhas to exercise sound discretion based on the facts of the cases\nas well as the statutory scheme dealing with the matter and it\ncannot be said that merely because a point of jurisdiction is\ninvolved, the writ petition has to be necessarily involved. In\nthe said judgement the Hon'ble Supreme court has referred to\njudgement passed in the case of Rashid Ahmed -versus-\nMunicipal Board reported in AIR 1950 SC 163 and held in\nPara 16 as follows:-\n\n16.\"\nRashid Ahmed v. Municipal Board\n. Kairana laid down that\nexistence of an adequate legal remedy was a factor to be taken into\nconsideration in the matter of granting writs.\n\nThis was followed by\n\nanother Rashid\ncase, namely\nK.S. Rashid & Son v. Income Tax\nInvestigation Commission\nwhich reiterated the above proposition and\nheld that where alternative remedy existed, it would be a sound\nexercise of discretion to refuse to interfere in a petition under Article\n\n226. This proposition was; however, qualified by the significant\nwords, \" unless there are good grounds therefor\" which indicated that\nalternative remedy would not operate as an absolute bar and that writ\npetition under\nArticle 226\ncould still be entertained in exceptional\ncircumstances.\"\n\nThis court finds that in the aforesaid judgement, the show\ncause notice itself was challenged and the same was ultimately\nquashed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court by holding that the\nRegistrar could not have legally issued suo-motu notice under\n\nSection 56(4)\nof the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958\nfor cancellation of certificates of registration/renewal already\ngranted.\n\nThe facts in the present case is totally different. The\njurisdictional issue was raised and contested before the arbitral\ntribunal and decided by a reasoned order and subsequently\nfinal award was passed which is under challenge in this writ\npetition. In such circumstances, this court is not inclined to\nexercise powers under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of\nIndia as such exercise of power would be against the very\nscheme of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nand the\nissue involves appreciation of the facts of the case.\n\n18. The Judgment, relied upon by the petitioners, reported in\n(2017) 8 SCC 830 (\nS.N.D.P. Sakhayogam vs. Kerala Atmavidya\nSangham and Others\n) arose out of suit filed in the civil court and\nthe impugned judgement was the judgement passed by the\nconcerned High Court in second appeal. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt considering the point of jurisdiction involved, which\nwas not taken note of the concerned courts, remanded the\nmatter to the trial court for disposal of the suit afresh. This\njudgement does not help the petitioners in any manner as the\nissue of jurisdiction was raised and contested by the parties\nbefore the respondent no. 1 and it was duly decided by citing\nreasons. The petitioners, instead of availing the statutory\nremedy under the aforesaid Act of 1996 as per the procedure\nprescribed under the statute, filed the present writ petition\nchallenging the award on the point of jurisdiction. This court is\nnot inclined to entertain this writ petition under Article\n226/227 of the Constitution of India which has been filed\nbypassing the statutory remedies. It cannot be said that once a\nwrit petition has been filed challenging jurisdiction of the\nauthority or alleging violations of the principles of natural\njustice, the writ petition has to be necessarily entertained and\ndecided on merits. Such an interpretation would be against the\nvery nature of extra ordinary discretionary jurisdiction\nexercised under\nArticle 226\nof the constitution of India and\nalso against the scheme of the aforesaid Act of 1996 as the\npoint of jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is required to be\nraised as per the scheme of the Act of 1996 with particular\nreference to\nSection 16\nthereof and the remedy as well as the\nmanner of availing the remedy against such decision is\nprovided under the Act itself.\n\n19. So far as the Judgment reported in 2019 (4) JCR 243 (Jhr.) [State\nProject Director, through Uma Shankar Singh versus M/s. Raj\nEnterprises, Nainital (Uttarakhand)] is concerned, the same does\nnot apply to the facts and circumstances of this case as in the\nsaid case, this court has considered the point as to whether a\nwrit petition under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India is\nmaintainable against an order passed by the commercial court\nand it has been held that the writ petition would be\nmaintainable, but the Courts would be very slow in\nentertaining such writ petition considering the object of the\n\nCommercial Courts Act, 2015\n. In the said case, the petition of\nthe petitioner that the award was a nullity was not taken on\nrecord by the learned executing court on the ground of expiry\nof 120 days as prescribed under order VIII\nRule 1 of C.P.C\nas\napplicable to the commercial courts. In such circumstances, the\nwrit petition filed against the order of executing court was\nheld to be maintainable and was also entertained and the\nmatter was remitted back to the learned executing court\nconsidering the facts and circumstances of the said case.\n\nIn the present case, the arbitral award has been\nchallenged and the proceedings does not arise from any order\npassed by learned court below although it is not in dispute\nthat on the date of filing of this writ petition, no case was\npending for execution of the award. There is a vast difference\nbetween entertaining a writ petition against an arbitral award\nand entertaining a writ petition against an order passed by the\ncourt below in the matter of execution of award. Accordingly,\nthe aforesaid judgement does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case.\n\n20. The judgement passed by this court being W.P. (C) No. 6378\nof 2014 dated 14.06.2018 also does not apply to the facts and\ncircumstances of this case where a writ petition was\nentertained and decided by holding that power of the High\nCourt under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India is plenary\nin nature and involvement of contractual dispute or\navailability of alternative remedy cannot, ipso-facto, be a\nground for dismissal of a writ petition and it was held that\narbitrariness in State action involving public law element can\nbe examined under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India .\nThis judgement does not apply to the facts of this case where\narbitral award is directly under challenge bypassing the\nstatutory remedies under the aforesaid Act of 1996.\n\n21. So far as the judgment reported in (2018) 13 SCC 462 (\nBank of\nIndia vs. Yadav Consultancy Services Private Limited and another\n)\nis concerned, this court finds that in the said case, the award\nwas challenged under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 wherein certain point of jurisdiction was\ntaken and thereafter, the matter was challenged before the\nHigh Court under\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 which was also dismissed. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court was of the considered view that the High\nCourt erred in not considering the question of lack of\njurisdiction as raised by the counsel. This Court finds that\nthere is no dispute that the point regarding lack of jurisdiction\ncan be raised under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 if it comes within the permissible\ngrounds and the judgment under\nsection 34\ncan be subject\nmatter of further challenge under\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 and the courts under the Act of 1996\nare under an obligation to decide the point of jurisdiction/lack\nof jurisdiction in accordance with law. In the instant case,\nadmittedly the petitioners have not approached the Civil\nCourt under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996 and accordingly, have not approached this court under\n\nSection 37\nof the aforesaid Act of 1996. Rather the petitioners\nhave straightway challenged the award under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution of India raising the point of jurisdiction of the\narbitral tribunal, which has already been decided by the\ntribunal by a reasoned order as stated above. Considering the\nnature of extra-ordinary and discretionary jurisdiction under\n\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India and the facts and\ncircumstances of this case coupled with the scheme of the\naforesaid act of 1996, this court is not inclined to entertain the\nwrit petition and is of the view that the writ petition is not\nmaintainable.\n22. A coordinate bench of this court in judgment dated 03.03.2016\npassed in WPC No. 6/2002 has held in Para 8 that when\nspecific grounds to assail an award are already available for\nchallenge under\nsection 34\nof the aforesaid Act of 1996, there is\nno reason why the petitioner should not have availed the\nstatutory remedy available under the provisions of the Act of\n1996 which are in the nature of special legislation. The counsel\nfor the petitioners has tried to distinguish this case by referring\nto certain observation of the court in Para 7 of the said\njudgement and submitted that it has been observed that\nin that\ncase\n, there was no such ground that the reference itself was not\nmaintainable by alleging that the supplier itself was not\ncovered under the provision of the\nMSMED Act, 2006\n.\n\nThis court is of the considered view that the said\ndistinguishing feature has no bearing in this writ petition as\nthe said point alleging that the Respondent No. 2 was not\ncovered under the\nMSMED Act, 2006\nhas been considered by\nthe arbitral award and it is not in dispute that such point can\nbe subject matter of challenge under\nSection 34\nof the aforesaid\nAct of 1996. In this view of the matter, the legal principle as\nheld by this Court in Para 8 of the said judgement is still\napplicable to the facts of this case and applying the said\nprinciple of law, this court is not inclined to entertain this writ\npetition.\n\n23. As a result of the aforesaid findings, this court is not inclined\nto entertain the present writ petition filed by the petitioners\nagainst the impugned award and is also of the considered\nview that the present writ petition against the impugned\naward is not maintainable. Accordingly, the writ petition is\ndismissed.\n\n24. However, dismissal of this writ petition will not come in the\nway of the writ petitioners to take appropriate remedies as\nmay be available to the petitioners in accordance with law and\nit is observed that dismissal of this case or any observation\nmade in this order will not prejudice either of the parties in\nany manner whatsoever as this court has not entered into the\nmerits of rival claims of the respective parties.\n\n25. Since the writ petition is not being entertained and is held to\nbe not maintainable against an award governed by the\nprovisions of\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n, the\nInterlocutory Application No. 5585 of 2019 filed by the\nRespondent No. 2 seeking direction upon the petitioners to\ndeposit the statutory amount in this writ petition is also\ndismissed.\n\n26. Any other pending Interlocutory application is dismissed as\nnot pressed.\n\n27. Let a copy of this judgement be immediately handed over to\nthe learned counsel for the parties.\n\n(Anubha Rawat Choudhary, J.)\nBinit/",
