PARDIWALA, J. :\n\n “A fair trial is one in which the rules of evidence are\n\n honored, the accused has competent counsel, and the judge\n\n enforces the proper court room procedures - a trial in which every\n\n assumption can be challenged.”\n\n ─ Harry Browne\n\n 1. These appeals are at the instance of a convict accused\n\n Signature Not Verified\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n satish kumar yadav\n\n Date: 2023.09.04\n\n sentenced to death for the offence of rape and murder of a\n 17:09:27 IST\n Reason:\n\n 10-year old girl named “X” and are directed against a common\n\n 1\n\n\fjudgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature at\n\nPatna dated 10.04.2018 in the Death Reference No. 4 of 2017\n\nwith Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 358 of 2017 by which the High\n\nCourt dismissed the Criminal Appeal filed by the appellant\n\nconvict herein and thereby confirmed the judgment of conviction\n\nand sentence of death passed by the Additional Sessions Judge-\n\nI, Bhagalpur in the Sessions Trial No. 581 of 2015 for the offence\n\npunishable under Sections 302 and 376 resply of the \nIndian\n\nPenal Code\n (for short, ‘\nIPC\n’) and \nSection 4\n of the Protection of\n\nChildren from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short, ‘\nPOCSO\n\nAct\n’).\n\n2. Before we proceed to give a fair idea as regards the\n\nprosecution case, it has to be mentioned that the High Court\n\nhad before it not only the appeal filed by the accused but also a\n\nreference made by the Sessions Court for confirmation of the\n\ncapital sentence under \nSection 366\n of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, 1973 (\nCrPC\n). Time and again this Court has pointed\n\nout that on a reference for confirmation of the sentence of death,\n\nthe High Court is under an obligation to proceed in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of Sections 367 and 368 resply of the \nCrPC\n.\n\nUnder these Sections the High Court must not only see whether\n\nthe order passed by the Sessions Court is correct but it is under\n\nan obligation to examine the entire evidence for itself, apart from\n\n 2\n\n\fand independently of the Sessions Court's appraisal and\n\nassessment of that evidence. From the long line of decisions\n\nwhich have taken this view it would be enough to refer to the\n\ndecisions in \nJumman v. State of Punjab\n, AIR 1957 SC\n\n469; \nRama Shankar Singh @ Ram Shankar Roy v. State of\n\nWest Bengal\n, AIR 1962 SC 1239; and \nBhupendra\n\nSingh v. State of Punjab\n, AIR 1968 SC 1438.\n\nFACTS OF THE CASE\n\n3. The facts of the case as recorded by the High Court in its\n\nimpugned judgment are stated hereinbelow:-\n\n “3. Short fact of the case is that on 01.06.2015 at about\n 12:45 PM, fardbeyan of Kiran Devi (P.W.2) wife of Arvind\n Sah and mother of the victim was recorded by Sub-\n Inspector of Police-cum-S.H.O. Smt. Rita Kumari of Sabour\n Police Station. The fardbeyan was recorded in the house\n of Nawal Kishore Ojha @ Fuchan Pandey. Nawal Kishore\n Ojha @ Fuchan Pandey is the own brother of the appellant\n and in the said house, there were two rooms and one\n room, from where dead body was recovered, was in\n possession of the appellant. In the fardbeyan, the\n informant/P.W.2 stated that on preceding date i.e.\n 31.05.2015, she was in the house of her late sister\n Shakila Devi in the village Jamunia Parbatta. On the\n same date at about 12:00 noon, her elder daughter\n namely Priya Kumari (P.W.3) telephonically informed her\n that her younger sister (victim) was missing. Thereafter,\n she immediately moved for Sabour. After arrival in her\n house in village Sabour, her elder daughter Priya\n informed her that the victim had gone to watch television\n in the house of Munna Pandey (appellant). When she did\n not return till 11:00 AM, only thereafter, she (Priya)\n informed the informant. While the informant went to the\n house of Munna Pandey (appellant) in search of her\n daughter, she found that the house of Munna Pandey\n\n 3\n\n\f (appellant) was locked. Thereafter, with some villagers,\n the informant vigorously searched her daughter, but she\n (victim) could not be traced. When Munna Pandey\n (appellant) was asked to open the lock, he told that key\n was not with him. Thereafter, she telephoned Fuchan\n Pandey (brother of appellant Munna Pandey), who at the\n relevant time was staying in his in-laws’ house. On 01-\n\n 06-2015, Nawal Kishore Ojha @ Fuchan Pandey at about\n 12:00 noon came to his house and opened the lock of his\n room. In the said room, Pritam Tiwary son of Dilip Tiwary,\n resident of village Shobhapur, P.S. Rajmahal, District –\n Sahebganj had concealed himself. The lock of the room\n was opened from the outside. When lock of the room of\n Munna Pandey (appellant) was opened, dead body of the\n daughter of the informant was found beneath the bed.\n The informant claimed that Pritam Tiwary and Munna\n Pandey (appellant) both after committing rape with her 11\n years old daughter by way of throttling had killed her and\n the dead body was concealed in his room. The fardbeyan\n was read over to the informant and after finding it correct,\n she, in presence of Babloo Sao (P.W.1), son of informant’s\n sister of village Jamunia, P.S. Parbatta, Naugachia, put\n her signature.”\n\n4. On the basis of the complaint (Fardbeyan) lodged by the\n\nmother of the victim PW 2 – Kiran Devi, the police registered a\n\nformal First Information Report (FIR) on the very same day i.e.\n\non 01.06.2015 at 3.00 pm at the Sabour Police Station as Case\n\nNo. 106 of 2015 for the offence punishable under Sections\n\n376(D), 302, 201 read with \nSection 34\n of the IPC and \nSection 4\n\nof the POCSO Act against the appellant herein and co-accused\n\nPritam Tiwari (brother-in-law of the elder brother of the\n\nappellant namely Naval Kishore Ojha @ Fuchan Pandey).\n\n 4\n\n\f5. On conclusion of the investigation, charge sheet was filed\n\nagainst the appellant herein and the co-accused named above.\n\nAs the offence was exclusively trialable by a Sessions Judge, the\n\ncase stood committed by the Magistrate to the Court of Sessions\n\nunder the provisions of \nSection 209\n of the CrPC and upon\n\ncommittal, the same came to be registered as the Sessions Trial\n\nNo. 581 of 2015 in the Court of the First Additional District and\n\nSessions Judge, Bhagalpur.\n\n6. The Trial Court framed charge vide order dated\n\n04.11.2015 against the appellant and the co-accused for the\n\noffence punishable under Sections 376(2)(g), 302 read with\n\nSection 34\n, \n120B\n of the IPC and \nSection 4\n of the POCSO Act.\n\n7. After framing of the charge, the co-accused namely\n\nPritam Tiwari raised the plea of being a juvenile. In such\n\ncircumstances, his case was separated vide order dated\n\n03.02.2016 passed by the Trial Court and was referred to the\n\nJuvenile Justice Board, Bhagalpur. The Trial Court proceeded\n\nonly against the appellant convict herein.\n\n8. In the course of the trial, the prosecution led the following\n\noral evidence:-\n\n (a) PW 1 Babloo Saw is the cousin brother of the\n\n deceased and son of sister of the First Informant at\n\n 5\n\n\f whose place, the informant had gone on 31.05.2015.\n\n This witness proved his signature on the fardbeyan,\n\n which was marked as Ext. 1 and he also proved the\n\n signature of Kiran Devi/P.W.2 (informant) of the case,\n\n which was marked as Ext. 1/1.\n\n (b) PW 2 Kiran Devi is the informant and mother of\n\n the deceased.\n\n (c) PW 3 Priya Kumari is the elder daughter of the\n\n informant and also the elder sister of the deceased.\n\n (d) PW 4 Dr. Sandeep Lal, who at the relevant time,\n\n was posted in the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and\n\n Hospital, Bhagalpur conducted the post-mortem\n\n examination on the dead body of the deceased.\n\n (e) PW 5 Rita Kumari is the investigating officer and\n\n she recorded the fardbeyan of the informant.\n\n (f) PW 6 Vijay Prasad Sah is a co-villager and he\n\n deposed that in his presence, the dead body was\n\n recovered from the room of the appellant.\n\n9. Upon conclusion of recording of the oral evidence, the\n\nfurther statement of the appellant convict was recorded by the\n\n 6\n\n\fTrial Court under \nSection 313\n of the CrPC. The appellant convict\n\nstated as under:-\n\n “I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated. I was not\n living in the house from where the dead body was\n recovered. I was residing in a rented house situated in\n Mali Tola. I executed a deed in favour of my brother\n Fuchan Pandey relating to an parental house situated at\n Thatheri Tola and my brother Fuchan Pandey was living\n in the house from where the dead body was recovered.”\n\n10. Upon appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence\n\non record, the Trial Court recorded a finding that the appellant\n\nherein was guilty of the offence he was charged with. The Trial\n\nCourt treated the case as one falling under the category of\n\n“rarest of the rare cases” and sentenced the appellant to death.\n\n11. The appellant herein being aggrieved with the judgment\n\nand order of conviction and capital sentence passed by the Trial\n\nCourt went in appeal before the High Court. The High Court\n\ndismissed the appeal filed by the appellant convict and\n\nconfirmed the capital sentence imposed by the Trial Court in the\n\nDeath Reference No. 4 of 2017.\n\n12. In such circumstances \nreferred to above\n, the appellant\n\nconvict is here before this Court with the present appeals.\n\n 7\n\n\fSUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT\n\n13. Dr. Aditya Sondhi, the learned senior counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellant convict, made the following submissions:-\n\n “1 . Case purely of circumstantial evidence\n 1.1 The case against the Appellant, Munna Pandey is\n based only on the last seen evidence and the conduct of\n the Appellant and hence entirely circumstantial in nature.\n\n It is a well established principle settled by this Hon’ble\n Court that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the\n circumstances against the accused ought to be conclusive\n in nature and there must be a chain of evidence so\n complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the\n conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused\n and must show that in all human probability the act must\n have been done by the accused.\n\n 2. Failure to conduct medical examination\n u/s 53A\n\n CrPC is fatal to the case of the prosecution.\n 2.1 Medical examination of the accused\n u/s 53A\n of\n CrPC is required in cases of rape. Even though the\n Appellant was taken to the hospital for the treatment of\n his injuries incurred during the time of arrest, he was not\n subjected to any such medical examination where his\n samples were collected for the purpose of DNA\n examination.\n\n \n2.2 In cases of rape where the victim is dead and the\n offence is sought to be established only by circumstantial\n evidence, medical evidence assumes great importance.\n The failure of the prosecution to subject the appellant to\n medical examination is fatal to the prosecution’s case.\n (\nChotkau v State of Uttar Pradesh\n 2022 SCCOnline SC\n 1313 para 81,82)\n 2.3 If no DNA examination is conducted and if no\n reasonable explanation is provided by the prosecution for\n not conducting a DNA examination, adverse\n consequences would fall on the prosecution. Moreover, if\n reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of\n the accused will not afford evidence as to the commission\n of an offence, it is quite unlikely that a charge-sheet\n would even be filed against the accused for committing\n an offence of rape.\n \n(\nRajendra Prahladrao Wasnik v State\n\n 8\n\n\fof Maharashtra\n (2019) 12 SCC 495 para 49-57; \nPrakash\nNishad @ Kewat v State of Maharashtra\n 2023 SCCOnline\nSC 666 para 57,58.59)\n\n3. Prosecution did not place on record the\nexculpatory evidence against the Appellant\n3.1 The underwear of the Appellant was seized by the\npolice on 01.06.2023 at 11:45 pm [Ex 6 (Seizure memo)],\nand the underwear of the deceased was seized on\n01.06.2015 at 11:00 pm [Ex 6/1 (Seizure memo)].\nHowever, the prosecution failed to prove if they were sent\nto the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination.\n3.2 As per the order dated 29.06.2015, a letter on\nbehalf of the officer in-charge of PS Sabour was filed\nbefore the Ld Trial Court seeking permission to send the\narticles to FSL Patna for examination. However PW5,\nReeta Kumari, the IO in her cross examination before the\nTrial Court on 24.10.2016 admitted that she followed the\ninstructions of her senior police officer and did not receive\nany FSL report. [PW5 para 8]\n3.3 Further the vaginal swab of the deceased collected\nat the time of post-mortem was sent by PW 4, Dr Sandeep\nLal to the pathology lab for examination. [Ex 2 (Post-\nmortem report)]. However, the pathological report which\nstates that ‘spermatozoa not found’ was not produced by\nthe prosecution as evidence at the time of trial.\n\n4. Last seen evidence not conclusively proved\nagainst the Appellant\n\n4.1 All the witnesses in their 161 statement stated\nthat the victim was last seen with Pritam Tiwari.\nHowever, PW1, PW2 and PW3 in their Court testimony,\nwhich was recorded 3 months after Pritam Tiwari was\ndeclared a Juvenile by the Juvenile Justice Board [Ex A\n(order of the JJB)] improved their statement and said\nthat it was Munna Pandey and not Pritam Tiwari.\nHowever, this was not corroborated by the independent\nwitness Vijay Sah (PW6). The said improvement on the\npart of the interested witnesses could be motivated by the\nfact that Pritam Tiwari (who was caught red handed)\nwas now only going to be subjected to a lenient\npunishment under the \nJuvenile Justice Act, 2000\n and\ntherefore the Appellant alone remained accused in the\nsubject case.\n\n 9\n\n4.2 There are material contradictions in PW3’s court\ntestimony and her 161 statement. In her 161 statement\nshe states that Pritam Tiwari came to her house at 09:00\nam and took the victim along with him to watch TV and\nafter 2 hours she saw Pritam Tiwari locking the grill of the\nverandah. Whereas in her Court testimony, she states\nthat Munna Pandey was last seen with the victim. PW3\nwas confronted with this particular contradiction by the\ndefense counsel during her cross- examination but PW3\ndoes not provide any reason for the said contradiction.\n4.3 PW2 in her Fardbeyan [Ex 1] which was recorded\nright after the victim’s body was recovered does not\nmention anything about the Appellant in the context of a\nlast seen evidence but improves her testimony in Court to\nstate that the Appellant was last seen with the victim.\nPW2 was confronted with this improvement in her cross\nexamination, where she merely stated that she had told\nthat Munna Pandey had spoken to her daughter PW3 and\nthat she did not state in her fardbeyan that PW3 saw\nMunna Pandey locking the door. This Hon’ble Court has\nheld that especially in cases involving heinous crimes,\nwhere there is inadequate cross-examination by the\ndefense counsel, the Trial Courts cannot be a mute\nspectator and they have the power and duty under\n\nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act, 1872 to discover relevant\nfacts when witnesses are not properly cross-\nexamined.(\nRahul v State of NCT of Delhi\n (2023) 1 SCC 83\npara 42-45)\n\n4.4 As per the case of the prosecution, on 31.05.2015\nat 09:00 when the Appellant came to the house of PW3 to\ntake the victim, the following persons were in the house\n\n- the victim, PW3 and Kushboo Devi (her aunt). However\nKushboo Devi, the aunt was not examined as a last seen\nwitness but only PW3 (a minor) was examined by the\nprosecution to prove its case.\n\n4.5 In cases where the child witness’s testimony\nregarding last seen evidence is inconsistent and when the\nmaterial witnesses are not examined by the prosecution,\nthe Court has rightly disbelieved the last seen evidence.\n(\nDigamber Vaishnav v State of Chhatisgarh\n (2019) 4 SCC\n522 para 40-43)\n\n 10\n\n\f5. Conduct of the accused at the relevant time\n5.1 Frequent quarrels used to take place between\nNaval Kishore Ojha @ Fucchan Pandey and Munna\nPandey and hence they have been residing separately.\nMunna Pandey was residing separately in a different\nhouse in Mali Tola. Fuchhan Pandey handed over the key\nto his house to Pritam Tiwari and Pritam Tiwari was\nresiding in the house of Fucchan Pandey for the past 2 to\n3 months. Further, Munna Pandey was called from\nelsewhere by the villagers every time, indicating that he\ndid not reside in the said house.\n\n5.2 As per the spot map and the spot mahazar, the\nbuilding consists of an outer iron grill door, a verandah, 1\nroom in the north and 1 in the south. The room in the north\nbelongs to Fuchhan Pandey and the room in the south\nbelongs to Munna Pandey. Pritam was found inside the\nroom of Fucchan Pandey and the victim was found in the\nroom of Munna Pandey. The room of Munna Pandey also\nhad 2 windows without any iron grill but only an outer\nwooden panel which was open. One window opened to\nthe verandah and the other window opened towards the\nmain road. The TV was in the room of Fucchan Pandey\nwhere Pritam was admittedly residing.\n\n5.3 The lock of the outer iron grill was broken open by\nthe villagers. The room of Fuchhan Pandey, where Pritam\nTiwari was present was locked from inside. The door of\nMunna Pandey’s room was opened by the keys brought\nby Fuchhan Pandey on 01.06.2015 [Ex 1].\n\n5.4 As per the case of the prosecution, the door of\nMunna Pandey’s room was opened by the villagers after\nthey snatched the keys from Munna Pandey although he\nclaimed that he did not have the keys to the house on the\nprevious day. As per the prosecution, this raised serious\ndoubts regarding his conduct. It is pertinent to note that\nthis suspicious conduct is not corroborated by the\nindependent witness PW6. Further, the villagers Manoj,\nAnil and Murrai who allegedly snatched the keys from\nMunna Pandey were not examined by the prosecution. It\nis pertinent to note that Munna Pandey did not flee from\nthe village overnight or on the next day when the dead\nbody of the victim was recovered. Further this particular\ncircumstance that the Appellant refused to give the keys\nto the villagers and threatened them with a case of\ndacoity was not put to him during his 313 statement. This\nHon’ble Court has repeatedly held that the circumstances\n\n 11\n\n\fnot put to the accused in his 313 examination cannot be\nrelied upon.(\nSharad Birdichand Sarda v State of\nMaharashtra\n (1984) 4 SCC 116 para 145)\n\n6. Alleged Confession of Pritam Tiwari implicating\nMunna Pandey cannot be relied upon\n6.1 As per the prosecution, right after Pritam Tiwari\nwas found in the house of Fucchan Pandey by the\nvillagers; he confessed to his crime and stated that he\nalong with Munna Pandey committed the offence against\nthe deceased. However, the said confession was made\nafter he was beaten by the police officers and was made\nin the presence of police officers. Due to the bar\n u/s 26\n\nof the Evidence Act, the said confession cannot be relied\nupon the Courts. Further this alleged confession is not\ncorroborated by the testimony of the independent witness\nVijay Sah (PW6). Pritam Tiwari was also not deposed as\na witness in this regard.\n\n7. 313 examination of the Appellant was not\nconducted in a proper manner\n\n7.1 Many crucial circumstances were not put to the\nAppellant in his 313 examination, though were\nconsidered as incriminating for the purpose of holding the\nappellant guilty of the offence. Those are as under:-\n\n● The circumstance of PW3 seeing the Appellant lock the\ngrill and the door of his room\n● The circumstance that the Appellant gave false\ninformation to PW3 that the victim had already left after\nwatching TV\n● The circumstance of the accused refusing to open the\ndoor as he did not have the key\n● The circumstance of the Appellant giving the keys to the\nvillagers after he was assaulted\n● The circumstance of the alleged extra-judicial\nconfession made by the co-accused Pritam Tiwari\nimplicating the Appellant\n\n7.2 This Hon’ble Court has consistently held that the\ncircumstances not put to the Appellant cannot be relied\nupon to convict an accused\n\n 12\n\n\f8. Flaws in the judgment of the Trial Court and the\nHigh Court\n\n8.1 The Trial Court in its judgment makes only a brief\ndiscussion of the evidence and erroneously records that\nPritam Tiwari and Munna Pandey were found inside the\nhouse.\n\n8.2 The High of Judicature at Patna, in the impugned\njudgment [at para 9]; observes that it is prima facie\nsatisfied that the Trial Court has not committed any error\nin both convicting the Appellant and sentencing him to\ndeath. In its said prima facie opinion on the matter it\nheavily relies on the deposition of interested witnesses\nPW1, PW2 and PW3 all of whom improved their versions.\nThe High Court has disregarded the evidence of the\nindependent witness and also the absence of material\nevidence, compliance with section 53A requirements, the\nabsence of FSL report and pathological report. Hence the\nsaid judgment suffers from perversity and is contrary to\nthe law\n\n9. Mitigation\n\n9.1 Without prejudice to the above submissions on\nmerits, the Courts below have incorrectly sentenced the\nAppellant to undergo the sentence of death.\n\n9.2 The Appellant has filed a mitigation report along\nwith the affidavits of the family members and the\nvillagers before this Hon’ble Court vide IA No 172211 of\n2022. The following are the mitigating circumstances of\nthe Appellant:\n\n(i) No criminal antecedents;\n\n(ii) Satisfactory jail conduct as certified by the\n\nSuperintendent of Shahid Jubba Sahni Central Jail,\nBhagalpur;\n\n(iii) Family impact - since his arrest, his family\nincluding his wife Sangeeta and his 2 sons - Krishna (18\nyears at the time of incident) and Balram (12 years at the\ntime of incident) were ostracized from the village and they\nhave been residing with Sangeeta’s parents in village\nPanchkathiya, Bihar\n\n(iv) Continued family ties\n\n 13\n\n\f (v)Strong community links - Munna Pandey’s wife\n Sangeeta was elected as the ward councilor in 2010. As\n per the affidavit of Mohd. Aktar @ Pairu Miyan (resident\n of village Sabour) the Appellant worked actively for the\n community alongside his wife. He was considered\n resourceful and many villagers approached him with their\n problems in the village.\n\n (vi) Age of the Appellant - he is currently 56 years old\n\n (vii) Strong probability of reformation”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n14. In such circumstances\n, \nreferred to above\n, the learned\n\ncounsel prayed that there being merit in his appeals, the same\n\nbe allowed and the judgment and order of conviction and capital\n\nsentence be set aside and the appellant may be acquitted of all\n\nthe charges.\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PROSECUTION\n\n15. On the other hand, these appeals were vehemently\n\nopposed by Mr. Samir Ali Khan, the learned counsel appearing\n\non behalf of the State. He submitted that no error, not to speak\n\nof any error of law, could be said to have been committed by the\n\nCourts below in holding the appellant guilty of the offence\n\ncharged with and treating the case to be one falling under the\n\ncategory of “rarest of the rare cases”.\n\n 14\n\n\f16. The learned counsel laid much stress on the fact that it\n\nwas the appellant who visited the house of the victim at 9 o’clock\n\nin the morning of 31.05.2015 and lured the victim to come to\n\nhis house to watch TV. It was argued that all the witnesses have\n\ndeposed that the victim went to the house of the appellant in the\n\nmorning on 31.05.2015 to watch TV and thereafter she went\n\nmissing. He submitted that the sister of the victim namely Priya\n\nKumari (PW 3) immediately informed her mother Kiran Devi (PW\n\n2) who at the relevant point of time was at the house of her sister\n\nat a different village. No sooner the mother of the victim came to\n\nknow that her daughter was missing, then she immediately\n\nrushed back to her house and started enquiring as regards the\n\nwhereabouts of her minor daughter. It was argued that the\n\nvictim could be said to have been last seen with the appellant.\n\nIt was also argued that when the house was opened, the dead\n\nbody of the victim was recovered beneath a cot and the room\n\nfrom where the dead body was recovered was of the ownership\n\nof the appellant. He submitted that it was for the appellant to\n\nexplain, how the dead body of the victim was recovered from the\n\nroom of his house over which he had full control. It was also\n\nargued that the PW 3 Priya Kumari in her deposition stated that\n\nshe had seen the appellant locking the door of his room. This is\n\nsuggestive of the fact that the keys of the room were with the\n\n 15\n\n\fappellant. The learned counsel submitted that the facts\n\nestablished are consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt\n\nof the appellant convict and are of a conclusive nature and\n\ntendency. He submitted that the chain of evidence is so complete\n\nthat it does not leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion\n\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused.\n\n17. In such circumstances \nreferred to above\n, the learned\n\ncounsel prayed that there being no merit in these appeals, those\n\nmay be dismissed.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n18. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nparties and having gone through the materials on record, the\n\nonly question that falls for our consideration is whether the High\n\nCourt committed any error in passing the impugned judgment?\n\n19. The case on hand is one of a very gruesome rape and\n\nmurder of a 10-year old girl. It is the case of the prosecution that\n\non the fateful day the victim had gone to the house of the\n\nappellant to watch TV. According to the prosecution, it is the\n\nappellant who came to the house of the victim and persuaded\n\nher to come at his house to watch TV. The elder sister of the\n\nvictim, PW 3 Priya Kumari was at home when her younger sister\n\nleft for the house of the appellant to watch TV. When the younger\n\n 16\n\n\fsister did not come back to her house, Priya Kumari started\n\nsearching for her and as her efforts failed to know the\n\nwhereabouts of her younger sister, she immediately informed\n\nher mother Kiran Devi (the first informant). At the relevant time,\n\nKiran Devi was at the house of her elder sister namely Shakila\n\nDevi at Jamunia Parbatta. The PW1 Babloo Saw is the son of\n\nShakila Devi. The PW 2 Kiran Devi happens to be the mousi of\n\nPW 1 Babloo Saw. It is the case of the prosecution that while\n\nKiran Devi was at the house of her elder sister Shakila Devi, she\n\nwas informed by Priya Kumari on telephone that the victim had\n\ngone to the house of the appellant in the morning to watch TV\n\nand thereafter she went missing. It was PW 1 Babloo Saw who\n\nbrought Kiran Devi on his motorcycle back to her village i.e. her\n\nhouse.\n\n20. We shall now look into the findings recorded by the High\n\nCourt in its impugned judgment. To put it in other words, the\n\ncircumstances relied upon by the High Court and the line of\n\nreasoning to hold the appellant herein guilty of the alleged crime\n\nis as follows:-\n\n “9 . … To start with, it would be firstly necessary to\n examine the first hand information, which has come\n from the mouth of elder daughter of the informant i.e.\n P.W.3 namely Priya Kumari. She was the main witness,\n who had seen that appellant had persuaded and\n\n 17\n\n\fenticed the victim to go with him on the pretext of\nwitnessing T.V. serial.\n\n10. … Munna Pandey (appellant) carried the victim, at\nthat time, it was about 9:00 AM (morning). After\npreparing food, she went to call the victim to the house\nof Munna Pandey (appellant), then she saw that Munna\nPandey (appellant) was putting lock on his door. She\nsaw that Munna Pandey (appellant), after putting lock\non his room, was coming out. When she reached near\nthe gate, till that time, Munna Pandey (appellant), after\nputting lock on gate also, was trying to move, then she\nasked Munna Pandey as to where is the victim, Munna\nPandey (appellant) replied that she, after witnessing\nT.V., had already gone. P.W.3 thereafter returned back\nto her house and tried to search nearby. When she did\nnot find the victim then she made telephone call to her\nmother (P.W.2, Kiran Devi) and informed her. Her mother\non the same date came back with her (Priya) cousin\nbrother Babloo (P.W.1). Again, this witness narrated\neverything to her mother. Thereafter, she, her mother,\naunt and cousin brother Babloo, all jointly started to\nsearch, but the victim was not traced, then they went to\nthe house of Munna Pandey (appellant), where it was\nnoticed that there was lock on the room of Munna\nPandey (appellant). Outer gate was also locked.\n\nThereafter, she inquired from other villagers, on which,\nvillagers called Munna Pandey, then he came. The\nappellant was inquired by villagers and her mother\n(P.W.2) also regarding the victim. The appellant said that\nhe was not having the key of the room. After noticing this\nfact, the villagers said that if he was not having key,\nthey will break the lock. On which, the appellant\nthreatened them for implicating in dacoity case, if lock is\nbroken. Munna Pandey (appellant) also stated that\nPritam (co-accused) was also not being located and he\nsaid that it appears that he had gone somewhere with\nthe victim. On the strength of such statement of Munna\nPandey (appellant), they started to search Pritam also,\nhowever; he could not be traced and thereafter, they\nreturned back to their house and again they went to the\nhouse of Munna Pandey (appellant), where she noticed\nthat some light was coming from inside the house of\nFuchan Pandey. Thereafter, the villagers raised some\nsuspicion, as if, in the room, there was someone. Munna\nPandey (appellant) was again asked to break the lock,\n\n 18\n\n\fthen he said that key was lying with Fuchan Pandey.\nVillagers thereafter telephoned Fuchan, at that very\ntime, he was in his in-laws’ house. Fuchan over\ntelephone informed that in the morning, he would come.\nSince by 8:00 AM, Fuchan did not arrive, P.W.3 with her\nmother went to Sabour Police Station, however; in the\nmeanwhile, Fuchan reached to his house. Villagers by\nusing force also pushed Munna and carried him to the\nsaid place. Thereafter, police also arrived there. Lock of\nouter gate was broken. Thereafter, the key of the room\nwas provided by Munna Pandey (appellant). From the\nroom of Fuchan, Pritam Tiwary came out. In presence of\nthe Police and villagers, Pritam was inquired as to where\nwas the victim, then he explained that victim was in the\nroom of Munna Pandey (appellant). Pritam also said that\nhe and Munna Pandey both had jointly raped the victim\nand thereafter, killed her. Dead body of the victim was\nfound beneath the bed of Munna Pandey (appellant). Her\nbody was undressed. Her urinal portion was swollen\nand blood had come out. She had also dispersed her\nwaste (potty) and it was also swollen. Police carried the\ndead body. She claimed to identify both accused\npersons, which includes appellant. In cross-examination\nin paragraph – 2, she stated that her father was living\nin Gujarat. She further stated that Fuchan Pandey is\nalso known as Nawal Kishore Ojha. In paragraph – 7 of\nher cross-examination, she claimed that she had seen\ntelevision in the room, where there was a bed, almirah\nincluding fan. In paragraph – 8, she further stated that\nshe was visiting the said room and stated that Munna\nPandey (appellant) was her neighbour. In paragraph –\n9, she explained that in search of the victim, they had\ngone to several places including block, chowk, station\nSabour etc. In paragraph 12, she stated that Fuchan\nPandey and Munna Pandey (appellant) were the full\nbrothers and both brothers were having one room each\nin their share. She stated in paragraph 12 that Munna\nPandey (appellant) was virtually residing somewhere\nelse and usually he was visiting to his room (place of\noccurrence). She further stated that she was not\nknowing about the rented house of Munna Pandey\n(appellant). Again, in paragraph 12 itself, she deposed\nthat earlier there was no complaint against Munna\nPandey (appellant). It is necessary to indicate that there\nwas no complaint against the appellant prior to the\n\n 19\n\n\foccurrence, which suggests that it was not a case of\nfalse implication due to any old animosity. Of course, her\nattention to her previous statement was drawn in\nparagraph 13 of her cross-examination, but while the\ninvestigating officer was being examined, no\ncontradiction was drawn and as such, there is no need\nto take note of such so called minor inconsistencies. She\ndenied the suggestion that she had given false evidence\nand falsely implicated the appellant. On examination of\nentire evidence of P.W.3, it is evident that though this\nwitness was cross-examined at length, nothing could be\nextracted to create any doubt on her evidence.\n\n11. … Munna Pandey (appellant) was also called by\nvillagers. When the villagers asked Fuchan to open lock,\nFuchan replied that he was not having key. Villagers\nthereafter started to assault Munna Pandey and asked\nhim to break the lock. When villagers broke one of the\nlock, then Munna Pandey (appellant) took out the key\nand from that key, lock of Fuchan’s door was opened,\nhowever; the room was closed from inside. When the\ndoor was pushed, it was opened by Pritam and he\nconcealed himself. All villagers entered into the house.\nPolice also arrived. Pritam was apprehended. When\nPritam was being assaulted, police had arrived there.\nLock of room of Munna was also opened by the villagers.\nFrom the room of Munna Pandey (appellant), dead body\nof the victim was recovered. Age of victim was 11 years\nold and dead body was kept beneath the bed and police\ntook out the dead body from beneath the bed. The\ninformant started crying. She further stated that the\ncloth of her daughter from lower portion was removed.\nShe noticed that urinal portion of her daughter was\nruptured and she also noticed potty there. She stated\nthat the anus was also ruptured. The face was swollen\nand on cheek also, there was sign of injury. Villagers\nthereafter started to assault Munna, Pritam and Fuchan.\nPritam, in presence of the Police, stated that he and\nMunna Pandey both jointly had committed the crime.\nThis witness stated that her fardbeyan was recorded by\nthe police at the place of occurrence itself and she\nidentified her signature as well as signature of Babloo\n(P.W.1) on the fardbeyan. Signature was identified as\nExt. 1/1. she claimed to identify Pritam and Munna\nPandey (appellant). At the time of cross-examination, it\nwas noticed by the Trial Judge that this witness was\n\n 20\n\n\fvery much nervous and also she was repeatedly\nweeping and this was the reason that cross-examination\non the date i.e. 21.06.2016 was deferred. This reflects\nregarding the agony suffered by the mother of the victim.\nIn paragraph 8 of her cross-examination, she stated that\nPriya (P.W.3) had informed on telephone that the victim\nwas traceless. She further deposed in paragraph - 8 of\nher cross-examination that family members of the\ninformant were in visiting term with Munna Pandey and\nhe was also visiting to the house of the informant. In\nparagraph -10 of her cross-examination, she stated that\nshe was not knowing anything about the criminal nature\nof the appellant. She stated that the appellant was her\nneighbour and this was the reason regarding their\nconversance. In paragraph - 11 of her cross-\nexamination, she stated that the room, in which, Pritam\nwas present was opened. The lock of room of Munna\nPandey (appellant) was opened. Munna Pandey\n(appellant) and Fuchan Pandey were residing\nseparately. One room was of Fuchan and one room was\nof Munna Pandey (appellant). She clarified in paragraph\n\n- 12 that 10-15 days prior to the occurrence, Fuchan had\nalready gone to his in-laws’ house situated at village\nShobhapur. In paragraph – 17 of her cross-examination,\nshe reiterated that dead body of her victim daughter\nwas found in the room of Munna Pandey, whereas,\nPritam Tiwary had concealed himself in the room of\nFuchan. In paragraph 19 and 20 of her cross-\n\nexamination, P.W.2 denied the suggestion that lock of\ntwo rooms were opened by Fuchan Pandey and denied\nthe suggestion that lock of the room of the Munna\nPandey (appellant) was also opened by Fuchan Pandey.\nIn paragraph - 23 of her cross-examination, she said that\nshe may not say exact date of recording fardbeyan,\nhowever; she said that she can say the day on which it\nwas recorded. She stated that Rita Madam i.e. P.W.5\nhad recorded fardbeyan and it was read over to her,\nhowever; she was not recollecting exactly what was the\ntime. In paragraph 26 and 27 of her cross-examination,\nshe stated that after arrival of Fuchan, when he denied\nregarding possession of the key, then the villagers\nstarted assaulting Munna Pandey (appellant). She\nstated that Pritam was apprehended by Vijay (P.W.6)\nBabloo (P.W.1) and other villagers and they also slapped\nPritam. Again in paragraph - 28 of her cross-\n\n 21\n\n\fexamination, she stated that the dead body of her\ndaughter was found in the house of Munna Pandey\n(appellant). On examination of her entire evidence,\nincluding cross-examination, it is evident that every fact\nrelating to the occurrence was reiterated in the cross\nexamination, but nothing could be doubted on her\nevidence.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n16. On examination of entire evidence, it is established\nthat the learned Trial Judge has rightly held the\nappellant guilty for commission of offence under \nSections\n302\n and \n376\n of the Indian Penal Code. The learned Trial\nJudge, after convicting the appellant by its judgment\ndated 02.02.2017, deferred the date of sentence and\nafter reasonable time, on 23.02.2017, the learned Trial\nJudge, after hearing both the parties and balancing the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances, had come to\nthe conclusion that it was a fit case for imposing death\nsentence and thereafter, death sentence was imposed\nand it was referred to this Court under \nSection 366\n of\nthe Cr.P.C. for its confirmation.\n\n17. The evidence of P.W.3 is very much specific that on\nthe date of occurrence in the morning, this appellant had\nreached the house of the informant, whereas, at that\nvery time, P.W.3 was preparing food. In her presence,\nthis appellant asked, rather lured the victim to\naccompany him for witnessing T.V. programme inside\nhis house. At first instance, P.W.3, elder sister of the\nvictim, asked that she can go only after taking meal, but\nthat too was prevented by the appellant and he\n(appellant) insisted and only thereafter, the victim, who\nwas aged about 11 years, had gone with the appellant\nin the garb of witnessing T.V. programme in his house.\nIn the evidence of P.W.2 informant/mother of the victim,\nthis fact has come that appellant was neighbour of the\ninformant and they were on visiting term. Meaning\nthereby that at the time, when the appellant had called\nthe victim, there was nothing in the mind of the elder\nsister that her younger sister aged about 11 years will\nbe raped by the appellant, who obviously on the date of\noccurrence was neither young nor very old. From the\njudgment of conviction and sentence, it appears that his\n(appellant) age was assessed as 50 years. Meaning\nthereby that beyond stretch of imagination, the elder\n\n 22\n\n\fsister was not having any apprehension that her minor\nsister can be raped by a person, who was neighbour and\naged about approaching 50 years. This was the reason\nthat victim was allowed to move with the appellant. The\nvictim, who was aged about 11 years, was also\noblivious of the fact that as to what was occurring in the\nmind of the appellant. After she was carried to the room\nand within few hours, when P.W.3 (elder sister of the\nvictim) went to the house of the appellant, she noticed\nthat this appellant after locking the door was coming out.\nThis was not the end, even on inquiry, this appellant\ngave false declaration that victim had already left after\nwitnessing T.V. programme. Again the criminal mind of\nthe appellant was operating and this was the reason\nthat even though, he had already committed rape and\nmurder of 11 years old girl and concealed the dead body\ninside his room, he gave false information to the elder\nsister of the victim (P.W.3). Since the victim could not be\ntraced by P.W.3 (Priya), the P.W.3 who was aged about\n15-16 years old, and this was the reason that she was\nnot in a position to take any further decision and she\nimmediately ranged her mother (informant), who had\ngone to village Jamunia, which was about 22 km. away\nfrom the village Sabour. She informed her mother\nregarding missing of the victim and she also explained\nregarding other circumstances, which were sufficient to\nraise suspicion on the appellant. Thereafter, the\ninformant from Jamunia came on a motorcycle with son\nof her late sister P.W.1 (Babloo Saw) and all of them\nagain went to the house of the appellant and this time\nthey noticed that house as well as outer gate of the\nappellant was locked and there was none, then the\nsearch was made for the victim. Subsequently, villagers\ncalled the appellant, who disclosed that he was not\nhaving the key and he pretended, as if, key was left with\nhis brother Fuchan Pandey, who was away and staying\nin his in-laws house. This time again this appellant gave\nfalse information. By way of searching, day time had\ncome to end of the day and in the evening, informant\nside and villagers noticed some light coming from the\nhouse of the appellant, then suspicion got strengthened.\nThereafter, again the villagers called the appellant for\nopening the door. On his denial, the villagers told that\nthey will break the lock of the door, in that event, this\nappellant threatened the villagers that if lock is broken,\n\n 23\n\n\f he will file a case of dacoity against them. All those\n things depict about the criminal mind of the appellant.\n Only in the next morning, when his brother Fuchan\n arrived, who was telephonically asked to come, and he\n disclosed that he was not having the key, the villagers\n started to assault the appellant and one lock was broken\n and only thereafter, this appellant took out the key.\n Ofcourse subsequently, the room, which was said to be\n in possession of the appellant, was opened and beneath\n the bed of the appellant, dead body in ruptured condition\n of the victim was found. Everything has already been\n discussed hereinabove, as was explained by the\n informant/P.W.2, P.W.3/Priya and P.W.1/Babloo.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n21. Thus, all throughout, the High Court proceeded on the\n\nfooting that it was the appellant convict who came to the house\n\nof the victim in the morning of 31.05.2015 and lured her to come\n\nto his house to watch TV. The High Court took the view that\n\nsince the dead body of the victim was recovered from the room\n\nowned by the appellant and he was seen by the PW 3 Priya\n\nKumari locking the door attached to his house, it could be none\n\nother than the appellant who could be said to have committed\n\nthe crime. The High Court completely forgot that there was a\n\nco-accused also namely Pritam Tiwari in the picture. Pritam\n\nTiwari being a juvenile was tried in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the \nJuvenile Justice Act, 2015\n and was held guilty\n\nand sentenced to three years imprisonment.\n\n 24\n\n\fFSL REPORT NOT OBTAINED:\n\n22. We noticed few very serious lapses in the entire\n\ninvestigation and, more particularly, the oral evidence of the\n\ninvestigating officer PW 5 Rita Kumari disturbed us a lot. The\n\ninvestigating officer in her cross examination deposed that in\n\naccordance with the order dated 29.06.2015 a letter on behalf of\n\nthe officer-in-charge of the Police Station, Sabour, was filed before\n\nthe Trial Court seeking permission to send the muddamal articles\n\nto the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), Patna for examination.\n\nHowever, the PW 5 Rita Kumari in her cross examination before\n\nthe Trial Court admitted that following the instructions of her\n\nsenior officers, she did not take any steps to procure FSL report.\n\nWho are these senior officers of PW 5 and why they instructed the\n\nPW 5 not to procure the FSL report should have been a subject\n\nmatter of inquiry by both, the State as well as the trial court.\n\n23. The aforesaid lapse is just a tip of the iceberg. We are at\n\npains to state that it is a very serious flaw on the part of the\n\ninvestigating officer and that too in such a serious matter.\n\nFAILURE TO CONDUCT MEDICAL EXAMINATION\n\n24. One another serious flaw in the present case on the part\n\nof the investigating officer that has come to our notice is the\n\nfailure to subject the appellant to medical examination by a\n\n 25\n\n\fmedical practitioner. No explanation, much less any reasonable\n\nexplanation, has been offered for such a serious flaw on the part\n\nof the investigating officer.\n\n25. \nSection 53(1)\n of the CrPC enables a police officer not below\n\nthe rank of sub-inspector to request a registered medical\n\npractitioner, to make such an examination of the person arrested,\n\nas is reasonably necessary to ascertain the facts which may afford\n\nsuch evidence, whenever a person is arrested on a charge of\n\ncommitting an offence of such a nature that there are reasonable\n\ngrounds for believing that an examination of his person will afford\n\nevidence as to the commission of an offence. Section 53(1) reads\n\nas follows:-\n\n “Section 53. Examination of accused by medical\n practitioner at the request of police officer.—(1)\n When a person is arrested on a charge of committing an\n offence of such a nature and alleged to have been\n committed under such circumstances that there are\n reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of\n his person will afford evidence as to the commission of an\n offence, it shall be lawful for a registered medical\n practitioner, acting at the request of a police officer not\n below the rank of sub-inspector, and for any person\n acting in good faith in his aid and under his direction, to\n make such an examination of the person arrested as is\n reasonably necessary in order to ascertain the facts\n which may afford such evidence, and to use such force as\n is reasonably necessary for that purpose.”\n\n26. \nBy Act\n 25 of 2005, a new Explanation was substituted\n\nunder Section 53, in the place of the original Explanation. The\n\n 26\n\n\fExplanation so substituted under Section 53 by Act 25 of 2005\n\nreads as follows:-\n\n “Explanation.—In this section and in Sections 53A and\n 54—\n\n (a) “examination” shall include the examination of blood,\n blood stains, semen, swabs in case of sexual offences,\n sputum and sweat, hair samples and finger nail clippings\n by the use of modern and scientific techniques including\n DNA profiling and such other tests which the registered\n medical practitioner thinks necessary in a particular case;\n\n (b) “registered medical practitioner” means a medical\n practitioner who possess any medical qualification as\n defined in clause (h) of \nSection 2\n of the Indian Medical\n Council Act, 1956 (102 of 1956) and whose name has\n been entered in a State Medical Register.”\n\n27. Simultaneously with the substitution of a new\n\nExplanation under \nSection 53\n, Act 25 of 2005 also inserted a new\n\nprovision i.e. Section 53A. Section 53A reads as follows:-\n\n “Section 53A. Examination of person accused of\n rape by medical practitioner.—(1) When a person is\n arrested on a charge of committing an offence of rape or\n an attempt to commit rape and there are reasonable\n grounds for believing that an examination of his person\n will afford evidence as to the commission of such offence,\n it shall be lawful for a registered medical practitioner\n employed in a hospital run by the Government or by a\n local authority and in the absence of such a practitioner\n within the radius of sixteen kilometers from the place\n where the offence has been committed by any other\n registered medical practitioner acting at the request of a\n police officer not below the rank of a Sub-Inspector, and\n for any person acting in good faith in his aid and under\n his direction, to make such an examination of the arrested\n person and to use such force as is reasonably necessary\n for that purpose.\n\n 27\n\n\f (2) The registered medical practitioner conducting such\n examination shall, without delay, examine such person\n and prepare a report of his examination giving the\n following particulars, namely—\n\n (i) the name and address of the accused and of the\n person by whom he was brought,\n\n (ii) the age of the accused,\n\n (iii) marks of injury, if any, on the person of the\n accused,\n\n (iv) the description of material taken from the person\n of the accused for DNA profiling, and\n\n (v) other material particulars in reasonable detail.\n (3) The report shall state precisely the reasons for each\n conclusion arrived at.\n\n (4) The exact time of commencement and completion of the\n examination shall also be noted in the report.\n (5) The registered medical practitioner shall, without\n delay, forward the report to the investigating officer, who\n shall forward it to the Magistrate referred to in Section\n 173 as part of the documents referred to in clause (a) of\n sub-section (5) of that section.”\n\n28. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in \nChotkau v. State of\n\nUttar Pradesh\n, (2023) 6 SCC 742, had the occasion to consider\n\nSections 53\n, \n53A\n and \n164\n of the CrPC in details. This Court\n\nobserved in para 80 to 83 as under:-\n\n \n“80. After saying that Section 53-A is not mandatory, this\n Court found in para 54 of \nthe said decision\n that the failure\n of the prosecution to produce DNA evidence, warranted\n an adverse inference to be drawn.\n \nPara 54 reads as\n follows : (\nRajendra Pralhadrao Wasnik\n case [\nRajendra\n Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra\n, (2019) 12\n SCC 460 : (2019) 4 SCC (Cri) 420], SCC p. 485)\n\n “54. For the prosecution to decline to produce DNA\n evidence would be a little unfortunate particularly\n when the facility of DNA profiling is available in the\n country. The prosecution would be well advised to take\n advantage of this, particularly in view of the provisions\n\n 28\n\n\f of Section 53-A and Section 164-ACrPC. We are not\n going to the extent of suggesting that if there is no DNA\n profiling, the prosecution case cannot be proved but we\n are certainly of the view that where DNA profiling has\n not been done or it is held back from the trial court, an\n adverse consequence would follow for the prosecution.”\n\n81. It is necessary at this stage to note that by the very\nsame Amendment Act 25 of 2005, by which Section 53-A\nwas inserted, Section 164-A was also inserted in the\nCode. While Section 53-A enables the medical\nexamination of the person accused of rape, Section 164-A\nenables medical examination of the victim of rape. Both\nthese provisions are somewhat similar and can be said\napproximately to be a mirror image of each other. But\nthere are three distinguishing features. They are:\n\n 81.1 Section 164-A requires the prior consent of the\n woman who is the victim of rape. Alternatively, the\n consent of a person competent to give such consent on\n her behalf should have been obtained before subjecting\n the victim to medical examination. Section 53-A does\n not speak about any such consent.\n\n 81.2 Section 164-A requires the report of the medical\n practitioner to contain among other things, the general\n mental condition of the woman. This is absent in\n Section 53-A.\n 81.3 Under Section 164-A(1), the medical examination\n by a registered medical practitioner is mandatory\n when, “it is proposed to get the person of the woman\n examined by a medical expert” during the course of\n investigation. This is borne out by the use of the words,\n “such examination shall be conducted”. In contrast,\n Section 53-A(1) merely makes it lawful for a registered\n medical practitioner to make an examination of the\n arrested person if “there are reasonable grounds for\n believing that an examination of his person will afford\n evidence as to the commission of such offence”.\n\n82. In cases where the victim of rape is alive and is in a\nposition to testify in court, it may be possible for the\nprosecution to take a chance by not medically examining\nthe accused. But in cases where the victim is dead and\nthe offence is sought to be established only by\n\n 29\n\n\f circumstantial evidence, medical evidence assumes great\n importance. The failure of the prosecution to produce such\n evidence, despite there being no obstacle from the\n accused or anyone, will certainly create a gaping hole in\n the case of the prosecution and give rise to a serious\n doubt on the case of the prosecution. We do not wish to\n go into the question whether Section 53-A is mandatory\n or not. Section 53-A enables the prosecution to obtain a\n significant piece of evidence to prove the charge. The\n failure of the prosecution in this case to subject the\n appellant to medical examination is certainly fatal to the\n prosecution case especially when the ocular evidence is\n found to be not trustworthy.\n\n 83. Their failure to obtain the report of the Forensic\n Science Laboratory on the blood/semen stain on the\n salwar worn by the victim, compounds the failure of the\n prosecution.”\n\n29. Thus, medical examination of an accused assumes great\n\nimportance in cases where the victim of rape is dead and the\n\noffence is sought to be established only by circumstantial\n\nevidence.\n\nFURTHER STATEMENT UNDER SECTION 313 \nCrPC\n\n30. The further statement of the appellant convict was\n\nrecorded under \nSection 313\n CrPC. We were shocked to see the\n\nmanner in which the Trial Court recorded the further statement\n\nof the appellant convict under \nSection 313\n CrPC. In all, four\n\nquestions were put to the appellant convict to enable him to\n\nexplain the incriminating circumstances pointing towards his\n\ncomplicity in the alleged crime. The questions are as under:-\n\n 30\n\n\f “(1) Question :- Have you heard the evidence of the\n witnesses?\n\n Answer :- Yes\n\n (2) Question :- There is evidence against you that on\n\n 31.5.15, you took away X to your house by calling her, on\n pretext of watching TV. What have you got to say?\n\n Answer :- No Sir.\n\n (3) Question :- There is also evidence against you that\n you escaped after locking your house and later on the lock\n was broken and then the dead body of X was recovered\n lying under the wooden cot. What have you got to say in\n this regard?\n\n Answer :- No Sir.\n\n (4) Question :- It has also come in evidence against you\n that you in association with Preetam committed murder\n of X after raping her. What have you got to say?\n\n Answer :- No sir, it is wrong.”\n\n31. However, for the purpose of holding the appellant herein\n\nguilty of the alleged crime, the Trial Court looked into the\n\nfollowing additional circumstances:-\n\n (a) The circumstance of PW 3 seeing the Appellant lock\n\n the grill and the door of his room.\n\n (b) The circumstance that the Appellant gave false\n\n information to PW 3 that the victim had already left\n\n after watching TV.\n\n 31\n\n\f (c) The circumstance of the accused refusing to open\n\n the door as he did not have the key.\n\n (d) The circumstance of the Appellant giving the keys\n\n to the villagers after he was assaulted.\n\n (e) The circumstance of the alleged extra-judicial\n\n confession made by the co-accused Pritam Tiwari\n\n implicating the Appellant.\n\n32. Indisputably, none of the aforesaid circumstances relied\n\nupon by the Trial Court were put to the appellant convict so that\n\nhe could offer a proper explanation to the same.\n\n33. Having regard to the fact that an innocent girl of 10 years\n\nwas lured, raped and brutally murdered, we looked into the\n\nentire record very closely. Our mind got clouded with suspicion.\n\nUltimately, we noticed something very shocking. The shocking\n\naspect, we shall discuss about hereinafter, if would have gone\n\nunnoticed at our end too, then it would have led to a serious\n\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\n34. We thought fit to call for the papers of the charge sheet\n\nand look into the FIR lodged by PW 2 Kiran Devi; the further\n\nstatement of PW 2 recorded under \nSection 161\n of the CrPC in\n\nfurtherance of the FIR lodged by her and the police statements\n\nof PW 1 Babloo Saw, and PW 3 Priya Kumari, the elder sister of\n\n 32\n\n\fthe victim and elder daughter of PW 2 (first informant). Reading\n\nthe FIR and the police statements of the aforesaid witnesses left\n\nus aghast.\n\n35. We first start with the FIR lodged by PW 2 which reads\n\nthus:-\n\n “Fardbayan of Kiran Devi aged about 40 years w/o\n Arvind Sah, at Thateri Tola, Police Station- Sabour,\n District Bhagalpur recorded by S.I. cum S.H.O. Rita\n Kumari Sabour P.S. in house of Naval Kishore Ojha @\n Fuchan Pandey dated 01-06-15 at 12:45 P.M.\n My name is Kiran Devi, aged about 40 years old, w/o\n Arvind Sah, Rio Thateri Tola Sabour Police Station- Saber,\n District- Bhagalpur. I am giving this statement without\n any pressure, in presence of the In-charge of Sabour\n Police Station today on 01 June, 2015 at the house of\n Naval Kishore (Fucchan Pandey) that yesterday on 31 st\n May, 2015, I went to my late elder sister Sakila Devi's\n home situated in Jamunia Parbatta. In the meantime, at\n about 12 pm, my elder daughter Priya Kumari informed\n me through telephone that my younger daughter, X is\n nowhere to be found. Then I left for Sabour immediately.\n When I reached home, my elder daughter Priya informed\n me that X went to watch TV at Munna Pandey's home.\n When she didn't come back till 11 am then my elder\n daughter called me. When I went to Munna Pandey’s\n home to find X, I found that Munna Pandey's house was\n locked. We started searching for X along with our\n relatives but X was nowhere to be found. When Munna\n Pandey was asked to open the lock, he said that he docs\n not have the keys. Then I called Munna Pandey’s brother\n Fucchan Pandey who was at his in-law's house (sasural).\n Today on 1st June, 2015, Naval Kishore Pandey @\n Fucchan Pandey came at around 12 pm and opened the\n lock of the room where it was found that Pritam Tiwari,\n S/o Dilip Tiwari R/o Shobhapur, Police Station:\n\n Rajmahal, District was hiding inside the room. The room\n was locked from outside. When Munna Pandey's room\n was opened, the dead body of my daughter was found\n\n 33\n\n\f under the bed. I am certain that Pritam Tiwari, s/o Dilip\n Tiwari, r/o Shobhapur, Police Station: Rajmahal District\n Sahebanj and Munna Pandey s/o Late Bir Bahadur\n Pandey r/o Thatcri Tola, Police Station: Sabour, District\n Bhagalpur, jointly conspired and had committed rape on\n my 11 y/o daughter (X) and after that strangulated her\n and killed her and then hid her dead body in the room.\n This is my statement which I heard and understood after\n reading them I found the above statements correct and I\n am putting my signature by my own will in the presence\n of my sister's son, Bablu Sah s/o Satish Sah r/o\n Jamunia, Toana Parvata (Navaghchiya) Bhagalpur.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n36. The further statement of Kiran Devi recorded by the police\n\nunder \nSection 161\n CrPC reads thus:-\n\n “Further investigation of this case, the police re-recorded\n the statement of complainant of this case - Kiran Devi,\n aged about 40 years, W/o - Arvind Sah, R/o - Thatheri\n Tola, PS - Sabour, District - Bhagalpur. Concurring with\n the FIR, she stated in her statement that in the\n neighborhood in front of her house lived two brothers -\n Munna Pandey and Naval Kishore Ojha @ Fucchan\n Pandey. They both have share in one room each. Frequent\n quarrels used to take place between the two brothers, due\n to which Naval Kishore Ojha @ Fucchan Pandey used to\n live at his in-law's place (sasuraal) and Munna Pandey,\n Sabour used to live near Kali Sthan in a rented house.\n Fucchan Pandey had handed over his room to his brother-\n in-law (wife's brother) for its maintenance. Pritam Tiwary\n worked in a cloth shop. People from the cloth shop also\n used to visit the house of Fucchan Pandey occasionally.\n There was a TV in the house of Fucchan Pandey. Children\n from the neighborhood also used to visit his house to\n watch the TV. On date 31.05.15, I (Kiran Devi) had gone\n to the house of my late sister, Shakila Devi in Jamunia\n Parvatta. On date 31.05.15 at about 12:00, her elder\n daughter Priya Kumari informed her on telephone that her\n younger daughter X was nowhere to be found. She\n immediately left from there. After her arrival at Sabour in\n her house, her elder daughter informed that her younger\n daughter X had stated that she was going to the house\n\n 34\n\n\fof Pritam Tiwary to watch TV. Pritam Tiwary had called\nX to watch TV at his home at around 9 o'clock. When X\ndid not come home till eleven o'clock, her elder daughter\nPriya went to the house of Pritam Tiwary to search for her.\nAt that time Pritam Tiwary was locking the door. When\nshe asked the whereabouts of X from Pritam Tiwary, he\ntold that she was not there. After that she went to a\nmango orchard to look for her. She was not found there\nalso. Then Priya called all her relatives and went to\nsearch her, but could not find her anywhere. Even after\nsuch a hectic search, X was nowhere to be found. So we\nall collectively decided to find Pritam Tiwary who was\nalso not to be found. The villagers became suspicious so\nthey all called Munna Pandey and asked him to open the\ngate. But Munna Pandey declined to open the gates and\nsaid that he did not have the keys to the lock. The local\nvillagers then telephoned Naval Pandey @ Fucchan\nPandey. At that time he was at his in-law's place at\nShobhapur. When Munna Pandey declined to hand over\nthe keys, everybody became suspicious that Pritam\nTiwary was not there and it was very much possible that\nhe (Pritam Tiwary) did some occurrence with her\ndaughter. On 01-06-2015, Naval Kishore Ojha @ Fucchan\nPandey came with his wife and children and opened the\nlocks of the grill at about 12:00 noon. When lock was\nopened, all the villagers entered the verandah and when\nlooked through the window in the room of Fucchan\nPandey, found Pritam Tiwary sleeping on the palang\n(wooden cot) in the room. When Fucchan Pandey opened\nthe lock of his room, Pritam Tiwary started hiding himself\nunder the wooden bed. The villagers took him out from\nthe bed and started to ask the whereabouts of X. Initially\nhe refused to give any information. But when all the\npeople asked him strictly, he said that X (deceased) was\nin the house of Munna Pandey. And when all the people\nlooked inside the room after breaking the locks of the\ndoors of Munna Pandey, they found the dead body of\neleven year old daughter X lying below the palang\n(wooden cot) in the room. When I looked at my daughter,\nshe was already dead. We found her face extremely\nswollen, both the lips swollen, blood stained wound was\nseen on her right cheek. Her clothes were in (illegible)\nmanner. The private parts of deceased X were swollen\nand blood stained wound and anus swollen with stool\nsticking to it, were found. He further informed that both\n\n 35\n\n\f the accused persons named in the FIR - (1) Pritam Tiwary,\n S/o - Dilip Tiwary, R/o - Shobhapur, PS - Raj Mahal,\n District - Sahebganj, State - Jharkhand, present address\n Naval Kishore Ojha, Thatheri Toal - Sabour, PS - Sabour,\n District - Bhagalpur, (2) Munna Pandey, S/o Late Bir\n Bahadur Pandey, R/o - Thatheri, Toal - Sabour, PS -\n Sabour, District - Bhagalpur raped her eleven year\n daughter X (deceased) and with a view to remove the\n evidence. strangled her and killed her and had hid the\n dead body below the palang (wooden cot). The villagers\n informed the police station. On receiving the information\n police came and began their investigation. Besides this,\n she did not tell any other important facts.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n37. The police statement of PW 1 Babloo Saw reads thus:-\n\n “In further investigation of this case recorded the witness\n statement of Babloo Sah, s/o Satish Sah, r/o Jamunia,\n PS - Parvatta, District - Khagaria, with complete support\n to the occurrence in his statement informed that deceased\n X is his aunt's (her mother's sister) daughter. On date\n 31.05.15 mother of the deceased came to his house.\n\n Priya, the elder sister of the deceased X, informed her\n mother over telephone that Pritam Tiwary, brother-in-law\n (wife's brother) of her neighbor Naval Kishore Ojha called\n X to watch television at his house and that she had not\n returned home. On information, he along with his mausi\n (mother's sister), Kiran Devi came to Sabour and along\n with family members and with the help of local villagers\n did exhaustive search in the nearby places, but could not\n find X anywhere. During the course of search, when I\n went to the house of Naval Kishore Ojha, I saw that his\n house is locked. Few people suspected that Pritam Tiwary\n had taken her somewhere or is inside the room, because\n the light of bulb was emitting light from his house. Then\n all the people called Munna Pandey and asked him to\n open the lock to which he declined and made an excuse\n that he does not possess the key. Then the suspicion of\n all the people grew more. Then villagers informed Naval\n Kishore Ojha @ Fucchan Pandey, brother of Munna\n Pandey about the occurrence of the incident on telephone.\n At that time of call Fuchchan Pandey was at his in-laws\n house at Shobhapur. He was not living here since last two\n months. On date 01.06.15 at about 12:00 noon, Fucchan\n\n 36\n\n\f Pandey came along with his family and opened the lock\n of the house and saw Pritam Tiwary hiding in his house.\n When local people strictly enquired about the deceased\n girl X, he informed that X (deceased) was in Munna\n Pandey's house and then he tried to escape. Then all the\n people broke the lock on the door of Munna Pandey's room\n and when they looked inside they found the dead body\n of X lying under the bed (wooden cot). The clothes on her\n body were in haphazard condition. The women of the\n village told that a lot of blood stained injury and swelling\n was found around the private parts of X (deceased). The\n face of deceased X was extremely swollen, blood stained\n injury on both the lips which was hanging after being\n swollen. He further stated that both accused persons.\n named in the FIR called the girl on the pretext to watch\n TV and raped her and with a view to hide the evidence\n strangled her and killed her and hid the dead body below\n the palang (wooden cot). The local police station was then\n informed about the incident. Police came and started its\n proceeding. He did not inform any important thing\n further.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n38. The police statement of PW 3 Priya Kumari, the elder\n\nsister of the victim, reads thus:-\n\n “In further investigation of this case I recorded the\n statement of witness Priya Kumari, aged about 15 years,\n s/o - Arvind Sah, R/o - Thatheri, tola PS - Sabour, District\n Bhagalpur. After certifying the FIR, she informed in her\n statement that on dated 31.05.15 she was cooking in her\n house. Her mother Kiran Devi had gone to the house of\n her aunt (her mother's sister) in Parvatta. Her father\n works as a laborer in Gujarat. There was no one else in\n the house. At about 09:00 am her younger sister\n deceased X had gone to the house of Fucchan Pandey to\n watch TV. Pritam Tiwary, brother in law of (wife's sister)\n Phuchchan Pandey lived in that house. He had called X\n to watch TV at his house. When X did not return even after\n two hours, Priya (elder sister) went to the room of Pritam\n Tiwary to call her. On asking Pritam Tiwary about the\n whereabouts of X, he told that X had not come there. At\n that time Pritam was locking the grills of the verandah.\n Then she went to the nearby mango orchard to look for\n\n 37\n\n\f her. She did not find her there also. Finally the she\n telephone her mother and informed her that X was\n missing. On arrival of Kiran Devi everybody started\n looking for X at all their relatives' place, but could not find\n her anywhere. Some people suspected that X was with\n Pritam Tiwary. Then everybody started searching for\n Pritam Tiwary. He was also not found anywhere. Then\n all the villagers and their relatives asked Munna Pandey\n to open the house but Munna Pandey refused to do so and\n made an excuse that he does not possess the keys. Then\n the villagers telephoned Fucchan Pandey who is the\n brother of Munna Pandey but they found that Fucchan\n Pandey was living at his in law's place (sasuraal) at\n Rajmahal since the last two months. On date 01.06.15 at\n about 12:00 o'clock Naval Kishore Ojha @ Fucchan\n Pandey came and opened the lock of his investigation.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n39. Thus, the case of all the witnesses before the police was\n\nthat it was Pritam Tiwari who had come to the house of the\n\nvictim on the fateful day and date and had taken the victim along\n\nwith him to his house to watch TV. All the statements further\n\nreveal that it was Pritam Tiwari who was found locking the door\n\nwhen the witnesses enquired with Pritam Tiwari about the\n\nwhereabouts of the victim.\n\n40. Neither the defence counsel nor the public prosecutor nor\n\nthe presiding officer of the Trial Court and unfortunately even\n\nthe High Court thought fit to look into the aforesaid aspect of\n\nthe matter and try to reach to the truth.\n\n41. It was the duty of the defence counsel to confront the\n\nwitnesses with their police statements so as to prove the\n\n 38\n\n\fcontradictions in the form of material omissions and bring them\n\non record. We are sorry to say that the learned defence counsel\n\nhad no idea how to contradict a witness with his or her police\n\nstatements in accordance with \nSection 145\n of the Evidence Act,\n\n1872 (for short, ‘\nEvidence Act\n’).\n\n42. The lapse on the part of public prosecutor is also\n\nsomething very unfortunate. The public prosecutor knew that\n\nthe witnesses were deposing something contrary to what they\n\nhad stated before the police in their statements recorded under\n\nSection 161\n of the CrPC. It was his duty to bring to the notice of\n\nthe witnesses and confront them with the same even without\n\ndeclaring them as hostile.\n\n43. The presiding officer of the Trial Court also remained a\n\nmute spectator. It was the duty of the presiding officer to put\n\nrelevant questions to these witnesses in exercise of his powers\n\nunder \nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act. \nSection 162\n of the CrPC\n\ndoes not prevent a Judge from looking into the record of the\n\npolice investigation. Being a case of rape and murder and as the\n\nevidence was not free from doubt, the Trial Judge ought to have\n\nacquainted himself, in the interest of justice, with the important\n\nmaterial and also with what the only important witnesses of the\n\nprosecution had said during the police investigation. Had he\n\ndone so, he could without any impropriety have caught the\n\n 39\n\n\fdiscrepancies between the statements made by these witnesses\n\nto the investigating officer and their evidence at the trial, to be\n\nbrought on the record by himself putting questions to the\n\nwitnesses under \nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act. There is, in\n\nour opinion, nothing in \nSection 162\n CrPC to prevent a Trial\n\nJudge, as distinct from the prosecution or the defence, from\n\nputting to prosecution witnesses the questions otherwise\n\npermissible, if the justice obviously demands such a course. In\n\nthe present case, we are strongly of the opinion that is what, in\n\nthe interests of justice, the Trial Judge should have done but he\n\ndid not look at the record of the police investigation until after\n\nthe investigating officer had been examined and discharged as a\n\nwitness. Even at this stage, the Trial Judge could have recalled\n\nthe officer and other witnesses and questioned them in the\n\nmanner provided by \nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act. It is\n\nregrettable that he did not do so.\n\n44. We take this opportunity of explaining the aforesaid a\n\nlittle more explicitly.\n\n45. \nSection 162\n of the CrPC reads thus:-\n\n “\nSection 162\n. Statements to police not to be signed\n : Use of statements in evidence.─(1) No statement\n made by any person to a police officer in the course of an\n investigation under this Chapter, shall, if reduced to\n writing, be signed by the person making it; nor shall any\n such statement or any record thereof, whether in a police\n\n 40\n\n\f diary or otherwise, or any part of such statement or\n record, be used for any purpose, save as hereinafter\n provided, at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence\n under investigation at the time when such statement was\n made:\n\n Provided that when any witness is called for the\n prosecution in such inquiry or trial whose statement has\n been reduced into writing as aforesaid, any part of his\n statement, if duly proved, may be used by the accused,\n and with the permission of the Court, by the prosecution,\n to contradict such witness in the manner provided by\n \nsection 145\n of the Indian Evidence Act , 1872 (1 of 1872);\n and when any part of such statement is so used, any part\n thereof may also be used in the re-examination of such\n witness, but for the purpose only of explaining any matter\n referred to in his cross-examination.\n\n (2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any\n statement falling within the provisions of clause (1) of\n \nsection 32\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872);\n\n or to affect the provisions of \nsection 27\n of that Act.\n Explanation.--An omission to state a fact or circumstance\n in the statement referred to in sub-section (1) may amount\n to contradiction if the same appears to be significant and\n otherwise relevant having regard to the context in which\n such omission occurs and whether any omission amounts\n to a contradiction in the particular context shall be a\n question of fact.”\n\n46. \nSection 162\n CrPC says that no statement made by any\n\nperson to a police officer in the course of an investigation,\n\nwhether it be recorded or not, shall be used for the purpose save\n\nas provided in the first proviso to the Section. The first proviso\n\nsays that when any witness, whose statement has been reduced\n\ninto writing by the police in accordance with the provisions of\n\nthe \nCrPC\n, is called for the prosecution in inquiry or trial the\n\naccused with the permission of the court may contradict the\n\n 41\n\n\fwitnesses in the manner provided by \nSection 145\n of the\n\nEvidence Act. It could be argued that, as the first part of \nSection\n\n162\n prohibits the use of the statement of a witness to a police\n\nofficer for any purpose, other than that subsequently provided\n\nfor in the proviso, and as the proviso says that the Court may\n\npermit the accused to contradict the witness with his previous\n\nstatement, the Court has no power to do anything suo motu. In\n\nour opinion, this would be a misreading of the Section. The first\n\npart of \nSection 162\n says that the statement made by a person to\n\na police officer during investigation cannot be used for any\n\npurpose other than that mentioned in the proviso. We lay stress\n\non the word “purpose”. The purpose mentioned in the proviso is\n\nthe purpose of contradicting the evidence given in favour of the\n\nState by a prosecution witness in Court by the use of the\n\nprevious statement made by such witness to the police officer.\n\nThe purpose is to discredit the evidence given in favour of the\n\nprosecution by a witness for the State. The Section prohibits the\n\nuse of the statement for any other purpose than this. It does not\n\nsay that the statement can only be used at the request of the\n\naccused. The limitation or restriction imposed in the first part of\n\nSection 162\n CrPC relates to this purpose for which the\n\nstatement may be used; it does not relate to the procedure which\n\nmay be adopted to effect this purpose. The proviso which sets\n\n 42\n\n\fout the limited purpose also mentions the way in which an\n\naccused person may contradict the witness with his previous\n\nstatement made to the Police, but it does not in any way purport\n\nto take away the power that lies in the Court to look into any\n\ndocument, that it considers necessary to look into for the ends\n\nof justice and to put such questions to a witness as it may\n\nconsider necessary to elicit the truth. We realise that the proviso\n\nwould prevent the Court from using statements made by a\n\nperson to a police officer in the course of investigation for any\n\nother purpose than that mentioned in the proviso but it does not\n\nin any other way affect the power that lies in the Court to look\n\ninto documents or put questions to witnesses suo motu. It seems\n\nto us to be absurd to suggest that a Judge cannot put a question\n\nto a witness which a party may put. In this connection we would\n\nrefer to the provisions of \nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act, where\n\nthe necessity of clothing the Judge with very wide powers to put\n\nquestions to witnesses and to look into documents is recognised\n\nand provided for. This is what \nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act\n\nsays:—\n\n “\nSection 165\n. Judge’s power to put questions or\n order production.─ The Judge may, in order to discover\n or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any\n question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any\n witness, or of the parties about any fact relevant or\n irrelevant; and may order the production of any document\n or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be\n\n 43\n\n\f entitled to make any objection to any such question or\n order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-\n examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to\n any such question: …”\n\n47. There is in our opinion nothing in \nSection 162\n of the CrPC\n\nwhich prevents a Trial Judge from looking into the papers of the\n\nchargesheet suo motu and himself using the statement of a\n\nperson examined by the police recorded therein for the purpose\n\nof contradicting such person when he gives evidence in favour\n\nof the State as a prosecution witness. The Judge may do this or\n\nhe may make over the recorded statement to the lawyer for the\n\naccused so that he may use it for this purpose. We also wish to\n\nemphasise that in many sessions cases when an advocate\n\nappointed by the Court appears and particularly when a junior\n\nadvocate, who has not much experience of the procedure of the\n\nCourt, has been appointed to conduct the defence of an accused\n\nperson, it is the duty of the Presiding Judge to draw his attention\n\nto the statutory provisions of \nSection 145\n of the Evidence Act,\n\nas explained in \nTara Singh v. State\n reported in AIR 1951 SC\n\n441 and no Court should allow a witness to be contradicted by\n\nreference to the previous statement in writing or reduced to\n\nwriting unless the procedure set out in \nSection 145\n of the\n\nEvidence Act has been followed. It is possible that if the attention\n\nof the witness is drawn to these portions with reference to which\n\n 44\n\n\fit is proposed to contradict him, he may be able to give a\n\nperfectly satisfactory explanation and in that event the portion\n\nin the previous statement which would otherwise be\n\ncontradictory would no longer go to contradict or challenge the\n\ntestimony of the witness.\n\n48. In our opinion, in a case of the present description where\n\nthe evidence given in a Court implicates persons who are not\n\nmentioned in the first information report or police statements, it\n\nis always advisable and far more important for the Trial Judge\n\nto look into the police papers in order to ascertain whether the\n\npersons implicated by witnesses, at the trial had been implicated\n\nby them during the investigation.\n\n49. \nIn the aforesaid context, we may refer to and rely on a\n\nthree-Judge Bench decision in the case of \nV.K. Mishra v. State\n\nof Uttarakhand\n, (2015) 9 SCC 588, wherein this Court, after\n\ndue consideration of \nSection 161\n of the CrPC and \nSection 145\n of\n\nthe Evidence Act, observed as under:-\n\n \n“16. \nSection 162\n CrPC bars use of statement of witnesses\n recorded by the police except for the limited purpose of\n contradiction of such witnesses as indicated there. The\n statement made by a witness before the police under\n \nSection 161(1)\n CrPC can be used only for the purpose of\n contradicting such witness on what he has stated at the\n trial as \nlaid down in\n the proviso to \nSection 162(1)\n CrPC.\n The statements under \nSection 161\n CrPC recorded during\n the investigation are not substantive pieces of evidence\n but can be used primarily for the limited purpose: (i) of\n\n 45\n\n\fcontradicting such witness by an accused under \nSection\n145\n of the Evidence Act; (ii) the contradiction of such\nwitness also by the prosecution but with the leave of the\nCourt; and (iii) the re-examination of the witness if\nnecessary.\n\n17. The court cannot suo motu make use of statements to\npolice not proved and ask questions with reference to\nthem which are inconsistent with the testimony of the\nwitness in the court. The words in \nSection 162\n CrPC “if\nduly proved” clearly show that the record of the statement\nof witnesses cannot be admitted in evidence\nstraightaway nor can be looked into but they must be\nduly proved for the purpose of contradiction by eliciting\nadmission from the witness during cross-examination\nand also during the cross-examination of the investigating\nofficer. The statement before the investigating officer can\nbe used for contradiction but only after strict compliance\nwith \nSection 145\n of the Evidence Act that is by drawing\nattention to the parts intended for contradiction.\n\n18. \nSection 145\n of the Evidence Act reads as under:\n\n “145.Cross-examination as to previous statements in\n writing.—A witness may be cross-examined as to\n previous statements made by him in writing or\n reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in\n question, without such writing being shown to him,\n or being proved; but, if it is intended to contradict him\n by the writing, his attention must, before the writing\n can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are\n to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.”\n\n19. Under \nSection 145\n of the Evidence Act when it is intended\nto contradict the witness by his previous statement reduced\ninto writing, the attention of such witness must be called to\nthose parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of\ncontradicting him, before the writing can be used. While\nrecording the deposition of a witness, it becomes the duty of\nthe trial court to ensure that the part of the police statement\nwith which it is intended to contradict the witness is brought\nto the notice of the witness in his cross-examination. The\nattention of witness is drawn to that part and this must\nreflect in his cross-examination by reproducing it. If the\nwitness admits the part intended to contradict him, it stands\nproved and there is no need to further proof of contradiction\n\n 46\n\n\f and it will be read while appreciating the evidence. If he\n denies having made that part of the statement, his attention\n must be drawn to that statement and must be mentioned in\n the deposition. By this process the contradiction is merely\n brought on record, but it is yet to be proved. Thereafter when\n investigating officer is examined in the court, his attention\n should be drawn to the passage marked for the purpose of\n contradiction, it will then be proved in the deposition of the\n investigating officer who again by referring to the police\n statement will depose about the witness having made that\n statement. The process again involves referring to the police\n statement and culling out that part with which the maker of\n the statement was intended to be contradicted. If the witness\n was not confronted with that part of the statement with\n which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the court\n cannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved\n in compliance with \nSection 145\n of the Evidence Act that is, by\n drawing attention to the parts intended for contradiction.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n50. What is important to note in the aforesaid decision of this\n\nCourt is the principle of law that if the witness was not confronted\n\nwith that part of the statement with which the defence wanted to\n\ncontradict him, then the Court cannot suo motu make use of\n\nstatements to police not proved in compliance with \nSection 145\n\nof the Evidence Act. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to prove\n\nall major contradictions in the form of material omissions in\n\naccordance with the procedure as established under \nSection 145\n\nof the Evidence Act and bring them on record. It is the duty of the\n\ndefence counsel to do so.\n\n51. This Court in \nRaghunandan v. State of U.P.\n reported in\n\n(1974) 4 SCC 186, it was observed:-(SCC p. 191, para 16)\n\n 47\n\n\f “16. We are inclined to accept the argument of the\n appellant that the language of \nSection 162\n, Criminal\n Procedure Code, though wide, is not explicit or specific\n enough to extend the prohibition to the use of the wide\n and special powers of the Court to question a witness,\n expressly and explicitly given by \nSection 165\n of the Indian\n Evidence Act in order to secure the ends of justice.\n ….Therefore, we hold that \nSection 162\n, Criminal\n Procedure Code, does not impair the special powers of the\n Court under \nSection 165\n, Indian Evidence Act. …”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n52. This Court in \nDandu Lakshmi Reddy v. State of A.P.\n,\n\n(1999) 7 SCC 69, it was held:-\n\n “20. It must now be remembered that the said procedure\n can be followed only when a witness is in the box. Barring\n the above two modes, a statement recorded under \nSection\n 161\n of the Code can only remain fastened up at all stages\n of the trial in respect of that offence. In other words, if the\n court has not put any question to the witness with\n reference to his statement recorded under \nSection 161\n of\n the Code, it is impermissible for the court to use that\n statement later even for drawing any adverse impression\n regarding the evidence of that witness. What is\n interdicted by Parliament in direct terms cannot be\n obviated in any indirect manner.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n53. Sarkar (1999, 15th pp. 2319 etc.) says that a Judge is\n\nentitled to take a proactive role in putting questions to ascertain\n\nthe truth and to fill up doubts, if any, arising out of inept\n\nexamination of witnesses. But, as stated by Lord Denning in\n\nJones v. National Coal Board, 1957 (2) All ER 155 (CA), the\n\nJudge cannot “drop the mantle of a Judge and assume the robe\n\nof an advocate”.\n\n 48\n\n\f54. Of course, the Judge should not be a passive spectator\n\nbut should take a proactive role as emphasized by Phipson\n\n(Evidence, 1999, 15th Ed, para 1.21 as under:-\n\n “When the form of the English trial assumed its modern\n institutional form, the role of the judge was that of a\n neutral umpire. This is still broadly the position in\n criminal cases. In civil cases, the abandonment of jury\n trial except in a few exceptional cases led to some dilution\n of this principle. The wholesale changes in 1999 of the\n rules governing civil procedure has emphasized the\n interventionist role of the modern judge. Whereas formally\n the tribunal was a ‘reactive judge (for centuries past at\n the heart of the English Common Law -- concept of the\n independent judiciary) instead we shall have a proactive\n judge whose task will be to take charge of the action at\n an early stage and manage its conduit.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n55. This Court in \nState of Rajasthan v. Ani @ Hanif and\n\nOrs.\n (1997) 6 SCC 162, made very relevant and important\n\nobservations as under:-\n\n “11. … \nSection 165\n of the Evidence Act confers vast and\n unrestricted powers on the trial court to put\n “any question he pleases, in any form, at any time,\n of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant\n or irrelevant” in order to discover relevant facts. The said\n section was framed by lavishly studding it with the word\n “any” which could only have been inspired by the\n legislative intent to confer unbridled power on the trial\n court to use the power whenever he deems it necessary\n to elicit truth. Even if any such question crosses into\n irrelevancy the same would not transgress beyond the\n contours of powers of the court. This is clear from the\n words “relevant or irrelevant” in \nSection 165\n. Neither of\n the parties has any right to raise objection to any such\n question.\n\n 49\n\n\f 12. Reticence may be good in many circumstances, but a\n Judge remaining mute during trial is not an ideal\n situation. A taciturn Judge may be the model caricatured\n in public mind. But there is nothing wrong in his becoming\n active or dynamic during trial so that criminal justice\n being the end could be achieved. Criminal trial should not\n turn out to be a bout or combat between two rival sides\n with the Judge performing the role only of a spectator or\n even an umpire to pronounce finally who won the race. A\n Judge is expected to actively participate in the trial, elicit\n necessary materials from witnesses in the appropriate\n context which he feels necessary for reaching the correct\n conclusion. There is nothing which inhibits his power to\n put questions to the witnesses, either during chief\n examination or cross-examination or even during re-\n\n examination to elicit truth. The corollary of it is that if a\n Judge felt that a witness has committed an error or a slip\n it is the duty of the Judge to ascertain whether it was so,\n for, to err is human and the chances of erring may\n accelerate under stress of nervousness during cross-\n examination. Criminal justice is not to be founded on\n erroneous answers spelled out by witnesses during\n evidence-collecting process. It is a useful exercise for trial\n Judge to remain active and alert so that errors can be\n minimised.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n56. \nIn the above context, it is apposite to quote the\n\nobservations of Chinnappa Reddy, J. in \nRam\n\nChander v. State of Haryana\n, (1981) 3 SCC 191:-\n\n “2. The adversary system of trial being what it is, there is\n an unfortunate tendency for a judge presiding over a trial\n to assume the role of a referee or an umpire and to allow\n the trial to develop into a contest between the prosecution\n and the defence with the inevitable distortions flowing\n from combative and competitive element entering the trial\n procedure. If a criminal court is to be an effective\n instrument in dispensing justice, the presiding judge must\n cease to be a spectator and a mere recording machine. He\n must become a participant in the trial by evincing\n intelligent active interest by putting questions to\n witnesses in order to ascertain the truth. …”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 50\n\n\fROLE AND DUTY OF THE HIGH COURT IN CONFIRMATION\nCASES\n\n57. We regret to state that the High Court completely\n\noverlooked the aforesaid aspects as discussed above. What was\n\nexpected of the High Court to do in such circumstances? If the\n\nHigh Court would have taken little pains to look into the record,\n\nthen immediately it could have taken recourse to \nSection 367\n of\n\nthe CrPC. We invite the attention of the High Court to the\n\nprovisions of Chapter XXVIII (Section 366 to Section 371) and\n\nChapter XXIX (Section 372 to Section 394). The provisions of\n\nSection 366 to Section 368 and Sections 386 and Section 391\n\nare quoted here for ready reference:-\n\n “Section 366. Sentence of death to be submitted by\n Court of Session for confirmation.—(1) When the\n Court of Session passes a sentence of death, the\n proceedings shall be submitted to the High Court, and the\n sentence shall not be executed unless it is confirmed by\n the High Court.\n\n (2) The Court passing the sentence shall commit the\n convicted person to jail custody under a warrant.\n\n Section 367. Power to direct further inquiry to be\n made or additional evidence to be taken.—(1) If,\n when such proceedings are submitted, the High Court\n thinks that a further inquiry should be made into or\n additional evidence taken upon, any point bearing upon\n the guilt or innocence of the convicted person, it may make\n such inquiry or take such evidence itself, or direct it to be\n made or taken by the Court of Session.\n\n 51\n\n\f(2) Unless the High Court otherwise directs, the presence\nof the convicted person may be dispensed with when\nsuch inquiry is made or such evidence is taken.\n(3) When the inquiry or evidence (if any) is not made or\ntaken by the High Court, the result of such inquiry or\nevidence shall be certified to such Court.\n\nSection 368. Power of High Court to confirm\nsentence or annual conviction.—In any case\nsubmitted under Section 366, the High Court—\n\n(a) may confirm the sentence, or pass any other sentence\nwarranted by law, or\n\n(b) may annul the conviction, and convict the accused of\nany offence of which the Court of Session might have\nconvicted him, or order a new trial on the same or an\namended charge, or\n\n(c) may acquit the accused person:\n\nProvided that no order of confirmation shall be made\nunder this section until the period allowed for preferring\nan appeal has expired, or, if an appeal is presented\nwithin such period, until such appeal is disposed of.\n\n x x x x\n\nSection 386. Powers of the appellate court.—After\nperusing such record and hearing the appellant or his\npleader, if he appears, and the Public Prosecutor, if he\nappears, and in case of an appeal under Section 377 or\nSection 378, the accused, if he appears, the Appellate\nCourt may, if it considers that there is no sufficient ground\nfor interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may—\n\n(a) in an appeal from an order of acquittal, reverse such\norder and direct that further inquiry be made, or that the\naccused be re-tried or committed for trial, as the case may\nbe, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according\nto law;\n\n(b) in an appeal from a conviction—\n\n (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or\n discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a\n\n 52\n\n\f court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such\n Appellate Court or committed for trial, or\n\n (ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or\n\n (iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature\n or the extent, or the nature and extent, of the sentence,\n but not so as to enhance the same;\n\n(c) in an appeal for enhancement of sentence—\n\n (i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or\n discharge the accused or order him to be re-tried by a\n court competent to try the offence, or\n\n (ii) alter the finding maintaining the sentence, or\n\n (iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature\n or the extent, or the nature and extent, of the sentence,\n so as to enhance or reduce the same;\n\n(d) in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse such\norder;\n\n(e) make any amendment or any consequential or\nincidental order that may be just or proper:\n\nProvided that the sentence shall not be enhanced unless\nthe accused has had an opportunity of showing cause\nagainst such enhancement:\n\nProvided further that the Appellate Court shall not inflict\ngreater punishment for the offence which in its opinion the\naccused has committed, than might have been inflicted\nfor that offence by the court passing the order or sentence\nunder appeal.\n\n x x x x\n\nSection 391. Appellate Court may take further\nevidence or direct it to be taken.—(1) In dealing with\nany appeal under this Chapter, the Appellate Court, if it\nthinks additional evidence to be necessary, shall record\nits reasons and may either take such evidence itself, or\ndirect it to be taken by a Magistrate, or when the\nAppellate Court is a High Court, by a Court of Session or\na Magistrate.\n\n(2) When the additional evidence is taken by the Court of\nSession or the Magistrate, it or he shall certify such\nevidence to the Appellate Court, and such Court shall\nthereupon proceed to dispose of the appeal.\n\n 53\n\n\f (3) The accused or his pleader shall have the right to be\n present when the additional evidence is taken.\n (4) The taking of evidence under this section shall be\n subject to the provisions of Chapter XXIII, as if it were an\n inquiry.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n58. According to Section 366 when a Court of Session passes\n\na sentence of death, the proceedings must be submitted to the\n\nHigh Court and the sentence of death is not to be executed unless\n\nit is confirmed by the High Court. Section 367 then proceeds to\n\nlay down the power of the High Court to direct further enquiry to\n\nbe made or additional evidence to be taken. Section 368,\n\nthereafter, lays down the power of the High Court to confirm the\n\nsentence so imposed or annul the conviction. One of the powers\n\nwhich the High Court can exercise is one under \nSection 368(c)\n of\n\nthe CrPC and that is to “acquit the accused person”. Pertinently,\n\nthe power to acquit the person can be exercised by the High Court\n\neven without there being any substantive appeal on the part of\n\nthe accused challenging his conviction. To that extent, the\n\nproceedings under Chapter XXVIII which deal with “submission\n\nof death sentences for confirmation” is a proceeding in\n\ncontinuation of the trial. These provisions thus entitle the High\n\nCourt to direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and\n\nthe High Court may, in a given case, even acquit the accused\n\nperson. The scope of the chapter is wider. Chapter XXIX of the\n\n 54\n\nCrPC\n deals with “Appeals”. Section 391 also entitles the appellate\n\ncourt to take further evidence or direct such further evidence to\n\nbe taken. Section 386 then enumerates powers of the appellate\n\ncourt which inter alia includes the power to “reverse the finding\n\nand sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him\n\nto be re-tried by a court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to\n\nsuch appellate court or committed for trial”. The powers of the\n\nappellate court are equally wide. The High Court in the present\n\ncase was exercising powers both under Chapters XXVIII and XXIX\n\nof the \nCrPC\n.\n\n59. Ordinarily, in a criminal appeal against conviction, the\n\nappellate court, under \nSection 384\n of the CrPC, can dismiss the\n\nappeal, if the Court is of the opinion that there is no sufficient\n\nground for interference, after examining all the grounds urged\n\nbefore it for challenging the correctness of the decision given by\n\nthe Trial Court. It is not necessary for the appellate court to\n\nexamine the entire record for the purpose of arriving at an\n\nindependent decision of its own whether the conviction of the\n\nappellant is fully justified. The position is, however, different\n\nwhere the appeal is by an accused who is sentenced to death, so\n\nthat the High Court dealing with the appeal has before it,\n\nsimultaneously with the appeal, a reference for confirmation of\n\nthe capital sentence under \nSection 366\n of the CrPC. On a\n\n 55\n\n\freference for confirmation of sentence of death, the High Court is\n\nrequired to proceed in accordance with Sections 367 and 368\n\nrespectively of the \nCrPC\n and the provisions of these Sections\n\nmake it clear that the duty of the High Court, in dealing with the\n\nreference, is not only to see whether the order passed by the\n\nSessions Judge is correct, but to examine the case for itself and\n\neven direct a further enquiry or the taking of additional evidence\n\nif the Court considers it desirable in order to ascertain the guilt\n\nor the innocence of the convicted person. It is true that, under\n\nthe proviso to Section 368, no order of confirmation is to be made\n\nuntil the period allowed for preferring the appeal has expired, or,\n\nif an appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is\n\ndisposed of, so that, if an appeal is filed by a condemned prisoner,\n\nthat appeal has to be disposed of before any order is made in the\n\nreference confirming the sentence of death. In disposing of such\n\nan appeal, however, it is necessary that the High Court should\n\nkeep in view its duty under \nSection 367\n CrPC and, consequently,\n\nthe Court must examine the appeal record for itself, arrive at a\n\nview whether a further enquiry or taking of additional evidence is\n\ndesirable or not, and then come to its own conclusion on the\n\nentire material on record whether conviction of the condemned\n\nprisoner is justified and the sentence of death should be\n\nconfirmed. [See: \nBhupendra Singh\n (supra)]\n\n 56\n\n\f60. \nIn \nJumman\n (supra), this Court explained the aforestated\n\nposition in the following words:-\n\n “10. … but there is a difference when a reference is made\n under \nSection 374\n of the Criminal Procedure Code\n (\nSection 366\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973),\n and when disposing of an appeal under \nSection 423\n of\n the Criminal Procedure Code (\nSection 386\n of the Code of\n Criminal Procedure, 1973) and that is that the High Court\n has to satisfy itself as to whether a case beyond\n reasonable doubt has been made out against the accused\n persons for the infliction of the penalty of death. In fact\n the proceedings before the High Court are a reappraisal\n and the reassessment of the entire facts and law in order\n that the High Court should be satisfied on the materials\n about the guilt or innocence of the accused persons. Such\n being the case, it is the duty of the High Court to consider\n the proceedings in all their aspects and come to an\n independent conclusion on the materials, apart from the\n view expressed by the Sessions Judge. In so doing, the\n High Court will be assisted by the opinion expressed by\n the Sessions Judge, but under the provisions of the law\n above-mentioned it is for the High Court to come to an\n independent conclusion of its own.”\n\n61. The same principle was recognised in \nRam Shankar\n\nSingh\n (supra):-\n\n “12. … The High Court had also to consider what order\n should be passed on the reference under Section 374, and\n to decide on an appraisal of the evidence, whether the\n order of conviction for the offences for which the accused\n were convicted was justified and whether, having regard\n to the circumstances, the sentence of death was the\n appropriate sentence. …”\n\n 62. \nIn \nMasalti v. State of U.P.\n, (1964) 8 SCR 133, this Court\n\n was dealing with an appeal under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution\n\n and, in that appeal, on behalf of the persons who were under\n\n 57\n\n\fsentence of death, a point was sought to be urged which was\n\ntaken before the trial court and was rejected by it, but was not\n\nrepeated before the High Court. This Court held:-\n\n “11. …it may, in a proper case, be permissible to the\n appellants to ask this Court to consider that point in an\n appeal under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution; after all in\n criminal proceedings of this character where sentences of\n death are imposed on the appellants, it may not be\n appropriate to refuse to consider relevant and material\n pleas of fact and law only on the ground that they were\n not urged before the High Court. If it is shown that the\n pleas were actually urged before the High Court and had\n not been considered by it, then, of course the party is\n entitled as a matter of right to obtain a decision on those\n pleas from this Court. But even otherwise no hard and\n fast Rule can be laid down prohibiting such pleas being\n raised in appeals under Article 136.”\n\n63. \nIn \nKunal Majumdar v. State of Rajasthan\n, (2012) 9 SCC\n\n320, this Court was dealing with an appeal filed by a convict\n\nsentenced to death. It was noted that the High Court had dealt\n\nwith the reference in a very casual and callous manner by merely\n\nstating that the counsel for the appellant therein pleaded for\n\nsympathetic consideration in commuting the death sentence into\n\nsentence for life. This Court noticed that there was absolutely no\n\nconsideration of the relative merits and demerits of the conviction\n\nand the sentence imposed in the reference under \nSection 366(1)\n\nCrPC in the manner in which it was required to be considered.\n\nThis Court while remitting the matter back to the High Court\n\nobserved thus:-\n\n 58\n\n\f“16. In a case for consideration for confirmation of death\nsentence under \nSection 366(1)\n CrPC, the High Court is\nbound to examine the reference with particular reference\nto the provisions contained in \nSections 367\n to \n371\n CrPC.\nUnder \nSection 367\n CrPC, when reference is submitted\nbefore the High Court, the High Court, if satisfied that a\nfurther enquiry should be made or additional evidence\nshould be taken upon, any point bearing upon the guilt or\ninnocence of the convict person, it can make such enquiry\nor take such evidence itself or direct it to be made or taken\nby the Court of Session. The ancillary powers as regards\nthe presence of the accused in such circumstances have\nbeen provided under sub-sections (2) and (3) of \nSection\n367\n CrPC. Under Section 368, while dealing with the\nreference under Section 366, it inter alia provides for\nconfirmation of the sentence or pass any other sentence\nwarranted by law or may annul the conviction itself and\nin its place convict the accused for any other offence of\nwhich the Court of Session might have convicted the\naccused or order a new trial on the same or an amended\ncharge. It may also acquit the accused person. Under\nSection 370, when such reference is heard by a Bench of\nJudges and if they are divided in their opinion, the case\nshould be decided in the manner provided under Section\n392 as per which the case should be laid before another\nJudge of that Court who should deliver his opinion and\nthe judgment or order should follow that opinion. Here\nagain, under the proviso to Section 392, it is stipulated\nthat if one of the Judges constituting the Bench or where\nthe appeal is laid before another Judge, either of them, if\nso required, direct for rehearing of the appeal for a\ndecision to be rendered by a larger Bench of Judges.\n\n17. When such a special and onerous responsibility has\nbeen imposed on the High Court while dealing with a\nreference under \nSection 366(1)\n CrPC, we are shocked to\nnote that in the order [Criminal Murder Reference No. 1 of\n2007 under\n S. 366(1)\n CrPC, decided on 11-7-2007 (Raj)]\nimpugned herein, the Division Bench merely recorded to\nthe effect that the counsel for the appellant pleaded for\nsympathy to commute the death sentence into one for life\nfor the offence falling under \nSection 302\n IPC while praying\nfor maintaining the sentence imposed for the offence\nunder \nSections 376\n/\n511\n IPC and that there was no\n\n 59\n\n\fopposition from the learned Public Prosecutor. The\nDivision Bench on that sole ground and by merely stating\nthat there was no use of force of severe nature on the\nvictim at the hands of the appellant and that the\ncommission of offence of murder cannot be held to be\nbrutal or inhuman and consequently the death sentence\nwas liable to be altered as one for life for the offence\nunder \nSection 302\n IPC. The Division Bench of the High\nCourt did not bother to exercise its jurisdiction vested in it\nunder \nSection 366(1)\n CrPC read with \nSections 368\n to \n370\n\nand \n392\n CrPC in letter and spirit and thereby, in our\nopinion, shirked its responsibility while deciding the\nreference in the manner it ought to have been otherwise\ndecided under the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. We feel\nthat less said is better while commenting upon the\ncursory manner in which the judgment came to be\npronounced by the Division Bench while dealing with the\nreference under Section 366(1) while passing the\nimpugned judgment [Criminal Murder Reference No. 1 of\n2007 under\n S. 366(1)\n CrPC, decided on 11-7-2007 (Raj)].\n\n18. We are however duty-bound to state and record that\nin a reference made under \nSection 366(1)\n CrPC, there is\nno question of the High Court short-circuiting the process\nof reference by merely relying upon any concession made\nby the counsel for the convict or that of the counsel for the\nState. A duty is cast upon the High Court to examine the\nnature and the manner in which the offence was\ncommitted, the mens rea if any, of the culprit, the plight of\nthe victim as noted by the trial court, the diabolic manner\nin which the offence was alleged to have been performed,\nthe ill-effects it had on the victim as well as the society at\nlarge, the mindset of the culprit vis-à-vis the public\ninterest, the conduct of the convict immediately after the\ncommission of the offence and thereafter, the past history\nof the culprit, the magnitude of the crime and also the\nconsequences it had on the dependants or the custodians\nof the victim. There should be very wide range of\nconsideration to be made by the High Court dealing with\nthe reference in order to ensure that the ultimate outcome\nof the reference would instill confidence in the minds of\npeace-loving citizens and also achieve the object of acting\nas a deterrent for others from indulging in such crimes. ”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 60\n\n\fCONCEPT OF FAIR TRAIL\n\n64. All fair trials are necessarily legally valid, but is the\n\nreverse necessarily true? What then is the genesis of the\n\nconcept of a fair trial? The concept of a fair trial has a very\n\nimpressive ancestry, is rooted in history, enshrined in the\n\nConstitution, sanctified by religious philosophy and juristic\n\ndoctrines and embodied in the statute intended to regulate the\n\ncourse of a criminal trial. Its broad features and ingredients have,\n\nin course of time, been concretised into well recognised\n\nprinciples, even though there are grey areas, which call for\n\nfurther legal thought and research.\n\n65. Truth is the cherished principle and is the guiding\n\nstar of the Indian criminal justice system. For justice to be done\n\ntruth must prevail. Truth is the soul of justice. The sole\n\nidea of criminal justice system is to see that justice is done.\n\nJustice will be said to be done when no innocent person is\n\npunished and the guilty person is not allowed to go scot free.\n\n66. For the dispensation of criminal justice, India follows the\n\naccusatorial or adversarial system of common law. In the\n\naccusatorial or adversarial system the accused is presumed to be\n\ninnocent; prosecution and defence each put their case; judge acts\n\n 61\n\n\fas an impartial umpire and while acting as a neutral umpire sees\n\nwhether the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond\n\nreasonable doubt or not.\n\n67. Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of \nArticle 21\n of the\n\nConstitution of India. If the criminal trial is not free and fair, then\n\nthe confidence of the public in the judicial fairness of a judge and\n\nthe justice delivery system would be shaken. Denial to fair trial is\n\nas much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society.\n\nNo trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial\n\njudge conducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence\n\ncounsel and equally honest, able and fair public prosecutor. A\n\nfair trial necessarily includes fair and proper opportunity to the\n\nprosecutor to prove the guilt of the accused and opportunity to\n\nthe accused to prove his innocence.\n\n68. The role of a judge in dispensation of justice after\n\nascertaining the true facts no doubt is very difficult one. In the\n\npious process of unravelling the truth so as to achieve the\n\nultimate goal of dispensing justice between the parties the judge\n\ncannot keep himself unconcerned and oblivious to the various\n\nhappenings taking place during the progress of trial of any case.\n\nNo doubt he has to remain very vigilant, cautious, fair and\n\nimpartial, and not to give even a slightest of impression that he\n\n 62\n\n\fis biased or prejudiced either due to his own personal convictions\n\nor views in favour of one or the other party. This, however, would\n\nnot mean that the Judge will simply shut his own eyes and be a\n\nmute spectator, acting like a robot or a recording machine to just\n\ndeliver what stands feeded by the parties.\n\n69. Malimath Committee on Judicial Reforms discussed\n\nthe paramount duty of Courts to search for truth. The relevant\n\nobservations of the Committee are as under:-\n\n (a) The Indian ethos accords the highest importance to truth.\n\n The motto “Satyameva Jayate” (Truth alone succeeds) is\n\n inscribed in our National Emblem “Ashoka Sthambha”. Our\n\n epics extol the virtue of truth.\n\n (b) For the common man truth and justice are synonymous.\n\n So when truth fails, justice fails. Those who know that the\n\n acquitted accused was in fact the offender, lose faith in the\n\n system.\n\n (c) In practice however we find that the Judge, in his anxiety\n\n to demonstrate his neutrality opts to remain passive and truth\n\n often becomes a casualty.\n\n (d) Truth being the cherished ideal and ethos of India, pursuit\n\n of truth should be the guiding star of the Justice System. For\n\n justice to be done truth must prevail. It is truth that must\n\n 63\n\n\f protect the innocent and it is truth that must be the basis to\n\n punish the guilty. Truth is the very soul of justice. Therefore,\n\n truth should become the ideal to inspire the courts to pursue.\n\n (e) Many countries which have Inquisitorial model have\n\n inscribed in their Parliamentary Acts a duty to find the truth\n\n in the case. In Germany \nSection 139\n of the so called ‘Majna\n\n Charta’, a breach of the Judges' duty to actively discover truth\n\n would promulgate a procedural error which may provide\n\n grounds for an appeal.\n\n (f) For Courts of justice there cannot be any better or higher\n\n ideal than quest for truth.\n\n70. This Court has condemned the passive role played by the\n\nJudges and emphasized the importance and legal duty of a Judge\n\nto take an active role in the proceedings in order to find the truth\n\nto administer justice and to prevent the truth from becoming a\n\ncasualty. A Judge is also duty bound to act with impartiality and\n\nbefore he gives an opinion or sits to decide the issues between the\n\nparties, he should be sure that there is no bias against or for\n\neither of the parties to the lis. For a judge to properly discharge\n\nthis duty the concept of independence of judiciary is in existence\n\nand it includes ability and duty of a Judge to decide each case\n\n 64\n\n\faccording to an objective evaluation and application of the law,\n\nwithout the influence of outside factors.\n\n71. If the Courts are to impart justice in a free, fair and\n\neffective manner, then the presiding judge cannot afford to\n\nremain a mute spectator totally oblivious to the various\n\nhappenings taking place around him, more particularly,\n\nconcerning a particular case being tried by him. The fair trial is\n\npossible only when the court takes active interest and elicit all\n\nrelevant information and material necessary so as to find out the\n\ntruth for achieving the ultimate goal of dispensing justice with all\n\nfairness and impartiality to both the parties.\n\n72. \nIn \nRam Chander\n (supra), while speaking about the\n\npresiding judge in a criminal trial, Chinnappa Reddy, J. observed\n\nthat if a criminal court is to be an effective instrument in\n\ndispensing justice, the presiding judge must cease to be a\n\nspectator and a mere recording machine. He must become a\n\nparticipant in the trial by evincing intelligent active interest by\n\nputting questions to witnesses in order to ascertain the truth.\n \nThe\n\nlearned Judge reproduced a passage from \nSessions Judge,\n\nNellore v. Intha Ramana Reddy\n, 1972 Cri.L.J. 1485, which\n\nreads as follows:—\n\n “Every criminal trial is a voyage of discovery in which\n truth is the quest. It is the duty of a presiding Judge to\n\n 65\n\n\f explore every avenue open to him in order to discover the\n truth and to advance the cause of justice. For that\n purpose he is expressly invested by \nSection 165\n of the\n Evidence Act with the right to put questions to witnesses.\n Indeed the right given to a Judge is so wide that he may,\n ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any\n time, of any witness, or of the parties about any fact,\n relevant or irrelevant. \nSection 172(2)\n of the\n Code of Criminal Procedure enables the court to send for\n the police-diaries in a case and use them to aid it in the\n trial. The record of the proceedings of the Committing\n Magistrate may also be perused by the Sessions Judge to\n further aid him in the trial.”\n\n73. For all the foregoing reasons, we are left with no other\n\nalternative but to set aside the impugned judgment of the High\n\nCourt and remit the matter back to the High Court for deciding\n\nthe reference under \nSection 366\n of the CrPC in the manner it\n\nought to have been decided, more particularly keeping in mind\n\nthe serious lapses on the part of the defence in not proving major\n\ncontradictions in the form of material omissions surfacing from\n\nthe oral evidence of the prosecution witnesses.\n\n74. If anyone would ask us the question, “What is the ratio of\n\nthis Judgment?” The answer to the same would be very simple\n\nand plain, in the words of Clarence Darrow;\n\n “Justice has nothing to do with what goes on in the\n courtroom; Justice is what comes out of a courtroom.”\n\n75. In the result, the impugned judgment of the High Court is\n\nset aside and the matter is remitted back to the High Court for\n\n 66\n\n\freconsideration of the Death Reference No. 4 of 2017 and\n\nCriminal Appeal (DB) No. 358 of 2017. The Death Reference No.\n\n4 of 2017 and Criminal Appeal (DB) No. 358 of 2017 stand\n\nrestored for reconsideration of the High Court in accordance with\n\nlaw.\n\n76. The appellant is in jail past more than nine years. In such\n\ncircumstances, the Death Reference \nreferred to above\n on being\n\nrestored to the file of the High Court shall be taken up for hearing\n\nexpeditiously. The learned Chief Justice of the High Court is\n\nrequested to notify the Death Reference along with the Criminal\n\nAppeal for hearing before a Bench which he may deem fit to\n\nconstitute. We also request the learned Judges who would be\n\nhearing the matter to give priority and dispose of the same at the\n\nearliest in accordance with law.\n\n77. As the appellant convict is in jail past more than nine\n\nyears, his family might be in dire straits. He may not be in a\n\nposition to engage a lawyer of his choice. Probably, he may not be\n\nin a position to even understand what is said in this judgment.\n\nIn such circumstances, the High Court may request a seasoned\n\ncriminal side lawyer to appear on behalf of the appellant and\n\nassist the Court.\n\n 67\n\n\f78. The Registry shall forward one copy each of this judgment\n\nto all the High Courts with a further request to each of the High\n\nCourts to circulate the same in its respective district judiciary.\n\n79. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.\n\n ……………………………………..J.\n ( B.R. GAVAI )\n\n ……………………………………..J.\n ( J.B.
