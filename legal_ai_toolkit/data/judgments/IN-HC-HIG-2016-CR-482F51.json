JUSTICE SUNITA GUPTA\n\nJUDGMENT\n\n: SUNITA GUPTA, J.\n\n1. Maya Devi and Preeti are the mother-in-law and sister-in-law of\ndeceased Deepa who met an unfortunate death on 07.08.2015. They seek\nanticipatory bail in case FIR No. 981/15 under\nSection 498A\n/\n304B\n/\nIPC\nregistered with police station Prashant Vihar.\n\n2. The FIR was registered on the basis of a statement made by Brijesh\nYadav, brother of the deceased to the Executive Magistrate.\n\n3. Learned senior advocate for the petitioners submits that deceased\nDeepa got married to Abhishek Kaushik on 07.11.2011 as per Hindu rites\nand customs. It was an intercast love marriage in which no dowry was\ngiven nor same was demanded by the applicants or any other family\nmember, as admitted by the complainant in his statement given to the SDM.\nThe complainant had specifically admitted in his statement that there were\nsome petty disputes with the applicants. Therefore, her husband was\nsearching for a separate house for last ten days. Abhishek Kaushik, husband\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 2 of 12\n\nof the deceased was arrested on 24.01.2016 and thereafter he was released\non regular bail on 06.02.2016. Subsequently, a complaint was made\nwherein also there were no allegations of demand of dowry. It was for the\nfirst time when a complaint was made to Commissioner of Police on\n02.09.2015 that it was alleged that demand of Rs.10 lacs and two diamond\nsets was being made. Learned counsel further submits that the statement of\nmother, brother and sister of the deceased and a maid servant were recorded\nbelatedly. Moreover, as per the statements, demand of Rs.10 lacs and two\ndiamond sets were made on the occasion of birth of the child which at the\nmost is a customary gift. Moreover, question of demanding these items does\nnot arise as the complainant himself was facing financial crisis and he\napproached the family of the applicants to help him. Out of love and\naffection, Sh.B.K.Kaushik, father-in-law of the deceased gave a sum of\nRs.5lacs to the complainant Brijesh Yadav through RTGS. Prior to that, he\nhad also given a sum of Rs.15 lacs to the cousin of complainant on\n27.02.2013 through RTGS. The statements made by the witnesses are\nafterthought. The petitioners have already joined investigation. They have\nroots in the society. Maya Devi is working as a teacher in a Government\nschool as such, there is no apprehension of fleeing from justice. They are\nstill ready and willing to join investigation as such, they be granted the\nbenefit of anticipatory bail.\n\n4. Initially, when the bail application was filed and transferred to this\nCourt, Mr.Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing Counsel appeared\nfor the State, however, on the date of hearing of the bail application,\nMr.Mukesh Gupta, Advocate also appeared and placed on record copy of\nthe order vide which he has been appointed as Special Public Prosecutor in\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 3 of 12\n\nthe bail application. The same was opposed by Mr.Rajesh Mahajan,\nAdditional Standing Counsel on the ground that he was appointed by the\nState to contest these bail applications, however, without going into the said\ncontroversy, since the bail applications are opposed by both the counsels, as\nsuch, they were advised to assist each other.\n\n5. Mr.Rajesh Mahajan, learned Additional Standing counsel submits that\nalthough FIR was initially registered under\nSection 498A\n/34IPC\nsubsequently,\nSection 304B\nIPC was added. For invoking the provisions of\n\nSection 304B\nIPC, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove:\n\n(i) The deceased met with an unnatural death;\n(ii) The unnatural death had taken place within seven years of the\nmarriage;\n\n(iii) Deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment on account of\ndemand of dowry;\n\n(iv) Soon before her death, the deceased was subjected to\ncruelty/harassment on account of dowry.\n\nCounsel submits that in the instant case all the four essential\ningredients are there as there is no dispute that the deceased got married with\nAbhishek Kaushik on 07.11.2011 and she met an unnatural death on\n07.08.2015. As regards the cruelty or harassment to the deceased on account\nof dowry, although it was admitted that in the initial complaint made by\nBrijesh Yadav, he had stated that the in-laws never demanded dowry from\nhis sister but in the subsequent complaint the reasons for this omission was\nduly explained where it was stated that Abhishek Kaushik is a practicing\nlawyer in Rohini court. When Deepa was taken to hospital several lawyers\nfrom legal fraternity were present in the hospital and they pressurized the\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 4 of 12\n\ncomplainant not to make a correct statement before the Executive\nMagistrate. Moreover, under their influence even the local police was not\ninvestigating the matter properly, therefore, complainant was compelled to\nmake a complaint to the Commissioner of Police on 02.09.2015 wherein it\nwas specifically stated that the deceased was being harassed for fulfillment\nof demand of Rs.10 lacs and two diamond sets. Reference was also made to\nthe status report that the investigation was thereafter transferred to DIU/OD\non 02.12.2015 and till then even the statement of relatives of the deceased\nwere not recorded. After the investigation was transferred to DIU/OD, the\ninvestigating officer recorded the statement of mother, brother and sister of\nthe victim as well as Kusum, maid servant who was sent to the house of the\ndeceased after the birth of the child to look after the child as well as the\ndeceased expenses of which were borne by the mother of the deceased.\nCounsels submits that in the statements all the witnesses have clearly stated\nthat the deceased was being constantly harassed for bringing Rs.10 lacs and\ntwo diamond sets and even on the fateful day, she had talked to her mother\nas well as sister and reiterated these demands. Learned Additional Public\nProsecutor further refers to the statement of the mother, brother and sister of\nthe deceased recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C where there are allegations\nof harassment to the deceased and demand of Rs.10 lacs and two diamond\nsets. Mother of the deceased further alleged that her statement was not\nrecorded by the police and SDM since on 08.08.2015 some of the advocates\nand one retired police officer kept pressurizing them. She further stated that\non the date of incident, she had talked to her daughter and tried to pacify her.\nBesides that, statement of one maid Smt.Kusum was recorded who worked\nto take care of the child of the victim for about two months in the in-laws\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 5 of 12\n\nhouse of the deceased. She also stated that deceased was being regularly\ntortured by her mother-in-law, sister-in-law and husband for demand of\ndowry. She used to describe these things to the victim's mother on her\nmobile. As per the status report, the analysis of CDR of deceased Deepa\nshows that soon before her death she had talked to her mother and sister and\nthe CDR details confirms talks of Smt.Kusum with the mother of the\ndeceased. Counsel further submits that the relatives of the deceased alleged\nthat they are being threatened by the relatives of the accused persons\ntherefore FIR No.563/15 at police station Maurya Enclave was registered. A\ncomplaint under\nSection 156(3)\nCr.P.C was also made by the complainant\nbefore the learned Metropolitan Magistrate Rohini in this regard. Due to\nsecurity reasons, the mother and brother of the deceased had shifted to\nGurgaon where their statements were recorded by the investigating officer of\nthe case after transfer of investigation to DIU. Learned ASC further submits\nthat during investigation, it has been found that twice abortion/termination of\npregnancy was got done from Kalra Hospital, Kirti Nagar, Delhi. Cash\nwithdrawal of Rs.4 lacs on 03.07.2014 and Rs.5 lacs on 21.10.2014 as\nalleged to have been paid by cash to the father-in-law and husband of the\nvictim is found in the account statements of complainant. In addition to it,\nRs.2 lacs RTGS transaction on 05.07.2014 is also found in favour of victim\nafter her marriage from the account of the complainant. It is further stated\nthat the deceased had found a CD allegedly an obscene CD of sister-in-law\nwhich was one of the cause of quarrel however the mobile phone of the\nvictim, her computer, CD and money could not be recovered. Although the\npetitioners were granted interim protection but they are not cooperating in\nthe investigation. Local enquiry also revealed that there used to be abusive\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 6 of 12\n\narguments among family members prior to the incident specially between\nthe petitioners on the one side and victim on another side.\nAs such, it is\nsubmitted that the investigation is at initial stage, the allegations are serious\nin nature, viscera report is yet to be received; recovery of mobile phone of\ndeceased, laptop, CD etc. is yet to the effected. Possibility of tampering with\nevidence and influencing independent witnesses cannot be ruled out in view\nof the past complaints of the family members of the deceased as such, it is\nsubmitted that the petitioners are not entitled to be granted benefit of\nanticipatory bail. Reliance was placed on\nSangita vs. State NCT of Delhi\nBail Appl.No.1601/2011\nand\nLavesh vs. State NCT of Delhi Bail\nAppl.No.1602/2011\nwhich was also a case under\nSection 498A\n/\n304B\nIPC\nand the petitioners were the real sister and brother of husband of deceased.\n\nApplication for grant of anticipatory bail was filed by them which was\ndismissed by this Court on 05.12.2011 by placing reliance on\nSamunder\nSingh vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n(1987) 1 SCC 466. SLP was preferred\nagainst that order which was also dismissed vide order dated 31.08.2012 by\nobserving that while considering such a request for grant of anticipatory bail,\nthe Court has to take into consideration the nature and gravity of the\naccusations, antecedents, possibility of the applicant to flee from justice etc.\nFurther, normally, the court should not exercise its discretion to grant\nanticipatory bail in disregard and magnitude and seriousness of the matter,\nthe matter regarding unnatural death of the daughter-in-law at the house of\nher in-laws is still under investigation and the appropriate course to adopt\nwas to allow the Magistrate concerned to deal with the same on the basis of\nmaterial before the Court.\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 7 of 12\n\n6.\nSamunder Singh\n(supra) was an appeal and the same was dismissed\nwith the following observations:-\n\n\"The widespread belief that dowry deaths are even now treated with some\ncasualness at all levels seems to be well grounded. The High Court has granted\nanticipatory bail in such a matter. We are of the opinion that the High Court\nshould not have exercised its jurisdiction to release the accused on anticipatory\nbail in disregard of the magnitude and seriousness of the matter. The matter\nregarding the unnatural death of the daughter-in-law at the house of her father-in-\nlaw was still under investigation and the appropriate course to adopt was to allow\nthe concerned magistrate to deal with the same on the basis of the material before\nthe court at the point of time of their arrest in case they were arrested. It was\nneither prudent nor proper for the High Court to have granted anticipatory bail\nwhich order was very likely to occasion prejudice by its very nature and timing.\nWe therefore consider it essential to sound a serious note of caution for future.\nThe High Court is under no compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant\nanticipatory bail in a matter of this nature. So far as the present matter is\nconcerned, since it has become infructuous, we do not propose to pass any order.\nSubject to these observations, the appeal is dismissed.\"\n\n7. Reliance was also placed on\nAlamgir Sani vs. State of Assam\n(2002)\n10 SCC 277 where also the initial complaint was lacking in certain\nparticulars regarding demand of dowry and it was submitted that the\nevidence of demand for dowry could not be believed at all. Repelling the\ncontention, Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that \"human nature is very\ncomplex. Different persons react differently under pressure or in times of\nsudden bereavement or grief. The shock suffered by a parent having seen\nhis daughter dead in an unnatural manner can in some cases prevent\nimmediate outpouring of reasons. Each case would have to be tested on its\nown facts and no hard and fast rule can be\nlaid down in\nthis behalf.\n\n8. Mr.Mukesh Gupta, learned Special Public Prosecutor supported the\nsubmissions of learned Additional Standing Counsel and opposed the bail\napplication on the ground that custodial interrogation of the petitioners is\nrequired for recovery of laptop, mobile, CD etc. Moreover, reference was\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 8 of 12\n\nmade to the conduct of the petitioners for submitting that due to threats\nadministered by the relatives of the petitioners, mother of the deceased was\ncompelled to shift to Gurgaon.\n\n9. Learned Senior advocate for the complainant adopted the arguments\nraised by learned Additional Standing Counsel as well as learned Special\nPublic Prosecutor for the State. In addition, it was submitted that at the\ninitial juncture a wrong information was given to the mother of the\ndeceased by Abhishek Kaushik, husband of the deceased by stating that\nDeepa has suffered a heart attack. When mother of the deceased informed\nhim that she is coming to the house then she was informed that she is being\ntaken to Bhagwati Hospital. When the mother of the deceased alongwith\nyounger brother and other relatives reached the hospital, they noticed some\nspots on the throat of Deepa. On enquiry Abhishek Kaushik informed that\nshe has committed suicide.\nIt was further submitted that due to the influence\nexerted by some advocates, friends of Abhishek Kaushik, the complainant\ncould not give the complete and correct narration of facts before the\nExecutive Magistrate under their pressure. Even the local police did not\ninvestigated the matter properly. It was only after the investigation was\ntransferred to DIU that the statement of some of the relatives and an\nindependent witness was recorded which reflects the circumstances under\nwhich the unfortunate incident has taken place within four and a half years\nof her marriage. Reliance was placed on\nSamunder Singh vs. State of\nRajasthan\n(1987) 1 SCC 466;\nState vs. Jaspal Singh Gill\n(1984) 3 SCC\n555;\nGajanand Agarwal vs. State of Orissa\n2007(14) SCC 537;\nCentral\nBureau of Investigation vs. V. Vijay Sai Reddy\n2013 (7) SCALE 15;\nNassirudin vs. State of NCT 2014 (13) SCC 579;\nRamesh Arjan Thadani\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 9 of 12\n\nvs. State of Maharashtra\n1995 CRLJ 2782 and Sanjay Bahl vs. State of\nU.P. 1995 Crl.J 1658.\n\n10. Rebutting the submissions of learned counsels for the complainant as\nwell as the learned Public Prosecutor for the State, learned senior advocate\nfor the petitioners submits that the mother of the deceased had shifted to\nGurgaon because they were allotted a flat by Haryana Urban Development\nAuthority in the year 1987 and after the house was constructed they shifted\nto this house and not because of any threat, as alleged by them. Moreover,\nin order to bring the case within the ingredient of \"soon before death\" as\nrequired under\nSection 304B\nIPC, the alleged demand of Rs.10 lacs and two\ndiamond jewellery was set up on the occasion of birth of son of the\ndeceased who was born in January and the customary function took place in\nMarch, 2015 but the alleged demand is being stretched to August, 2015.\n\n11. I have carefully considered the submissions made by learned counsels\nfor the parties.\n\n12. Needless to say, the allegations levelled against the petitioners are\nserious in nature. While dealing with application for grant of anticipatory\nbail, among other circumstances, the following factors have also to be\nconsidered before granting bail, they are:\n\ni) The nature of accusations and the severity of punishment in case of\nconviction and nature of supporting evidence;\n\nii) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witness or\napprehension of threat to the complainant;\n\niii) Prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of the charge.\n\n13. The deceased has committed suicide within four and a half years from\nthe date of her marriage. It is true that in the initial complaint made by\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 10 of 12\n\nBrijesh Yadav, brother of the deceased, to the Executive Magistrate it was\nalleged that there was no demand of dowry, however, the subsequent\ncomplaints made by him reflect the circumstances under which such a\nstatement was made before the Executive Magistrate. Moreover, the local\npolice had not even recorded the statement of the near and close relatives of\nthe deceased. It was only subsequently a complaint was made by Brijesh\nYadav for inaction on the part of the police and subsequently another\ncomplaint was made stating therein that the deceased was subjected to\nharassment on account of constant demand of Rs.10 lacs and two diamond\njewellery sets. It was only after the investigation was transferred to DIU\nthat the statement of mother, another brother, sister and maid of the\ndeceased were recorded which unfolded the demand of Rs.10 lacs and two\ndiamond sets. All this material collected during investigation will be subject\nto scrutiny at the trial by the Sessions Judge at the appropriate stage. As per\nthe status report, there was some money transaction which reflected\npayment of Rs.4 lacs, 5 lacs and 2 lacs by the complainant whereas\naccording to petitioners a sum of Rs.5 lac and 15 lac was given by father-in-\nlaw of deceased to her brother and cousin. All these transactions are\nrequired to be investigated. Moreover, although the petitioners have joined\ninvestigation pursuant to the interim protection granted to them however it\nis alleged that they are not cooperating with the investigation. The CD\nalleged to be containing obscene pictures of Preeti, video clip, mobile and\nlaptop of the deceased etc. are yet to be recovered. Despite the fact that\nAbhishek Kaushik was arrested and his police custody remand was taken\nbut these things could not be recovered. Moreover, there are allegations of\nthreats being administered to the complainant and his family members\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 11 of 12\n\nwhich resulted in registration of FIR No. 563/2015 under\nSection 506\nIPC\nat police station Maurya Enclave and it is alleged that because of security\nreason, the complainant and his family members were compelled to shift\nGurgaon. At the stage of bail, the Court is not to threadbare analyse the\nevidence furnished by the prosecution. That exercise will only be done after\nthe witnesses have been examined in the trial court.\n\n14. For the reasons mentioned above and since the case is still at the\nthreshold, I do not think that it is a case where benefit of anticipatory bail\ndeserves to be extended to the petitioners. Accordingly, the applications are\ndismissed. The interim protection granted to the petitioners vide order dated\n17.02.2016 and extended thereafter stands vacated.\n\n15. It is clarified that expression of any opinion may not be treated as an\nexpression on merits of the case.\n\n(SUNITA GUPTA)\nJUDGE\nAPRIL 19, 2016\nmb\n\nBail Appln.352-2016 & Bail Appln. 354-2016 Page 12 of 12",
