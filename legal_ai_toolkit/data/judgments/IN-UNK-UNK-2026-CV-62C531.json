RESPONDENTS\n\n(BY SRI.A.G. SHIVANNA, ADDL. ADVOCATE GENERAL A/W\n SRI RAVI V.HOSAMANI, AGA FOR R1-R5)\n\n THESE WRIT PETITIONS ARE FILED UNDER \nARTICLES\n226\n \n& 227\n OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO\nSTRUCK DOWN THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT NO.07 OF\n\"KARNATAKA PRIVATE AIDED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS\nEMPLOYEES (REGULATION OF PAY, PENSION AND OTHER\nBENEFITS) ACT, 2014\" AND CONSEQUETNLY TO QUASH THE\nGAZETTE NOTIFICATION DATED 12.02.2014 PUBLISHED IN\nKARNATAKA GAZETTE DATED 12.02.2014 IN PART IV(A) BY THE\nRESPONDENT NO.1 AS PER ANNEXURE-E.\n\n THESE WRIT PETITIONS BEING HEARD AND RESERVED,\nCOMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY,\nTHE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:\n : 240 :\n\n ORDER\n\n In all these petitions, the constitutional validity of\n\nthe Act known and called as '\nThe Karnataka Private\n\nAided Educational Institutions Employees (Regulation of\n\nPay, Pension and Other Benefits) Act, 2014\n, (for short\n\n'Act No.7/2004') is under challenge. Petitioners are also\n\nseeking for treating the employees of aided private\n\neducational institutions who have been admitted to\n\ngrant-in-aid on par with employees working in\n\nGovernment Educational Institutions in providing\n\nservice benefits.\n\n 2. I have heard the arguments of Sriyuths\n\nJanardhan G., Vittal S Teli, J.S.Shetty, A.S.Patil,\n\nSharmila M.Patil, learned counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof petitioners and Sri A.G.Shivanna, learned Additional\n\nAdvocate General along with Sri Ravi V Hosamani,\n\nlearned Additional Government Advocate appearing on\n\nbehalf of respondent/State. In few of the writ petitions,\n\n : 241 :\n\nthe institutions in which the petitioners are working\n\nhave also been arrayed as parties and notices issued to\n\nthem either has been served, represented or unserved\n\nand yet to be served. Their presence or absence and\n\ntheir say in these writ petitions would have no bearing\n\non the contentions raised by the petitioners in aid of the\n\nrelief sought for by them in these writ petitions. Hence,\n\nby consent of learned advocates appearing for parties,\n\nthese writ petitions are taken up together for hearing\n\nand disposed of by this common order since grounds\n\nurged and defence putforth in all these writ petitions are\n\ncommon, similar and identical.\n\n 3. The grievance of the petitioners is they have\n\nbeen appointed as Lecturers, Teachers, Clerical Staff\n\netc., by the Management of the aided institutions in\n\nwhich they are now at present working and their\n\nappointment was approved subsequently on various\n\ndates (in respect of different petitioners) by admitting\n\n : 242 :\n\nthem to grant-in-aid and the non-grant period was not\n\nconsidered for purposes of seniority and fixing the pay-\n\nscale. It is also contended that some of the petitioners\n\nworking as teachers had undergone career advancement\n\nscheme as per the requirement of UGC guidelines and\n\non fulfilling the said requirement, they are being paid\n\nsalary accordingly, by extending all benefits. It is also\n\ncontended that the petitioners have been granted the\n\nrevised UGC pay-scales from time to time from the date\n\nof joining of service.\n\n 4. It is also contended that on account of the\n\nState undertaking to exclude the non-grant period for\n\nthe purposes of reckoning seniority and other service\n\nbenefits, some of the teachers had approached this\n\nCourt seeking for a direction to the State to include the\n\nnon-grant period also for service benefits and same\n\ncame to be allowed which was later affirmed by the\n\nDivision Bench and also by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It\n\n : 243 :\n\nis contended that pursuant to the said order, first\n\nrespondent extended the triple benefit scheme for non-\n\ngrant period also and to over come the orders passed by\n\nthis Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court, the present Act\n\nhas been introduced with retrospective effect from\n\n01.06.1995, whereby for the non-grant period extending\n\nthe triple benefit scheme now stands excluded.\n\n 5. It is also the grievance of the petitioners that\n\npursuant to the same, second respondent has issued\n\nCirculars to the institutions/colleges where the\n\npetitioners are working to implement the provisions of\n\namended Act and accordingly re-fix their salaries by\n\nexcluding the non-grant period and as such, these\n\ninstitutions/colleges are making attempts to re-fix the\n\nsalaries of the petitioners.\n\n 6. It is contended by the petitioners that in\n\ndoing so, it would amount to discrimination between the\n\nemployees of State and employees of private institutions\n\n : 244 :\n\nand all teachers will have to be treated equally and as\n\nsuch the impugned Act is violative of \nArticle 14\n of the\n\nConstitution. It is also contended that the State having\n\nbeen unsuccessful before all the Courts including the\n\nApex Court in repudiating the claim of the petitioners\n\nfor treating the non-grant period to be excluded has now\n\nsought to negate the dicta of the Courts by bringing the\n\npresent legislation retrospectively.\n\n 7. The contentions raised in these writ petitions\n\nby the petitioners can be crystalised as under:\n\n i) State cannot deny the service benefits\n to the employees working in\n institutions admitted to grant-in-aid\n though same is extended to the\n employees working in Government\n colleges/institutions and it would\n amount to discrimination since both\n are discharging same duties;\n\n ii) When \nSection 87\n of Karnataka\n Education Act, has fixed same\n\n : 245 :\n\n parameters for both the employees\n namely employees working in\n educational institutions receiving grant\n from the State will be the same as\n those applicable for corresponding\n category of employees in any State\n institutions, same cannot be whittled\n down by the amending Act that too,\n retrospectively and particularly when\n the provisions of existing Act has been\n interpreted by the Courts to the benefit\n of the petitioners and as such, taking\n away the benefit accrued by such\n orders of the Court through legislation\n would be violative of \nArticle 14\n of the\n Constitution.\n\niii) When \nSection 87\n of the Karnataka\n Education Act, 1983, along with Rules\n (1), (3), 2 (d), 3, 3 (1) (a) (b) (c), 3 (2) (a)\n and Rule 17 (1) of Karnataka\n Education Rules, has been examined,\n interpreted and held by the Courts that\n employees working in private\n institutions are entitled for the triple\n\n : 246 :\n\n benefit scheme on par with the\n employees working in institutions run\n by Government, State cannot shrug off\n its responsibility in complying with\n such orders by taking recourse to\n nullify the said orders through\n impugned retrospective legislation.\n\niv) When petitioners and similarly placed\n employees have been granted all\n service benefits with prior approval of\n the State, such benefits already\n granted cannot be taken away by\n impugned retrospective legislation.\n\nv) Any attempt by the State to nullify the\n effect of judicial pronouncement\n amounts to encroachment of judicial\n power,\n\nvi) When Hon'ble Supreme Court has held\n that claim of teachers in aided schools\n for parity in the matter of pay and\n pension to be the same granted to\n teachers working in Government\n schools/colleges and has granted such\n\n : 247 :\n\n parity, same cannot be denied on the\n ground of financial burden to the State\n as it would not be a valid ground for\n denying the pay parity.\n\n vii) It is also contended that statement and\n objects of the Act would clearly indicate\n that to avoid financial burden to the\n State, impugned legislation is being\n brought in retrospectively and same\n would amount to taking away the\n fundamental right of the petitioners.\n\n viii) The principle of equal pay for equal\n work would apply in all force to the\n petitioners and as such, there cannot\n be any discrimination between them\n and the employees working in\n institutions run by Government.\n\n 8. The learned advocates appearing for the\n\nparties having reiterated the above raised contentions\n\nand have also supplemented their contentions which\n\ncan be summarised as under:\n\n : 248 :\n\ni) When judgments have been passed by\n the Courts holding that petitioners are\n entitled for equal pay on par with\n Government teachers/staff from the\n date of appointment or initial entry into\n service and not from the date they were\n admitted to grant-in-aid same cannot\n be nullified by the Act in question that\n too, with retrospective effect.\n\nii) The impugned Act attempts to nullify\n the judgments of this Court and\n Hon'ble Apex Court and same is\n impermissible and is violative of\n Articles 13, 14 and 16 of the\n\n Constitution of India since these issues\n which have been concluded by the\n judgments and the object with which\n the Act impugned is being brought in is\n not for a bonafide reason but tainted\n with malafides.\n\niii) By the impugned Act a reasonable\n classification between two classes of\n employees is not brought about but it\n\n : 249 :\n\n discriminates between two classes of\n employees who are similarly placed\n and who have put in equal service and\n it further discriminates between same\n class of teachers i.e., between the\n teachers of aided institutions and\n teachers of Government colleges.\n\niv) \nThe Education Act\n being in concurrent\n list, impugned Act in question over\n rides the Central Act and same is\n beyond legislature competence of the\n State legislation.\n\nv) Pension and salary is not a bounty\n given by the State but it is a property\n right and same is being taken away by\n impugned legislation.\n\nvi) Even teachers who were working in\n Government colleges as stop-gap\n lectureres have been extended benefit\n from the date of initial entry into\n service and by the impugned Act,\n benefit granted to them would not be\n\n : 250 :\n\n taken away but on the other hand\n such benefit extended to petitioners\n and similarly placed persons would be\n taken away and as such there would\n be discrimination between petitioners\n and stop-gap lecturers working in\n Government colleges.\n\nvii) Provisions of \nSection 3\n of Act 7 of 2014\n is ultra vires the powers of the State\n Legislature as it encroaches upon\n judicial field and over rule the judicial\n pronouncements which is binding\n between interse parties. Thus, any\n action to take away the power of the\n judicial pronouncements would be\n ultra vires of the power of the\n Legislature and binding judicial\n pronouncement between the parties\n cannot be made ineffective with the aid\n of legislative power by enacting a\n statute which in substance over rules\n such judgments and it would not be in\n the realm of legislative enactment\n\n : 251 :\n\n which displaces the basis or\n foundation of such judgments.\n\n viii) It is contended that in the instant case,\n Courts have not struck down any\n legislation so as to enable the\n Legislature to remove the defect in the\n statute pointed out in the judgment so\n as to bring in the impugned legislation\n retrospectively and as such the\n legislature have no power or\n competency to nullify the binding effect\n of the judgments rendered by Courts\n which are binding interse parties.\n\n 9. In support of their submissions they have\n\nrelied upon the following judgments:\n\n \ni) AIR 1996 SC 188\n S.R.Bhagwat & Others vs. State Of Mysore\n\n ii) 2012 (3) Kar.L.J. 77 (DB)\n State of Karnataka vs. I. Rudrayya and\n others\n\n iii) AIR 1976 SC 2250\n I.N.Saksena, R.D.Doongaji vs. State Of\n Madhya Pradesh\n\n : 252 :\n\niv) AIR 1996 SC 1431\n Indian Aluminium Company Limited vs.\n State of Kerala\n\nv) 1994 (5) SCC 450\n Union of India vs. Tushar Ranjan Mohanty\n\nvi) AIR 2005 SC 137\n Virender Singh Hooda vs. State of Haryana\n\nvii) AIR 1970 SC 192\n Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Limited vs. Broach\n Borough Municipality and others\n\nviii) AIR 1971 SC 57\n Janapada Sabha Chhindwara, State of\n Madhya Pradesh vs. Central Provinces\n Syndicate Limited, Amalgamated Coal Fields\n Limited.\n\nix) AIR 1987 SC 411\n State of Mysore vs. B.Basavalingappa\n\nx) AIR 1973 SC 1088\n Purushottam Lal and others vs. Union of\n India (UOI) and another.\n\nxi) AIR 1969(2) Unreported Judgment 616\n (SC)\n Mahal Chand Sethia vs. State West of Bengal\n\nxii) AIR 1997 SC 3828\n Chairman, Railway Board and Others vs.\n C.R.Rangadhamaiah and others\n\n : 253 :\n\n \nxiii) (2000)2 SCC 42\n Chandigarh Administration and others vs.\n Rajni Vali (Mrs.) and Others\n.\n\n 10. Per contra, Sri A G Shivanna, learned\n\nAdditional Advocate General appearing along with Sri\n\nRavi V Hosamani, learned Additional Government\n\nAdvocate would reiterate the contentions raised in the\n\nstatement of objections in W.P.No.21216/2014 and\n\ncontends that said plea put forward by the State would\n\nhold good as the defense of the State in respect of all\n\nother writ petitions and elaborates his submission by\n\ncontending that grant-in-aid is not a right and same is a\n\nmatter of policy of the State and as such, first\n\nrespondent taking into account its economic capacity\n\nand development of the State has taken a conscious\n\ndecision not to consider the non-grant period for pay,\n\npension and other benefits and decisions rendered by\n\nthis Court to consider the non-grant service period for\n\nsame would amount to amendment of the existing\n\n : 254 :\n\nGovernment policy by way of judicial order and it also\n\namounts to extension of benefits to persons to whom\n\nthe policy was not intended to apply and as such, the\n\nKarnataka Private Aided Educational Institutions\n\nEmployees (Regulation of Pay, Pension and other\n\nbenefits) Act, 2014 was brought in and it satisfies the\n\nthree tenets prescribed by catena of judgments of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court namely, (1) impugned Act satisfies\n\nthe test of legislative competence; (2) defect pointed out\n\nby the Courts in the judgments is cured by complying\n\nwith legal and constitutional requirements; and (3) there\n\nis no violation of rights guaranteed in part III of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n 11. He would also further contend that \nSection\n\n87\n of the Education Act having been amended by\n\nOrdinance 1 of 2004, the defect or deficiency in the\n\nstatutory provision which was pointed out by the Courts\n\nin various earlier judgments which have been relied\n\n : 255 :\n\nupon by the petitioners has been sought to be removed\n\nby the impugned legislation and Legislature is fully\n\nempowered to prescribe the conditions for excluding the\n\nnon-grant period. He would also contend that pension\n\nof Government employees are governed by Karnataka\n\nCivil Services Rules and none of the petitioners fit into\n\nthe category of a Government employee i.e., they do not\n\nsatisfy the three conditions prescribed under Chapter\n\nXVI of Karnataka Civil Services Rules so as to claim\n\nequality with employees working in institutions run by\n\nGovernment. He would also submit by way of alternate\n\nsubmission that law which was already found in \nSection\n\n87\n of the Education Act has been clarified by Act 7 of\n\n2014 and the impugned legislation is a clarificatory\n\nlegislation and to exclude the non-grant period for\n\nextending pay and pension, new law has been framed.\n\nIt is also contended that State of Andhra Pradesh by Act\n\nNo.26 of 2006 declared to limit the liability of the State\n\n : 256 :\n\non schemes of advancement to the extent of grant-in-aid\n\nsanctioned to the posts by nullifying the judgment\n\nrendered by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in\n\nW.P.No.8697/2005 dated 07.11.2005 and similar\n\nexercise having been undertaken by the State of\n\nKarnataka through Act No.7 of 2014, the constitutional\n\nvalidity be upheld since there is no challenge to the\n\ncompetence of the legislature to enact the impugned\n\nlegislation. Hence, he prays for dismissal of the writ\n\npetitions.\n\n 12. In support of his submissions, he has relied\n\nupon the following judgments:\n\n (i) AIR 2014 SC 2407\n State of Tamil Nadu vs. State of Kerala\n and another.\n\n (ii) (2013)8 SCC 633\n Jagdish Prasad Sharma and others vs.\n State of Bihar and others.\n\n (iii) Unreported judgment rendered in\n W.P.Nos.226-228/1998 disposed of on\n 13.08.1998.\n\n Smt.Renukha vs. State of Karnataka\n\n : 257 :\n\n(iv) 1973(3) SCC 585\n M/s.Tirath \nRam Rajindra Nath,\n Lucknow vs. State of U.P. and another\n.\n\n(\nv) 1975(2) SCC 274\n The Government of Andhra Pradesh\n and another vs. Hindustan Machine\n Tools Ltd\n.\n\n(vi) AIR 1976 SC 2250\n I.N.Saksena, R.D.Doongaji vs. State of\n Madhya Pradesh\n\n(vii) 1987 (SUPP) SCC 751\n M/s.Utkal Contractors and Joinery (P)\n Limited and others\n\n(viii) 1993 SUPP(1) SCC 96(II)\n In the matter of Cauvery Water\n Disputes Tribunal\n\n(ix) 1996(4) SCC 281\n Comorin Match Industries (P) Ltd. vs.\n State of T.N.\n\n(x) (1994)6 SCC 77\n Bhubaneshwar Singh and another vs.\n Union of India and others\n\n(xi) (1996)7 SCC 637\n Indian Aluminium Co. and others vs.\n State of Kerala and others.\n\n : 258 :\n\n \n(\nxii) (1996)11 SCC 462\n Meerut Development Authority and others\n vs. Satbir Singh and others\n.\n\n (xiii) (2009)8 SCC 431\n A.Manjula Bhashini and others vs. Managing\n Director, Andhra Pradesh Women's\n Cooperative Finance Corporation Limited\n and another\n\n 13. Having heard the learned Advocates\n\nappearing for the parties, on perusal of the pleadings\n\nand case laws relied upon by the learned Advocates\n\nappearing for the parties, this Court is of the considered\n\nview that only question which arises for consideration\n\nis:\n\n \"Whether constitutional validity of Karnataka\n Private Aided Educational Institutions\n Employees (Regulation of Pay, Pension and other\n Benefits) Act, 2014 (Act No.7 of 2014) is to be\n upheld or be declared as unconstitutional on the\n ground that it is ultra vires of the Constitution\n of India?\"\n\n In order to undertake this exercise, it would be\n\nnecessary to narrate few facts which are common to all\n\nthe writ petitions and also extract the impugned\n\nlegislation.\n\n : 259 :\n\nFACTUAL MATRIX:\n\n 14. All the petitioners are working as teaching\n\nand non-teaching staff of private aided educational\n\ninstitutions. They came to be appointed by the\n\nrespective institutions after permission came to be\n\ngranted by the Department of Education. On the\n\nground that they are legally entitled for fixation of pay\n\nscale, annual increments, seniority and also entitled to\n\npensionary benefits from the date of their initial\n\nappointment upto the date of their appointment with\n\naid and denial of said benefit to them is bad in law, they\n\nhad approached this Court by filing writ petitions with a\n\nprayer to reckon and count the past services rendered\n\nby them namely, from the date of their initial\n\nappointment up to the date of approval of their\n\nappointment with aid for the purposes of fixation of pay\n\nscale, annual increments, seniority and pensionary\n\nbenefits. Writ petitions filed by them came to be\n\nallowed and was affirmed by the Division Bench of this\n\n : 260 :\n\nCourt and Special Leave Petitions filed by the State\n\nchallenging the orders passed by Division Bench came\n\nto be dismissed. Thus, the matter attained finality.\n\n 15. For the purposes of immediate reference, one\n\nset of writ Appeals filed by the State which came to be\n\ndismissed by the Division Bench of this Court in\n\nW.A.No.503/2011 and connected matters by order\n\ndated 30.11.2011 requires to be noticed to meet the\n\narguments advanced by respective learned Advocates. It\n\ncame to be held by the Division Bench as under:\n\n \"4. Since on a similar question\n this Court has taken a consistent view, in\n several petitions, holding that such\n lecturers are entitled to the benefit of\n fixation of salary from the date of their\n initial appointment and not necessarily\n from the date the college was admitted to\n grant-in-aid, the present petitions stand\n allowed. Annexure-\"C\" by which such a\n benefit is denied to the petitioners is\n hereby quashed. The respondents are\n directed to take into account the past\n services of the petitioners from the\n date of their respective appointments\n till the passing of the impugned order\n for the purpose of fixation of pay with\n\n : 261 :\n\n revision from time to time in the cadre\n of Lecturers along with arrears and to\n pass suitable orders within a period of\n eight weeks, if not earlier, from the date\n of receipt of a certified copy of this order.\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 16. Similar matters which came to be disposed\n\nof by the Division Bench was challenged by the State\n\nGovernment in Special Leave Petitions filed before the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in SLP (C) Nos.14870-15136/2012\n\nc/w SLP (C) Nos.22176-22186/2010 which came to be\n\ndismissed by order dated 21.08.2013. Thus, the matter\n\nattained finality. In other words, petitioners therein\n\nacquired certain rights by virtue of orders passed by\n\nthis Court.\n\n 17. On account of non-implementation of the\n\norders/directions issued in the above referred\n\njudgments and also similar orders, aggrieved petitioners\n\nhad approached this Court by initiating contempt\n\n : 262 :\n\nproceedings, wherein the State undertook to implement\n\nthe orders within two months and as such, reserving\n\nliberty to the complainants/petitioners to seek revival of\n\nthe contempt proceedings in the event of order passed\n\nby the learned Single Judge is not complied, contempt\n\nproceedings came to be disposed of. Thereafter, the\n\nState did not comply with the order passed by the\n\nlearned Single Judge and as such, complainants revived\n\nthe contempt proceedings by filing necessary\n\napplications and the State Government being put on\n\nnotice, produced the Government order, under which\n\nthe State Government extended the service benefits for\n\nthe unaided period of service, such as fixation of pay\n\nscale, adding annual increments, senuiority, T.B.A. and\n\npensionary benefits. Thereafter, several orders came to\n\nbe issued by the State Government under which the\n\nservice benefits such as fixation of pay scale, annual\n\nincrements, pensionary benefits and other\n\n : 263 :\n\nconsequential benefits were extended to some of the\n\npetitioners only and several others have not been\n\nextended the service benefits for unaided period. It\n\nwould be apt to note at this juncture itself that review\n\napplication filed by the State Government before the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court seeking review of dismissal of\n\nSpecial Leave Petitions also came to be dismissed on\n\n06.12.2012.\n\n 18. It is in this factual background, the State\n\nGovernment through the impugned enactment namely,\n\nby Act No.7 of 2014 introduced Karnataka Private Aided\n\nEducational Institutions (Regulation of Pay, Pension and\n\nother Benefits) Act, 2014 to extend Grant-in-aid\n\ncomputed at the minimum of pay scale in the time scale\n\non the date of admission to Grant-in-aid to the\n\nemployees working in Private Educational Institutions\n\nin the State and to limit the liability of the State on\n\nschemes of advancement to the extent of Grant-in-aid\n\n : 264 :\n\nsanctioned to the posts and for the matters connected\n\ntherewith or incidental thereto for the purposes\n\nindicated thereunder with retrospective effect from\n\n01.06.1995.\n\n 19. Concededly the State Government amended\n\nthe \nKarnataka Education Act, 1983\n namely, \nSection 87\n\nof the Education Act through Ordinance namely,\n\nthrough Karnataka Education (Amendment) Ordinance,\n\n2014 (Karnataka Ordinance No.1/2014) retrospectively\n\ni.e., with effect from 01.06.1995. The amendement\n\nbrought about to Section 87 via Ordinance reads as\n\nunder:\n\n \"2. Amendment of Section 87.- \nIn the\n Karnataka Education Act, 1983\n\n(Karnataka Act\n 1 of 1995), in \nsection 87\n,-\n\n (a) in the proviso the words \"and\n benefits of retirement\" shall be omitted;\n\n and\n\n (b) after the proviso, the following\n provisos shall be inserted, namely:-\n\n : 265 :\n\n \"Provided further that conditions of\n service of the employees working in aided\n educational institutions shall be as such\n as may be determined by the State\n Government from time to time.\n\n Provided also that since 1974 no\n employee of the aided institution is\n required to appear and pass any Servie\n Examination or the Kannada Language\n Examination as prescribed in the\n Karnataka Civil Service (Service and\n Kannada Language Examination) Rules,\n 1974 no such employee shall be eligible\n for or be granted any additional\n increment for having passed or deemed to\n have been passed said examination from\n the date of commencement of said rules.\"\n\nThe said Ordinance having not been placed before both\n\nthe Houses of the State namely, Legislative Assembly\n\nand Legislative Council as required under \nArticle\n\n213(2)(a)\n of the Constitution of India, same has lapsed\n\nwhich is not disputed by the learned Additional\n\nAdvocate General. Hence, this Court would not\n\nexamine the issue of constitutional validity of the\n\namendment to \nSection 87\n brought about by Ordinance\n\nduring the pendency of writ petitions, though some of\n\n : 266 :\n\nthe petitioners have also amended the writ petitions and\n\nhave sought for declaring Karnataka Education\n\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 2014 being unconstitutional\n\nand violative of \nArticle 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of\n\nIndia, since such an exercise if undertaken would be an\n\nexercise in futility and academic issue.\n\n 20. Now turning my attention back to the core\n\nissue namely, the constitutional validity of Act No.7 of\n\n2014, it would be of benefit to extract the Statement¸\n\nObjects and reasons of enacting the impugned\n\nlegislation by the State of Karnataka. It reads as under:\n\n Statement, Objects and Reasons:\n\n \"\nAn Act\n to regulate salary and\n allowance and other conditions of service\n of teaching and non-teaching employees\n of private educational institutions on\n admission to grant-in-aid and limiting\n financial liability of the State and other\n matters connected therewith are\n incidental thereto;\n\n Whereas, the State Government\n has admitted several private educational\n institutions for grant-in-aid to improve\n\n : 267 :\n\nthe standard of education and reduce the\nburden of the management by giving the\nsalary grant to teaching and non-\nteaching staff.\n\n And whereas, the Government in\norder No.ED 65 SES 62 dated 24.08.1963\nintroduced the Karnataka State Aided\nSchools Employees Contributory\nProvident Fund-Insurance-Pension\nscheme (Triple Benefit Scheme) Rules to\nregulate pensionary benefits of aided\ninstitutions coming under the ambit of\nPrimary and Secondary Education with\neffect from 01.04.1963 and directed to\ntake in to account the length of qualifying\nservice of all previous service whether\ntemporary, officiating or permanent either\nin one or more than one State - aided\ninstitution.\n\n And whereas, the Government\nframed the \nKarnataka Education Act,\n1983\n to provide for the planned\ndevelopment of educational institutions,\ninculcations of healthy educational\npractice, maintenance and improvement\nin the standards of education and better\norganization discipline and control over\nEducational institutions in the state with\na view to fostering the harmonious\ndevelopment of the mental and physical\nfacilities of students and cultivating a\nscientific and secular outlook through\neducation and the said Act came into\nforce from 1-6-1995 as per Government\nnotification No ED 2 MES 95 dated 30-\n05-1995 with a saving clause enshrined\nin \nSection 146 (3)\n by virtue of which the\n\n : 268 :\n\nTBS Rules became part and parcel of the\nsaid Act.\n\n And whereas, non-consideration of\nnon-grant service for pay was questioned\nin W.P.Nos. 226-228/1998 and the said\nwrit petitions were dismissed on 13-08-\n1998 by rejecting the reliefs sought by\nthe writ petitioners.\n\n And Whereas, the Government in\nletter No. ED 130 PMC 99 dated: 12-07-\n2001 has given direction not to reckon\nthe unaided service for pensionary\nbenefits.\n\n And Whereas, the Government has\nissued a circular on 20-09-2003 bearing\nNo. ED 90 PMC 99 clarifying that the\nnon-grant service shall not be considered\nfor the purpose of pension and leave.\n\n And whereas the Government has\nissued order No. ED 674 SEW 2005\ndated: 10-04-2006 reiterating the\ndirections given in rule 3 (1) (b) and (c) of\nthe Karnataka Educational Institutions\n(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions\nof Service of Employees in Private Aided\nand Primary and Secondary Educational\nInstitutions) Rules, 1999, wherein the\nservice rendered during non-grant period\nshall not be considered for pay, leave,\npension and any other service benefits.\n\n And whereas the non-reckoning of\nnon-grant period of service for pensionary\nbenefits was challenged by Sri H. Peter in\nW.P. No. 10399/2004 and the Hon'ble\nHigh Court of Karnataka allowed the said\n\n : 269 :\n\nwrit petition on 01-09-2006 with a\ndirection to compute pensionary benefits\nby considering non-grant period.\n\n And whereas, in exercise of powers\nconferred by Sub-Section (1) of \nSection\n145\n of the Karnataka Education Act,\n1983 the Government framed the\nKarnataka Pre-University Education\n(Academic, Registration, Administration\nand Grant-in-aid etc.) Rules, 2006. The\nSub-rule (2) and (3) of Rule 21 of the said\nRules reads as below-\n\n \"(2) The posts and the\n persons working in such posts\n in private aided Pre-University\n Colleges shall be eligible for\n grant-in-aid only from the date\n of sanction of the grant-in-aid\n by the Government and the\n earlier period of un-aided service\n shall not count for any pay\n fixation, increment, leave,\n seniority and other service\n benefits including pension.\n\n (3) Consequent to the\n sanction of salary grant-in-aid\n to an employee of aided Pre-\n\n University College, the initial\n pay of such an employee shall\n be fixed at the minimum of the\n pay scale applicable to the post\n and he will not be eligible for\n any monetary benefits either\n notionally or otherwise in\n respect of the earlier period of\n unaided service.\"\n\n : 270 :\n\n And whereas, the Writ Appeal\nNo.291/2007 filed by the State before the\nDivision Bench of the Hon'ble High Court\nof Karnataka against the order dated: 01-\n09-2006 made in W.P. No.10399/2004\nwas rejected and the Special Leave\nPetition filed by the State before the\nHon'ble Supreme Court was also\ndismissed on 09/05/2011.\n\n And whereas, non reckoning of non\ngrant period of service for pensionary\nbenefits was challenged in W.P.\nNo.126/2008 and W.P. No.15025/2006\nand the said writ petitions were\nconnected with the writ appeals filed by\nthe state and the said writ petitions were\nallowed on 03-11-2009.\n\n And whereas, Government issued\ncircular No. ED 156 PMC 2005 dated: 13-\n03-2009 once again reiterating the\ndirections given in Rule 3 (1) (b) & (c) of\nthe Karnataka Educational Institutions\n(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions\nof Service of Employees in private aided\nand primary and secondary educational\ninstitutions) Rules 1999, wherein the\nservice rendered during unaided period\nshall not be considered for pay, leave,\npension and any other service benefits.\n\n And whereas, the non-\n\nconsideration of non-grant period for\nfixation of pay was challenged in W.P.No.\n25447/2010 and the said writ petition\nwas allowed on 16-08-2010. The State\nfiled Writ Appeal 4788/2010 against the\norder dated:16-08-2010 and the Division\nBench of the Hon'ble High Court\n\n : 271 :\n\ndismissed the said writ appeal and the\nSpecial Leave Petition (CC) No.\n7365/2012 was dismissed on 02-07-\n2012. The review petition No. 2364/2012\nfiled by the State against the order\npassed in S.L.P. (CC) No. 7365/2012 was\nalso dismissed on 06-12-2012,\nthereby creating inevitable situation of\ncomplying orders of the Hon'ble High\nCourt of Karnataka in W.P. No.\n25447/2010 against the directions given\nin rule 21(2) and (3) of the Karnataka\nPre-University Education (Academic,\nRegistration, Administration & Grant-in-\naid etc.) Rules, 2006.\n\n And whereas, the Special Leave\nPetition No. 22176-22186/10 filed by the\nState in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia challenging order dated:\n\n03/11/2009 was connected with other\nS.L.P's filed by the State and the said\nS.L.P's were dismissed on 21-08-2013.\n\n And whereas, the Government in\nOrder No. ED 176 UPC 75, dated:\n\n18.08.1976, introduced the Karnataka\nState Aided College and Technical\nInstitutions Employees Triple Benefit\nScheme (Pension, Insurance and\nManagement Contribution) Rules, 1976\n(TBS Rules for short) to regulate\npensionary benefits in aided institutions\ncoming under the ambit of Higher\nEducation with effect from 01.04.1970\nand directed to take into account all the\nprevious service rendered in regular and\nwhole time posts in Grant-in-aid\ninstitutions governed by TBS Rules shall\n\n : 272 :\n\nbe taken into account for computing the\nlength of qualifying service.\n\n And whereas, Government in\nG.O.No. ED 15 UEC 89, dated:\n\n05.04.1991 sanctioned the revised 1986\nUniversity Grants Commission pay scales\nto the Librarians and the Physical\nEducation Personnel in the First Grade\n(Degree) i.e., Government Colleges and\nthose aided by the Government as per the\nGrant-in-aid Code under the Department\nof Collegiate Education with effect from\n01.01.1986 and extended the Career\nAdvancement Scheme inter alia to the\nLibrarian and Physical Education\npersonnel in the aided colleges;\n\n And whereas in exercise of the\npowers conferred by sub-section (1) of\n\nsection 145\n of the Karnataka Education\nAct, 1983, the Government has issued\nrules namely the Karnataka Educational\nInstitutions (Recruitment and Terms and\nConditions of Service of Employees in\nAided Colleges of Education and\nTeachers' Training Institutes) Rules,\n2001. In the proviso to rule 3(1) (b) and 3\n(1) (c) of the said rules, a direction is\ngiven that the service rendered during\nnon-grant period shall not be considered\nfor pay, leave, pension and any other\nservice benefits.\n\n And whereas, the service rendered\nby the employee of the private colleges\nand Technical Institutions prior to the\ndate of admission into grant-in-aid was\nalso taken into consideration for the\npurpose of Automatic Advancement\n\n : 273 :\n\nScheme and Career Advancement\nScheme by an unintended interpretation\nof the directions given in Government\nOrder NO. ED 25 UPC 2001, dated:\n\n03.06.2003, which was issued with the\nintention of counting non-grant period\nservice for Automatic Advancement\nScheme and Career Advancement\nScheme subject to fulfillment of\nconditions specified in the guidelines\nissued by the competent\nauthorities/bodies;\n\n And whereas, the non-reckoning of\nnon-grant period of service for Automatic\nAdvancement Scheme, Career\nAdvancement Scheme and Pension was\nchallenged by some Aided employees in\nHon'ble High Court of Karnataka in Writ\nPetition Nos. 14676/2001, 871/2004,\n19431/2005 and 5145/2007 and\nupholding the contention of the\nPetitioners that the Triple Benefit Scheme\nRules and the Government Orders are\nnot inconsonance with \nsection 87\n of the\nKarnataka Education Act, 1983 thereby\nrejecting the Government's contention\nthat as per TBS Rules only the service\nrendered in aided institutions be\nconsidered for qualifying service, the\nHon'ble High Court on 13.10.2006 and\n12.12.2007 allowed the Writ Petitions by\ndirecting reckoning of the service from\ninitial appointment on the basis of actual\nemoluments drawn, including increments\nand promotions for non-grant period;\n\n And whereas, the State filed\nAppeals against the Orders dated:\n\n13.10.2006 and 12.12.2007 made in Writ\n\n : 274 :\n\nPetitions Nos. 14676/2001, 871/2004,\n19431/2005 and 5145/2007 and on\n03.11.2009, the Hon'ble High Court of\nKarnataka connected the Writ Appeals\nNos. 450/2007 and 848/2008 filed by\nthe State with other similar Writ Petitions\ndelivered the following Order:\n\n \"Under the circumstances,\n Writ Appeals filed by the State\n have to be dismissed and the\n Writ Petitions have to be\n allowed. Rule is made absolute.\n\n The respective authorities are\n directed to consider the case of\n each of the Petitioner and pass\n orders accordingly in the\n context of relevant rules\n applicable to them with regard\n to their retirement benefits\n including pension and gratuity\n along with interest at the rate of\n 6% p.a. which shall be paid with\n effect from the date of filing of\n the Writ Petition by each of\n these lecturers/teachers within\n a period of two months from the\n date of receipt of the certified\n copy of this Order\".\n\n And whereas, the State of\nKarnataka preferred the Appeal in the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the Special\nLeave Petition No. 22176-22186/2010\nwas connected with other similar Special\nLeave Petitions were dismissed on\n21.08.2013;\n\n And whereas, there is no\njustification to include the service\n\n : 275 :\n\nrendered in un-aided institutions which\nare subsequently brought under grant-in-\naid, for the purpose of pensionary\nbenefits as such inclusion would amount\nto taking into consideration the service\nnot covered by the Pension Rules and it\nwould also amount to giving retrospective\neffect to the admission to grant-in-aid\nwhich is never contemplated by the\nGovernment;\n\n And whereas, if the increments\nearned by the teaching and non-teaching\nemployees of the Private Aided\nEducational Institutions in non-grant\nperiod is taken into consideration for\nreleasing the Grant-in-aid, and for the\npurposes of Automatic Advancement\nScheme, Career Advancement Scheme\nand Pension it would involve very huge\nfinancial implication to the state\nexchequer;\n\n And therefore, Government\nreviewed the matter and decided to\nextend Grant-in-aid computed at the\nminimum of pay in the time scale on the\ndate of admission to grant in aid to the\nemployees working in Private Educational\ninstitutions in the State and to limit the\nliability of the State on schemes of\nAdvancement to the extent of Grant-in-\naid sanctioned to the posts and for the\nmatters connected therewith or incidental\nthereto for the purposes hereinafter\nappearing;\"\n\n : 276 :\n\n \n21. The preamble of a Statute like the long title\n\nis a part of the Act and is an admissible aid to\n\nconstruction. Although not an enacting part, the\n\npreamble is expected to express the scope, object and\n\npurpose of the Act more comprehensively than the long\n\ntitle. It may recite the grounds and cause of making the\n\nstatute, the evils sought to be remedied or the doubts\n\nwhich may be intended to be settled. Sir John Nickel in\n\nBrett vs. Brett\n reported in (1826) 162 ER 456 at page\n\n458-459 has held:\n\n \"It is to the preamble more\n specially that we are to look for the\n reason or spirit of every statute,\n rehearsing this, as it ordinarily does,\n the evils sought to be remedied, or the\n doubts purported to be removed by\n the statute, and so evidencing in the\n best and most satisfactory manner,\n the object or intention of the\n legislature in making or passing the\n statute itself.\"\n\n : 277 :\n\n \n22. As to circumstances under which a preamble\n\ncan be used as a tool in aid of interpretation, came to be\n\nconsidered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nBURAKAR COAL LIMITED vs UNION OF INDIA\n\nreported in AIR 1961 SC 954 and held:\n\n \"It is one of the cardinal\n principles of construction that where\n the language of an Act is clear, the\n preamble must be disregarded\n though, where the object or meaning\n of an enactment is not clear, the\n preamble may be resorted to explain\n it. Again, where very general language\n is used in an enactment which, it is\n clear must be intended to have a\n limited application, the preamble may\n be used to indicate to what particular\n instances, the enactment is intended\n to apply. We cannot therefore, start\n with the preamble for construing the\n provisions of an Act, though we could\n be justified in resorting to it, nay, we\n will be required to do so if we find that\n the language used by Parliament is\n ambiguous or is too general though in\n point of fact Parliament intended that\n it should have a limited application.\"\n\n : 278 :\n\nIt has been further held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nSTATE OF RAJASTHAN vs LEELA JAIN\n reported in\n\nAIR 1965 SC 1296 that preamble cannot be used to\n\neliminate the operative provisions of the statute as\n\nunintended. It has been held:\n\n \"The preamble may, no doubt, be used\n to solve any ambiguity or to fix the\n meaning of the words which may have\n more than one meaning but it can,\n however, not be used to eliminate as\n redundant or unintended, the\n operative provisions of the statute.\"\n\n \n23. Thus, an enactment including its preamble\n\nmust be read as a whole to decide whether any part of\n\nthe enacting provision is clear or ambiguous. If,\n\nhowever, having read the Act as a whole, including the\n\npreamble, the enacting words clearly negative the\n\nconstruction which it is sought to support by the\n\npreamble, that is an end of it. It has been held by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nSTATE OF WEST\n\n : 279 :\n\nBENGAL vs UNION OF INDIA\n reported in AIR 1963 SC\n\n1241 that objects of the Act cannot be used to cut down\n\nthe generality of the words used in the statute. It has\n\nbeen observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court as under:\n\n \"It is however well settled that\n the Statement of Objects and Reasons\n accompanying a Bill, when introduced\n in Parliament, cannot be used to\n determine the true meaning and effect\n of substantive provisions of the\n statute. They cannot be used except\n for the limited purpose of\n understanding the background and\n the antecedent state of affairs leading\n up to the legislation. But we cannot\n use this statement as an aid to the\n construction of the enactment or to\n show that the legislature did not\n intend to acquire the proprietary\n rights vested in the State or in any\n way to affect the State Government's\n rights as owner of minerals. A\n statute, as passed by Parliament, is\n the expression of the collective\n intention of the legislature as a whole,\n and any statement made by an\n individual, albeit a Minister, or the\n intention and objects of the Act\n cannot be used to cut down the\n generality of the words used in the\n statute. \"\n\n : 280 :\n\n 24. Keeping these principles in mind, when the\n\nStatements, Objects and Reason of the impugned\n\nenactment i.e., Act No.7/2014 is perused, it would\n\nclearly emerge that the State Government having\n\nadmitted several Private Educational Institutions for\n\nGrant-in-aid to improve the standard of education and\n\nreduce the burden of management had extended salary\n\ngrant to teaching and non-teaching staff from the date\n\nof grant and not from the date of their initial\n\nappointment. Records would also indicate that several\n\nemployees both teaching and non-teaching being\n\naggrieved by non-consideration of initial date of\n\nappointment for extending grant-in-aid, pay and other\n\nbenefits had questioned such denial and had sought for\n\nreckoning the non-grant period for extending pay, leave,\n\npromotion, pension and other service benefits. Records\n\nwould also indicate that several writ petitions filed by\n\nsuch of those employees including petitioners herein\n\n : 281 :\n\nhad been allowed by this Court and affirmed in Writ\n\nAppeals and confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\nHowever, in order to exclude the non-grant period\n\nrendered by the employees in unaided institutions\n\nwhich were subsequently brought under the Grant-in-\n\naid for the purpose of pay and pensionary benefits,\n\nautomatic advancement scheme, career advancement\n\nscheme, impugned enactment has been brought about\n\non the ground that it would result in huge financial\n\nimplication to the State Exchequer. When preamble\n\nof the Act is read in conjunction with the provisions of\n\nimpugned enactment, it would clearly indicate that it\n\ndisentitles the petitioners the benefit of fixation of pay\n\nscale, annual increments, Time Bound Allowances,\n\npensionary benefits and other consequential benefits\n\nfrom the date of their entry into service but they would\n\nbe entitled to such benefits from the date of approval of\n\ntheir appointment with aid. In other words, the benefit\n\n : 282 :\n\naccrued and derived by the petitioners by virtue of the\n\norder passed by this Court and which have also been\n\nimplemented by the State is sought to be nullified by\n\nthe impugned Act No.7/2014.\n\n 25. Keeping the aforestated aspects in mind,\n\nfurther and deeper examination namely, the\n\nconstitutional validity of the Act is being examined in\n\nthe background of its challenge on the grounds already\n\nnoted hereinabove.\n\n 26. It is not in dispute that petitioners and\n\nsimilarly placed persons had approached this Court for\n\nreckoning the non-grant period to be treated as\n\nqualifying years for the purposes of extending pay and\n\nother service benefits and this Court having considered\n\nthe plea of the State which was to the effect that\n\nKarnataka Education Act, 1993\n and the Rules made\n\nthereunder would enable the State to restrict the\n\nemployees working in aided institutions to grant salary\n\n : 283 :\n\nand other service benefits from the date of admitting\n\nthem to grant and not any period anterior to it and\n\nrejected the same by delving upon \nSection 87\n of the\n\nEducation Act and Rule 3 of the Karnataka Educational\n\nInstitutions (Recruitment and Terms and conditions of\n\nservice of employees in Private Aided Primary and\n\nSecondary Educational Institutions) Rules, 1999 by\n\nholding that a conjoint reading of \nSection 87\n of the\n\nKarnataka Education Act, 1993 and the Rules made\n\nthereunder, it is clear that the intention of the State\n\nGovernment is to grant parity to the teachers working in\n\nall Government Schools as well as those working in\n\nPrivate Schools vide judgment rendered by Division\n\nBench on 03.11.2009 in W.A.No.848/2008 and\n\nconnected matters. It came to be been held by the\n\nDivision Bench to the following effect:\n\n \"21. On a combined reading of\n these provisions what emerges is that\n under \nSection 87\n of the Act, conditions of\n service of employees in recognized private\n\n : 284 :\n\n educational institutions must be on par\n with the conditions of service of the State\n Government Institutions. However, the\n proviso states that with regard to\n conditions of service including the\n retirement for employees in educational\n institutions such as the state aided\n institutions can be prescribed otherwise\n meaning thereby that the conditions of\n service of aided institutions could be\n varied as compared to the conditions of\n service of teachers of Government\n Institutions by means of Rules being\n enacted. It is in view of this proviso the\n 2001 Rules and the 1999 Rules as well as\n 2003 \nreferred to above\n have been\n enacted.\"\n\n 27. The question whether the legislature has\n\nkept itself within the jurisdiction assigned to it or has\n\nencroached upon a forbidden field, is determined by\n\nfinding out the true nature and character of the\n\nlegislation. The Courts' strongly lien against a\n\nconstruction which reduces the statute to a futility. A\n\nstatute or any enacting provision therein must be so\n\nconstrued so as to make it effective and operative on the\n\nprinciple expressed in the maxim \"ut res magis valeat\n\nquam pereat\" - that the thing may rather have\n\n : 285 :\n\neffect than be destroyed; that the transaction may\n\nbe valid rather than invalid. It is on application of\n\nthis principle that Courts while pronouncing upon the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute start with a presumption in\n\nfavour of constitutionality and prefer a construction\n\nwhich keeps the statute within the competence of the\n\nlegislature. There is, therefore a presumption that the\n\nlegislature does not exceed its jurisdiction and the\n\nburden of establishing that the act is not within the\n\ncompetence of the legislature, or that it has\n\ntransgressed other constitutional mandates such as\n\nthose relating to fundamental rights, is always on the\n\nperson who challenges its vires.\n\n 28. Lord Denning in the case of FAWCETT\n\nPROPERTIES VS. BUCKINGHAM COUNTY COUNCIL\n\nreported in 1960 (3) AIR 503 has observed thus:\n\n \"But when a statute has some meaning\n even though it is obscured, or several\n meanings, even though it has little to\n choose between them, the Courts have to\n\n : 286 :\n\n say what meaning the statute is to bear\n rather than reject it as a nullity.\"\n\n 29. A statute is designed to be workable and the\n\nexercise undertaken by a Court should be to secure that\n\nobject unless crucial omission or clear direction makes\n\nthat ultimate end unattainable. If on one construction\n\na given statute would become ultra vires the powers of\n\nthe legislature, whereas on another construction, which\n\nmay be open and the statute remains effective and\n\noperative, the Court will prefer the latter, on the ground\n\nthat the legislature is presumed not to have intended to\n\nact in excess of its jurisdiction.\n\n \n30. A perusal of statement of objects and\n\nreasons assigned by the State while enacting Act\n\nNo.7/2014, it would indicate that the legislature with\n\nan intent to remove the basis of the judgment rendered\n\nby this Court has sought to ensure such decision is\n\nrendered ineffective. The legislature, while removing the\n\n : 287 :\n\nbasis of a judgment or its substratum can exercise its\n\npower by bringing in a legislation to render such\n\njudicial decision ineffective. If the legislature wants to\n\nrender a judicial decision ineffective, it can only do so\n\nby removing or altering or neutralizing the legal basis of\n\nthe judgment which is sought to be made ineffective\n\nand that neither the legislature nor the executive has\n\nthe power of simply declaring the earlier decision of the\n\nCourts as invalid or not binding. In otherwords,\n\nlegislature has the power to remove the defect in the\n\nstatute pointed out by the Courts by amending Act and\n\nremoving such defect in the statute by validating such\n\nAct retrospectively with the aid of legal fiction. It has\n\nbeen held by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nM/S.TIRATH RAM RAJINDRA NATH, LUCKNOW VS.\n\nSTATE OF U.P. AND ANOTHER\n reported in (1973)3\n\nSCC 585 as under:\n\n \"7. Now coming to the second\n contention of Dr.Singhvi, we fail to see\n how the question of lack of power now\n\n : 288 :\n\n arises in view of Section 3-AB. While\n developing his contention No.2,\n Dr.Singhvi urged that the Legislature has\n unauthorisedly encroached on the\n judicial power. The amended \nSection 3-\n\n AB merely intradicts the decision\n rendered by the High Court and has not\n removed the want of power noticed by the\n High Court. We are unable to accede to\n this contention. The Legislature has not\n purported either directly or by necessary\n implication to overrule the decision of the\n Allahabad High Court in Krishna Brick\n Field's case (supra). On the other hand it\n has accepted the decision as correct but\n has sought to remove the basis of the\n decision by retrospectively changing the\n law. This court has pointed out in\n several cases the distinction between\n encroachment on the judicial power and\n the nullification of the effect f a judicial\n decision by changing the law\n retrospectively. The former is outside the\n competence of the Legislature but the\n latter is within its permissible limits. In\n the instance case what the Legislature\n has done is to amend the law\n retrospectively and thereby remove the\n basis of the decision rendered by the\n High Court. Such a course cannot be\n considered as an encroachment on the\n judicial power.\"\n\n \n31. It has been further held by Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of \nI.N.SAKSENA VS. STATE OF M.P\n\nreported in AIR 1976 SC 2250 that distinction between\n\n : 289 :\n\na \"legislative act\" and a \"judicial act\" is well known\n\nthough in some specific instances the line which\n\nseparates one category from the other may not be easily\n\ndiscernible. It has been held that such validating\n\nlegislation which removes the causes for ineffectiveness\n\nor invalidity of actions is not an encroachment on\n\njudicial power.\n\n \n\"22. While, in view of this\n distinction between legislative and judicial\n functions, the legislature cannot by a bare\n declaration, without more, directly over-\n rule, reverse or over-ride a judicial\n decision, it may, at any time in exercise of\n the plenary powers conferred on it by\n \nArticle 245\n and \n246\n of the Constitution\n render a judicial decision ineffective by\n enacting a valid law on a topic within its\n legislative field fundamentally altering or\n changing with retrospective, curative or\n neutralising effect the conditions on which\n such decision is based. As pointed out by\n Ray C.J. in \nIndira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj\n Narain\n,(1) the rendering ineffective of\n judgments or orders of competent courts\n and tribunals by changing their basis by\n legislative enactment is a well-known\n pattern of all validating Acts. Such\n validating legislation which removes the\n causes for ineffectiveness or invalidity of\n actions or proceedings is not an\n encroachment on judicial power.\"\n\n : 290 :\n\n 32. The legislature may, at any time, in exercise\n\nof the plenary power conferred on it by \nArticle 245\n and\n\n246\n of the Constitution render a judicial decision\n\nineffective by enacting a valid law. There is no\n\nprohibition against retrospective legislation. The power\n\nof the legislature to pass a law postulates the power to\n\npass it prospectively as well as retrospectively, which\n\nwould be subject to legislative competence. Thus,\n\nrendering the judgments and orders of competent\n\nCourts ineffective by changing their basis by legislative\n\nenactment is a well known pattern of all validating Acts.\n\nSuch validating legislation which removes the causes of\n\nineffectiveness or invalidity of action or proceedings\n\ncannot be construed as encroachment of judicial power.\n\nIf the legislature by passing an Act without altering the\n\nstatute on the basis of which the judgment was\n\npronounced, then such legislation will not nullify the\n\n : 291 :\n\neffect or force of the judgment pronounced by a Court in\n\nany manner.\n\n \n33. The learned Additional Advocate General has\n\nvery heavily relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the matter of \nCOMORIN MATCH INDUSTRIES\n\n(PVT) LTD vs STATE OF TAMIL NADU\n reported in\n\n1996(4) SCC 281 to contend enacting validation law\n\nwith retrospective effect is within the competence of the\n\nlegislature and by amendment Act, judgment of the\n\nHigh Court is being nullified to sustain the\n\nconstitutional validity of the impugned Act.\n\n 34. Assessment Orders for the assessment year\n\n1957-58 to 1965-66 came to be challenged before the\n\nHigh Court of Madras by COMORIN MATCH\n\nINDUSTRIES PRIVATE LIMITED contending that it had\n\nsold the Safety Matches manufactured by it, in the\n\ncourse of inter-state trade and commerce for which\n\nsales tax was charged under the \nCentral Sales Tax Act\n,\n\n : 292 :\n\n1956 (for short 'CST'), on the ground that CST was\n\nlevied on turnover which included excise duty and no\n\nCST can be levied on excise duty. Claim for refund of\n\nthe tax collected by the authorities were also made.\n\nSimilar writ petitions were also filed before the High\n\nCourt. The High Court of Madras allowed the writ\n\npetition in the case of LARSEN AND TOUBRO LIMITED\n\nvs JT.CTO reported in (1967) 20 STC (Mad.).\n\nFollowing that decision, High Court allowed the writ\n\npetition filed by the assessee - COMORIN MATCH\n\nINDUSTRIES and other writ petitioners. \nThough the\n\nsales tax authorities did not file any appeal against the\n\njudgment of COMORIN MATCH INDUSTRIES, but\n\npreferred an appeal in respect of another assessee\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Apex Court i.e., in the case of \nSTATE\n\nOF MADRAS vs N.K.NATARAJA MUDALIAR\n reported\n\nin AIR 1969 SC 147. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that\n\nprovisions of sub-sections (2), (2-A) and (5) of \nSection 8\n\n : 293 :\n\nof the Central Sales Tax were valid. However, it was\n\nheld that the tax on excise duty was illegal and affirmed\n\nthe decision of the High Court on the said issue.\n\n \n35. The grievance of the assessee - COMORIN\n\nMATCH INDUSTRIES was that despite the judgment of\n\nthe High Court, refund of the tax was not granted\n\nthough specific direction had been given by the High\n\nCourt to the said effect. The Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nNATARAJ MUDALIAR\n's case, while disposing of the\n\nappeal had directed as under:\n\n \"The appeal will be allowed and the\n order passed by the High Court declaring\n the provisions of \nSections 8(2)\n, \n8\n(2-A) and\n 8(5) ultra vies must be set aside.\n\n The petition out of which this appeal\n arises was one of a group of petitions filed\n before the High Court. Against orders\n passed in favour of the other assessees the\n State has not preferred appeals. The\n amount involved in the claim is small. The\n State apparently has approached this\n Court with a view to obtain a final\n determination of the important question\n which was raised in the petitions filed\n before the High Court. We therefore direct\n\n : 294 :\n\n that there will be no order as to costs in\n this Court and in the High Court.\"\n\n 36. Yet another reason for which assessments\n\nwere set aside was on account of inclusion of excise\n\nduty in the computation of 'turnover'. There was a\n\ncontroversy as to how the turnover under the Central\n\nSales Tax should be computed. Under the T.N.General\n\nSales Tax Act, 1959 and the Rule, as it stood at the\n\nmaterial time, provisions had been made for deduction\n\nof excise duty in the computation of chargeable\n\nturnover. The High Court of Madras held that the\n\nquantum of turnover for the purposes of levy of CST\n\nhad to be made in the same manner by excluding the\n\nexcise duty paid on the goods sold.\n\n \n37. \nThe Central Sales Tax Act, 1956\n was\n\namended by \nCentral Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969\n,\n\nwhereunder the definition of 'turnover' defined in\n\nSection 2(j)\n was amended and the working of \nSection 9\n\n : 295 :\n\nwas radically altered. The new provisions were deemed\n\nalways to have been substituted. The said amendment\n\nwas effected with a view to put an end to the\n\ncontroversy whether \"turnover\" should be computed in\n\naccordance with the provisions of the State Sales Tax\n\nlaw or not. This amendment was brought about to get\n\nover the view expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nSTATE OF MADRAS vs N.K.NATARAJA MUDALIYAR\n\nreported in AIR 1969 SC 147 whereunder it had been\n\nheld that the Central Sales Tax had to be levied in the\n\nsame manner as provided in the Madras General Sales\n\nTax Act.\n \nIt had been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nNATARAJA MUDALIYAR\n's case referred to supra as\n\nunder:\n\n \"If under the Madras General Sales\n Tax Act in computing the turnover the\n excise duty is not liable to be included\n and by virtue of \nSection 9(1)\n of the\n Central Sales Tax Act has to be levied in\n the same manner as the Madras General\n Sales Tax Act, the excise duty will not be\n liable to be included in the turnover....\n\n : 296 :\n\n We are of the view that in the matter of\n determining the taxable turnover the\n same rules will apply by virtue of \nSection\n 9(1)\n of the Central Sales Tax Act, whether\n the tax is to be levied under the \nCentral\n Sales Tax Act\n or the \nGeneral Sales Tax\n Act\n.\"\n\nWhen the Central Sales Tax Act\n was examined by the\n\nMadras High Court in LARSEN AND TOUBRO's case\n\nreferred to supra and the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nNATARAJ MUDALIAR\n's case, defined 'turnover' as\n\ndefined in \nSection 2(j)\n of the Central Sales Tax Act to\n\nmean \"the aggregate of the sales prices received and\n\nreceivable by him in respect of sales of any goods in the\n\ncourse of inter-State trade or commerce made during any\n\nprescribed period and determined in the prescribed\n\nmanner\". By amending Act, the words \"and determined\n\nin the prescribed manner\" were substituted by the\n\nwords \"and determined in accordance with the provisions\n\nof this Act and the Rules made thereunder\".\n \nThis\n\namendment was given effect with retrospective effect\n\n : 297 :\n\nfrom the date on which the \nCentral Sales Tax Act\n came\n\ninto force and thereby the basis of law on which\n\njudgement in \nN.K.NATARAJ MUDALIAR\n's case was\n\npronounced was removed from the statute.\n\n 38. It is in this background, the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in COMORIN MATCH INDUSTRIES (PVT) LTD\n\nVS STATE OF TAMIL NADU reported in (1996)4 SCC\n\n281 has held that the statute being what it was, the\n\njudicial interpretation of the statute could not be held to\n\nbe erroneous by legislative imprimatur, but if the\n\nstatute itself was amended retrospectively so that the\n\nvery basis of the judgment disappear, then it could not\n\nbe said that the judgment was still in force and will\n\nhave to be given effect even though the legislature had\n\nspecifically laid down that amended law would operate.\n\nIt has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in said case\n\nas under:\n\n \"16. Therefore, the majority view\n appears to be that if a judgment is\n\n : 298 :\n\n pronounced by a court and the effect of\n that judgment is sought to be taken away\n by legislature by passing an Act without\n altering the statute on the basis of which\n the judgment was pronounced, then such\n legislation will not nullify the effect or force\n of the judgment pronounced by a court in\n any manner. The statute being what it was,\n the judicial interpretation of the statute\n could not be held to be erroneous by\n legislative imprimatur, but if the statute\n itself was amended retrospectively so that\n the very basis of the judgment\n disappeared, then it could not be said the\n judgment was still in force and will have to\n be given effect to even though the\n legislature had specifically laid down that\n the amended law will operate\n notwithstanding any judgment or decision\n or decree by the court to the contrary. In\n fact, that is how the judgment of Shri\n Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. understood and\n explained.\n\n 39. The power of validation is undisputed if\n\nvested with the Legislature. For this proposition, the\n\njudgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of SRI\n\nPRITHVI COTTON MILLS vs BROACH BOROUGH\n\nMUNICIPALITY reported in (1969)2 SCC 283 can be\n\nlooked up.\n\n : 299 :\n\n 40. The distinction between legislative and\n\njudicial function is well known. Within the scope of its\n\nlegislative competence and subject to other\n\nconstitutional limitations, Legislature can exercise its\n\npower to enact laws and said power is plenary in\n\nnature. In exercise of such plenary power, Legislature\n\ncan enact law prospectively as well as retrospectively.\n\nWhere the statutory provision is interpreted by the\n\nCourt in a particular manner and directions are issued\n\nfor implementing the judgment in the light of the\n\ninterpretation placed on the statutory provisions, the\n\nlegislature need not pass a validating Act. In such\n\nsituation, the legislature in exercise of its plenary power\n\nunder \nArticle 245\n and \n246\n can make a new Act altering\n\nfundamentally the provisions which was the basis of the\n\njudgment passed by the Court. This exercise can be\n\ndone with retrospective effect also.\n\n : 300 :\n\n \n41. As held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\n\ncase of \nSTATE OF TAMIL NADU VS. STATE OF\n\nKERALA\n reported in AIR 2014 SC 2407 that State can\n\nvalidate the law by removing the defects pointed out by\n\nthe Court will have to be examined in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of each case. The question whether or\n\nnot the legislature has usurped the judicial power or\n\nenacted a law in breach of separation of powers would\n\ndepend upon facts of each case after considering the\n\nreal effect of law on a judgment or a judicial proceeding.\n\nThree primary tests which requires to be applied are:\n\n (1) Whether the vice pointed by Court and\n invalidity suffered by previous law is\n cured, complying with legal and\n constitutional requirements?\n\n (2) Whether Legislature has competence to\n validate the law?\n\n : 301 :\n\n (3) Whether such validation is consistent\n with the rights guaranteed in part III of\n the Constitution?\n\n 42. Thus, Court has a delicate function to\n\nexamine the law enacted by legislature to find out,\n\nwhether in fact legislature has exercised legislative\n\npower by merely declaring an earlier judicial decision to\n\nbe invalid and ineffective or the legislature has altered\n\nand changed the character of legislation which\n\nultimately render the judicial decision ineffective.\n\n 43. It has to be remembered that there is always\n\na presumption that legislature does not exceed its\n\njurisdiction. As such, burden of establishing that\n\nlegislature has transgressed constitutional mandate is\n\nalways on the person who alleges such violation and\n\nwho challenge the vires. It is to be remembered that\n\nuntil and unless it becomes clear beyond reasonable\n\n : 302 :\n\ndoubt that the legislation under challenge has\n\ntransgressed constitutional limits, Courts refrain from\n\ninterfering with such legislation and it will be allowed to\n\nstand. The adjudication of the rights of the parties\n\naccording to law is a judicial function. When a\n\nparticular rule or the Act is interpreted by a Court of\n\nlaw in a specified manner and the law making authority\n\nforms the opinion that such an interpretation would\n\nadversely affect rights of the parties and as such, a new\n\nset of rules or laws is enacted, it is quite offen\n\nchallenged on the ground of the legislature having\n\ntransgressed its power or usurped the judicial power.\n\nThus, the Courts would have delicate function to\n\nundertake and examine the new set of laws enacted by\n\nthe legislature and to find out whether in fact the\n\nlegislature has exercised the legislative power by merely\n\ndeclaring an earlier judicial decision to be invalid and\n\nineffective or the legislature has altered and changed\n\n : 303 :\n\nthe character of the legislation which ultimately may\n\nrender the judicial decision ineffective.\n\n \n44. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nSTATE OF TAMIL NADU vs STATE OF KERALA\n\nreported in AIR 2014 SC 2407 while examining the\n\nconstitutionality of \nKerala Irrigation and Water\n\nConservation (Amendment) Act, 2006\n and declaring it\n\nas unconstitutional in its application to and effect on\n\nthe Mullaperiar Dam was also examining the separation\n\nof powers between legislature, executive and judiciary\n\nand held that even without express provision of the\n\nseparation of powers, the doctrine of separation of\n\npowers is an enshrined principle embodied in the\n\nConstitution of India. It has been held by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court after elaborate discussion on the issue of\n\ndoctrine of separation of powers under the\n\nConstuitution of India and summarized it as under:\n\n : 304 :\n\n \"121. On deep reflection of the\nabove discussion, in our opinion,\nfollowing are the constitutional principles\nin the context of Indian Constitution\nrelating to separation of powers between\nlegislature, executive and judiciary may,\nin brief, be summarized thus:\n\n (i) Even without express\n provision of the separation of\n powers, the doctrine of\n separation of powers is an\n entrenched principle in the\n Constitution of India. The\n doctrine of separation of\n powers informs the Indian\n constitutional structure and\n it is an essential constituent\n of rule of law. In other\n words, the doctrine of\n separation of power though\n not expressly engrafted in the\n Constitution, its sweep,\n operation and visibility are\n apparent from the scheme of\n Indian Constitution.\n\n Constitution has made\n demarcation, without\n drawing formal lines between\n the three organs -\n\n legislature, executive and\n judiciary. In that sense, even\n in the absence of express\n provision for separation of\n power, the separation of\n powers between legislature,\n execution and judiciary is not\n different from the\n constitutions of the countries\n\n : 305 :\n\n which contain express\n provision for separation of\n powers.\n\n(ii) Independence of courts from\n the executive and legislature\n is fundamental to the rule of\n law and one of the basic\n tenets of Indian Constitution.\n Separation of judicial power\n is a significant constitutional\n principle under the\n Constitution of India.\n\n(iii) Separation of powers\n between three organs -\n\n legislature, executive and\n judiciary - is also nothing\n but a consequence of\n principles of equality\n enshrined in \nArticles 14\n of\n the Constitution of India.\n\n Accordingly, breach of\n separation of judicial power\n may amount to negation of\n equality under \nArticles 14.\n\n Stated thus, a legislation can\n be invalidated on the basis of\n breach of the separation of\n powers since such breach is\n negation of equality under\n \nArticles 14\n of the\n Constitution.\n\n(iv) The superior judiciary (High\n Courts and Supreme Court)\n is empowered by the\n Constitution to declare a law\n made by the legislature\n\n : 306 :\n\n (Parliament and State\n legislatures) void if it is found\n to have transgressed the\n constitutional limitations or\n if it infringed the rights\n enshrined in Part - III of the\n Constitutions.\n\n(v) The doctrine of separation of\n powers applies to the final\n judgments of the courts.\n\n Legislature cannot declare\n any decision of a court of law\n to be void or of no effect. It\n can, however, pass an\n amending Act to remedy the\n defects pointed out by a\n court of law or on coming to\n know of it aliunde. In other\n words, a court's decision\n must always bind unless the\n conditions on which it is\n based are so fundamentally\n altered that the decision\n could not have been given in\n the altered circumstances.\n\n(vi) If the legislature has the\n power over the subject-\n\n matter and competence to\n make a validating law, it can\n at any time make such a\n validating law and make it\n retrospective. The validity of\n a validating law, therefore,\n depends upon whether the\n legislature possesses the\n competence which it claims\n over the subject-matter and\n\n : 307 :\n\n whether in making the\n validation law it removes the\n defect which the courts had\n found in the existing law.\n\n(vii) The law enacted by the\n legislature may apparently\n seem to be within its\n competence but yet in\n substance if it is shown as\n an attempt to interfere with\n the judicial process, such law\n may be invalidated being in\n breach of doctrine of\n separation of powers. In\n such situation, the legal\n effect of the law on a\n judgment or a judicial\n proceeding must be\n examined closely, having\n regard to legislative\n prescription or direction.\n\n The questions to be asked\n are, (i) Does the legislative\n prescription or legislative\n directions interfere with the\n judicial functions? (ii) Is the\n legislation targeted at the\n decided case or whether\n impugned law requires its\n application to a case already\n finally decided? (iii) What are\n the terms of law; the issues\n with which it deals and the\n nature of the judgment that\n has attained finality? If the\n answer to (i) to (ii) is in the\n affirmative and the\n consideration of aspects\n\n : 308 :\n\n noted in question (iii)\n sufficiently establishes that\n the impugned law interferes\n with the judicial functions,\n the Court may declare the\n law unconstitutional.\"\n\n 45. Thus, it would emerge from the scheme of\n\nconstitution that Legislature can render judicial\n\ndecision ineffective by enacting validating law within its\n\nlegislative field fundamentally altering or changing its\n\ncharacter retrospectively. However, said principle would\n\nhave no application where a judicial decision has been\n\nrendered by recording a finding of fact and under the\n\npretence of such plenary power, legislature, cannot\n\nnullify or neutralize the effect of the judgment rendered\n\nafter ascertainment of facts by means of evidence or\n\nmaterial placed by the parties to such dispute. A final\n\njudgment once rendered would be operative and\n\nexecutable until and unless altered by the Court itself in\n\nappropriate proceedings.\n\n : 309 :\n\n \n46. Keeping the aforestated discussion in mind,\n\nthe constitutional validity of Act No.7/2014 is to be\n\ntested. As held by Hon'ble Apex Court in \nSTATE OF\n\nTAMIL NADU vs STATE OF KERALA\n referred to supra,\n\na validating law is to be judged by applying three tests\n\nnamely,\n\n (1) Whether the legislature possesses\n\n competence over the subject\n\n matter?\n\n (2) Whether by validation the\n\n legislature has removed the defect\n\n which the Courts found in the\n\n previous law? and,\n\n (3) Whether it is inconsistent with\n\n the provisions of Part III of the\n\n Constitution?\n\n : 310 :\n\n 47. Insofar as the first test is concerned, it\n\nwould not detain this Court for too long to hold that\n\nthere is not much challenge by the petitioners with\n\nregard to the competency of the legislature to enact the\n\nimpugned Act namely, Act No.7/2014. Hence,\n\nquestion of applying the first test and examining as to\n\nwhether the impugned Act would pass the said test\n\ndoes not arise.\n\n 48. However, the other two tests namely,\n\nwhether the impugned Act is a validating Act brought\n\nabout to remove the defect which the Courts had\n\npointed out in the previous law or whether the\n\nimpugned Act is inconsistent or contrary to the\n\nprovisions of Part III of the Constitution will have to be\n\nexamined in the background of the law \nlaid down by\n\nthis Court in granting relief to the petitioners namely,\n\ndirecting the State to reckon the non-grant period or the\n\ndate of initial appointment for the purposes of granting\n\n : 311 :\n\npay, promotion, pension and other service benefits to be\n\ngranted to them which concededly was on account of\n\ninterpretative process adopted by this Court, by\n\ndeclaring the law namely, \nKarnataka Education Act,\n\n1993\n and Rules made thereunder. Purportedly to plug\n\nthe said loop hole or the lacuna in the law, legislature in\n\nexercise of its plenary power has brought about the\n\nimpugned enactment. Whether this Court had pointed\n\nout any defect in the existing enactment and whether\n\non the basis of said defect, judgment came to be\n\nrendered so as to enable the legislature to remove such\n\ndefect found in the previous law would be the primary\n\nquestion. It is also to be examined as to whether the\n\nimpugned enactment is not opposed to Part III of the\n\nConstitution of India or in other words, impugned\n\nenactment is inconsistent with Part III of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n : 312 :\n\n 49. In Writ Appeal No.848/2008 c/w\n\nW.A.No.450/2007 and other writ petitions, Division\n\nBench of this Court examined the contention of the\n\nState which was to the effect that the non-grant period\n\nof service of the lecturers/teachers cannot be taken into\n\nconsideration for paying pensionary benefits, by relying\n\nupon \nSection 87\n of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993\n\nand Rule 3 of the Karnataka Educational Institutions\n\n(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions of Service of\n\nEmployees in Aided Colleges of Education and Teachers\n\nTraining Institutions) Rules, 2001 and Karnataka\n\nEducational Institutions (Recruitment and Terms and\n\nConditions of Service of Employees in Aided Colleges)\n\nRules, 1999. However, Division Bench rejected said\n\ncontentions by holding that there is no contra\n\nprescription insofar as the teachers of the aided\n\ninstitutions are concerned and said Rule create a parity\n\n : 313 :\n\nbetween the Teachers of the Government colleges as\n\nwell as aided colleges.\n\n 50. Likewise, the serving as well as retired\n\nteachers, assistant teachers and non-teaching staff who\n\nhave worked or working in aided private institutions\n\nassailed the Government Order dated 25.03.2011\n\nwhereunder the claim made by those petitioners for\n\ngrant of one increment on account of their passing\n\nKannada Language examination came to be denied for\n\nthe period 1974-1987. Said order came to be quashed\n\nbefore a co-ordinate Bench of this Court and this Court\n\nby order dated 10.08.2012 upheld the contention of\n\nemployees. Same was assailed in Writ Appeal No.2779\n\n& 4868-5434/2013 by the State before the Division\n\nBench. It was contended in the appeals by the State\n\nthat writ petitioners were not entitled to any benefits\n\nwhich are applicable to Government servant and\n\nteachers serving in the aided institutions cannot be\n\n : 314 :\n\ntreated on par with the teachers serving in the\n\nGovernment institution and mere passing of the\n\nKannada Examination by them, which was not\n\nobligatory, would not entitle them to claim the\n\nincrement and as such, it was contended that the\n\nlearned Single Judge was not justified in directing that\n\nmonetary benefit being paid to them for passing of the\n\nKannada Language examination or same to be extended\n\nto the teachers working in private aided institutions\n\nalso. \nSection 87\n of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993\n\nand Rule 3 of Karnataka Educational Institutions\n\n(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions of Service of\n\nEmployees in Private Aided Primary and Secondary\n\nEducational Institution) Rules, came to be examined by\n\nthe Division Bench and direction issued by the learned\n\nSingle Judge to grant benefit of one increment to those\n\nteaching and non-teaching staff of the aided institutions\n\n : 315 :\n\non par with the Government schools was upheld. It has\n\nbeen held by the Division Bench as under:\n\n \"On a conjoint reading of the Section\n and the Rules along with Annexure-H, it\n becomes clear that the intention of the\n State Government is to grant parity to the\n teachers working in all Government\n schools as well as those working in private\n schools. However, this is subject to the\n financial capacity of the State Government.\n It is in that regard that the proviso has\n been inserted to Sub-Rule(b) of Rule 3(1),\n so as to deny certain benefits to employees\n of aided institutions. In the instant case, if\n the State had intended to deny the benefit\n of one incentive to the teachers and non-\n teaching staff of private institutions on\n passing of the Kannada language\n examination, the same could have been\n inserted in Annexure-II of the Rules. The\n absence of such an insertion in Annexure-\n II coupled with \nSection 87\n read with\n Clause (b) of Sub-Rule(1) of Rule 3 makes\n clear that there is no intention on the part\n of the State Government to deny such a\n benefit to the teachers of the aided\n institutions. Moreover, conditions of\n service of staff of private aided institutions\n could be varied by the State Government\n under Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 3. Such a\n variation has not been pointed out insofar\n as the respondents are concerned. In that\n view of the matter, the learned Single\n Judge was right in quashing Annexure-A\n impugned in the writ petition and directing\n the State to grant the benefit of one\n\n : 316 :\n\n increment to those teaching and non-\n teaching staff of the aided institutions,\n particularly the respondents herein, on\n passing of the Kannada language\n examination, on par with the Government\n schools. In that view of the matter, the\n impugned order does not call for any\n interference in these appeals. The appeals\n being devoid of merit are dismissed.\"\n\n 51. The legislature cannot by a bare declaration\n\nwithout more, directly overrule, reverse or override a\n\njudicial decision. However it may, at any time, in\n\nexercise of the plenary powers conferred on it by \nArticle\n\n245\n and \n246\n of the Constitution render a judicial\n\ndecision ineffective by enacting a valid law on a topic\n\nwithin its legislative field fundamentally altering or\n\nchanging with retrospective effect either curatively or\n\nneutralizing the effect on which such decision is based.\n\nSuch validating legislation which removes the causes\n\nfor ineffectiveness or invalidity of actions or proceedings\n\nis not an encroachment on judicial power. For this\n\nproposition, judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\n\n : 317 :\n\ncase of INDIRA NEHRU GANDHI vs RAJ NARAYAN\n\nreported in AIR 1975 SC 2299 can be looked up.\n\n \n52. Legislature while passing validating law and\n\nproviding an intended valid legislation must indicate the\n\ndefect pointed out in the judgment which otherwise\n\ncould not have been rendered. The intended legislation\n\nmust be curative legislation, not directly declaring the\n\njudgment as ineffective. It has been held by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in \nSAJJAN SINGH vs STATE OF\n\nRAJASTHAN\n reported in AIR 1965 SC 845 to the\n\nfollowing effect:\n\n \"It is also urged that inasmuch as\n the impugned Act purports in substance\n to set aside the decisions of courts of\n competent jurisdiction by which some of\n the Acts added to the Ninth Schedule\n have been declared to be invalid, it is\n unconstitutional. We see no substance in\n this argument. It is hardly necessary to\n emphasize that legislative power to make\n laws in respect of areas entrusted to the\n legislative jurisdiction of different\n legislative bodies, can be exercised both\n prospectively and retrospectively. The\n constituent power conferred by \nArt. 368\n\n : 318 :\n\n on the Parliament can also be exercised\n both prospectively and retrospectively.\n On several occasions, legislatures think it\n necessary to validate laws which have\n been declared to be invalid by Courts of\n competent jurisdiction and in so doing,\n they have necessarily to provide for the\n intended validation to take effect\n notwithstanding any judgment, decree or\n order passed by a court of competent\n jurisdiction to the contrary. Therefore, it\n would be idle to contend fiat by making\n the amendment retrospective, the\n impugned Act has become\n constitutionally invalid.\"\n\n \n53. It has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nthat though the legislature has power to validate an\n\ninvalid levy retrospectively and can change the\n\ncharacter of tax or duty from impermissible to\n\npermissible but these principles would not apply if it is\n\nin the form of a explanation, vide \nM.P.CEMENT\n\nMANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION vs STATE OF\n\nMADHYA PRADESH\n reported in (2004)2 SCC 249. It\n\nhas been held as under:\n\n \n\"22. The legislature has the power to\n validate an invalid levy and to do so\n\n : 319 :\n\nretrospectively. The prescription\nprovided in the context of judicially\ninvalidated legislation would not apply as\nthe 2001 amendment had not, till the\npromulgation of the 2003 Act, been held\nto be invalid by any court. The\nlegislature can also change the character\nof the tax or duty from impermissible to\npermissible but the tax or levy should be\nwithin its legislative competence.\nHowever, in our view, these principles\nwould not apply to the 2003 amendment\nsince it is in the form of an Explanation\nto \nSection 3(2)\n. The object of an\nExplanation to a statutory provision has\nbeen culled out from the earlier judicial\ndecisions and succinctly restated in\n\nS.Sundaram Pillai v. V.R.Pattabiraman\n -\n(1985) 1 SCC 591.\n\n \n\"53. Thus, from a\n conspectus of the authorities\n \nreferred to above\n, it is manifest that\n the object of an Explanation to a\n statutory provision is--\n\n (a) to explain the meaning and\n intendment of the Act itself,\n\n (b) where there is any obscurity\n or vagueness in the main\n enactment, to clarify the same as to\n make it consistent with the\n dominant object which it seems to\n subserve.\n\n (c) to provide an additional\n support to the dominant object of\n\n : 320 :\n\n the Act in order to make it\n meaningful and purposeful,\n\n (d) an Explanation cannot in any\n way interfere with or change the\n enactment or any part thereof but\n where some gap is left which is\n relevant for the purpose of the\n Explanation, in order to suppress\n the mischief and advance the\n object of the Act it can help or\n assist the court in interpreting the\n true purport and intendment of the\n enactment, and\n\n (e) it cannot, however, take away\n a statutory right with which any\n person under a statute has been\n clothed or set at naught the\n working of an Act by becoming a\n hindrance in the interpretation of\n the same.\"\n\n \n54. The power of the legislature to remove the\n\nbasis of a decision rendered by a competent Court in\n\nexercise of its plenary power is an issue which is no\n\nmore res integra in view of the law \nlaid down by\n Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in the case of \nSTATE OF H.P. AND\n\nOTHERS vs. YASH PAL GARG (DEAD) BY LRS\n. &\n\nOTHERS reported in (2003)9 SCC 92.\n \nLikewise, where\n\n : 321 :\n\nthe legislature possess competence over the subject\n\nmatter and tries to remove the defect which the Courts\n\nhad found in the existing law and makes adequate\n\nprovision in the validating law, the constitutionality of\n\nsuch law has been held to be upheld as held by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in \nDHARAM DUTT AND OTHERS\n\nvs UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS\n (2004)1 SCC 712.\n\n \n55. However, if the judgment is delivered on the\n\nprinciples of parity, while re-enacting the law with\n\nretrospective effect, such Act can be questioned as one\n\nbeing in violation of fundamental rights enshrined in\n\nPart-III of Constitution. If the judgment is delivered on\n\nthe principle of parity i.e. \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution,\n\nthen there is little scope or area left available to the\n\nlegislature to enact a law inasmuch as, there is nothing\n\nleft to be validated or defect to be cured. Such\n\nlegislation cannot be considered as curative legislation.\n\nWhere the judgments are held to be ineffective by\n\n : 322 :\n\namending law, then exercise of power by the legislature\n\nhas to be held as having encroached upon the judicial\n\npower. It has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in the\n\ncase of \nSTATE OF HARYANA & OTHERS vs THE\n\nKARNAL CO-OP. FARMERS' SOCIETY LIMITED\n\nreported in AIR 1994 SC 1 to the following effect:\n\n \"31. Thus, it becomes clear that a\n Legislature while has the legislative\n power to render ineffective the earlier\n judicial decisions, by removing or altering\n or neutralising the legal basis in the\n unamended law on which such decisions\n were founded, even retrospectively, it\n does not have the power to render\n ineffective the earlier judicial decisions by\n making a law which simply declares the\n earlier judicial decisions as invalid or not\n binding for such power if exercised would\n not be a legislative power but a judicial\n power which cannot be encroached upon,\n by a Legislature under our Constitution.\n\n 32. In the instant case, the\n Haryana State Legislature, by the\n Amendment Act of 1981, has not made\n any provision to include the lands and\n immovable properties - the subject of the\n civil Court's decrees, in 'Shamilat deh' so\n as to bring them within the purview of\n the principal Act. But, the provision\n\n : 323 :\n\nmade therein merely directs the Assistant\nCollector of First Grade, in effect, to\ndisregard or disobey the earlier civil\nCourts' decrees and judicial orders by\nwhich it had been held that certain lands\nand immovable properties fell outside\n'shamilat deh' regulated by the principal\nAct. Such provisions inserted by the\nAmendment Act of 1981 in the principal\nAct by a Legislature are clearly\nunconstitutional for they are to be\nregarded as provisions made by\nencroaching upon the judicial power.\nHence, the view of the High Court that\nthe provisions of the Amendment Act of\n1981 which merely authorize the\nAssistant Collector of First Grade to\ndecide the claims to the made before him\nclaiming certain lands or immovable\nproperties as 'shamilat deh' vesting in\nPanchayats ignoring the judicial orders or\ndecrees, by which any right, title or\ninterest of private parties in such lands\nor immovable properties are recognized\nare unconstitutional, requires to be\nupheld. Consequently, the provisions of\nthe Amendment Act of 1981, insofar as\nthey are intended to operate\nretrospectively for nullifying the\nadjudications made by civil Courts prior\nto that Amendment Act are invalid,\ninoperative and unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, the provisions in the\nAmendment Act of 1981, can\n\nundoubtedly operate prospectively for\nadjudicating upon claims to 'shalimat\ndeh' in proceedings initiated subsequent\nto the commencement of that Act, if they\n\n : 324 :\n\n do not, in any way, disturb the finality of\n adjudications made earlier.\"\n\n 56. \nIn this connection, the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nMUNICIPAL\n\nCORPORATION OF CITY OF AHMEDABAD vs NEW\n\nSHOROCK SPINNING & WEAVING COMPANY\n\nLIMITED\n reported in AIR 1970 SC 1292 can be noticed\n\nwhereunder the High Court as well as the Apex Court\n\nhas held that the property tax collected for certain years\n\nby the Municipal Corporation was illegal. In order to\n\nnullify the effect of the decision, the State Government\n\nintroduced Section 152-A by an amendment to the Act,\n\nthe effect of which was to command the Municipal\n\nCorporation, to refuse to refund the amount illegally\n\ncollected despite the orders of the High Court as well as\n\nApex Court. In this background, it was held that said\n\nprovision makes direct in-road into the judicial powers.\n\nIt was further held that no legislature in the country\n\n : 325 :\n\nhas power to ask the instrumentalities of the State to\n\ndisobey or disaregard the decision given by the Courts.\n\nConsequently, the amended provision was held to be\n\nrepugnant to the Constitution and struck down.\n\n 57. The legislature can change the basis on\n\nwhich decision is rendered by the Court and thus,\n\nchanged the law in general, which will affect a class of\n\npersons and events at large. It cannot, however, set\n\naside an individual decision inter parties and affect their\n\nrights and liabilities alone. Such an act on the part of\n\nthe legislature amounts to exercising the judicial power\n\nof the State and to function as an appellate Court or\n\nTribunal. This view is fortified by the law laid downby\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of: CAUVERY\n\nDISPUTES TRIBUNAL reported in 1993 supplment (1)\n\nSCC 96(II).\n\n : 326 :\n\n \n58. The legislature cannot assume power of\n\nadjudicating a case by virtue of its enactment of the law\n\nwithout leaving it to the judiciary to decide it with\n\nreference to the law in force. The legislature also is\n\nincompetent to over rule the decision of a Court without\n\nproperly removing the base on which the judgment is\n\nfound. The Hon'ble Apex Court in \nINDIAN ALUMINIUM\n\nCOMPANY & OTHERS vs. STATE OF KERALA\n\nreported in (1996) 7 SCC 637 while examining the\n\nvalidity of \nSection 11\n of Kerala Electricity Surcharge\n\n(levy and collection) Act, 1989 (Act 22 of 1999) and\n\nfurther provision permitting non-refund of the amount\n\ncollected has laid down the parameters for examining\n\nthe constitutionality of validating Act by the Courts in\n\nthe following manner:\n\n \"56. From a resume of the above\n decisions the following principles would\n emerge:\n\n (1) The adjudication of the rights\n of the parties is the essential\n\n : 327 :\n\n judicial function. Legislature\n has to lay down the norms of\n conduct or rules which will\n govern the parties and the\n transactions and require the\n court to give effect to them;\n\n(2) The Constitution delineated\n delicate balance in the\n exercise of the sovereign\n power by the legislature,\n executive and judiciary;\n\n(3) In a democracy governed by\n rule of law, the legislature\n exercises the power under\n \nArticles 245\n and \n246\n and\n other companion articles\n read with the entries in the\n respective lists in the\n Seventh Schedule to make\n the law which includes power\n to amend the law.\n\n(4) Courts in their concern and\n endeavour to preserve\n judicial power equally must\n be guarded to maintain the\n delicate balance devised by\n the Constitution between the\n three sovereign functionaries.\n\n In order that rule of law\n permeates to fulfil\n constitutional objectives of\n establishing an egalitarian\n social order, the respective\n sovereign functionaries need\n free play in their joints so\n that the march of social\n\n : 328 :\n\n progress and order remains\n unimpeded. The smooth\n balance built with delicacy\n must always be maintained;\n\n(5) In its anxiety to safeguard\n judicial power, it is\n unnecessary to be\n overzealous and conjure up\n incursion into the judicial\n preserve invalidating the\n valid law competently made;\n\n(6) The court, therefore, needs to\n carefully scan the law to find\n out:\n\n (a) whether the vice pointed\n out by the court and\n invalidity suffered by\n previous law is cured\n complying with the legal and\n constitutional requirements;\n\n (b) whether the legislature\n has competence to validate\n the law: (c) whether such\n validation is consistent with\n the rights guaranteed in Part\n III of the Constitution.\n\n(7) The court does not have the\n power to validate an invalid\n law or to legalise impost of\n tax illegally made and\n collected or to remove the\n norm of invalidation or\n provide a remedy. These are\n not judicial functions but the\n exclusive province of the\n legislature. Therefore, they\n\n : 329 :\n\n are not encroachment on\n judicial power.\n\n(8) In exercising legislative\n power, the legislature by\n mere declaration, without\n anything more, cannot\n directly overrule, revise or\n override a judicial decision.\n It can render judicial\n decision ineffective by\n enacting valid law on the\n topic within its legislative\n field fundamentally altering\n or changing its character\n retrospectively. The changed\n or altered conditions are\n such that the previous\n decision would not have been\n rendered by the court, if\n those conditions had existed\n at the time of declaring the\n law as invalid. It is also\n empowered to give effect to\n retrospective legislation with\n a deeming date or with effect\n fro the particular date. The\n legislature can change the\n character of the tax or duty\n from impermissible to\n permissible tax but the tax or\n levy should answer such\n character and the legislature\n is competent to recover the\n invalid tax validating such a\n tax on removing the invalid\n base for recovery from the\n subject or render the\n recovery from the State\n\n : 330 :\n\n ineffectual. It is competent\n for the legislature to enact\n the law with retrospective\n effect and authorize its\n agencies to levy and collect\n the tax on that basis, make\n the imposition of levy\n collected and recovery of the\n tax made valid,\n notwithstanding the\n declaration by the court or\n the direction given for\n recovery thereof.\n\n (9) The consistent thread that\n runs through all the\n decisions of this Court is that\n the legislature cannot\n directly overrule the decision\n or make a direction as not\n binding on it but has power\n to make the decision\n ineffective by removing the\n base on which the decision\n was rendered, consistent\n with the law of the\n Constitution and the\n legislature must have\n competence to do the same.\"\n\n 59. A bare reading of above dicta \nlaid down by\n\nHon'ble Apex Court would indicate that the legislature\n\nby mere declaration without anything more, cannot\n\ndirectly over rule, revise or over write a judicial decision.\n\n : 331 :\n\nIt has been held that the consistent thread that runs\n\nthrough all the decisions of the Apex Court is that the\n\nlegislature cannot directly over rule the decision or\n\nmake a direction as not binding on it but has power to\n\nmake the decision ineffective by removing the base on\n\nwhich the decision was rendered, consistent with the\n\nConstuitution of India. The State has to establish that\n\ndue to absence of the provision found in the amending\n\nAct, such judgment came to be rendered and this was\n\nthe defect pointed out by the Court and to cure the\n\ndefect pointed out, amending Act or amendment was\n\nbeing brought in.\n\n 60. It is well settled by catena of judgments that\n\nwhen the Courts in exercise of power of judicial review\n\nhave declared a particular statute to be invalid, the\n\nlegislature has no power to over rule the judgment.\n\nHowever, it has the power to suitably amend the law by\n\n : 332 :\n\nuse of appropriate phraseology by removing the defects\n\npointed out by the Court for its effective enforcement.\n\n 61. Where the legislature validates the executive\n\naction repugnant to the statutory provision declared by\n\nthe Court of law, what the legislature is required to do\n\nis, first to remove the very basis of invalidity and then\n\nvalidate the executive action. In order to validate the\n\nexecutive action or any provision of a statute, it is not\n\nsufficient for the legislature to declare that a judicial\n\npronouncement given by a Court of law would not be\n\nbinding as the legislature would not possess that power.\n\n 62. In the instant case, the decisions rendered\n\nby the Courts insofar as petitioners and similarly placed\n\npersons are concerned relates to pay parity, grant of\n\nincrement on par with teachers working in Government\n\ninstitutions, payment of pension and grant of other\n\n : 333 :\n\nservice benefits which is based on \nArticle 14\n of the\n\nConstitution. Thus, it is a fundamental right which has\n\naccrued to the petitioners as a matter of interpretation\n\nof \nSection 87\n of Karnataka Education Act, 1993 and\n\nRules made thereunder by applying the principle of\n\n'equal pay for equal work' financial benefits have been\n\nextended to the petitioners and similarly placed\n\npersons, which again is based on the principles \nlaid\n\ndown in\n \nArticle 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. \nThe\n\nimpugned enactment by the legislature in exercise of its\n\nplenary power would take away the judicial\n\npronouncement which have been based on \nArticle 14\n of\n\nthe Constitution and as such, the impugned enactment\n\nwill have to be necessarily held as opposed to \nArticle 14\n\nof the Constitution and thereby it fails to pass one of the\n\ntests as indicated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nSTATE\n\nOF TAMIL NADU vs STATE OF KERALA\n reported in\n\nAIR 2014 SC 2407 referred to supra.\n\n : 334 :\n\n \n63. At this juncture, it would be apt to note the\n\njudgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of\n\nCHANDIGARH ADMINISTRATION vs RAJNI VALI\n\n(Mrs.\n) reported in (2000)2 SCC 42 wherein the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court has opined that it is the duty of all the\n\nStates in India to facilitate the imparting of primary and\n\nsecondary education and the grant-in-aid to the private\n\nschools is a constitutional obligation, which the States\n\ncannot ignore and it is also held that State\n\nAdministration cannot plead lack of resources to meet\n\nsuch contingency. It has been held by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt as under:\n\n \"10. Coming to the contention of\n the appellants that the Chandigarh\n Aministration will find it difficult to bear\n the additional financial burden if the claim\n of the respondents 1 to 12 is accepted, we\n need only say that such a contention\n raised in different cases of similar nature\n has been rejected by this Court. The State\n Administration cannot shirk its\n responsibility of ensuring proper\n education in schools and colleges on the\n plea of lack of resources. It is for the\n Authorities running the Administration to\n\n : 335 :\n\n find out the ways and means of securing\n funds for the purpose. We do not deem it\n necessary to consider this question in\n further detail. The contention raised by\n the appellants in this regard is rejected. It\n is, however, clarified that the proportion in\n which the additional burden will be shared\n by the Chandigarh Administration and the\n Management of the school will be in\n accordance with the Grant-in- aid Scheme\n applicable to the school from time to time.\n The judgment of the High Court that the\n sharing of the financial burden will be in\n the ratio of 95 % to 5% is modified\n accordingly.\"\n\n 64. \nIn fact, directions came to be issued by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court way back in the year 1998 in\n\nthe case of \nHARYANA STATE ADHYAPAK SANGH &\n\nOTHERS vs STATE OF HARYANA & OTHERS\n reported\n\nin AIR 1988 SC 1663 to the effect that teachers of the\n\naided schools must be paid the same pay scales and\n\ndearness allowance as teachers in Government schools\n\nfor the entire period claimed by petitioners, and that the\n\nexpenditure on that account should be apportioned\n\nbetween State and the management in the same\n\n : 336 :\n\nproportion in which they share the burden of the\n\nexisting emoluments of the teachers which direction\n\nwas reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court on 21.02.1990\n\nbetween the same parties reported in reported in AIR\n\n1990 SC 968 with a direction to the State to pay scales\n\nof the teachers of the Government aided schools so as to\n\nbring them at par with the pay scales of teachers of\n\nGovernment schools with effect from 01.04.1979 and\n\nalso additional dearness allowance on the basis of\n\nrevised pay scales for the period 01.04.1979 to\n\n31.12.1985 in five instalments.\n\n 65. In this background, it requires to be noticed\n\nthat the impugned Act namely, Act No.7/2014 enacted\n\nby the State legislature in exercise of its plenary power\n\nis sought to be defended on two grounds namely,\n\n (1) It causes financial burden to the State;\n\n and\n\n : 337 :\n\n (2) Petitioners and similarly placed\n employees working in Government\n aided institutions do not have right to\n claim monetary and service benefits\n from the date of their initial\n appointment.\n\nIt is the same plea which came to be put forward by the\n\nState when petitioners and similarly placed persons had\n\napproached this Court seeking for pay parity on par\n\nwith the employees working in Government institutions.\n\nBy interpretative process, this Court has consistently\n\nheld in catena of judgments that \nSection 87\n when read\n\nwith \nSection 49\n of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993\n\ndoes not leave any iota of doubt to arrive at a conclusion\n\nabout there cannot be any discrimination between two\n\ntypes of teachers discharging same duties and thereby it\n\ncame to be held that pay parity by way of differenciation\n\nbetween the teachers working in Government aided\n\ninstitutions and teachers working in aided institutions\n\n : 338 :\n\nwould amout to discrimination and is hit by \nArticle 14\n\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n 66. The judgments rendered by this Court as\n\naffirmed by Division Bench and confirmed by Hon'ble\n\nApex Court has not extended the benefit to the\n\npetitioners on the basis of any lacuna either in the\n\nKarnataka Education Act, 1993\n or the Rules made\n\nthereunder and thereby enabling the legislature to fill\n\nup the said defect or loop hole or lacuna in the\n\nenactment through the impugned enactment. However,\n\non the touch stone of \nArticle 14\n, \nSection 87\n of\n\nKarnataka Education Act, 1993 has been held to be\n\ndiscriminatory. The legislature nor the executive has\n\nthe power to simply declare the decisions of the Court\n\nas invalid or not binding. The State has not taken into\n\nconsideration any fresh material nor it has taken into\n\nconsideration any report from competent and expert\n\nbodies to arrive at a conclusion that the impugned\n\n : 339 :\n\nenactment is brought about as a curative legislation.\n\nThe Courts in the instant case have not found or\n\ndeclared any law to be invalid so as to enable the\n\nlegislature to exercise its plenary power to remove or\n\nalter or neutralize the legal basis in the unamended law.\n\n 67. In fact, at this juncture, it would be apt to\n\nnote the subsequent event also that arose during the\n\npendency of these writ petitions namely, amendment\n\nbrought about to \nSection 87\n of the Karnataka Education\n\nAct by way of Ordinance whereunder the words \"and\n\nbenefits of retirement\" found in the proviso to \nSection\n\n87\n of the Act was sought to be omitted and the provisos\n\nindicated thereunder was sought to be inserted. The\n\nabove said omission and insertion which were sought to\n\nbe included under the Karnataka Education\n\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 2014 (Karnataka Ordinance\n\n1 of 2014) reads as under:\n\n : 340 :\n\n \"2. Amendment of \nSection 87\n. -\n\nIn the Karnataka Education Act, 1983\n\n(Karnataka Act\n 1 of 1995), in \nsection 87\n,-\n\n (a) in the proviso the words \"and\nbenefits of retirement\" shall be omitted;\nand\n\n (b) after the proviso, the following\nprovisos shall be inserted, namely:-\n\n \"Provided further that\n conditions of service of the\n employees working in aided\n educational institutions shall\n be as such as may be\n determined by the State\n Government from time to time.\n\n Provided also that since\n 1974 no employee of the aided\n institution is required to\n appear and pass any Service\n Examination or the Kannada\n Language Examination as\n prescribed in the Karnataka\n Civil Service (Service and\n Kannada Language\n Examination) Rules, 1974 no\n such employee shall be eligible\n for or be granted any\n additional increment for\n having passed or deemed to\n have been passed said\n examination from the date of\n commencement of said rules.\"\n\n 3. Cancellation of sanction of\nAdditional increment and\nextinguishment of claims, if any.- (1)\n\n : 341 :\n\nNotwithstanding anything contained in\nthe \nKarnataka Education Act, 1983\n\n(Karnataka Act\n 1 of 1995), any order of\nthe State Government or rules governing\nthe conditions of employees of any Private\naided Educational Institution or any\nother Law governing the Grant in aid to\nthe above employees or any Judgment,\ndecree or order of any Court or Tribunal\nor Authority no employees of an aided\ninstitution is required to pass any Service\nor Kannada Language examination or be\neligible for or be granted any additional\nincrement for having passed or deemed to\nhave been passed any such examination\nas prescribed to Government Servants in\nthe Karnataka Civil Services (Service and\nKannada Language examination) Rules,\n1974 and any claim of an employee of a\nPrivate Educational Institution for\nsanction of any additional increment for\nthe above reason shall stand\nextinguished, accordingly,-\n\n (a) the order issued by\nGovernment directing to sanction any\nadditional increment for the above\nreason shall stand cancelled;\n\n Provided that any amount paid\nas per the order now cancelled\ntowards said additional increment\nshall not be recovered;\n\n (b) no suit or other proceeding\nshall be maintained or continued in\nany Court against the Government by\nany employee of Private Aided\nEducational institution claiming\nadditional increment for the said\n\n : 342 :\n\n purpose or arrears thereof or for\n pensionary benefits by reckoning the\n said additional increment;\n\n (c) no Court shall enforce any\n decree or order directing release of\n grant in aid taking into account the\n additional increment for having\n passed or deemed to have been passed\n the Service examination or the\n Kannada Language Examination by an\n employee of Private aided Educational\n Institution.\"\n\n \n68. At the cost of repetition, it requires to be\n\nnoticed that said Ordinance having not been brought\n\nbefore the Legislature, it has failed and thereby\n\namended provision brought to \nSection 87\n of the\n\nKarnataka Education Act, 1993 is not to be found or in\n\nother words, unamended \nSection 87\n stands as on date.\n\nThus, \nSection 87\n of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993\n\nhaving been interpreted by this Court as it is and held\n\nthat not taking into consideration the date of entry into\n\nservice for the purposes of pay, promotion, pension and\n\nother service benefits to the petitioners and similarly\n\n : 343 :\n\nplaced employees would tantamount to discrimination\n\nand hit by \nArticle 14\n of the Constiutition of India,\n\nLegislature is now precluded from nullifying the effect of\n\njudgments rendered by this Court by impugned Act in\n\nexercise of its plenary power since it is not validating\n\nany law declared by the Courts as invalid or defective.\n\nThus, the very foundation or the basis for the impugned\n\nAct is lacking. Consequently, it has to be held that the\n\nlegislature has transgressed its power and has\n\nencroached the judicial arena through the impugned\n\nenactment. Thereby, the impugned Act also does not\n\npass the second test prescribed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of \nSTATE OF TAMIL NADU vs STATE\n\nOF KERALA\n reported in AIR 2014 SC 2407.\n\n 69. Yet another contention which has been\n\nraised by Sri A.G.Shivanna, learned Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral is that State of Andhra Pradesh had enacted\n\nsimilar law and same has been upheld by the High\n\n : 344 :\n\nCourt of Andhra Pradesh when examined, it requires to\n\nbe taken note of for purposes of rejection for reasons\n\nmore than one. State of Andhra Pradesh enacted\n\nAndhra Pradesh Private Aided Educational Staff\n\n(Regulation of Pay) Ordinance, 2005 (Ordinance 3 of\n\n2005) relating to certain service conditions of the\n\nemployee both teaching and non-teaching of the\n\neducational institutions run by private organizations.\n\nThe validity of the said Ordinance had come up for\n\nconsideration before the Division Bench of High Court of\n\nAndhra Pradesh in the matter of Y.SIDDAREDDY vs\n\nGOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH reported in\n\n(2006)1 ALT 354 and held as follows:\n\n \"67. Under \nSection 4\n, the\n Legislature purports to extinguish the\n rights created under the automatic\n advancement scheme and the career\n advancement scheme, the benefits of\n which are made available to those\n employees who had rendered certain\n minimum qualifying service. \nSection 4\n of\n the Act purports to extinguish the claims\n of the employees of the private aided\n educational institutions with regard to\n\n : 345 :\n\nthe above mentioned four aspects of the\nservice based on any government order or\nany judgment of the Court below or\ntribunal. A plain reading of the section\npurports to extinguish the rights of the\nemployees through the various orders on\nthe basis of which such rights were\ncreated. Though the learned Advocate\nGeneral argued that the intention of the\nLegislature is only to extinguish such\nrights vis-a-vis the State, the section does\nnot make any distinction between the\nobligation of the State and the obligation\nof the management to give the benefits as\ncontemplated under the various GOs. It\nmainly purports to extinguish the right\nitself thereby relieving even the\nmanagements from the obligation to\nextend the benefits conferred under the\nvarious government orders. We fail to\nunderstand the whole exercise\nundertaken by the State. On one hand,\nthe continued existence of the benefits\ncreated under the automatic\nadvancement scheme and career\nadvancement scheme is recognized in the\nOrdinance, but on the literal construction\nof \nSection 4\n, it purports to extinguish the\nrights flowing from such schemes. In our\nview, the enactment is a product of an\nabsolute misconception of law and\ninability of the draftsman to handle\nthe problem. The State in an attempt\nto escape the financial liability arising\nout of a plethora of ill-conceived\norders issued earlier resorted to the\nimpugned retrospective legislation by\nwhich it not only proposes to escape\nthe financial liability - we make it clear\n\n : 346 :\n\n the State indeed is entitled to escape -\n but also extinguish the rights of the\n employees vis-avis the managements. The\n State also ignored the fact that it owes a\n constitutional obligation to extend the\n necessary financial support to the\n educational institutions imparting\n education to children below 14 years. The\n Ordinance does not make any distinction\n between the educational institutions\n imparting education to the children below\n 14 years and those imparting education\n to children above 14 years. This kind of\n grouping of SUBJECTS ignoring the\n constitutionally settled differentia, in\n our view, itself renders the legislation\n irrational and arbitrary. In our view,\n therefore, the Ordinance, as it is, is\n required to be declared\n unconstitutional as violating the\n \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India.\n We accordingly declare so. The Writ\n Petition is allowed as prayed for\".\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 70. Facts narrated in the above judgment are\n\nsome what similar to facts obtained in the instant case.\n\nGVK Girls High School was admitted to grant-in-aid\n\nwith effect from 01.09.1985 as per the \nAndhra Pradesh\n\nEducation Act\n. The arrears of salary to the Head\n\nMistress and Staff of the school were not paid. As such,\n\n : 347 :\n\na writ petition came to be filed and State was directed to\n\npay the arrears. However, it was noticed by the Court\n\nthat during the pendency of writ petitions, G.O. dated\n\n28.04.1994 was issued refusing to pay the arrears.\n\nHence, direction came to be issued to the State to pay\n\nthe arrears. It is thereafter the State came forward\n\nwith a legislation by way of Andhra Pradesh Act, 34 of\n\n1995 with retrospective effect from 17.10.1989\n\nwhereunder it permitted denial of \"arrears\" of grant-in-\n\naid whenever such arrears were claimed under any\n\njudgment, decree or order of Court or other authority or\n\nany order issued by Government. In the writ Appeal\n\nfiled by the State against the learned Single Judge's\n\norder, State relied upon the said legislation to get over\n\nthe judgment of the learned Single Judge. In this\n\nbackground, Division Bench held that legislature could\n\nnot set aside the judgment of the High Court by Act\n\nNo.34 of 1995 by dismissing the Writ Appeal No.1745 of\n\n : 348 :\n\ndated 06.08.1996 and affirming the judgment of the\n\nlearned Single Judge. This judgment of the Division\n\nBench was carried by the State by way of Special Leave\n\nPetition before the Hon'ble Apex Court which was later\n\nconverted as Civil Appeal No.2428/1997. The Hon'ble\n\nApex Court has held to the following effect:\n\n \"Act 22/1995 cannot set aside\n the judgment of the learned Single\n Judge. Now \nsection 2\n of the Act\n 34/95 also purports to nullify the\n effect of the judgment of the learned\n Single Judge. It is well settled that\n the legislature cannot overrule a\n judgment by passing a law to that\n effect unless it removes the basis of\n the legal rights upon which the\n judgment is based, with retrospective\n effect and provided there is no\n violation of any constitutional\n provision in such withdrawal of rights\n retrospectively.\n\n In the present case, we are not\n going into the question whether any\n provision of the Constitution is\n violated while passing Act 34/95\n denying arrears of grant-in-aid\n retrospectively. However, in our view,\n inasmuch as the rights created by Act\n 1/82 and Act read with the\n\n : 349 :\n\n Committee's recommendations have\n not been nullified by Act 22/95, the\n judgment of the learned Single Judge\n remains effective. The basis of the\n judgment has not been removed. We\n have already shown that the rights\n flowing from the Acts were not\n touched.\"\n\n 71. Thus, from the perusal of the order passed\n\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court, it would clearly indicate that\n\njudgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court came to be\n\naffirmed. It was held by the Andhra Pradesh High Court\n\nthat Ordinance was unconstitutional and as such,\n\namendment brought to \nAndhra Pradesh Education Act\n\ncame to be struck down. In that view of the matter, the\n\nsaid amendment cannot be held as being in parimateria\n\nwith \nKarnataka Education Act, 1993\n. In that view of the\n\nmatter, contention of the learned Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral that amendment brought to \nAndhra Pradesh\n\nEducation Act\n is similar to the impugned Act if accepted\n\nalso, then the necessary consequence would be to hold\n\n : 350 :\n\nthe present impugned enactment as also violative of\n\nArticle 14\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 72. One another contention which has been\n\nraised by the State is that 'Doctrine of Small Repairs'\n\nis applicable to the impugned enactment and the\n\nlegislature in order to carry out the object of the\n\nprincipal Act has resorted to enact the impugned Act.\n\nHence, it is contended that impugned Act does not\n\nsuffer from any vice for being struck down.\n\n \n73. Whenever a tax payer would challenge the\n\nlevy of tax before the Courts, scrutiny of legal provisions\n\nis undertaken by the Courts to decide whether the levy\n\nof tax is legally valid or suffers from some infirmity. In\n\nthe event of Court arriving at a conclusion that such\n\nlevy of tax was not warranted on account of defect in the\n\nenactment or the phraseology used in the statutory\n\n : 351 :\n\nprovisions or any other infirmity, order for refund. The\n\nlegislature in such circumstances undertake to enact\n\nlaw to remove or rectify the defect or the lacuna and\n\nalso validate the proceedings including retaining or\n\nwithholding tax already recovered by retrospective\n\noperation. Such an amending and validating Act to\n\nmake \"small repairs\" is permissible mode of legislation\n\nwhich is frequently resorted to in Fiscal enactments\n\nwhich has been approved by the constitutional bench of\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nASSISTANT\n\nCOMMISSIONER OF URBAN LAND TAX AND OTHERS\n\nvs THE BUCKINGHAM AND CARNATIC COMPANY\n\nLIMITED, ETC\n. reported in (1969)2 SCC 55. Keeping\n\nthe principles enumerated by Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nmind, when the impugned Act is examined, it would not\n\neven remotely suggest that the Courts while interpreting\n\nSection 87\n of the Karnataka Education Act and the\n\nRules made thereunder had found any infirmity or\n\n : 352 :\n\nlacuna in the said enactments so as to enable the\n\nlegislature to exercise its plenary power to remove such\n\ndefect or lacuna in the enactment and thereby render\n\nthe judgments already delivered by the Courts to be\n\nineffective.\n \nOn the other hand, the impugned\n\nenactment has been brought about on the ground that\n\nit would cause financial burden on the State which has\n\nalready been dealt by this Court hereinabove and it has\n\nbeen held that State Administration cannot shirk its\n\nresponsibility of ensuring proper education in schools\n\nand colleges on the plea of lack of resources and it is for\n\nthe authorities to find out ways and means of securing\n\nfunds for the said purpose as held by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of \nCHANDIGARH ADMINISTRATION\n\ncase referred to supra.\n\n : 353 :\n\n 74. For the reasons aforestated, I proceed to\n\npass the following:\n\n ORDER\n\n (i) Writ Petitions are hereby allowed.\n\n (ii) The Karnataka Private Aided\n Educational Institutions Employees\n (Regulation of Pay, Pension and other\n Benefits) Act, 2014 \n(Karnataka Act\n\n No.07/2014) is hereby struck down as\n ultravires of Constitution of India as it\n is opposed to \nArticle 14\n of Constitution\n of India and also encroaches upon the\n judicial powers of the Courts as\n discussed herein above.\n\n (iii) Respondent - State shall continue to\n pay salary or pension as the case may\n be, to petitioners and similarly placed\n persons as was being paid pursuant to\n its earlier orders or in other words, as\n it was being paid prior to impugned\n enactment.\n\n : 354 :\n\n OR\n\n Respondent-State shall comply with\n the directions already issued by this\n Court extending the monetary benefits\n and treating the petitioners working in\n Private Aided Educational Institutions\n on par with the employees working in\n Government Institutions.\n\n (iv) In the event of respondent - State\n having recovered any amount/s\n pursuant to the impugned enactment,\n same is hereby ordered to be refunded\n to the respective petitioner/s by the\n State expeditiously, at any rate within\n eight weeks from the date of receipt of\n certified copy of this order.\n\n (v) No order as to costs.\n\n Ordered accordingly.\n\n Sd/-\n JUDGE\n*sp",
