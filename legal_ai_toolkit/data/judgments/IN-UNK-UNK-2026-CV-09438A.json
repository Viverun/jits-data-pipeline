(C) No. 17 of 2010)\n\nDr. (Mrs.) Malathi Ravi, M.D. ... Appellant\n\n Versus\n\nDr. B.V. Ravi, M.D. ...Respondent\n\n J U D G M E N T\n\nDipak Misra, J.\n\n Leave granted.\n\nMarriage as a social institution is an affirmance of civilized social order\nwhere two individuals, capable of entering into wedlock, have pledged\nthemselves to the institutional norms and values and promised to each other\na cemented bond to sustain and maintain the marital obligation. It stands\nas an embodiment for continuance of the human race. Despite the pledge and\npromises, on certain occasions, individual incompatibilities, attitudinal\ndifferences based upon egocentric perception of situations, maladjustment\nphenomenon or propensity for non-adjustment or refusal for adjustment gets\neminently projected that compels both the spouses to take intolerable\npositions abandoning individual responsibility, proclivity of asserting\nsuperiority complex, betrayal of trust which is the cornerstone of life,\nand sometimes a pervert sense of revenge, a dreadful diet, or sheer sense\nof envy bring the cracks in the relationship when either both the spouses\nor one of the spouses crave for dissolution of marriage – freedom from the\ninstitutional and individual bond. The case at hand initiated by the\nhusband for dissolution of marriage was viewed from a different perspective\nby the learned Family Court Judge who declined to grant divorce as the\nfactum of desertion as requisite in law was not proved but the High Court,\nconsidering certain facts and taking note of subsequent events for which\nthe appellant was found responsible, granted divorce. The High Court\nperceived the acts of the appellant as a reflection of attitude of revenge\nin marriage or for vengeance after the reunion pursuant to the decree for\nrestitution of marriage. The justifiability of the said analysis within the\nparameters of \nSection 13(1)\n of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (for brevity\n“the Act”) is the subject-matter of assail in this appeal, by special\nleave, wherein the judgment and decree dated 11.09.2009 passed by the High\nCourt of Karnataka in MFA No. 9164 of 2004 reversing the decree for\nrestitution of conjugal rights granted in favour of the wife and passing a\ndecree for dissolution of marriage by way of divorce allowing the petition\npreferred by the respondent-husband, is called in question.\n\nThe respondent-husband, an Associate Professor in Ambedkar Medical College,\nKadugondanahalli, Bangalore, filed a petition, M.S. No. 5 of 2001 under\n\nSection 13(1)\n the Act seeking for a decree for judicial separation and\ndissolution of marriage. However, in course of the proceeding the petition\nwas amended abandoning the prayer for judicial separation and converting\nthe petition to one under \nSection 13(1)(ib)\n of the Act seeking dissolution\nof marriage by way of divorce.\n\nIn the petition filed before the Family court, it was averred by the\nrespondent-husband that the marriage between the parties was solemnized in\naccordance with Hindu Rites and customs on 23.11.1994. After the marriage\nthe husband and wife stayed together for one and a half years in the house\nof the father of the husband but from the very first day the appellant-wife\nwas non-cooperative, arrogant and her behaviour towards the family members\nof the husband was unacceptable. Despite the misunderstanding, a male\nchild was born in the wedlock and thereafter, the wife took the child and\nleft the house and chose not to come back to the husband or his family for\na period of three years. It was pleaded that there had been a marital\ndiscord and total non-compatibility, and she had deserted him severing all\nties. It was also alleged that she had left the tender child in the\ncustody of her parents and joined a post graduate course in the Medical\nCollege of Gulbarga. All the efforts by the husband to bring her back\nbecame an exercise in futility inasmuch as the letters written by him were\nnever replied. Despite the non-responsive attitude of the wife, he,\nwithout abandoning the hope for reconciliation for leading a normal married\nlife, went to the house of his in-laws, but her parents ill treated him by\nforcibly throwing him out of the house.\n\nIt was the assertion of the husband that after she completed her course,\nshe started staying with her parents along with the child at Bangalore and\nneither he nor his family members were invited for the naming giving\nceremony of the child. As set forth, the conduct of the wife caused\nimmense mental hurt and trauma, and he suffered unbearable mental agony\nwhen the family members of his wife abused and ill treated him while he had\ngone to pacify her and bring her back to the matrimonial home. All his\nsolicitations and beseechments through letters to have normalcy went in\nvain which compelled him to issue a notice through his counsel but she\nchose not to respond to the same. Under these circumstances, the petition\nwas filed for judicial separation and thereafter, as has been stated\nearlier, prayer was amended seeking dissolution of marriage on the ground\nof desertion since she had deliberately withdrawn from his society.\n\nThe wife filed objections contending, inter alia, that when she was\nresiding in the matrimonial home, the sister and brother-in-law of the\nhusband, who stayed in the opposite house, were frequent visitors and their\ninterference affected the normal stream of life of the couple. They\ninfluenced the husband that he should not allow his wife to prosecute her\nstudies and be kept at home as an unpaid servant of the house. The\nhusband, as pleaded, was torn in conflict as he could not treat the wife in\nthe manner by his sister and brother-in-law had desired and also could not\nopenly express disagreement. At that juncture, as she was in the family\nway, as per the customs, she came to her parental home and by the time the\nchild was born the sister and brother-in-law had been successful in\npoisoning the mind of the husband as a result of which neither he nor his\nrelatives, though properly invited, did not turn up for the naming\nceremony. All her attempts to come back to the matrimonial home did not\nproduce any result since the husband was acting under the ill-advice of his\nsister and brother-in-law. It was put forth that he had without any\nreasonable cause or excuse refused to perform his marital obligations. The\nplea of mental hurt and trauma was controverted on the assertion that she\nhad never treated him with cruelty nor was he summarily thrown out of the\nhouse of her parents.\n\nBe it stated, the wife in the same petition filed an application under\n\nSection 9\n of the Act for restitution of conjugal rights to which an\nobjection was filed by the husband stating, inter alia, that no case had\nbeen made out for restitution of conjugal rights but, on the contrary,\nvexatious allegations had been made. It was further averred that the wife\nhad deserted him for more than five years and she had been harassing him\nconstantly and consistently.\n\nIn support of their respective pleas the husband and wife filed evidence by\nway of affidavit and were cross-examined at length by the other side. On\nbehalf of the husband 12 documents were exhibited as Exts. P-1 to P-12 and\nthe wife examined one witness and exhibited four documents, Exts. R-1 to R-\n\n4.\n\nThe family court formulated the following points for consideration: -\n\n“(1) Whether the petitioner proves that respondent assaulted him for a\ncontinuous period of not less than 2 years immediately proceeding the\npresentation of the petition?\n\nWhether the respondent proves that the petitioner without reasonable excuse\nwithdrawn from the society?\n\nWhether the petitioner is entitled for decree of divorce as prayed for?\n\nWhether the respondent is entitled for decree of restitution of conjugal\nright as prayed for?\n\nWhat order?”\n\nThe learned Principal Judge of the family court, appreciating the oral and\ndocumentary evidence on record came to hold that the material on record\ngave an impression that there was no scuffle between the husband and the\nwife; that even after the birth of the child the husband and his family\nmembers used to visit the wife at her parental home to see the child; that\nthere was no material on record to show that when he went to his in-laws\nhouse to see the child, he was ill-treated in any manner; that after the\nchild was born he had taken the child along with her for vaccination and\nspent sometime; that though the husband and his relatives were invited for\nnaming ceremony of the child, they chose not to attend; that the husband\nwas able to recognize his son from the photograph in Ext. R-2; that the\nplea of the husband that he was not allowed to see the child did not\ndeserve acceptation; that the circumstances did not establish that wife had\nany intention to bring the conjugal relationship to an end but, on the\ncontrary, she was residing in her parents’ house for delivery and then had\nto remain at Gulbarga for prosecuting her higher studies; that while she\nwas studying at Gulbarga, as is evident from Ext. R-4, the husband stayed\nthere for two days, i.e., 27.5.1999 and 28.5.1999; that from the letters\nvide Exts. P-3, P-7, P-9 and P-11 nothing was discernible to the effect\nthat the wife went to Gulbarga for her studies without his permission and\nshe had deserted him; that the husband had not disclosed from what date he\nstopped visiting the house of the wife’s parents after the birth of the\nchild; that the letters written by the husband did not reflect the non-\ncooperative conduct of the wife; that there was no sufficient evidence to\ncome to a definite conclusion that the wife had deserted the husband with\nan intention to bring the matrimonial relationship to an end; that assuming\nthere was desertion yet the same was not for a continuous period of two\nyears immediately preceding the presentation of the petition; that the\nhusband only wrote letters after 15.9.1999 and nothing had been brought on\nrecord to show what steps he had taken for resumption of marital ties with\nthe wife if she had deserted him; that the wife was not allowed to come\nback to the matrimonial home because of intervention of his sister and\nbrother-in-law; that the explanation given by the wife to her non-response\nto the letters was that when she was thinking to reply the petition had\nalready been filed was acceptable; that as the husband was working at\nAmbedkar Medical College in the Department of Biochemistry and wife had\njoined in the Department of Pathology which would show that she was willing\nto join the husband to lead a normal marital life; and that it was the\nhusband who had withdrawn from the society of the wife without any\nreasonable cause. Being of this view, the learned Family Judge dismissed\nthe application for divorce and allowed the application of the wife filed\nunder \nSection 23(a)\n read with \nSection 9\n of the Act for restitution of\nconjugal rights.\n\nAfter the said judgment and decree was passed by the learned Family Judge,\nthe respondent did not prefer an appeal immediately. He waited for the\nwife to join and for the said purpose he wrote letters to her and as there\nwas no response, he sent a notice through his counsel. The wife,\neventually, joined on 22.8.2004 at the matrimonial house being accompanied\nby her relative who was working in the Police Department. As the turn of\nevents would uncurtain, the wife lodged an FIR No. 401/2004 dated\n17.10.2004 at Basaveshwaranagar alleging demand of dowry against the\nhusband, mother and sister as a consequence of which the husband was\narrested being an accused for the offences under Section 498A and 506 read\nwith \nSection 34\n of the Indian Penal Code and also under the provisions of\n\nDowry Prohibition Act\n. He remained in custody for a day until he was\nenlarged on bail. His parents were compelled to hide themselves and moved\nan application under \nSection 438\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure and,\nultimately, availed the benefit of said provision. After all these events\ntook place, the husband preferred an appeal along with application for\ncondonation of delay before the High Court which formed the subject-matter\nof M.F.A. No. 9164/04 (FC). The High Court condoned the delay, took note\nof the grounds urged in the memorandum of appeal, appreciated the\nsubsequent events that reflected the conduct of the wife and opined that\nthe attitude of the wife confirmed that she never had the intention of\nleading a normal married life with the husband and, in fact, she wanted to\nstay separately with the husband and dictate terms which had hurt his\nfeelings. The High Court further came to the conclusion that the husband\nhad made efforts to go to Gulbarga on many an occasion, tried to convince\nthe wife to come back to the matrimonial home, but all his diligent efforts\nmet with miserable failure. As the impugned judgment would reflect, the\nbehaviour of the wife established that she deliberately stayed away from\nthe marital home and intentionally caused mental agony by putting the\nhusband and his family to go through a criminal litigation. That apart,\nthe High Court took the long separation into account and, accordingly, set\naside the judgment and decree for restitution of conjugal rights and passed\na decree for dissolution of marriage between the parties.\n\nWe have heard Mr. Shanth Kumar V. Mohale, learned counsel for the appellant\nand Mr. Balaji Srinivasan, learned counsel for the respondent.\n\nAssailing the legal sustainability of the judgment of the High Court, Mr.\nShanth Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, submitted that\nwhen the petition for divorce was founded solely on the ground of desertion\nand a finding was returned by the family court that the ingredients\nstipulated under \nSection 13(1)(ib)\n of the Act were not satisfied making out\na case of desertion on the part of the wife, the High Court should have\nconcurred with the same and not proceeded to make out a case for the\nrespondent-husband on the foundation of mental cruelty. It is urged by him\nthat the High Court has taken note of subsequent events into consideration\nwithout affording an opportunity to the appellant to controvert the said\nmaterial and that alone makes the decision vulnerable in law. Learned\ncounsel would submit that the High Court has erroneously determined the\nperiod of communication of letters and the silence maintained by the wife\nwhich is factually incorrect and, in fact, the concept of desertion, as is\nunderstood in law, has not been proven by way of adequate evidence but, on\nthe contrary, the analysis of evidence on record by the Family Court goes a\nlong way to show that there was, in fact, no desertion on the part of the\nwife to make out a case for divorce. It is his further submission that the\nHigh Court has opined that the marriage between the parties had\nirretrievably been broken and, therefore, it was requisite to grant a\ndecree for dissolution of marriage by divorce which cannot be a ground for\ngrant of divorce. Learned counsel has placed reliance on the decisions in\n\nLachman Utamchand Kirpalani v. Meena @ Mota\n[1], \nK. Narayanan v. K.\nSreedevi\n[2], \nMohinder Singh v. Harbens Kaur\n[3] and \nSmt. Indira Gangele v.\nShailendra Kumar Gangele\n[4].\n\nMr. Balaji Srinivasan, learned counsel for the respondent-husband, has\nurged that if the petition filed by the husband is read in entirety, it\nwould be clear that the husband had clearly pleaded about the mental hurt\nand trauma that he had suffered because of the treatment meted out to him\nby his wife and her family members. He has drawn our attention to the\nevidence to show that for a long seven and a half years despite the best\nefforts he could not get marital cooperation from his wife and as the High\nCourt has accepted the same, the impugned judgment is flawless. He has\nhighlighted about the non-responsive proclivity of the wife when she chose\nnot to reply to the letters of the husband beseeching her to join his\ncompany while she was staying at Gulbarga. He has also drawn our attention\nto the cross-examination of the husband where he has deposed that after the\ndelivery of the son on 12.1.1998 when she was discharged, he and his mother\nhad gone to bring the wife and the child to their home but she went to her\nparental home and further neither he nor his family members were invited\nfor the naming ceremony which was performed in October, 1998. Learned\ncounsel has drawn our attention to the subsequent events which have been\nbrought on record by way of affidavit as well as the rejoinder filed by the\nappellant-wife to the counter affidavit to highlight the subsequent conduct\nfor the purpose of demonstrating the cruel treatment of the wife. It is\ncanvassed by him that the subsequent events can be taken note of for the\npurpose of mental cruelty by this Court and the decree of divorce granted\nby the High Court should not be disturbed.\n\nTo appreciate the rivalised submissions raised at the Bar, we have\ncarefully perused the petition and the evidence adduced by the parties and\nthe judgment of the Family Court and that of the High Court. The plea that\nwas raised for grant of divorce was under \nSection 13(1)(ib)\n of the Act. It\nprovides for grant of divorce on the ground of desertion for a continuous\nperiod of not less than two year immediately preceding the presentation of\nthe petition. The aforesaid provision stipulates that a husband or wife\nwould be entitled to a dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce if the\nother party has deserted the party seeking the divorce for a continuous\nperiod of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of\nthe petition. Desertion, as a ground for divorce, was inserted to \nSection\n13\n by Act 68/1976. Prior to the amendment it was only a ground for\njudicial separation. Dealing with the concept of desertion, this Court in\n\nSavitri Pandey v. Prem Chandra Pandey\n[5] has ruled thus:-\n\n“Desertion”, for the purpose of seeking divorce under the Act, means the\nintentional permanent forsaking and abandonment of one spouse by the other\nwithout that other’s consent and without reasonable cause. In other words\nit is a total repudiation of the obligations of marriage. Desertion is not\nthe withdrawal from a place but from a state of things. Desertion,\ntherefore, means withdrawing from the matrimonial obligations i.e. not\npermitting or allowing and facilitating the cohabitation between the\nparties. The proof of desertion has to be considered by taking into\nconsideration the concept of marriage which in law legalises the sexual\nrelationship between man and woman in the society for the perpetuation of\nrace, permitting lawful indulgence in passion to prevent licentiousness and\nfor procreation of children. Desertion is not a single act complete in\nitself, it is a continuous course of conduct to be determined under the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. After referring to a host of\nauthorities and the views of various authors, this Court in Bipinchandra\nJaisinghbai Shah v. Prabhavati1 held that if a spouse abandons the other in\na state of temporary passion, for example, anger [pic]or disgust without\nintending permanently to cease cohabitation, it will not amount to\ndesertion.\n\nIn the said case, reference was also made to Lachman Utamchand Kirpalani’s\ncase wherein it has been held that desertion in its essence means the\nintentional permanent forsaking and abandonment of one spouse by the other\nwithout that other’s consent, and without reasonable cause. For the offence\nof desertion so far as the deserting spouse is concerned, two essential\nconditions must be there (1) the factum of separation, and (2) the\nintention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi).\nSimilarly two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is\nconcerned: (1) the absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving\nreasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the\nnecessary intention aforesaid. For holding desertion as proved the\ninference may be drawn from certain facts which may not in another case be\ncapable of leading to the same inference; that is to say the facts have to\nbe viewed as to the purpose which is revealed by those acts or by conduct\nand expression of intention, both anterior and subsequent to the actual\nacts of separation.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Family Court, on the basis of the evidence brought\non record, has recorded a finding that there was no desertion for a\ncontinuous period of two years. The High Court has reversed it by\nemphasizing on certain aspects of conduct. Analysing the evidence, we are\nof the considered opinion that it is not established that the appellant-\nwife had deserted the husband for a continuous period of not less than two\nyears immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. It is\nbecause the petition was presented in the year 2001 and during the cross-\nexamination of the husband it has been admitted by him that he had gone to\nGulbarga in May, 1999 for two days. The Family Court, on the basis of\nmaterial brought on record, has opined that there is no sufficient evidence\nto come to a definite conclusion that the wife deserted him with intention\nto bring the matrimonial relationship to an end and further the period of\ntwo years was not completed. The High Court, as it seems to us, has not\ndealt with this aspect in an appropriate manner and opined that the wife\nhad no intention to lead a normal married life with the husband.\nTherefore, the allegation of desertion, as enshrined under \nSection\n13(1)(ib)\n has not been established. The finding on that score as recorded\nby the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, deserves to be affirmed and\nwe so do.\n\nPresently to the factual matrix in entirety and the subsequent events. We\nare absolutely conscious that the relief of dissolution of marriage was\nsought on the ground of desertion. The submission of the learned counsel\nfor the appellant is that neither subsequent events nor the plea of cruelty\ncould have been considered. There is no cavil over the fact that the\npetition was filed under \nSection 13(1)(ib)\n. However, on a perusal of the\npetition it transpires that there are assertions of ill-treatment, mental\nagony and torture suffered by the husband.\n\nFirst we intend to state the subsequent events. As has been narrated\nearlier, after the application of the wife was allowed granting restitution\nof conjugal rights, the husband communicated to her to join him, but she\nchose not to join him immediately and thereafter went to the matrimonial\nhome along with a relative who is a police officer. After she stayed for a\nbrief period at the matrimonial home, she left her husband and thereafter\nlodged FIR No. 401/2004 on 17.10.2004 for the offences under \nSections 498A\n\nand \n506\n/\n34\n of the Indian Penal Code and the provisions under \nDowry\nProhibition Act, 1961\n against the husband, his mother and the sister.\nBecause of the FIR the husband was arrested and remained in custody for a\nday. The ladies availed the benefit of anticipatory bail. The learned\ntrial Magistrate, as we find, recorded a judgment of acquittal. Against\nthe judgment of acquittal, the appellant preferred an appeal before the\nHigh Court after obtaining special leave which was ultimately dismissed as\nwithdrawn since in the meantime the State had preferred an appeal before\nthe Court of Session. At this juncture, we make it absolutely clear that\nwe will not advert to the legal tenability of the judgment of acquittal as\nthe appeal, as we have been apprised, is sub-judice. However, we take note\nof certain aspects which have been taken note of by the High Court and also\nbrought on record for a different purpose.\n\nThe seminal question that has to be addressed is whether under these\ncircumstances the decree for divorce granted by the High Court should be\ninterfered with. We must immediately state that the High Court has referred\nto certain grounds stated in the memorandum of appeal and taken note of\ncertain subsequent facts. We accept the submission of the learned counsel\nfor the appellant that the grounds stated in the memorandum of appeal which\nwere not established by way of evidence could not have been pressed into\nservice or taken aid of. But, it needs no special emphasis to state that\nthe subsequent conduct of the wife can be taken into consideration. It\nsettled in law that subsequent facts under certain circumstances can be\ntaken into consideration.\n\nIn \nA. Jayachandra v. Aneel Kaur\n[6] it has been held thus: -\n\n“If acts subsequent to the filing of the divorce petition can be looked\ninto to infer condonation of the aberrations, acts subsequent to the filing\nof the petition can be taken note of to show a pattern in the behaviour and\nconduct.”\n\nIn \nSuman Kapur v. Sudhir Kapur\n[7] this Court had accepted what the High\nCourt had taken note of despite the fact that it was a subsequent event.\nIt is necessary to reproduce the necessary paragraphs from \nthe said\ndecision\n to perceive the approach of this Court: -\n\n“46. The High Court further noted that the appellant wife sent a notice\nthrough her advocate to the respondent husband during the pendency of\nmediation proceedings in the High Court wherein she alleged that the\nrespondent was having another wife in USA whose identity was concealed.\nThis was based on the fact that in his income tax return, the husband\nmentioned the social security number of his wife as 476-15-6010, a number\nwhich did not belong to the appellant wife, but to some American lady\n(Sarah Awegtalewis).\n\n[pic]47. The High Court, however, recorded a finding of fact accepting the\nexplanation of the husband that there was merely a typographical error in\ngiving social security number allotted to the appellant which was 476-15-\n6030. According to the High Court, taking undue advantage of the error in\nsocial security number, the appellant wife had gone to the extent of making\nserious allegation that the respondent had married an American woman whose\nsocial security number was wrongly typed in the income tax return of the\nrespondent husband.”\n\nFrom the acceptance of the reasons of the High Court by this Court, it is\nquite clear that subsequent events which are established on the basis of\nnon-disputed material brought on record can be taken into consideration.\nHaving held that, the question would be whether a decree for divorce on the\nground of mental cruelty can be granted. We have already opined that the\nground of desertion has not been proved. Having not accepted the ground of\ndesertion, the two issues that remain for consideration whether the issue\nof mental cruelty deserves to be accepted in the obtaining factual matrix\nin the absence of a prayer in the relief clause, and further whether the\nsituation has become such that it can be held that under the existing\nfactual scenario it would not be proper to keep the marriage ties alive.\nLearned counsel for the appellant has urged with vehemence that when\ndissolution of marriage was sought on the ground of desertion alone, the\nissue of mental cruelty can neither be raised nor can be addressed to.\nRegard being had to the said submission, we are constrained to pose the\nquestion whether in a case of the present nature we should require the\nrespondent-husband to amend the petition and direct the learned Family\nJudge to consider the issue of mental cruelty or we should ignore the\nfetter of technicality and consider the pleadings and evidence brought on\nrecord as well as the subsequent facts which are incontrovertible so that\nthe lis is put to rest. In our considered opinion the issue of mental\ncruelty should be addressed to by this Court for the sake of doing complete\njustice. We think, it is the bounden duty of this Court to do so and not\nto leave the parties to fight the battle afresh after expiry of thirteen\nyears of litigation. Dealing with the plea of mental cruelty which is\nperceptible from the material on record would not affect any substantive\nright of the appellant. It would be only condoning a minor technical\naspect. Administration of justice provokes our judicial conscience that it\nis a fit case where the plentitude of power conferred on this Court under\n\nArticle 142\n deserves to be invoked, more so, when the ground is statutorily\npermissible. By such exercise we are certain that it would neither be\nsupplanting the substantive law nor would it be building a structure which\ndoes not exist. It would be logical to do so and illogical to refrain from\ndoing so.\n\nBefore we proceed to deal with the issue of mental cruelty, it is\nappropriate to state how the said concept has been viewed by this Court.\n\nIn \nVinit Saxena v. Pankaj Pandit\n[8], while dealing with the issue of mental\ncruelty, the Court held as follows: -\n\n“31. It is settled by a catena of decisions that mental cruelty can cause\neven more serious injury than the physical harm and create in the mind of\nthe injured appellant such apprehension as is contemplated in the section.\nIt is to be determined on whole facts of the case and the matrimonial\nrelations between the spouses. To amount to cruelty, there must be such\nwilful treatment of the party which caused suffering in body or mind either\nas an actual fact or by way of apprehension in such a manner as to render\nthe continued living together of spouses harmful or injurious having regard\nto the circumstances of the case.\n\n Xxx xxx xxx\n\n35. Each case depends on its own facts and must be judged on these facts.\n\nThe concept of cruelty has varied from time to time, from place to place\nand from individual to individual in its application according to social\nstatus of the persons involved and their economic conditions and other\nmatters. The question whether the act complained of was a cruel act is to\nbe determined from the whole facts and the matrimonial relations between\nthe parties. \nIn this connection, the culture, temperament and status in\nlife and many other things are the factors which have to be considered.”\n\nIn \nSamar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh\n[9], this Court has given certain illustrative\nexamples wherefrom inference of mental cruelty can be drawn. The Court\nitself has observed that they are illustrative and not exhaustive. We\nthink it appropriate to reproduce some of the illustrations: -\n\n“(i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of the parties, acute\nmental pain, agony and suffering as would not make possible for the parties\nto live with each other could come within the broad parameters of mental\ncruelty.\n\n(ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial life of the\nparties, it becomes abundantly clear that situation is such that the\nwronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and\ncontinue to live with other party.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n(iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep anguish,\ndisappointment, frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of other\nfor a long time may lead to mental cruelty.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n(vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, indifference or\ntotal departure from the normal standard of conjugal kindness causing\ninjury to mental health or deriving sadistic pleasure can also amount to\nmental cruelty.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n (x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated\ninstances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill\nconduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where [pic]the\nrelationship has deteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and\nbehaviour of a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely difficult to\nlive with the other party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n (xiv) Where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may\nfairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The\nmarriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to\nsever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of\nmarriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and\nemotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental\ncruelty.”\n\nIn the said case the Court has also observed thus: -\n\n“99. … The human mind is extremely complex and human behaviour is equally\ncomplicated. Similarly human ingenuity has no bound, therefore, to\nassimilate the entire human behaviour in one definition is almost\nimpossible. What is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in the\nother case. The concept of cruelty differs from person to person depending\nupon his upbringing, level of sensitivity, educational, family and cultural\nbackground, financial position, social status, customs, traditions,\nreligious beliefs, human values and their value system.\n\n100. Apart from this, the concept of mental cruelty cannot remain static;\n\nit is bound to change with the passage of time, impact of modern culture\nthrough print and electronic media and value system, etc. etc. What may be\nmental cruelty now may not remain a mental cruelty after a passage of time\nor vice versa. There can never be any straitjacket formula or fixed\nparameters for determining mental cruelty in matrimonial matters. The\nprudent and appropriate way to adjudicate the case would be to evaluate it\non its peculiar facts and circumstances….”\n\nIn Vishwanath Agrawal, s/o Sitaram Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal[10],\nwhile dealing with mental cruelty, it has been opined thus: -\n\n“22. The expression “cruelty” has an inseparable nexus with human conduct\nor human behaviour. It is always dependent upon the social strata or the\nmilieu to which the parties belong, their ways of life, relationship,\ntemperaments and emotions that have been conditioned by their social\nstatus.”\n\nIn the said case, analyzing the subsequent events and the conduct of the\nwife, who was responsible for publication in a newspaper certain\nhumiliating aspects about the husband, the Court held as follows: -\n\n“In our considered opinion, a normal reasonable man is bound to feel the\nsting and the pungency. The conduct and circumstances make it graphically\nclear that the respondent wife had really humiliated him and caused mental\ncruelty. Her conduct clearly exposits that it has resulted in causing agony\nand anguish in the mind of the husband. She had publicised in the\nnewspapers that he was a womaniser and a drunkard. She had made wild\nallegations about his character. She had made an effort to prosecute him in\ncriminal litigations which she had failed to prove. The feeling of deep\nanguish, disappointment, agony and frustration of the husband is obvious.”\n\nIn \nU. Sree v. U. Srinivas\n[11], the Court, taking note of the deposition of\nthe husband that the wife had consistently ill treated him inasmuch as she\nhad shown her immense dislike towards his “sadhna” in music and had\nexhibited total indifference to him, observed as follows: -\n“It has graphically been demonstrated that she had not shown the slightest\nconcern for the public image of her husband on many an occasion by putting\nhim in a situation of embarrassment leading to humiliation. She has made\nwild allegations about the conspiracy in the family of her husband to get\nhim remarried for the greed of dowry and there is no iota of evidence on\nrecord to substantiate the same.\n \nThis, in fact, is an aspersion not only on\nthe character of the husband but also a maladroit effort to malign the\nreputation of the family.”\n\nIn \nK. Srinivas Rao v. D.A. Deepa\n[12], while dealing with the instances of\nmental cruelty, the court opined that to the illustrations given in the\ncase of Samar Ghosh certain other illustrations could be added. We think\nit seemly to reproduce the observations: -\n\n“Making unfounded indecent defamatory allegations against the spouse or his\nor her relatives in the pleadings, filing of complaints or issuing notices\nor news items which may have adverse impact on the business prospect or the\njob of the spouse and filing repeated false complaints and cases in the\ncourt against the spouse would, in the facts of a case, amount to causing\nmental cruelty to the other spouse.”\n\nPresently, we shall advert to the material on record. It is luminous from\nit that the wife has made allegations that the sister and brother-in-law of\nthe husband used to interfere in the day-to-day affairs of the husband and\nhe was caught in conflict. The said aspect has really not been proven. It\nhas been brought on record that the sister and brother-in-law are highly\neducated and nothing has been suggested to the husband in the cross-\nexamination that he was pressurized by his sister in any manner whatsoever.\n It is her allegation that the sister and brother-in-law of the husband\nwere pressurizing him not to allow the wife to prosecute higher studies and\nto keep her as an unpaid servant in the house. On a studied evaluation of\nthe evidence and the material brought on record it is demonstrable that the\nwife herself has admitted that the husband had given his consent for her\nhigher education and, in fact, assisted her. Thus, the aforesaid\nallegation has not been proven. The allegation that the husband was\ninstigated to keep her at home as an unpaid servant is quite a disturbing\nallegation when viewed from the spectrum of gender sensitivity and any\nsensitive person would be hurt when his behavior has remotely not reflected\nthat attitude. The second aspect which has surfaced from the evidence is\nthat the wife had gone to the parental home for delivery and therefrom she\nwent to the hospital where she gave birth to a male child. However, as the\nevidence would show, the husband despite all his co-operation as a father,\nwhen had gone to the hospital to bring the wife and child to his house, she\nalong with the child had gone to her parental house. This aspect of the\nevidence has gone totally unchallenged. Perceived from a social point of\nview, it reflects the egocentric attitude of the wife and her non-concern\nhow such an act is likely to hurt the father of the child. The next thing\nthat has come in evidence is that the respondent was not invited at the\ntime of naming ceremony. He has categorically disputed the suggestion that\nhe and his family members were invited to the ceremony. It is interesting\nto note that a suggestion has been given that they did not attend the\nceremony as in the invitation card the names of the parents of the husband\nhad not been printed. It has been asserted by the husband that the said\nincident had caused him tremendous mental pain. View from a different\nangle, it tantamounts to totally ignoring the family of the husband.\n\nAnother incident deserves to be noted. The wife went to Gulbarga to join\nher studies and the husband was not aware of it and only come to know when\none professor told about it. Thereafter he went to Gulbarga and stayed in\na hotel and met the wife in the hostel on both the days. Despite his\nrequest to come to the house she showed disinclination. When he enquired\nabout the child, he was told that the child was in her mother’s house.\nThese are the incidents which are antecedent to the filing of the petition.\n\nWe have already stated the legal position that subsequent events can be\ntaken note of. After the judgment and decree was passed by the learned\nFamily Judge, the husband sent a notice through his counsel dated 14.7.2004\nand intimated her as follows: -\n\n“According to the operative portion of the order, my client has to welcome\nyou to join him with the child within three months which please note.\n\n My client’s address is Dr. B.V. Ravi, M.D., residing in No. 428. 2nd\nAcross, 6th Main, 3rd Stage, 3rd Block, Basaveshwaranagar, Bangalore-79 and\nhis Telephone No. 23229865. In obedience to the Hon’ble Court order, you\ncalled upon to join Dr. B.V. Ravi to the above said address any day after\n18th of July, 2004, as this period upto 17th is inauspicious because of\n“Ashada”.”\n\nAs it appears, she did not join and the husband was compelled to send a\ntelegram. Thereafter, on 13.8.2004 a reply was sent on her behalf that she\nwould be joining after 15.8.2004 but the exact date was not intimated.\nThereafter, on 14.8.2004 a reply was sent to the legal notice dated\n\n14.7.2004 sent by the husband. It is appropriate to reproduce the relevant\ntwo paragraphs: -\n\n“In this context, we hereby inform you that our client will be coming to\njoin your client in the above said address along with the child on Sunday\nthe 22nd August 2004 as the auspicious NIJASHRAVANA MONTH commences from\n16th August 2004.\n\n Further our client expects reasonable amount of care and cordiality\nfrom your client’s side. Please ensure the same.”\n\nThe purpose of referring to these communications is that despite obtaining\ndecree for restitution of conjugal rights the wife waited till the last day\nof the expiration of the period as per the decree to join the husband.\nThere may be no legal fallacy, but the attitude gets reflected. The reply\nalso states that there is expectation of reasonable amount of care and\ncordiality. This reflects both, a sense of doubt and a hidden threat. As\nthe facts unfurl, the wife stays for two months and then leaves the\nmatrimonial home and lodges the first information report against the\nhusband and his mother and sister for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 498A\n, \n506\n/\n34\n of the Indian Penal Code and under the provisions of\n\nDowry Prohibition Act\n. The husband suffers a day’s custody and the mother\nand the sister availed anticipatory bail.\n\nThe High Court has taken note of all these aspects and held that the wife\nhas no intention to lead a normal marital life. That apart, the High Court\nhas returned a finding that the marriage has irretrievably been broken\ndown. Of course, such an observation has been made on the ground of\nconduct. This Court in certain cases, namely, \nG.V.N. Kameswara Rao v. G.\nJabilli\n[13], \nParveen Mehta v. Inderjit Mehta\n[14], \nVijayakumar R. Bhate v.\nNeela Vijayakumar Bhate\n[15], \nDurga Prasanna Tripathy v. Arundhati\nTripathy\n[16], \nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli\n[17] and \nSamar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh\n\n(supra), has invoked the principle of irretrievably breaking down of\nmarriage.\n\nFor the present, we shall restrict our delineation to the issue whether the\naforesaid acts would constitute mental cruelty. We have already referred\nto few authorities to indicate what the concept of mental cruelty means.\nMental cruelty and its effect cannot be stated with arithmetical\nexactitude. It varies from individual to individual, from society to\nsociety and also depends on the status of the persons. What would be a\nmental cruelty in the life of two individuals belonging to particular\nstrata of the society may not amount to mental cruelty in respect of\nanother couple belonging to a different stratum of society. The agonized\nfeeling or for that matter a sense of disappointment can take place by\ncertain acts causing a grievous dent at the mental level. The inference\nhas to be drawn from the attending circumstances. As we have enumerated\nthe incidents, we are disposed to think that the husband has reasons to\nfeel that he has been humiliated, for allegations have been made against\nhim which are not correct; his relatives have been dragged into the\nmatrimonial controversy, the assertions in the written statement depict him\nas if he had tacitly conceded to have harboured notions of gender\ninsensitivity or some kind of male chauvinism, his parents and he are\nignored in the naming ceremony of the son, and he comes to learn from\nothers that the wife had gone to Gulbarga to prosecute her studies. That\napart, the communications, after the decree for restitution of conjugal\nrights, indicate the attitude of the wife as if she is playing a game of\nChess. The launching of criminal prosecution can be perceived from the\nspectrum of conduct. The learned Magistrate has recorded the judgment of\nacquittal. The wife had preferred an appeal before the High Court after\nobtaining leave. After the State Government prefers an appeal in the Court\nof Session, she chooses to withdraw the appeal. But she intends, as the\npleadings would show, that the case should reach the logical conclusion.\nThis conduct manifestly shows the widening of the rift between the parties.\n It has only increased the bitterness. In such a situation, the husband is\nlikely to lament in every breath and the vibrancy of life melts to give way\nto sad story of life.\n\nFrom this kind of attitude and treatment it can be inferred that the\nhusband has been treated with mental cruelty and definitely he has faced\nignominy being an Associate Professor in a Government Medical College.\nWhen one enjoys social status working in a Government hospital, this\nhumiliation affects the reputation. That apart, it can be well imagined\nthe slight he might be facing. In fact, the chain of events might have\ncompelled him to go through the whole gamut of emotions. It certainly must\nhave hurt his self-respect and human sensibility. The sanguine concept of\nmarriage presumably has become illusory and it would not be inapposite to\nsay that the wife has shown anaemic emotional disposition to the husband.\nTherefore, the decree of divorce granted by the High Court deserves to be\naffirmed singularly on the ground of mental cruelty.\n\nPresently, we shall proceed to deal with grant of maintenance. Both the\nappellant and the respondent are doctors and have their respective jobs.\nThe son is hardly sixteen years old and definitely would require financial\nsupport for education and other supportive things to lead a life befitting\nhis social status. The High Court, while granting a decree for divorce\nshould have adverted to it. However, we do not think it appropriate to\nkeep anything alive in this regard between the parties. The controversy is\nto be put to rest on this score also. Considering the totality of\ncircumstances, the status the appellant enjoys and the strata to which the\nparties belong, it becomes the bounden duty of the respondent to provide\nfor maintenance and education for the son who is sixteen years old. At\nthis juncture, we may note that a proceeding was initiated before the\nlearned Principal Judge, Family Court, Bangalore and in the said proceeding\nthe learned Principal Judge passed the following order: -\n\n “Matter is settled before the mediation centre where in parties have\nentered into a memorandum of settlement.\n\n Contents of the Memorandum of Settlement are admitted by the Parties.\n Court is satisfied that the same is voluntary.\n\n As per the terms of settlement para 5 clause (i) petitioner has\ndeposited Rs.3,00,000/- in the name of minor child in Karnataka Bank, copy\nof fixed deposit receipt and R.D. Account pass book are filed along with\nmemo. Hence petition is allowed in terms of settlement.\n\n Memorandum of settlement shall be a part of the decree.”\n\nLearned counsel for the respondent would submit that the amount has been\nsettled. Though there has been a settlement of Rs.3,00,000/- yet that was\nat a different time and under different circumstances. The present appeal\nwas pending. The duty of this Court is to see that the young son born in\nthe wedlock must get acceptable comfort as well as proper education. It is\nthe duty of the Court also to see that a minor son should not live in\ndiscomfort or should be deprived of requisite modern education. We are\nconscious, the appellant is earning but that does not necessarily mean that\nthe father should be absolved of his liability. Regard being had to the\nsocial status and strata and the concept of effective availing of education\nwe fix a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- (twenty five lacs) excluding the amount\nalready paid towards the maintenance and education of the son. The said\namount shall be deposited by the respondent within a period of six months\nbefore the learned Principal Judge, Family Court at Bangalore and the\namount shall be kept in a fixed deposit in a nationalized bank in the joint\naccount of the appellant and the minor son so that she can draw quarterly\ninterest and expend on her son. After the son attains majority the joint\naccount shall continue and they would be at liberty to draw the amount for\nthe education or any urgent need of the son.\n\nWith the aforesaid directions, we affirm the decree for divorce passed by\nthe High Court. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly but without any\norder as to costs.\n\n .....................................................J.\n [Sudhansu Jyoti Mukhopadhaya]\n\n .....................................................J.\n [Dipak Misra]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nJune 30, 2014.\n\n-----------------------\n\n[1] AIR 1964 SC 40\n[2] AIR 1990 Ker 151\n[3] AIR 1992 P&H 8\n[4] AIR 1993 MP 59\n[5] (2002) 2 SCC 73\n[6] (2005) 2 SCC 22\n[7] (2009) 1 SCC 422\n[8] (2006) 3 SCC 778\n[9] (2007) 4 SCC 511\n[10] (2012) 7 SCC 288\n[11] (2013) 2 SCC 114\n[12] (2013) 5 SCC 226\n[13] (2002) 2 SCC 296\n[14] (2002) 5 SCC 706\n[15] (2003) 6 SCC 334\n[16] (2005) 7 SCC 353\n[17] (2006) 4 SCC 558\n\n-----------------------\n\n41",

In other words\nit is a total repudiation of the obligations of marriage. Desertion is not\nthe withdrawal from a place but from a state of things. Desertion,\ntherefore, means withdrawing from the matrimonial obligations i.e. not\npermitting or allowing and facilitating the cohabitation between the\nparties. The proof of desertion has to be considered by taking into\nconsideration the concept of marriage which in law legalises the sexual\nrelationship between man and woman in the society for the perpetuation of\nrace, permitting lawful indulgence in passion to prevent licentiousness and\nfor procreation of children. Desertion is not a single act complete in\nitself, it is a continuous course of conduct to be determined under the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. After referring to a host of\nauthorities and the views of various authors, this Court in Bipinchandra\nJaisinghbai Shah v. Prabhavati1 held that if a spouse abandons the other in\na state of temporary passion, for example, anger [pic]or disgust without\nintending permanently to cease cohabitation, it will not amount to\ndesertion."

For the offence\nof desertion so far as the deserting spouse is concerned, two essential\nconditions must be there (1) the factum of separation, and (2) the\nintention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi).\nSimilarly two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is\nconcerned: (1) the absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving\nreasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the\nnecessary intention aforesaid. For holding desertion as proved the\ninference may be drawn from certain facts which may not in another case be\ncapable of leading to the same inference; that is to say the facts have to\nbe viewed as to the purpose which is revealed by those acts or by conduct\nand expression of intention, both anterior and subsequent to the actual\nacts of separation."

It is luminous from\nit that the wife has made allegations that the sister and brother-in-law of\nthe husband used to interfere in the day-to-day affairs of the husband and\nhe was caught in conflict. The said aspect has really not been proven. It\nhas been brought on record that the sister and brother-in-law are highly\neducated and nothing has been suggested to the husband in the cross-\nexamination that he was pressurized by his sister in any manner whatsoever.\n It is her allegation that the sister and brother-in-law of the husband\nwere pressurizing him not to allow the wife to prosecute higher studies and\nto keep her as an unpaid servant in the house. On a studied evaluation of\nthe evidence and the material brought on record it is demonstrable that the\nwife herself has admitted that the husband had given his consent for her\nhigher education and, in fact, assisted her. Thus, the aforesaid\nallegation has not been proven. The allegation that the husband was\ninstigated to keep her at home as an unpaid servant is quite a disturbing\nallegation when viewed from the spectrum of gender sensitivity and any\nsensitive person would be hurt when his behavior has remotely not reflected\nthat attitude. The second aspect which has surfaced from the evidence is\nthat the wife had gone to the parental home for delivery and therefrom she\nwent to the hospital where she gave birth to a male child. However, as the\nevidence would show, the husband despite all his co-operation as a father,\nwhen had gone to the hospital to bring the wife and child to his house, she\nalong with the child had gone to her parental house. This aspect of the\nevidence has gone totally unchallenged. Perceived from a social point of\nview, it reflects the egocentric attitude of the wife and her non-concern\nhow such an act is likely to hurt the father of the child. The next thing\nthat has come in evidence is that the respondent was not invited at the\ntime of naming ceremony. He has categorically disputed the suggestion that\nhe and his family members were invited to the ceremony. It is interesting\nto note that a suggestion has been given that they did not attend the\nceremony as in the invitation card the names of the parents of the husband\nhad not been printed. It has been asserted by the husband that the said\nincident had caused him tremendous mental pain. View from a different\nangle, it tantamounts to totally ignoring the family of the husband."

      "text": "For the present, we shall restrict our delineation to the issue whether the\naforesaid acts would constitute mental cruelty. We have already referred\nto few authorities to indicate what the concept of mental cruelty means.\nMental cruelty and its effect cannot be stated with arithmetical\nexactitude. It varies from individual to individual, from society to\nsociety and also depends on the status of the persons. What would be a\nmental cruelty in the life of two individuals belonging to particular\nstrata of the society may not amount to mental cruelty in respect of\nanother couple belonging to a different stratum of society. The agonized\nfeeling or for that matter a sense of disappointment can take place by\ncertain acts causing a grievous dent at the mental level. The inference\nhas to be drawn from the attending circumstances. As we have enumerated\nthe incidents, we are disposed to think that the husband has reasons to\nfeel that he has been humiliated, for allegations have been made against\nhim which are not correct; his relatives have been dragged into the\nmatrimonial controversy, the assertions in the written statement depict him\nas if he had tacitly conceded to have harboured notions of gender\ninsensitivity or some kind of male chauvinism, his parents and he are\nignored in the naming ceremony of the son, and he comes to learn from\nothers that the wife had gone to Gulbarga to prosecute her studies. That\napart, the communications, after the decree for restitution of conjugal\nrights, indicate the attitude of the wife as if she is playing a game of\nChess. The launching of criminal prosecution can be perceived from the\nspectrum of conduct. The learned Magistrate has recorded the judgment of\nacquittal. The wife had preferred an appeal before the High Court after\nobtaining leave. After the State Government prefers an appeal in the Court\nof Session, she chooses to withdraw the appeal. But she intends, as the\npleadings would show, that the case should reach the logical conclusion.\nThis conduct manifestly shows the widening of the rift between the parties.\n It has only increased the bitterness. In such a situation, the husband is\nlikely to lament in every breath and the vibrancy of life melts to give way\nto sad story of life."

That apart, it can be well imagined\nthe slight he might be facing. In fact, the chain of events might have\ncompelled him to go through the whole gamut of emotions. It certainly must\nhave hurt his self-respect and human sensibility. The sanguine concept of\nmarriage presumably has become illusory and it would not be inapposite to\nsay that the wife has shown anaemic emotional disposition to the husband.\nTherefore, the decree of divorce granted by the High Court deserves to be\naffirmed singularly on the ground of mental cruelty."
