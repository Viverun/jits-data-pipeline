Learned\ncounsels for the State as also for private opposite parties are present. On\nthe earlier occasion also, no one had appeared for the petitioner in spite of\nrepeated calls, as such the case was adjourned for giving an opportunity to\nthe learned counsel. Today also no one has appeared for the petitioner in\nspite of repeated calls. As such, I have gone through the record.\n\nThis revision application is directed against the order dated\n09.02.2005 passed by Sri Krishna Murari Gupta, learned Additional Sessions\nJudge, Fast Track Court-II, Garhwa, in Criminal Rev. No. 189 of 2001,\nwhereby the Court below allowed the revision, giving discretion to the Court\nof S.D.M. Garhwa to pass necessary orders by invoking or exercising the\npower u/s 311 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nIt appears from the impugned order that a proceeding\nu/s 145\nCr.P.C.\nwas going on between the parties in the Court of S.D.M., Garhwa, in Misc.\nCase No. 173 of 1997 and an order was passed on 29.11.2011, asking the\nNotary Public to appear before the Court on 05.12.2001 with the affidavit\nregister.\n\nThe said order was challenged in the Revisional Court below and the\nCourt below found that the said order was not passed in exercise of the\npower\nu/s 311\nof the Cr.P.C. The Court below also took into consideration the\nfact that such applications were filed earlier, which were rejected by the\nS.D.M. Garhwa. The Revisional Court below allowed the revision application\nand set aside the impugned order, but gave the option to the learned S.D.M.,\nGarhwa to invoke the power\nu/s 311\nof the Cr.P.C. if the evidence of the\nNotary Public appeared to be essential for just decision of the case and with\nthis observation the Criminal Revision was allowed.\n\nI do not find any illegality and / or irregularity in the impugned order,\nworth interference in the revisional jurisdiction. There is no merit in this\napplication, which is accordingly, dismissed. Let the Lower Court Record be\nsent back forthwith.\n\n(H.C.Mishra, J.)\nD.S.\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI\n\nCr.

Case No. 1693 of 2011, whereby the\nCourt below has rejected the application filed by the petitioner for release\nof the seized iron scrap in connection with this case in favour of the\npetitioner.\n\nThe impugned order shows that the petitioner had produced the\ndocuments with respect to the purchase of the iron scrap on which a report\nwas called for from the concerned police station. The Court below however,\nupon getting the report of the concerned police station, opined that the\nInvestigating Officer had not verified the genuineness of the documents\nthough the Investigating Officer had stated that on the basis of the cash\nmemo produced by the accused petitioner it had transpired that the\npetitioner had purchased the iron scrap from the dealers.\n\nIn view of the fact that the said report was not given by the\nInvestigating Officer after verifying the genuineness of the documents of\nthe seized iron scrap, the Court below ought to have directed the\nInvestigating Officer to submit the report after proper verification about the\ngenuineness of the documents and to have disposed of the application\nupon getting the report.\n\nAs such, the impugned order dated 23.01.2012 passed by Sri K. K.\nJha, learned Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad, in Chirkunda P.S. Case No. 96 of\n2011, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 1693 of 2011, is hereby, set aside\nand it is directed that the Court below shall direct the Officer Incharge of\nthe police station to submit the report after proper verification of the\ndocuments produced by the petitioner and the Court below shall pass the\norder afresh upon getting the verification report from the police station.\n\nThis revision application is accordingly, allowed with the directions as\nabove.\n\n(H.C.Mishra, J.)\nD.S.\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI\n\nCr. Rev. No. 85 of 2012\n\n-------\n\nShambhu Nath Agarwal ..... Petitioner\n\n-Versus-\n\nThe State of Jharkhand ..... Opposite Party\n\n-------\n\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE H.C.MISHRA\n\n-------\n\nFor the Petitioner: : M/s.A.K.Chaturvedi\nFor the State: : M/s. Ravi Prakash, A.P.P.\n\n-------\n\n02/ 21.09.2012. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\ncounsel for the State.\n\nThe petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 20.9.2011\npassed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Simdega, in\nSimdega P.S. Case No. 17 of 2005, corresponding to G.R. No. 58 of\n2005, whereby the application filed by the petitioner for release of\nthe truck in question in favour of the petitioner was rejected by the\nCourt below stating that no document was produced by the\npetitioner with respect to the seized truck.\n\nIt appears that the a truck was seized by the police, as it was\nfound with 225 bags of wheat and Simdega P.S. Case No. 17 of 2005,\ncorresponding to G.R. No. 58 of 2005 was registered for the offence\nu/s 414, 120(B) of the\nIndian Penal Code\nand\nSection 7\nof the\nEssential Commodities Act. The son of the petitioner was also made\naccused in the case.\n\nIt appears from the impugned order that a confiscation\nproceeding with respect to the truck in question was initiated and\nthe truck was confiscated by the order of the D.C. Simdega. The said\nconfiscation of the truck was challanged before the Sessions Judge\nSimdega, and the confiscation of the truck was set aside. It also\nappears from the impugned order that the order taking cognizance\nwas also challenged by the son of the petitioner, who was an\naccused in the case, and the order taking cognizance was also set\naside and the case has been dropped against the son of the\npetitioner.\n\nThe petitioner, claiming himself to be the owner of the truck,\nfiled the application for the release of the truck in question stating\nthat the original documents were seized along with the truck and he\nhad no documents left with him. His application was rejected by the\nCourt below by the impugned order dated 20.9.2011.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner had drawn the attention of\nthis Court towards Annexure-5, which appears to be the copy of a\nreport called for by the Officer Incharge of Simdega Police Station,\nmentioning that there was no document with respect to the truck in\n\n-2-\n\nquestion and asking the District Transport Officer, Ranchi, to report\nabout the ownership of the truck and it appears that the District\nTransport Officer, Ranchi, had reported that the truck belonged to\nthe petitioner. However, it appears that this document has also not\nbeen discussed in the impugned order.\n\nIn view of the fact that the original documents of the truck are\nnot available, in the peculiar facts of this case, I am of the\nconsidered view that the Court below should have taken into\nconsideration the report of the District Transport Officer, Ranchi, if\nany, available on the record, or aught to have called for a fresh\nreport from the District Transport Officer, Ranchi, and to have\npassed the appropriate order in accordance with law. It goes without\nsaying that if the ownership of the truck is found to be with the\npetitioner, the truck should be released in favour of the petitioner, as\nthe criminal case as well as the confiscation proceeding, have\nalready been dropped.\n\nWith these directions, the impugned order dated 20.9.2011\npassed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Simdega, in\nSimdega P.S. Case No. 17 of 2005, corresponding to G.R. No. 58 of\n2005, is hereby set aside and the Court below is directed to pass the\norder afresh in view of the directions as above. This revision\napplication is accordingly, allowed with the directions as above.\n\n(H.C.Mishra, J.)\nD.S.",
