No.17 of 1991. After having purchased, on 26.07.2013,\n\nthe 2nd respondent-A.Madhu sold the property measuring an extent of 1.36\n\n2 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nAcres of land comprised in S.No.679/8B; 1.99 Acres of land comprised in\n\nS.No.679/1 and 0.42 cents of land comprised in S.No.679/4 situated at\n\nSunjalnatham village to one D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy\n\nvide Doc.No.361 of 2013. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu, the\n\noriginal owner executed a rectification deed dated 31.08.2015 vide Doc.\n\nNo.3035/2015 in favour of the said D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and\n\nP.K.Duraisamy to rectify the mistake in respect of the survey number for 1.36\n\nacres of land. According to the rectification deed, instead of S.NO.679/8A, it\n\nwas wrongly typed out as S.No.679/8B.\n\n2.2 Thereafter, one I.Veerasamy, a practising Advocate as plaintiff, filed\n\na suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 against his own brother-A.Madhu, the\n\n2nd respondent herein, and his other family members for partition and also for a\n\ndeclaration, declaring the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by the\n\n2nd respondent in favour of D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy as\n\nnull and void and for permanent injunction which suit was taken on file as O.S.\n\nNo. 21 of 2020.\n\n2.3 In the said suit, an interim application was filed by Advocate Mr. I.\n\nVeerasamy, which was numbered as I.A. No. 131 of 2021, seeking an order of\n\ninterim injunction. The above-said application was heard and dismissed by the\n\nDistrict Munsif by order dated 29.10.2021 on merits. Pursuant to the dismissal\n\n3 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nof the interim application for ad-interim injunction, Advocate Mr. I.\n\nVeerasamy, who was the plaintiff in the suit in O.S.No.21 of 2020 and also\n\nappeared in person, filed a memo dated 15.11.2021 seeking leave of the Court\n\nto withdraw the suit in O.S.No.21 of 2020. The learned District Munsif,\n\nacceding to the request of the plaintiff-Advocate-I.Veerasamy, dismissed the\n\nsuit in O.S.No.21 of 2020 as not pressed.\n\n2.4 While so, D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy, who\n\noriginally purchased the properties described in the suit schedule measuring an\n\nextent of 1.30 acres of land in S.No.679/8A; 1.99 Acres of land in S.No.679/1\n\nand 42 cents of land in S.No.679/4 after having retained 0.06 cents in\n\nS.No.679/8A by way of sale deed dated 13.12.2021 vide Doc.No.5687 of 2021\n\nfrom the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu, in turn, sold the same on 13.12.2021 to the\n\nrevision petitioners by virtue of a registered sale deed bearing Document No.\n\n5687 of 2021. Pursuant to the said purchase, the revenue records were\n\nmutated in their name.\n\n2.5 When the matter stood thus, Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein\n\nengaged Mr. I. Veerasamy, Advocate, to file a suit for specific performance\n\nagainst the 2nd respondent in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned\n\nDistrict Munsif, Pennagaram, based on a bogus and fraudulent agreement of\n\n4 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nsale said to have been executed on 05.05.2011. The said suit was filed on\n\n09.03.2023 by Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein against the 2nd respondent-\n\nA.Madhu (who was arrayed as 1st defendant in the suit) and 4 others. The 2nd\n\nrespondent - A.Madhu who was the 1st defendant in the suit had conveniently\n\nremained ex parte in the said suit, and let the suit decreed ex parte on\n\n29.09.2023. Thereafter, the 1st respondent—Ganesan filed an execution\n\npetition, and pursuant to the orders passed therein, a sale deed was executed in\n\nhis favour through the executing court, based on the ex parte decree obtained in\n\nO.S. No. 16 of 2023.\n\n2.6 According to the revision petitioners, the decree obtained in\n\nO.S.NO.16 of 2023 was nothing but an outcome of fraud and collusion between\n\nthe 1strespondent’s Advocate - I.Veerasamy who was plaintiff in O.S.No.21 of\n\n2020 on the file of the learned District Munsif, Pennagaram and incidentally, he\n\nwas the Advocate who represented the plaintiff-Ganesan in the in the suit in\n\nO.S.No.16 of 2023, the 1st respondent herein.\n\n2.7 The vendors of the revision petitioners lawfully purchased the\n\nproperty on 26.07.2013 under a registered sale deed, which is duly recorded in\n\nthe encumbrance register maintained by the Registration Department.\n\n2.8 The suit for specific performance was filed at the instance of Mr. I.\n\n5 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nVeerasamy, Advocate, who is the mastermind behind the creation of the alleged\n\nsale agreement dated 05.05.2011. The 1st respondent was only a name lender.\n\nHence, the decree dated 29.09.2023 passed in O.S. No.16 of 2023 on the file of\n\nthe learned District Munsif, Pennagaram is nothing but a product of fraud and is\n\na nullity in the eyes of law. As the decree was obtained by practising fraud upon\n\nthe Court, it is rendered void ab initio and can be challenged under\nArticle 227\n\nof the Constitution of India. The learned counsel for the revision petitioners\n\nsubmitted that it is highly improbable for a person, who had allegedly entered\n\ninto an agreement for sale in the year 2011, to remain silent for more than\n\ntwelve years and then abruptly file a suit for specific performance in the year\n\n2023. Such prolonged and unexplained inaction, according to the learned\n\ncounsel, raises grave doubts about the authenticity of the alleged agreement. It\n\nis further contended that the said agreement appears to have been fabricated\n\nsolely with the intention of defeating and nullifying the valid sale deed already\n\nexecuted by A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent herein who is the brother of\n\nAdvocate – I.Veerasamy in favour of D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and\n\nP.K.Duraisamy.\n\n3. This court has heard Mr.N.Manokaran, learned counsel for the revision\n\npetitioners, Mr.S.Mukunth, learned senior counsel on behalf of\n\n6 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nMr.R.Vasudevan, counsel on record for the 1st respondent and\n\nMr.T.Arunkumar, learned Additional Government Pleader for the 2nd\n\nrespondent.\n\n4.1 The learned counsel for the revision petitioners summarised the\n\nbackground of the facts leading to the filing of the revisionpetition in detail\n\nwhich read as follows:\n\n(i) Earlier, one Advocate, I. Veerasamy, a practising Advocate,\n\ninstituted a suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 against his brother, the 2nd respondent,\n\nA. Madhu (2nd defendant), mother Kunjammal and other family members,\n\nbesides the District Collector, Pennagaram, and a few other officials of the\n\nRegistration, Revenue, and Survey Departments, a decree and judgement for\n\npartition of the family properties; a declaration declaring that the sale deed\n\nexecuted in favour of defendants 7 and 8 as null and void; a permanent\n\ninjunction and for mesne profits.\n\n(ii) Along with the suit, Advocate I. Veerasamy, who was the\n\nplaintiff in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, also filed an application for interim injunction.\n\nHowever, the trial court, by a reasoned order dated 29.10.2021 in I.A. No. 131\n\nof 2021, dismissed the said application on merits. Subsequently, the plaintiff—\n\nAdvocate I. Veerasamy, chose to withdraw the entire suit.\n\n(iii) Thereafter, the very same Advocate filed another suit, which\n\n7 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nwas taken on file as O.S. No. 16 of 2023, this time in the name of the 1st\n\nrespondent herein – Ganesan, seeking specific performance of an agreement\n\nallegedly dated 05.05.2011.\n\n(iv) The very nature of the non-judicial stamp paper used for\n\nengrossment of the alleged agreement of sale would sufficiently indicate that it\n\nwas created solely for the purpose of fabricating an agreement of sale. The\n\nappropriate stamp duty for engrossing an agreement of sale is twenty rupees, as\n\nprescribed under\nArticle 5(j)\nof the\nSchedule to the Indian Stamp Act\n, as\n\namended by the Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 2001. However, in the present case, the\n\nalleged agreement has been engrossed on a non-judicial stamp paper of only ten\n\nrupees, which is insufficient and improper for such a document. This\n\ndiscrepancy, according to the learned counsel, categorically establish that the\n\nagreement was not executed contemporaneously in 2011 as claimed, but was\n\ninstead created later to suit the convenience of the first respondent.\n\n(v) The very same Advocate — Mr. I. Veerasamy — who had\n\nearlier instituted a comprehensive suit seeking a judgment and decree for\n\npartition of the suit properties into six equal shares, allotment of one such share\n\nto the plaintiff, and for separate possession, had also sought a declaration that\n\nthe sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by the 2nd defendant in favour of\n\n8 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\ndefendants 7, 8, and 9 was fraudulent, dishonest, null and void. In addition, he\n\nprayed for a permanent injunction restraining defendants 7 and 8 from entering\n\nupon or encroaching upon the suit properties and from measuring the same, as\n\nwell as an enquiry into mesne profits. It is this very same Advocate who has\n\nnow filed the present suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, seeking specific performance\n\non the basis of an alleged agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, thereby giving\n\nrise to serious concerns regarding the bona fides and consistency of the legal\n\nclaims advanced. However, in doing so, the said Advocate has deliberately\n\nfailed to implead the purchasers of the property,who are necessary parties to the\n\nsuit. Instead, Mr. I. Periyasamy, who instituted the suit on behalf of Ganesan,\n\nthe 1st respondent herein, chose to implead his own brother, Mr. A. Madhu, and\n\nfour public officials including those from the Registration Department and the\n\nDistrict Collector, Dharmapuri, without impleading the actual purchasers, who\n\nare just and necessary parties to the suit.\n\n(vi) Such selective impleadment, omitting necessary parties without\n\nwhom the matter could not have been adjudicated effectively, enabled the 1st\n\nrespondent to obtain an ex parte decree. This sequence of events, coupled with\n\nthe procedural omissions, would clearly establish that the decree was obtained\n\nby playing fraud upon the Court.\n\n9 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n(vii) Advocate I. Veerasamy, as plaintiff, filed a suit in the year 2020,\n\nwhich was taken on file as O.S. No. 21 of 2020 on the file of the learned\n\nDistrict Munsif, Pennagaram, seeking partition and other reliefs. In that suit, he\n\nwas fully aware of the earlier sale transaction and, in fact, specifically sought a\n\ndeclaration that the sale deed dated 26.07.2013, executed by the 2nd respondent\n\nherein (who was arrayed as the 1st defendant in that suit) in favour of D.\n\nMadhaiyan and two others, was fraudulent, dishonest, and null and void.\n\n(viii) However, subsequently, the same Advocate filed another suit in the\n\nname of Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein, based on an alleged agreement of\n\nsale dated 05.11.2011, seeking specific performance, while purportedly\n\nsuppressing all the previous transactions concerning the sale of the property by\n\nthe 2nd respondent to D. Madhaiyan and others.\n\n(ix) Such deliberate concealment of material facts and earlier proceedings\n\nwould, by itself, be sufficient to constitute fraud played upon the Court.\n\n4.2 In essence, the learned counsel for the revision petitioners submitted\n\nthat\n\n(i) The suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was a fraudulent and collusive\n\naction filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy in the name of the 1st respondent –\n\nGanesan, after having withdrawn an earlier suit (O.S. No. 21 of 2020) in which\n\n10 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nhe himself had challenged the same sale deed dated 26.07.2013. In the present\n\nsuit, the said Advocate deliberately suppressed the earlier transactions and\n\nfailed to implead the bona fide purchasers of the property, despite being fully\n\naware of their interest. The agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, alleged in\n\nsupport of the suit, was not only suspiciously delayed in enforcement but also\n\nimproperly stamped, indicating fabrication. The suit was thus engineered to\n\nsecure an ex parte decree by deceit.\n\n(ii) Such deliberate concealment and procedural manipulation\n\namount to fraud on the Court, warranting exercise of powers under\nArticle 227\n\nof the Constitution to set aside the decree and the sale deed executed pursuant\n\nto it as null and void.\n\n4.3 The learned counsel for the revision petitioners in support of his\n\nabove contentions placed reliance upon the following judgements:\n\n1.\nS.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath\n, (1994) 1\nSCC 1;\n\n2.\nSatluj Jal Vidyut Nigam v. Raj Kumar Rajinder\nSingh\n, (2019) 14 SCC 449;\n\n3. K.P.Natarajan and another v. Muthuammal and\nothers, (2024) 6 CTC 819\n\n4. S.Baskar v. S.Ranjithkumar and others (2021) 1\nCTC 539\n\n11 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n5. Shanthimalai Trust v. Arunachala Education &\nEnvironmental (2021) 1 CTC 539; and\n\n6. Ayyasamy v. Shanmugam (2024) 6 MLJ 164\n\n5.1 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent opposing\n\nthe revision, submitted that the decree obtained in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 is\n\nlawful, valid, and based on a binding agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011. the\n\nex parte decree was passed after service of summons, and no challenge was\n\nraised at the relevant time. The decree was followed by execution proceedings,\n\nculminating in the execution of a sale deed through the court, thereby\n\ntransferring valid title to the 1st respondent.\n\n5.2 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent further contended that the\n\n2nd respondent – A. Madhu, as the original owner of the property, had entered\n\ninto a valid agreement for sale with the 1st respondent – Ganesan, and that the\n\nentire sale consideration was paid at the time of the agreement. Due to delay on\n\nthe part of the vendor in executing the sale deed, the 1st respondent was\n\ncompelled to file the suit for specific performance.\n\n5.3 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent furthermore contended that\n\nthe failure to implead subsequent purchasers does not render the decree void, as\n\n12 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nthey were neither necessary nor proper parties to a suit between the contracting\n\nparties, especially when the purchasers had notice of the prior agreement.\n\nEarlier suit (O.S. No. 21 of 2020) filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy was entirely\n\nindependent and unrelated to the agreement in question and was withdrawn\n\nvoluntarily. The present suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was based on a legally\n\nenforceable agreement and pursued in accordance with law. The ex parte nature\n\nof the proceedings, by itself, does not constitute fraud, and that the decree was\n\npassed following the normal legal process. Merely because Advocate I.\n\nVeerasamy, who instituted the suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on behalf of the 1st\n\nrespondent—Ganesan, and who was himself the plaintiff in the earlier suit in\n\nO.S. No. 21 of 2020, happens to be a close relative of Ganesan, such a\n\nrelationship alone cannot form the basis to attribute fraud.\n\n5.4 According to the learned counsel for the 1st respondent, the revision\n\npetitioners cannot invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court\n\nunder\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India to challenge the validity of a\n\ndecree that was legally passed, even if it was an ex parte decree. If the revision\n\npetitioners were truly aggrieved by such decree, the proper course of action\n\nwould have been to file an appeal or an application to set aside the ex parte\n\ndecree, as provided under\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\nor to file a separate suit\n\n13 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nfor declaration under\nSection 34\nof the Specific Relief Act or otherwise to\n\nestablish that the decree is not binding on them due to fraud, collusion, or\n\nsuppression.\n\n5.5 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent lastly contended that\n\nallegations of fraud, collusion, or suppression of material facts must be\n\nspecifically pleaded and proved by evidence. Such serious allegations cannot be\n\nraised casually or for the first time in a revision petition. The revision\n\npetitioners, having failed to challenge the proceedings at the appropriate time,\n\ncannot now, at this belated stage, seek to unsettle a concluded judicial\n\nproceeding by making unsubstantiated claims. Therefore, the learned counsel\n\nprayed that the revision petition be dismissed.\n\n6.1 The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent while adopting the\n\narguments advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 1st\n\nrespondent would additionally contend that the powers of the High Court under\n\nArticle 227\nbeing supervisory, the same has to be exercised sparingly in cases\n\nwhere errors are apparent on the face of record, occasioning grave injustice by\n\nthe court assuming jurisdiction which it does not have, failing to exercise\n\njurisdiction which it does have, or exercising its jurisdiction in a perverse\n\n14 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nmanner. Hence, he would contend that essence of the power under\nArticle 227\n,\n\nbeing supervisory, it cannot be invoked to usurp the original jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt which it seeks to supervise.\n\n6.2 In support of his above contention, Mr.S.Mukunth, learned senior\n\ncounsel would place much reliance on the very recent judgement of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in S.L.P.(C) No.21466 of 2024 dated 29.04.2025 (K.Valarmathi\n\nand others v. Kumaresan).\n\n7. In the light of the rival submissions, the point that arises for\n\nconsideration in this revision petition is:\n\nWhether the Court, while exercising its power\n\nunder\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India, can set\n\naside an ex parte decree on the ground of fraud and abuse\n\nof process of law?\n\n8. It is apposite to refer to the settled legal principles on the subject.\n\n9.\nIn\nS.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath\n, (1994) 1 SCC 1, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has held that fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical\n\n15 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nor temporal. The 1st paragraph of the judgement reads as follows:\n\n“Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or\ntemporal” observed Chief Justice Edward Coke of England\nabout three centuries ago. It is the settled proposition of law\nthat a judgment or decree obtained by playing fraud on the\ncourt is a nullity and non est in the eyes of law. Such a\njudgment/decree by the first court or by the highest court has\nto be treated as a nullity by every court, whether superior or\ninferior. It can be challenged in any court even in collateral\nproceedings.”\n\n10.\nIn\nSatluj Jal Vidyut Nigam v. Raj Kumar Rajinder Singh\n, (2019)\n\n14 SCC 449, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\n“68. Fraud vitiates every solemn proceeding and no right\ncan be claimed by a fraudster on the ground of\ntechnicalities. On behalf of the appellants, reliance has\nbeen placed on the definition of “fraud” as defined\nin Black's Law Dictionary, which is as under:\n\n“Fraud : (1) A knowing misrepresentation of the\ntruth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to\nact to his or her detriment. Fraud is usually a tort, but in\nsome cases (esp. when the conduct is wilful) it may be a\ncrime. … (2) A misrepresentation made recklessly without\nbelief in its truth to induce another person to act.

(4) Unconscionable\ndealing; esp., in contract law, the unconscientious use of\nthe power arising out of the parties' relative positions and\nresulting in an unconscionable bargain.”\n\n69.Halsbury's Laws of England has defined “fraud”\nas follows:\n\n“Whenever a person makes a false statement which he\ndoes not actually and honestly believe to be true, for\npurpose of civil liability, the statement is as fraudulent as\nif he had stated that which he did know to be true, or know\nor believed to be false. Proof of absence of actual and\nhonest belief is all that is necessary to satisfy the\nrequirement of the law, whether the representation has\nbeen made recklessly or deliberately, indifference or\nrecklessness on the part of the representor as to the truth\nor falsity of the representation affords merely an instance\nof absence of such a belief.”\n\n70. In Kerr on the Law of Fraud and Mistake,\n“fraud” has been defined thus:\n\n“It is not easy to give a definition of what\nconstitutes fraud in the extensive significance in which\nthat term is understood by Civil Courts of Justice. The\ncourts have always avoided hampering themselves by\ndefining or laying down as a general proposition what\nshall be held to constitute fraud. Fraud is infinite in\nvariety… Courts have always declined to define it, …\nreserving to themselves the liberty to deal with it under\nwhatever form it may present itself. Fraud … may be said\nto include property (sic properly) all acts, omissions, and\nconcealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable\nduty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious\nto another, or by which an undue or unconscientious\n\n17 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nadvantage is taken of another. All surprise, trick, cunning,\ndissembling and other unfair way that is used to cheat\nanyone is considered as fraud. Fraud in all cases implies a\nwilful act on the part of anyone, whereby another is\nsought to be deprived, by illegal or inequitable means, of\nwhat he is entitled to.”\n\n71.\nIn\nRam Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra\nSingh\nv. Savitri Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319] , it was observed\nthat fraud vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice\nnever dwell together and it cannot be perpetuated or saved\nby the application of any equitable doctrine including res\njudicata. This Court observed as under : (SCC pp. 327-29,\nparas 15-18, 23 & 25)\n\n“15. Commission of fraud on court and suppression of\nmaterial facts are the core issues involved in these\nmatters. Fraud, as is well known, vitiates every solemn\nact. Fraud and justice never dwell together.\n\n16.Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which\ninduces the other person or authority to take a definite\ndeterminative stand as a response to the conduct of the\nformer either by word or letter.\n\n17.It is also well settled that misrepresentation itself\namounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may\nalso give reason to claim relief against fraud.\n\n18.A fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and\nconsists in leading a man into damage by wilfully or\nrecklessly causing him to believe and act on falsehood.

State of\nMaharashtra, (2015) 6 SCC 557 : (2015) 3 SCC (Civ) 368\n: (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 239] , this Court observed that fraud\nhad been played by showing the records and the orders\nobtained unlawfully by the declarant, would be a nullity in\nthe eye of the law though such orders have attained\nfinality. Following observations were made : (SCC pp.\n569-70, para 27)\n\n“27.

Muthuammal and others,\n\n(2024) 6 CTC 819, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the powers of the\n\nHigh Court under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India are in addition to, and\n\nwider than, the powers under\nSection 115\nof the Code of Civil Procedure, the\n\nHon’ble Supreme Court held that the High Court can invoke its jurisdiction\n\nunder\nArticle 227\nto set aside an ex parte decree in a revision arising out of the\n\ndismissal of an application under\nSection 5\nof the Limitation Act, in order to\n\ncorrect gross errors of jurisdiction committed by a subordinate court. Para 21\n\nof the judgement reads as follows:\n\n“21. The contention that in a revision arising out of the\ndismissal of a petition under\nSection 5\nof the Limitation\nAct, 1963, the High Court cannot set aside the ex parte\ndecree itself, by invoking the power under\nArticle 227\n,\ndoes not appeal to us.

Following the settled legal position, this Court, in S. Baskar v. S.\n\nRanjithkumar and others, MANU/TN/6545/2024 (C.R.P. No. 4050 of 2024\n\ndated 02.12.2024), has held as follows:\n\n“12. This Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under\n\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India, is exercising\npower of superintendence over all the Courts and\ntribunals throughout the State. This Court cannot turn a\nblind eye when its attention is drawn to an ex-facie illegal\njudgment. This Court has to necessarily interfere with the\nsame, failing which, there will be failure of justice and it\nwill amount to perpetuating illegality.”\n\n13. In Shanthimalai Trust v.

In Ayyasamy v. Shanmugam, MANU/TN/5582/2023\n\n(C.R.P.No.2672 of 2019 dated 19.09.2023), this court has held that the High\n\nCourt under\nArticle 227\nhas the jurisdiction to set aside a decree while dealing\n\nwith a revision under\nSection 5\nof the Limitation Act.\n\n15. All the above precedents make it abundantly clear that a decree\n\nobtained by playing fraud upon the Court or by abuse of the process of law is a\n\nnullity in the eyes of law. In such cases, the supervisory jurisdiction of the High\n\nCourt under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution can rightly be invoked to set aside\n\nsuch an illegal and void decree, in order to uphold the sanctity of the judicial\n\nprocess and prevent miscarriage of justice.\n\n16. In K. Valarmathi and others v. Kumaresan [S.L.P. (C) No. 21466 of\n\n2024, dated 29.04.2025], upon which the learned senior counsel for the 1st\n\nrespondent placed much reliance, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that a\n\ndecree cannot be set aside in the exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 227\nof\n\n24 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nthe Constitution of India. In the said judgement, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nemphasized that\nArticle 227\nconfers supervisory jurisdiction, not appellate or\n\nrevisional jurisdiction, and cannot be invoked to substitute statutory remedies or\n\nto set aside a decree passed by a competent civil court in the exercise of its\n\noriginal jurisdiction.\n\n17. On a careful perusal of the recent judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in K. Valarmathi and Others v. Kumaresan (cited supra), this Court\n\nfinds that none of the earlier judgements rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme\n\nCourt were brought to the notice of the Court. In particular, the earlier binding\n\nprecedent of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Natarajan v. Muthuammal, (2021)\n\n15 SCC 817, wherein it was categorically held that the powers of the High\n\nCourt under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India are in addition to, and\n\nwider than, the power under\nSection 115\nof the Code of Civil Procedure, and\n\nthat such power can be exercised even to set aside a decree in exceptional\n\ncircumstances, was not considered.\n\n18. In the case of Natarajan v. Muthuammal (supra), the Hon’ble\n\nSupreme Court examined and relied upon several earlier decisions and\n\nreaffirmed the settled legal position regarding the scope of\nArticle 227.\n\nAccordingly, this Court is inclined to consider the facts of the present case\n\n25 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nbearing in mind the law laid down in Natarajan's case and the binding\n\nprecedents in few other cases which have consistently interpreted the scope and\n\nextent of supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution.\n\n19. Ordinarily, a challenge to a decree on the ground that it was obtained\n\nby fraud must be raised by way of an appeal or appropriate proceedings wherein\n\nthe alleged fraud must be specifically pleaded and established by evidence.\n\nMere allegations of fraud and collusion are not sufficient and there must be\n\nconcrete facts to substantiate the allegations of fraud and collusion. However, in\n\ncases where the fraud is evident on the face of the judgment and decree, or\n\ndiscernible from the conduct of the parties, it may not be necessary to await a\n\nfull-fledged trial for determination. In such exceptional circumstances, where\n\nthe decree itself is a product of fraud and amounts to an abuse of the process of\n\ncourt, the High Court, in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India, is empowered to intervene and set aside such\n\ndecree. The jurisdiction of the High Court under\nArticle 227\nis not ousted in\n\ncases where the decree is a nullity in law owing to fraud perpetrated upon the\n\ncourt itself.\n\n26 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n20. Let this Court now advert to the facts of the present case, wherein the\n\ndecree dated 29.09.2023 is sought to be assailed, in the light of the settled legal\n\nposition discussed above.\n\n21. On a careful perusal of the judgment and decree dated 29.09.2023\n\nmade in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned District Munsif,\n\nPennagaram, it is seen that the 1st respondent filed the suit on the basis of an\n\nunregistered agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, allegedly entered into\n\nbetween the 1st respondent (purchaser) and the 2nd respondent (vendor). It is\n\npertinent to note that although the agreement is dated 05.05.2011, the suit came\n\nto be filed only in the year 2023.\n\n22. The pleadings in the plaint reveal that no steps were taken by the\n\nplaintiff from the date of the alleged agreement, despite claiming that the entire\n\nsale consideration of Rs. 80,000/- for the purchase of 3.77 acres was paid in full\n\non the date of execution of agreement of sale itself. It is pleaded in the plaint\n\nthat the 1st respondent herein issued a legal notice to his vendor, the 2nd\n\nrespondent herein only on 01.03.2023, nearly twelve years later, calling upon\n\nhim to appear before the Sub-Registrar for execution of the sale deed.\n\n23. A photocopy of the so-called agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011 has\n\nbeen placed before this Court for perusal. On a careful examination of the same,\n\nit is seen that the said agreement was typed on a non-judicial stamp paper of\n\n27 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nRs.10/-, which appears to have been purchased in the name of the 1st\n\nrespondent – Ganesan.\n\n24. It is relevant to place on record that, as per\nArticle 5(j)\nof\nSchedule-I\n\nto the Indian Stamp Act, 1899\n, as amended by the Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 2001,\n\nthe stamp duty for an agreement for sale was prescribed as Rs. 20/-, with effect\n\nfrom 11.07.2002. Therefore, the fact that the alleged agreement of sale dated\n\n05.05.2011 was executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of only Rs. 10/-, instead\n\nof the statutorily required Rs. 20/-, raises a serious doubt about the genuineness\n\nand authenticity of the document.\n\n25. Be that as it may, though the agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011\n\nstates that the entire sale consideration of Rs. 80,000/- for the sale of 3.77 acres\n\nof land had been paid in full, there is no recital in the agreement regarding\n\ndelivery of possession of the subject properties to the purchaser. Furthermore,\n\nthe agreement does not stipulate any specific time frame within which the sale\n\ntransaction was to be completed by execution and registration of the sale deed.\n\n26. This Court is of the view that the absence of a specific time limit\n\nprescribed in the agreement of sale clearly indicates that such omission was\n\ndeliberate, with the apparent intention of bringing the suit within the period of\n\n28 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nlimitation as contemplated under Part II of\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act,\n.\n\n27. It is relevant to note that the conduct of a person who claims to have\n\nparted with the entire sale consideration, yet remains silent for more than\n\ntwelve years without initiating any action, is wholly inconsistent with the\n\nconduct expected of a prudent person. The prolonged inaction on the part of the\n\n1st respondent, including the failure to issue even a legal notice during this\n\nentire period demanding execution of the sale deed, assumes considerable\n\nsignificance when viewed in the context of the other attending circumstances of\n\nthe case. Such unexplained delay raises serious doubts about the bona fides of\n\nthe alleged agreement and the claim arising therefrom.\n\n28. It is also relevant to note that the suit properties were sold by the 2nd\n\nrespondent by way of a registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, vide Document\n\nNo. 361 of 2013, in favour of D. Maddhaiyan, G. Rajendran, and P.K.\n\nDuraisamy. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent executed a rectification deed on\n\n31.08.2015, vide Document No. 3035 of 2015, to correct an error in the survey\n\nnumber mentioned in the original sale deed. Thus, as early as 26.07.2013, the\n\n2nd respondent, the vendor of the vendors of the revision petitioner under the\n\nagreement dated 05.05.2011 had already conveyed the suit properties by way of\n\n29 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\na valid registered sale, and it is this sale that was sought to be annulled in the\n\nsuit filed in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 by Advocate I. Veerasamy, who had arrayed\n\nhimself as the plaintiff.\n\n29. It is pertinent to note that Advocate I. Veerasamy, a practising\n\nlawyer, is none other than the brother of the 2nd respondent, A. Madhu. In his\n\nplaint in O.S.No.21 of 2020, Advocate-I.Veerasamy not only sought relief\n\nagainst the 2nd respondent but also against the other family members.\n\n30. In the plaint filed in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, Advocate I. Veerasamy\n\nalleged that the suit properties were joint family properties, though purchased in\n\nthe name of the 2nd respondent. It was further contended that the 2nd\n\nrespondent had executed the sale deed with the intention of defeating the rights\n\nof the other family members. Accordingly, he prayed for a judgement and\n\ndecree declaring the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 as null and void, in addition to\n\nseeking the reliefs of partition and permanent injunction.\n\n31. Along with the suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, Advocate I. Veerasamy\n\nalso filed an application in I.A. No. 131 of 2020 under Order XXXIX Rules 1\n\nand 2\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n, seeking an ad-interim injunction.\n\nHowever, the said application was dismissed on merits by the learned District\n\nMunsif by order dated 29.10.2021.Subsequently, Advocate I. Veerasamy filed a\n\nmemo expressing his intention not to pursue the suit any further and sought\n\n30 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\npermission to withdraw the same. Notably, he did not seek to reserve his right\n\nto institute a fresh suit on the same cause of action. Accepting his request, the\n\nlearned District Munsif dismissed the suit as not pressed by judgement dated\n\n15.11.2021.\n\n32. From the foregoing facts, it is evident that Advocate I. Veerasamy, a\n\npractising Advocate who is the brother of the 2nd respondent, was well aware\n\nof the sale of the suit property as early as July 2013. He had himself instituted a\n\nsuit challenging the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by his brother, the 2nd\n\nrespondent – A. Madhu, in favour of D. Madhaiyan and two others. However,\n\nthe said suit was later withdrawn by Advocate I. Veerasamy on his own\n\nvolition, without reserving liberty to file a fresh suit on the same cause of\n\naction. Thereafter, Advocate I. Veerasamy himself instituted the suit in\n\nO.S.No.16 of 2023 on behalf of the 1st respondent – Ganesan, seeking specific\n\nperformance of the so-called agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011.\n\n33. It is pertinent to note that the 1st defendant in the said suit, A. Madhu,\n\nis none other than the brother of Advocate I. Veerasamy. The suit in O.S.No.16\n\nof 2023 came to be filed for specific performance by the very same advocate\n\nwho had earlier challenged the sale deed executed by his own brother in the suit\n\nin O.S.No.21 of 2020 and subsequently withdrew that suit without reserving\n\nany liberty. However, while drafting the plaint in O.S. No. 16 of 2023,\n\n31 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nAdvocate I. Veerasamy deliberately maintained complete silence with respect\n\nto the prior transactions involving the very same properties. He conveniently\n\nomitted any reference to the earlier sale deed dated 26.07.2013, which he had\n\nhimself challenged in his own suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020. Such suppression is\n\nglaring and cannot be overlooked, particularly when the same advocate, fully\n\naware of the prior transaction, chose not to disclose it in the subsequent suit.\n\nThe deliberate omission raises serious concerns and casts a shadow over the\n\nbona fides of the suit, suggesting that the suppression was intentional and for\n\nreasons best known to Advocate I. Veerasamy, his brother A. Madhu.\n\n34. Despite being fully aware of the registered sale deed executed by his\n\nbrother, A. Madhu, on 26.07.2013 in favour of D. Madhaiyan, G. Rajendran,\n\nand P.K. Duraisamy, Advocate I. Veerasamy, while filing the suit in O.S. No.\n\n16 of 2023 for specific performance, deliberately chose not to implead the said\n\npurchasers as parties to the suit. Instead, he arrayed only his brother, A. Madhu,\n\nthe 2nd respondent herein as a defendant, along with certain Government\n\nofficials. The conscious omission of necessary parties, despite knowledge of\n\ntheir direct interest in the subject matter, further reinforces the inference of\n\ndeliberate suppression and calls into question the bona fides of the suit. This\n\ncourt is unable to comprehend how the Sub Registrar, Pennagaram, District\n\n32 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nRegistrar, Dharmapuri and District Collector, Dharmapuri were necessary\n\nparties to the issue relating to enforcement of a contract.\n\n35. Having chosen to implead his brother-A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent\n\nherein and certain government officials of the State as party defendants in the\n\nsuit in O.S.No.16 of 2023, Advocate - I. Veerasamy, however, failed to\n\nimplead the purchasers - D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy, who\n\nhad acquired the suit properties from the said A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent\n\nherein under the registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, as well as the\n\nsubsequent purchasers, namely the revision petitioners herein, who had\n\npurchased the same properties on 13.12.2017 from D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran\n\nand P.K.Duraisamy. Despite their clear and direct interest in the subject matter\n\nof the suit, those purchasers were deliberately omitted from the array of parties\n\nin O.S. No. 16 of 2023, thereby rendering the suit defective for non-joinder of\n\nnecessary parties.\n\n36. In the suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the 2nd respondent, A. Madhu—\n\nwho was arrayed as the 1st defendant, conveniently remained ex parte, thereby\n\nallowing the suit to be decreed ex parte. It is not in dispute that A. Madhu, the\n\n2nd respondent herein had already sold the subject properties as early as July\n\n2013 to D. Maddhaiyan, G. Rajendran, and P.K. Duraisamy. His brother,\n\nAdvocate I. Veerasamy, who is a practising lawyer, was fully aware of the said\n\n33 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\ntransaction and had even instituted a suit (O.S.No.21 of 2020) challenging the\n\nsaid sale, which he later withdrew.\n\n37. However, in the subsequent suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, Advocate I.\n\nVeerasamy, while acting as counsel for the plaintiff—Ganesan (1st respondent\n\nherein), conveniently omitted to implead the subsequent purchasers, including\n\nthe revision petitioners herein, who had acquired the properties on 13.12.2017,\n\nas party defendants. This Court is of the considered view that such omission\n\nwas not inadvertent but a deliberate act aimed at suppressing material facts\n\nrelating to the prior alienation of the suit properties. The suppression of the\n\nsubsequent sale transactions, particularly in a suit for specific performance,\n\namounts to a clear and calculated act of fraud.\n\n38. Had the subsequent purchasers been impleaded as parties in the suit,\n\nthey would have had the opportunity to contest the claim and establish that the\n\nproperties were transferred to them for valuable consideration, in good faith,\n\nand without notice of any prior agreement. The failure to implead them,\n\ncoupled with the ex parte conduct of the 1st defendant, leads this Court to\n\nconclude that the decree was obtained by playing fraud upon the Court, thereby\n\nvitiating the very foundation of the judgement and decree passed in O.S. No. 16\n\nof 2023.\n\n34 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n39. It is now well settled that an agreement for sale can be enforced\n\nagainst a subsequent purchaser only if it is shown that such purchaser had\n\nnotice of the prior agreement and that the purchase was not made in good faith\n\nor for valuable consideration. Only in order to circumvent such legal\n\ncomplications, the suit for specific performance in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was\n\ncleverly instituted without impleading the subsequent purchasers as party\n\ndefendants.\n\n40. The pleadings in the earlier suit, O.S. No. 21 of 2020, filed by\n\nAdvocate I. Veerasamy as plaintiff, clearly indicate that the subject properties\n\nwere sold on 26.07.2013. Significantly, it was not his case in that suit that the\n\nsale consideration was not paid by the purchasers. If the agreement of sale dated\n\n05.11.2011 had in fact been executed in favour of the 1st respondent and was in\n\nexistence, such a vital fact ought to have been disclosed, in all fairness, in the\n\npleadings of O.S. No. 21 of 2020.\n\n41. The omission to mention the alleged agreement dated 05.05.2011 in\n\nthe earlier suit and the subsequent filing of O.S. No. 16 of 2023 without\n\nimpleading the known purchasers clearly reveal a concerted effort to suppress\n\nmaterial facts. These circumstances strongly suggest that the 1st respondent is\n\nmerely a name-lender, and that the suit is a result of collusion between the 2nd\n\n35 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nrespondent and his brother, Advocate I. Veerasamy.\n\n42. This conclusion is further fortified by the inherently improbable\n\nconduct of the 1st respondent, who, despite allegedly paying the entire sale\n\nconsideration of Rs. 80,000/- on 05.05.2011, failed to take any steps whatsoever\n\nfor over twelve years to enforce the agreement. Such prolonged and\n\nunexplained silence is wholly against with the normal conduct of an ordinary\n\nprudent man, which casts serious doubt on the genuineness of the alleged\n\ntransaction.\n\n43. The cumulative facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove lead\n\nto the inescapable conclusion that the suit for specific performance in O.S. No.\n\n16 of 2023 was clearly an afterthought, and the agreement of sale dated\n\n05.05.2011 is antedated with the sole object of achieving, through indirect\n\nmeans, what could not be achieved directly through the earlier suit in O.S. No.\n\n21 of 2020 filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy.\n\n44. The very pleadings in the plaint in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the conduct\n\nof the parties, the deliberate non-joinder of necessary parties, and the manner in\n\nwhich the 1st respondent – Ganesan obtained an ex parte decree and\n\nsubsequently got a sale deed executed in his favour through the executing court,\n\nall point to a clear abuse of process.\n\n36 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n45. Such a sale deed, executed in furtherance of a decree obtained by\n\nsuppressing material facts and without impleading the true and lawful\n\npurchasers of the suit properties, cannot confer any valid title upon the 1st\n\nrespondent. Merely because an ex parte decree was passed in the suit for\n\nspecific performance and a sale deed was executed in pursuance thereof, it does\n\nnot ipso facto confer any valid title upon the 1st respondent. It is an undisputed\n\nfact that the 2nd respondent – A. Madhu, had already conveyed the subject\n\nproperties by way of a registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, and therefore, on\n\nthe date when the executing court purported to execute a sale deed in favour of\n\nthe 1st respondent pursuant to the decree in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the 2nd\n\nrespondent no longer held any title to convey.\n\n46. In the absence of impleadment of the subsequent bona fide\n\npurchasers, and in view of the fraudulent suppression of these transactions, the\n\nentire proceedings culminating in the ex parte decree and execution thereof are\n\nvitiated. Consequently, the decree for specific performance and the sale deed\n\nexecuted pursuant thereto are liable to be set aside as nullities in the eye of law.\n\n47. In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the considered\n\nopinion that the decree for specific performance obtained in O.S. No. 16 of\n\n2023 was the result of a calculated and deliberate suppression of material facts,\n\n37 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nincluding the prior alienation of the suit properties and the purchasers were not\n\nimpleaded as parties. The suit was engineered in collusion between the 1st and\n\n2nd respondents, with the active connivance of Advocate I. Veerasamy, who\n\nhad personal knowledge of all relevant transactions but chose to withhold the\n\nsame from the Court. Such conduct constitutes a clear abuse of the process of\n\ncourt and amounts to playing fraud upon the court. It is a settled principle of\n\nlaw that a decree obtained by fraud is a nullity and can be declared as such even\n\nin collateral proceedings. Therefore, this Court finds that the ex parte decree\n\ndated 26.09.2023 passed in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned\n\nDistrict Munsif, Pennagaram, and the consequential sale deed executed by the\n\nexecuting court in favour of the 1st respondent, are vitiated by fraud and are\n\nhence null and void in the eye of law. This is a fit case warranting the exercise\n\nof this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia. This Court is therefore of the considered view that the extraordinary\n\nsupervisory jurisdiction under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India is\n\nrequired to be exercised in this case. Accordingly, the impugned decree and sale\n\ndeed are hereby set aside.\n\nIn the result, the civil revision petition is allowed in the following terms:\n\n38 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n(1) The judgement and decree dated 29.09.2023 passed in\n\nO.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the learned District Munsif cum Judicial\n\nMagistrate, Pennagaram, Dharmapuri District, are hereby set aside.\n\n(2) The sale deed dated 15.11.2024 executed by the District\n\nMunsif, Pennagaram, Dharmapuri District, on behalf the 2nd respondent-\n\nA.Madhu (1st defendant in O.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the District Munsif,\n\nPennagaram) Son of Abimannan, in favour of the 1st respondent-Ganesan\n\n(Plaintiff in O.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the District Munsif, Pennagaram)\n\nSon of Selvam is hereby declared as null and void and non-est in the eye of law.\n\nConsidering the special circumstances of the case, this court is not\n\ninclined to pass any orders on costs and the parties in this revision shall bear\n\ntheir own costs incurred on this revision petition.\n\nConsequently, connected CMP is closed.\n\nIndex : yes / no 24..06..2025\nNeutral Citation : yes / no\n\nkmk\n\nTo\n\n1.The District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate, Pennagaram,\n\n39 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\nN.SATHISH KUMAR.J.,\nkmk\n\nC.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n24..06..2025\n\n40 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )",
