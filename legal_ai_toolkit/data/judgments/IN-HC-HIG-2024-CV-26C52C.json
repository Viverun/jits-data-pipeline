FURTHER TO DIRECT THE RESPONDENTS\n\nREGULARIZE THE SERVICE OF PETITIONER AND ALSO TO GRANT ALL\n\nTHE CONSEQUENTIAL RELIEF IN FAVOUR OF THE PETITIONERS AND\n\nETC., IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY.\n\nTHIS WRIT PETITION HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED\n\nFOR ORDERS ON 19.09.2024 COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF\n\nORDER THIS DAY THE COURT, MADE THE FOLLOWING:\n-6-\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nCAV ORDER\n\nChallenging Selection List dated 25/27.09.2023 issued by\n\nrespondent no.2 at Annexure-A; and seeking for direction to\n\nrespondents no.1 to 4 to continue service of petitioners till\n\nregular appointments are made to posts held by them; for\n\ndirecting respondents to frame rules for absorption or give\n\nweightage marks/age relaxation for service rendered by\n\npetitioners, by considering their representation to respondent\n\nno.1 at Annexure-P dated 01.10.2023 and for direction to\n\nregularize service of petitioners, grant all consequential reliefs\n\netc., this writ petition is filed.\n\n2. Sri J.S.Shetty, learned counsel for petitioners\n\nsubmitted, petitioners no.1, 2, 4 and 6 were working as nurses\n\nin K.H.E.P. Hospital, Ambikanagar, while petitioners no.3, 5, 7\n\nand 8 as staff nurses in K.H.E.P. Hospital, Ganeshgudi. It was\n\nsubmitted, though their appointment was\n\ntemporary/contractual basis for a period of 11 months, but they\n\ncontinued till date. It was submitted, petitioner no.1 appointed\n\non 13.08.2015 had more than 8 and half years experience;\n\nwhile petitioner no.2 appointed on 10.12.2018 had completed 5\n\nyears. Similarly petitioner no.3 appointed on 25.07.2015\n-7-\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\ncompleted 7 and half years, petitioner no.4 appointed on\n\n11.12.2018 had put in 6 years, petitioner no.5 appointed on\n\n29.12.2019 completed 4 years, petitioner no.6 appointed on\n\n12.12.2018 completed 5 years and petitioner no.8 appointed on\n\n29.12.2019 completed 4 years of service. It was submitted,\n\nsame was without any change in service conditions. It was\n\nsubmitted, prior to said appointment, they had worked in other\n\nhospitals.\n\n3. It was submitted, petitioners had worked tirelessly\n\nduring prevalence of COVID-19 Pandemic and received letters\n\nof appreciation as per Annexures-L, L1 to L26. It was\n\nsubmitted, after transfer of respondent no.5 from Raichur as\n\nAssistant General Manager, H.R.D., KPCL, Ambikanagar, he\n\nintended to appoint persons of his choice. Accordingly, he\n\nissued recruitment notification at Annexure-N dated 13.06.2023\n\ncalling for applications from eligible candidates. It was\n\nsubmitted, said appointment was stated to be for 11 months on\n\ncontractual basis.\n\n4. It was evident that respondents intended to replace\n\none set of temporary employees with another set without any\n\njustification. It was submitted, even selection process was\n\nriddled with various irregularities. It was submitted, in affidavit\n-8-\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nfiled by respondent no.5 on 25.01.2024, it was stated, final\n\nselection list was prepared on basis of qualifying examination\n\nmarks and five years experience, but candidate at Sl.no.11,\n\nnamely Sri Ravikumar (respondent no.16) had acquired basic\n\neducational qualification not more than two years prior to\n\nnotification. Therefore, his name was included in final selection\n\nlist by falsely showing experience of five years.\n\n5. It was further submitted, petitioners had not yet\n\ncompleted contractual period of service and respondents had\n\nsought to terminate their services during currency of contract\n\nwithout issuing any notice, which would be illegal. It was\n\nsubmitted, petitioners had worked on extremely humble wages\n\nand were provided residential quarters, wherein, they had\n\nshifted their families. Premature and arbitrary termination of\n\nservices, would affect not only petitioners but also impose\n\nhardship on family members who would be displaced. It was\n\nsubmitted, repeated renewal/extension of their services had\n\ngiven rise to legitimate expectation that their services would be\n\ncontinued and regularized as need for providing health services\n\nwas perennial in nature. Despite said fact, respondents had not\n\ntaken any action for making regular appointments to provide\n\nhealth services. On other hand, without justification resorted to\n-9-\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nonce again make temporary appointment. Under above\n\ncircumstances, petitioners had sought, not only for continuation\n\nof their services till regular appointments were made, but also\n\nfor regularization of their services.\n\n6. It was further submitted, this Court on 03.10.2023\n\ngranted interim order against petitioners being relieved from\n\nservices. Though they were actually relieved until then,\n\nrespondents claimed to have relieved them on 02.10.2023, to\n\ncircumvent interim order. It was alleged, same was at behest of\n\nrespondent no.5, who intended to appoint persons of his\n\nchoice. Therefore, issuance of impugned notification suffered\n\nfrom malafide and liable to be quashed.\n\n7. On other hand, Sri Pramod Nair, learned Senior\n\nCounsel appearing for Sri Mrutyunjaya S.Hallikeri advocate for\n\nrespondents no.1 to 5 and 20, and Sri Praveen P.Tarikar\n\nlearned counsel for respondent no.9, 10, 13 and 14 sought to\n\noppose writ petition.\n\n8. At outset learned Senior counsel submitted,\n\nrecruitment notification at Annexure-N was given wide publicity\n\nevidenced by receipt of large number of applications (166 in\n\nnumber). It was submitted, each of petitioners had filed\n- 10 -\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\napplication in response thereto and only after failing in selection\n\nprocess, challenged selection, which would be barred by\n\nprinciple of estoppel. It was submitted, in view of specific\n\nobservations by Hon'ble Supreme Court in paragraphs no.45\n\nand 47 in case of Secretary, State of Karnataka and Ors. v.\n\nUmadevi and Ors. (3) reported in 2006 (4) SCC 1,\n\npetitioners' prayer for regularization of their services or claims\n\nbased on legitimate expectations as well as on ground of\n\nreplacement of one temporary employee with another would\n\nrequire to be rejected. It was submitted, prayer for\n\nregularization, would untenable without challenge of\n\nrecruitment notification at Annexure-N.\n\n9. It was submitted, core business of respondents -\n\nKPCL was power generation and it did not have any experience\n\nor expertise in establishing and running hospitals/clinics.\n\nEstablishment of clinic/hospital was in exigencies and\n\nrequirement of staff nurses would vary from year to year. It\n\nwas submitted, there were no sanctioned posts of staff nurses.\n\nSame would bar any relief being granted to petitioners.\n\n10. It was submitted, though selection was sought to\n\nbe assailed on ground of adoption of five years of experience\n\ncriteria without notifying same in recruitment notification,\n- 11 -\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nadmittedly each of petitioners had such experience and their\n\napplications were not rejected on said ground. Their\n\ncandidature was duly considered and selection list at Annexure-\n\nA was prepared on merit. It was lastly submitted, during course\n\nof pendency of present writ petition, management had taken a\n\ndecision to discontinue contractual appointments altogether and\n\nto outsource running of hospital to agency having expertise in\n\nsaid field.\n\n11. In support of submissions, learned Senior Counsel\n\nrelied on decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of State\n\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi (3), reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1 as\n\nfollows :\n\n\"45. While directing that appointments, temporary or\ncasual, be regularized or made permanent, the courts are\nswayed by the fact that the person concerned has worked for\nsome time and in some cases for a considerable length of\ntime. It is not as if the person who accepts an engagement\neither temporary or casual in nature, is not aware of the\nnature of his employment. He accepts the employment with\nopen eyes. It may be true that he is not in a position to\nbargain--not at arm's length--since he might have been\nsearching for some employment so as to eke out his\nlivelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that ground\nalone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the\nconstitutional scheme of appointment and to take the view\nthat a person who has temporarily or casually got employed\nshould be directed to be continued permanently. By doing so,\nit will be creating another mode of public appointment which\nis not permissible. If the court were to void a contractual\nemployment of this nature on the ground that the parties\nwere not having equal bargaining power, that too would not\n- 12 -\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nenable the court to grant any relief to that employee. A total\nembargo on such casual or temporary employment is not\npossible, given the exigencies of administration and if\nimposed, would only mean that some people who at least get\nemployment temporarily, contractually or casually, would not\nbe getting even that employment when securing of such\nemployment brings at least some succour to them. After all,\ninnumerable citizens of our vast country are in search of\nemployment and one is not compelled to accept a casual or\ntemporary employment if one is not inclined to go in for such\nan employment. It is in that context that one has to proceed\non the basis that the employment was accepted fully\nknowing the nature of it and the consequences flowing from\nit. In other words, even while accepting the employment, the\nperson concerned knows the nature of his employment. It is\nnot an appointment to a post in the real sense of the term.\nThe claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\ntemporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be\nconsidered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving\nup of the procedure established, for making regular\nappointments to available posts in the services of the State.\nThe argument that since one has been working for some time\nin the post, it will not be just to discontinue him, even\nthough he was aware of the nature of the employment when\nhe first took it up, is not one that would enable the\njettisoning of the procedure established by law for public\nemployment and would have to fail when tested on the\ntouchstone of constitutionality and equality of opportunity\nenshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n47. When a person enters a temporary employment or\ngets engagement as a contractual or casual worker and the\nengagement is not based on a proper selection as recognised\nby the relevant rules or procedure, he is aware of the\nconsequences of the appointment being temporary, casual or\ncontractual in nature. Such a person cannot invoke the\ntheory of legitimate expectation for being confirmed in the\npost when an appointment to the post could be made only by\nfollowing a proper procedure for selection and in cases\nconcerned, in consultation with the Public Service\nCommission. Therefore, the theory of legitimate expectation\ncannot be successfully advanced by temporary, contractual\nor casual employees. It cannot also be held that the State\nhas held out any promise while engaging these persons\neither to continue them where they are or to make them\npermanent. The State cannot constitutionally make such a\n- 13 -\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\npromise. It is also obvious that the theory cannot be invoked\nto seek a positive relief of being made permanent in the\npost.\"\n\n12. Reliance was also placed on decision in case of\n\nJoginder Singh v. Union of India, reported in 2015 SCC\n\nOnLine P&H 9348, wherein it was held as follows:\n\n\"6. From a perusal of the above terms and conditions\ngoverning the services of the petitioners, it is clear that all\nappointments were initially to be for a period of 12 months.\nHowever, as per clause 2, the services were renewable for a\nfurther period of 12 months at a time up to attainment of the\nmaximum age, as prescribed in Appendix-A attached to the\nScheme dated 22.09.2003 (as amended from time to time).\nAs per clause 2 of the Agreement, the renewal in the period\nof service was subject to only two riders i.e. good\nperformance and existence of work which would require the\nservices of the appointed person.\n..................\n\n10. So far as petitioners no. 2 to 4 are concerned,\nlearned counsel for the petitioners submitted that contractual\nemployees like the petitioners cannot be replaced by another\nset of contractual employees. The petitioners further allege\nmala fide on the part of respondent no. 5, who was their\nOfficer Incharge. It is submitted that respondent no. 5 falsely\nand for mala fide reasons, issued letters to the petitioners\npointing out acts of omission and commission on their part\nand asking them to improve their working. It is further the\ncase of the petitioners that respondent no. 5, in connivance\nwith respondent no. 4 - the Staff Commander, in order to\nwreck vengeance against the petitioners, did not renew their\nservices.\n\n....................\n\n12. The terms of the Scheme, under which the\npetitioners have been appointed and the Agreement of\nservice entered into between the parties bind them,\nespecially when the same remains unchallenged by either\nside. Clause 2 of the Agreement of service, as reproduced\nabove, clearly stipulates that the services of all the\nappointees like the petitioners, initially appointed for a period\nof 12 months, could be renewed, subject to good\n\n- 14 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nperformance and existence of work warranting such\nextension. The record of the case shows that the petitioners'\nwork and conduct has not been up to the mark. The record\nfurther reveals that the petitioners were put to adequate\nnotice with regard to their poor performance on several\noccasions, but to no avail. The streak of bad performance\ncontinued. Resultantly, the petitioners had not been granted\nrenewal in the period of their service. This is as per the\nScheme under which they had been appointed and the\nAgreement of service which binds them.\n\n......................\n\n15. Learned counsel for the petitioners have\nstrenuously urged before me that the petitioners, who were\ncontractual employees, could not be replaced by another set\nof contractual employees. To support their submission, they\nhave relied upon several judgments of the Apex Court, this\nCourt, as also other High Courts. In the case in hand, the\nposts in question are contractual in nature and as per\nthe Scheme, are required to be filled up only on\ncontractual basis. This part of the Scheme is not under\nchallenge by the petitioners. That being so, posts,\nwhich are contractual in nature, would necessarily be\nfilled up through employees, to be appointed on\ncontract. The judgments cited by the counsel for the\npetitioners pertain to posts, which are regular in\nnature, wherein directions have been issued not to\nreplace employees appointed on contract basis by\nanother set of contractual employees till regular\nappointments are made. In view of the facts of the\ncase in hand, this situation could not arise herein.\"\n\n13. Likewise, relied on decision of Punjab and Haryana\n\nHigh Court in case of Ex.Hav.\nJaspal Singh and others v\n\nUnion of India and others\n(LPA No.1205 of 2015) for\n\nproposition that non-grant of renewal of engagement on\n\ncontractual basis, would not be termination of services and\n\ncould not be challenged on ground of violation of principles of\n\nnatural justice.\n\n- 15 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n14. Reference was placed on decision in case of\nMohit\n\nDahiya v Delhi Pollution Control Committee\nreported in\n\n2020 SCC Online Del 2710, wherein it was held as follows:\n\n\"20. The matter can be looked at from another\nperspective. The second Vacancy Notice also throws\nlight on the nature of the post involved and it is\nevident that the posts of Trainee are purely temporary\nin nature and the scheme envisages the filling up of\nthe posts by Trainees and replaced only by Trainee. In\nthis background the Petitioner cannot have any\ngrievance once his engagement comes to an end by\nefflux of time, more particularly, when the policy is not\nunder challenge. In this context, I may refer to a judgment\nof the Kerala High Court in Resmi R.S. v. Government of\nIndia, Represented By Secretary to Government, Department\nof Women And Child Development, 2019 SCC OnLine Ker\n2649 wherein the Petitioners were working in different posts\nin the District Child Protection Units in various districts in the\nState and challenged the move to terminate their services to\ninduct another set of contract employees.\nReliance was\nplaced on\nPiara Singh\n(supra). The Court delved into the\nscheme of their appointment and came to a conclusion that\nthe very scheme provided that the appointment of the staff\nwas on contract basis and with a limited tenure. The reasons\nfor opting the specific method of engagement was mentioned\nin the guidelines therein. The Government had taken a\ncategorical stand, being the proponent of the scheme, that it\nwas a deliberate decision to appoint the staff only on contract\nbasis keeping the objective of the scheme in mind. In this\nbackground, the decision not to extend the contract of the\nemployees once recruited beyond the period or extended\nperiod for which they were recruited was sought to be\njustified. The Court held as follows:\n\n\"7. I have considered the contentions advanced. Reliance\nhas been placed by the learned counsel for the petitioners\non the decisions of the Apex Court and of this Court to\ncontend that one set of temporary employees are not\nliable to be substituted by another set which would result\nin arbitrary exercise of power. However, in the instant\ncase, the very scheme provides that appointment of staff\nis to be made on a contract basis and with a limited\n\n- 16 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\ntenure. The reasons for opting for such a method of\nengagement of staff are also specified in Ext. R 1(b)\nguidelines. The Central Government, who is the proponent\nof the scheme has also filed a statement stating that it\nwas a deliberate decision to appoint staff in the scheme\nonly on contract basis and this was intended with the best\ninterests of the scheme in mind. It is stated that the\nprocess for recruitment and employment of staff is to be\ncarried out by the Director, ICPS of the State in\nconsultation with the State Principal Secretary/Secretary,\nDepartment of Women and Child Development at State\nlevel. The District level staff is recruited by the concerned\nDistrict Magistrate. It is stated that in the instant case, the\ndecisions had been taken not to extend the contract of the\nemployees once recruited beyond the period or the\nextended period for which they had been recruited.\n\n8. Having considered the contentions of the parties and\nhaving gone through the decisions of the Apex Court, I am\nof the opinion that in the specific nature of the scheme as\nalso the appointments made and the intentions sought to\nbe achieved, the petitioners who were engaged on short\nterm contract basis would have absolutely no right to\ncontend that their services are not liable to be terminated\nand that they are entitled to continue beyond the period of\ncontract.\n\n9. This Court in its judgment in W.P. (C) No. 22402 of\n2018 and connected cases has considered the claim of\npersons appointed under the Mahatma Gandhi National\nRural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and\nhas held, after referring to all the judgments including the\nonce relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioners in\nthe instant case, that contractual employees under a\nScheme can have no right to claim that they are entitled\nto continue in service after the agreed term of contract is\nover. In the instant cases as well, it is not in dispute\nbefore me that the term of contract in respect of the\nemployees has expired. The decisions of the Apex Court\nrelied on do not apply to the situation on hand.\"\n\n21. Likewise, in the case of\nJoginder Singh v. Union of\nIndia\n, 2015 SCC OnLine P&H 9348, the High Court of Punjab\nand Haryana held as follows:\n\n- 17 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n\"15. Learned counsel for the petitioners have strenuously\nurged before me that the petitioners, who were\ncontractual employees, could not be replaced by another\nset of contractual employees. To support their submission,\nthey have relied upon several judgments of the Apex\nCourt, this Court, as also other High Courts. In the case in\nhand, the posts in question are contractual in nature and\nas per the Scheme, are required to be filled up only on\ncontractual basis. This part of the Scheme is not under\nchallenge by the petitioners. That being so, posts, which\nare contractual in nature, would necessarily be filled up\nthrough employees, to be appointed on contract. The\njudgments cited by the counsel for the petitioners pertain\nto posts, which are regular in nature, wherein directions\nhave been issued not to replace employees appointed on\ncontract basis by another set of contractual employees till\nregular appointments are made. In view of the facts of the\ncase in hand, this situation could not arise herein.\"\n\n22.\nIn view of the policy of the Respondent and the\nnature of appointment of the Petitioner and persuaded by the\n\njudgments\nreferred to above\n, this Court is of the opinion that\nthe Petitioner cannot claim any right to continue as the\nTrainee Engineer beyond the period of three years which was\nthe maximum period of engagement envisaged in the Policy.\nThere is admittedly no challenge to the Policy and rather the\nappointment itself was under the terms of the said Policy.\n\n23. Petitioner had lastly contended that even if his\nservices cannot be directed to be continued further, a\ndirection be issued to the Respondent to permit him to apply\nafresh and he be considered along with the other candidates\nunder the Vacancy Notice dated 13.03.2020. The said relief\ncannot be granted to the Petitioner in view of the stand of\nthe Respondent that the engagements are purely for the\npurpose of training and not to grant any employment and\ntherefore, the Policy does not envisage the same Trainees\nbeing appointed repeatedly as fresh graduates have to be\ngiven an opportunity to train themselves and gain\nexperience.\"\n\n- 18 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n15. Likewise, reliance was placed on decision in case of\n\nVidyavardhaka Sangha v. Y.D. Deshpande\n, reported in\n\n(2006) 12 SCC 482, wherein it was held as follows:\n\n\"4. It is now well-settled principle of law that the\nappointment made on probation/ad hoc basis for a specific\nperiod of time comes to an end by efflux of time and the\nperson holding such post can have no right to continue on\nthe post. In the instant case as noticed above, the respective\nrespondents have accepted the appointment including the\nterms and conditions stipulated in the appointment orders\nand joined the posts in question and continued on the said\nposts for some years. The respondents having accepted the\nterms and conditions stipulated in the appointment order and\nallowed the period for which they were appointed to have\nbeen elapsed by efflux of time, they are not now permitted to\nturn their back and say that their appointments could not be\nterminated on the basis of their appointment letters nor they\ncould be treated as temporary employees or on contract\nbasis. The submission made by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents to the said effect has no merit and is, therefore,\nliable to be rejected. It is also well-settled law by several\nother decisions of this Court that appointment on ad\nhoc basis/temporary basis comes to an end by efflux\nof time and persons holding such post have no right to\ncontinue on the post and ask for regularisation, etc.\"\n\n16. And on decision in case of\nInstitute of\n\nManagement Development, U.P. v. Pushpa Srivastava\n,\n\nreported in (1992) 4 SCC 33, wherein it was held:\n\n\"4. The respondent was first appointed in the appellant-\nInstitute as a Research Executive on a consolidated fixed\ncompensation of Rs 1,260 per month on contract basis for a\nperiod of three months. It was specifically stated in the order\nthat it was purely on ad hoc basis, liable for termination\nwithout any notice on either side.\n\n- 19 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n19. The following are clear from the above order:\n\n(i) The respondent was appointed on a contractual\nbasis.\n\n(ii) The post was to carry a consolidated pay of Rs 2400\nper month.\n\n(iii) The duration of appointment was six months from\nthe date of the respondent joining charge.\n\n(iv) It is purely on ad hoc basis.\n\n(v) It is terminable without any notice.\n\n20. Because the six months' period was coming to an\nend on February 28, 1991, she preferred the writ petition a\nfew days before and prayed for mandamus which was\ngranted by the learned Judge under the impugned judgment.\nThe question is whether the directions are valid in law. To\nour mind, it is clear that where the appointment is\ncontractual and by efflux of time, the appointment\ncomes to an end, the respondent could have no right to\ncontinue in the post. Once this conclusion is arrived at,\nwhat requires to be examined is, in view of the\nservices of the respondent being continued from time\nto time on 'ad hoc' basis for more than a year whether\nshe is entitled to regularisation? The answer should be\nin the negative. ......\"\n\n17. In reply, learned counsel for petitioner relied on\n\ndecision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Manish Gupta v.\n\nJan Bhagidari Samiti, reported in (2022) 15 SCC 540,\n\nwherein it held as follows:\n\n\"13. A perusal of the advertisement dated 24-6-2016\nissued by the Principal, Government Kamla Raja Girls Post\nGraduate Autonomous College, Gwalior, which is at Annexure\nP-2 of the appeal paperbook and the advertisement dated 2-\n7-2016 issued by the Principal, SMS Government Model\nScience College, Gwalior, M.P., which is at Annexure P-3 of\nthe appeal paperbook, would show that the appointments\nwere to be made after the candidates had gone through due\nselection procedure. Though Shri Nataraj, learned ASG has\n\n- 20 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nstrenuously urged that the appointments of the appellants\nwere as guest lecturers and not as ad hoc employees, from\nthe nature of the advertisements, it could clearly be seen\nthat the appellants were appointed on ad hoc basis. It is a\nsettled principle of law that an ad hoc employee\ncannot be replaced by another ad hoc employee and he\ncan be replaced only by another candidate who is\nregularly appointed by following a regular procedure\nprescribed. Reliance in this respect can be placed on the\njudgment of this Court in\nRattan Lal v. State of\nHaryana [Rattan Lal\nv. State of Haryana, (1985) 4 SCC 43:\n\n1985 SCC (L&S) 938] and on the order of this Court\nin Hargurpratap Singh v. State of Punjab [Hargurpratap\nSingh v. State of Punjab, (2007) 13 SCC 292: (2008) 2 SCC\n(L&S) 618].\"\n\n18. Reference was also made to ratio in case of\n\nMahanadi Coalfields Ltd. v. Brajrajnagar Coal Mines\n\nWorkers' Union\n, reported in 2024 SCC OnLine SC 270, as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"27. We are also not impressed with the artificial\ndistinction which the appellant sought to bring about\nbetween the 19 workers who were regularized and the\n13 workers who were left out. The evidence on record\ndiscloses that, of the total 32 workmen, 19 workers worked\nin the bunker, 6 worked in the Coal Handling Plant, and 7\nworked on the railway siding. However, of the 19 workers\nwho were regularized, 16 worked in the bunker, and 3\nworked in the Coal Handling Plant. However, 3 workers from\nthe same bunker, 3 workers from the same Coal Handling\nPlant and again 7 workers from the same railway siding were\nnot regularized. A tabulated representation of the above\ndescription is as follows:\n\nSite of work No. of workers No. of workers No. of workers\nexecuted regularized not regularized\nworks\n\nBunker 19 16 3\n\nCoal Handling\n\n6 3 3\n\nPlant\n\n- 21 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nRailway Siding 7 - 7\n\nTotal: 32 19 13\n\n28. The above-referred facts speak for themselves, and\nthat is the reason why the Tribunal has come to a conclusion\nthat the denial of regularization of the 13 workmen is wholly\nunjustified. As stated previously, we do not find any grounds\nin the artificial distinction asserted by the appellant.\n\nHowever, as the case was argued at length we thought it\nappropriate to give reasons for rejecting the appeals. What\nwe have referred to hereinabove are all findings of fact by\nthe Tribunal as affirmed by the High Court. In view of the\nconcurrent findings of fact on the issue of nature of\nwork, the continuing nature of work, continuous\nworking of the workmen, we are of the opinion that\nthere is no merit in the appeals filed by the appellant.\"\n\n19. He also relied on decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nin case of\nSheo Narain Nagar v. State of U.P.\n, reported in\n\n(2018) 13 SCC 432, holding as follows:\n\n\"9. The High Court dismissed the writ application relying\non the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. But the\nappellants were employed basically in the year 1993; they\nhad rendered service for three years, when they were offered\nthe service on contract basis; it was not the case of back\ndoor entry; and there were no Rules in place for offering\nsuch kind of appointment. Thus, the appointment could not\nbe said to be illegal and in contravention of Rules, as there\nwere no such Rules available at the relevant point of time,\nwhen their temporary status was conferred w.e.f. 2-10-2002.\n\nThe appellants were required to be appointed on regular\nbasis as a one-time measure, as\nlaid down in\npara 53\nof\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. Since the appellants had\ncompleted 10 years of service and temporary status had\nbeen given by the respondents with retrospective effect from\n2-10-2002, we direct that the services of the appellants be\nregularised from the said date i.e. 2-10-2002, consequential\n\n- 22 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nbenefits and the arrears of pay also to be paid to the\nappellants within a period of three months from today.\n\n10. Impugned judgment and order [\nSheo Narain\nNagar v. State of U.P.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine All 16492] and also\norder terminating the services are hereby quashed. The\nappeal is, accordingly, allowed. Pending application, stands\ndisposed of.\"\n\n20.\nIn support of his contention that Courts could\n\ninterfere even with policy decisions of State if it was arbitrary\n\nand irrational, reliance was placed on decision of Allahabad\n\nHigh Court in case of\nKalamuddin and others v. State of U.P\n\nand others\n(W.A.no.3451/2022, DD: 27.03.2023).\n\n21. Likewise, in support of submission that there would\n\nbe no absolute bar against participant challenging selection,\n\nfollowing observations in case of\nMeeta Sahai v. State of\n\nBihar\n, reported in (2019) 20 SCC 17, were referred to:\n\n\"15. Furthermore, before beginning analysis of the\nlegal issues involved, it is necessary to first address the\npreliminary issue. The maintainability of the very challenge\nby the appellant has been questioned on the ground that she\nhaving partaken in the selection process cannot later\nchallenge it due to mere failure in selection. The counsel for\nthe respondents relied upon a catena of decisions of this\nCourt to substantiate his objection.\n\n16. It is well settled that the principle of estoppel\nprevents a candidate from challenging the selection process\nafter having failed in it as iterated by this Court in a plethora\nof judgments including Manish Kumar Shahi v. State of\nBihar [Manish Kumar Shahi v. State of Bihar, (2010) 12 SCC\n\n- 23 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n576: (2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 256] , observing as follows: (SCC\np. 584, para 16)\n\n\"16. We also agree with the High Court [\nManish Kumar\nShahi v. State of Bihar\n, 2008 SCC OnLine Pat 321:\n\n(2008) 4 PLJR 93] that after having taken part in the\nprocess of selection knowing fully well that more than\n19% marks have been earmarked for viva voce test,\nthe appellant is not entitled to challenge the criteria or\nprocess of selection. Surely, if the appellant's name had\nappeared in the merit list, he would not have even\ndreamed of challenging the selection. The [appellant]\ninvoked jurisdiction of the High Court under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution of India only after he found that his\nname does not figure in the merit list prepared by the\nCommission. This conduct of the appellant clearly\ndisentitles him from questioning the selection and the\nHigh Court did not commit any error by refusing to\nentertain the writ petition.\"\n\n[See also: Madan Lal v. State of J&K, (1995) 3 SCC 486 :\n\n1995 SCC (L&S) 712, Marripati Nagaraja v. State of A.P.,\n(2007) 11 SCC 522 : (\n2008) 1 SCC (L&S) 68, Dhananjay\nMalik v. State of Uttaranchal\n, (2008) 4 SCC 171 : (\n2008) 1\nSCC (L&S) 1005 and K.A. Nagamani v. Indian Airlines\n,\n(2009) 5 SCC 515 : (2009) 2 SCC (L&S) 57]\n\nThe underlying objective of this principle is to prevent\ncandidates from trying another shot at consideration, and to\navoid an impasse wherein every disgruntled candidate,\nhaving failed the selection, challenges it in the hope of\ngetting a second chance.\n\n17. However, we must differentiate from this principle\ninsofar as the candidate by agreeing to participate in the\nselection process only accepts the prescribed procedure and\nnot the illegality in it. In a situation where a candidate\nalleges misconstruction of statutory rules and\ndiscriminating consequences arising therefrom, the\nsame cannot be condoned merely because a candidate\nhas partaken in it. The constitutional scheme is sacrosanct\nand its violation in any manner is impermissible. In fact, a\ncandidate may not have locus to assail the incurable illegality\nor derogation of the provisions of the Constitution, unless\nhe/she participates in the selection process.\"\n\n- 24 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n22. And relying on decision of this Court in case of\n\nUmesha T.N and others v. State of Karnataka and Ors\n.\n\n(W.P.No.19588/2023, DD 09.05.2024), it was lastly contended,\n\neven in case, direction for reinstatement could not be granted;\n\nrelief of payment of compensation, could be granted.\n\n23. Heard learned counsel and perused writ petition\n\nrecords.\n\n24. From above, it is seen petitioners appointed on\n\ncontractual basis for fixed period have sought prayers for\n\nquashing selection list; for direction to continue their services\n\ntill regular appointments; for directing respondent-employer to\n\nframe rules providing weightage on basis of experience and for\n\nregularization of their services etc. Petitions are opposed\n\nmainly on ground of principle of estoppel having accepted\n\nappointment on contractual basis for limited term, estoppel\n\nagainst challenging selection after having participated in\n\nselection process, bar against grant of directions for\n\nregularization in view of decision in\nUmadevi\n's case (supra)\n\nand no right to seek continuation in view of lack of sanctioned\n\npost.\n\n- 25 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n25.\nInsofar as contention about petitioners having\n\nparticipated in selection process and bar against challenging\n\nselection process, there cannot be dispute about proposition of\n\nlaw that participant in selection process would be barred from\n\nchallenging selection process, in view of ratio in\nMadras\n\nInstitute of Development Studies v. K.\n\nSivasubramaniyan\n, reported in (2016) 1 SCC 454, but, in\n\ninstant case, petitioners are not claiming to be aggrieved by\n\nany condition in selection notification. As rightly contended,\n\npetitioners allege irregularities/illegalities in selection process\n\nwherein persons especially respondent no.16 who would not be\n\nqualified as per conditions mentioned in selection notification\n\nbeing selected.\n\n26. Further, in their statement of objections,\n\nrespondents no.1 to 5 have stated that selection list was\n\nprepared by adopting additional condition of 5 years\n\nexperience. Perusal of recruitment notification at Annexure-N\n\nreveals that said condition was not notified. In light of specific\n\ncontention that candidates whose names notified in Annexure-\n\nA, did not meet said requirement, specifically show in case of\n\nrespondent no.16 whose name is mentioned at Sl.no.11 which\n\nhas not been seriously controverted by respondents no.1 to 5\n\n- 26 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nwould require to be examined by them. Therefore, petitioners'\n\ncase would fall within distinguishing circumstances mentioned\n\nin\nMeeta Sahai\n's case (supra).\n\n27.\nInsofar as adoption of additional criteria for\n\nselection than notified, said issue would be squarely covered by\n\ndecision in case of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nK.\n\nManjusree v. State of A.P.\n, reported in (2008) 3 SCC 512:\n\n\"27. But what could not have been done was the second\nchange, by introduction of the criterion of minimum marks\nfor the interview. The minimum marks for interview had\nnever been adopted by the Andhra Pradesh High Court\nearlier for selection of District & Sessions Judges, (Grade II).\nIn regard to the present selection, the Administrative\nCommittee merely adopted the previous procedure in vogue.\nThe previous procedure as stated above was to apply\nminimum marks only for written examination and not for the\noral examination. We have referred to the proper\ninterpretation of the earlier Resolutions dated 24-7-2001 and\n21-2-2002 and held that what was adopted on 30-11-2004\nwas only minimum marks for written examination and not for\nthe interviews. Therefore, introduction of the requirement of\nminimum marks for interview, after the entire selection\nprocess (consisting of written examination and interview)\nwas completed, would amount to changing the rules of the\ngame after the game was played which is clearly\nimpermissible. We are fortified in this view by several\ndecisions of this Court. It is sufficient to refer to three of\nthem --\nP.K. Ramachandra Iyer v. Union of India\n[(1984) 2\nSCC 141: 1984 SCC (L&S) 214], Umesh Chandra\nShukla v. Union of India [(1985) 3 SCC 721: 1985 SCC (L&S)\n919] and Durgacharan Misra v. State of Orissa [(1987) 4\nSCC 646: 1988 SCC (L&S) 36: (1987) 5 ATC 148].\n\n28. In Ramachandra Iyer [(1984) 2 SCC 141 : 1984\nSCC (L&S) 214] this Court was considering the validity of a\nselection process under the ICAR Rules, 1977 which provided\nfor minimum marks only in the written examination and did\n\n- 27 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nnot envisage obtaining minimum marks in the interview. But\nthe Recruitment Board (ASRB) prescribed a further\nqualification of obtaining minimum marks in the interview\nalso. This Court observed that the power to prescribe\nminimum marks in the interview should be explicit and\ncannot be read by implication for the obvious reason that\nsuch deviation from the Rules is likely to cause irreparable\nand irreversible harm. This Court held that as there was no\npower under the Rules for the Selection Board to prescribe\nthe additional qualification of securing minimum marks in the\ninterview, the restriction was impermissible and had a direct\nimpact on the merit list because the merit list was to be\nprepared according to the aggregate marks obtained by the\ncandidates at written test and interview. This Court\nobserved: (SCC p. 181, para 44)\n\n\"44. ... Once an additional qualification of\nobtaining minimum marks at the viva voce test is\nadhered to, a candidate who may figure high up in\nthe merit list was likely to be rejected on the\nground that he has not obtained minimum\nqualifying marks at viva voce test. To illustrate, a\ncandidate who has obtained 400 marks at the\nwritten test and obtained 38 marks at the viva\nvoce test, if considered on the aggregate of marks\nbeing 438 was likely to come within the zone of\nselection, but would be eliminated by ASRB on the\nground that he has not obtained qualifying marks\nat viva voce test. This was impermissible and\ncontrary to Rules and the merit list prepared in\ncontravention of Rules cannot be sustained.\"\n\n29. In Umesh Chandra [(1985) 3 SCC 721 : 1985 SCC\n(L&S) 919] the scope of the Delhi Judicial Service Rules,\n1970 came up for consideration. The Rules provided that\nthose who secured the prescribed minimum qualifying marks\nin the written examination will be called for viva voce; and\nthat the marks obtained in the viva voce shall be added to\nthe marks obtained in the written test and the candidate's\nranking shall depend on the aggregate of both. 27 candidates\nwere found eligible to appear for viva voce on the basis of\ntheir having secured the minimum prescribed marks in the\nwritten examination. The final list was therefore, expected to\nbe prepared by merely adding the viva voce marks to the\nwritten examination marks in regard to those 27 candidates.\nBut the final list that was prepared contained some new\n\n- 28 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nnames which were not in the list of 27 candidates who\npassed the written examination. Some names were omitted\nfrom the list of 27 candidates who passed the written\nexamination.\n\n30. It was found that the Selection Committee had\nmoderated the written examination marks by an addition of\n2% for all the candidates, as a result of which some\ncandidates who did not get through the written examination,\nbecame eligible for viva voce and came into the list.\nSecondly, the Selection Committee prescribed for selection, a\nminimum aggregate of 600 marks in the written examination\nand viva voce which was not provided in the Rules and that\nresulted in some of the names in the list of 27 candidates\nbeing omitted. This Court held neither was permissible.\nDealing with the prescription of minimum 600 marks in the\naggregate this Court observed: (Umesh Chandra\ncase [(1985) 3 SCC 721 : 1985 SCC (L&S) 919] , SCC pp.\n735-36, para 14)\n\n\"14. ... There is no power reserved under Rule 18 of the\nRules for the High Court to fix its own minimum marks\nin order to include candidates in the final list. It is\nstated in Para 7 of the counter-affidavit filed in Writ\nPetition No. 4363 of 1985 that the Selection Committee\nhas inherent power to select candidates who according\nto it are suitable for appointment by prescribing the\nminimum marks which a candidate should obtain in the\naggregate in order to get into the Delhi Judicial Service.\n... But on going through the Rules, we are of the view\nthat no fresh disqualification or bar may be created by\nthe High Court or the Selection Committee merely on\nthe basis of the marks obtained at the examination\nbecause Clause (6) of the Appendix itself has laid down\nthe minimum marks which a candidate should obtain in\nthe written papers or in the aggregate in order to\nqualify himself to become a member of the Judicial\nService. The prescription of the minimum of 600 marks\nin the aggregate by the Selection Committee as an\nadditional requirement which the candidate has to\nsatisfy amounts to an amendment of what is prescribed\nby Clause (6) of the Appendix. ... We are of the view\nthat the Selection Committee has no power to prescribe\nthe minimum marks which a candidate should obtain in\nthe aggregate different from the minimum already\nprescribed by the Rules in its Appendix. We are,\n\n- 29 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\ntherefore, of the view that the exclusion of the names\nof certain candidates, who had not secured 600 marks\nin the aggregate including marks obtained at the viva\nvoce test from the list prepared under Rule 18 of the\nRules is not legal.\"\n\n31. In Durgacharan Misra [(1987) 4 SCC 646 : 1988\nSCC (L&S) 36 : (1987) 5 ATC 148] this Court was\nconsidering the selection under the Orissa Service Rules\nwhich did not prescribe any minimum qualifying marks to be\nsecured in viva voce for selection of Munsifs. The Rules\nmerely required that after the viva voce test the State Public\nService Commission shall add the marks of the viva voce test\nto the marks in the written test. But the State Public Service\nCommission which was the selecting authority prescribed\nminimum qualifying marks for the viva voce test also. This\nCourt held that the Commission had no power to prescribe\nthe minimum standard at viva voce test for determining the\nsuitability of candidates for appointment of Munsifs.\n\n32.\nIn\nMaharashtra SRTC v. Rajendra Bhimrao\nMandve\n[(2001) 10 SCC 51 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 720] this Court\nobserved that \"the rules of the game, meaning thereby, that\nthe criteria for selection cannot be altered by the authorities\nconcerned in the middle or after the process of selection has\ncommenced\". In this case the position is much more serious.\nHere, not only the rules of the game were changed, but they\nwere changed after the game had been played and the\nresults of the game were being awaited. That is unacceptable\nand impermissible.\n\n33. The Resolution dated 30-11-2004 merely adopted\nthe procedure prescribed earlier. The previous procedure was\nnot to have any minimum marks for interview. Therefore,\nextending the minimum marks prescribed for written\nexamination, to interviews, in the selection process is\nimpermissible. We may clarify that prescription of minimum\nmarks for any interview is not illegal. We have no doubt that\nthe authority making rules regulating the selection, can\nprescribe by rules, the minimum marks both for written\nexamination and interviews, or prescribe minimum marks for\nwritten examination but not for interview, or may not\nprescribe any minimum marks for either written examination\nor interview. Where the rules do not prescribe any\nprocedure, the Selection Committee may also prescribe\n\n- 30 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nthe minimum marks, as stated above. But if the\nSelection Committee wants to prescribe minimum\nmarks for interview, it should do so before the\ncommencement of selection process. If the Selection\nCommittee prescribed minimum marks only for the\nwritten examination, before the commencement of\nselection process, it cannot either during the selection\nprocess or after the selection process, add an\nadditional requirement that the candidates should also\nsecure minimum marks in the interview. What we have\nfound to be illegal, is changing the criteria after\ncompletion of the selection process, when the entire\nselection proceeded on the basis that there will be no\nminimum marks for the interview.\"\n\n28. Consequently, as held in case of\nP.K.\n\nRamachandra Iyer v. Union of India\n, reported in (1984) 2\n\nSCC 141, referred to in above decision, selection list prepared\n\nin pursuance of illegal selection process cannot be saved.\n\nHence, impugned selection list at Annexure-A, cannot be\n\nsustained.\n\n29.\nInsofar as prayer for regularization and for\n\ncontinuation till regular appointments are made, decision in\n\nUmadevi\n's case (supra) especially in view of uncontroverted\n\nassertion of respondents that petitioners' appointments were\n\nnot against any sanctioned posts, without establishing\n\nsatisfaction with three conditions mentioned in paragraph 53 of\n\nUmadevi\n's case (supra), prayer for regularization would be\n\nuntenable.\n\n- 31 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n30. However reasons assigned by official respondents\n\nfor making ad hoc/contractual arrangements requires to be\n\nexamined. There are various devices/strategies and arguments\n\nadopted by managements to avoid compliances with welfare\n\nschemes.\n\n31. Though there is no dispute about core business of\n\nrespondents no.1 to 5 being generation of power and not\n\nestablishment/management of hospital/clinics, but said\n\nmeasure was undertaken to ensure health of their staff,\n\nperhaps as location of power generation units were away from\n\ntownships and in remote areas. Duty to take care of health\n\nrequirements would be incidental to if not part of main object of\n\nemployer. Therefore, said requirement would co-exist with\n\nemployment and as such, perennial in nature. However,\n\nrespondents no.1 to 5 and 20 as employer/management would\n\nbe entitled to take policy decision about manner of providing\n\nfor such need.\n\n32. While faced with similar contentions, Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court expressed need for piercing corporate veil\n\nbehind same, with following observations in case of\n\nHussainbhai v. Alath Factory Thezhilali Union\n, reported in\n\n(1978) 4 SCC 257:\n\n- 32 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n\"4. This argument is impeccable in laissez\nfaire economics \"red in tooth and claw\" and under the\n\nContract Act\nrooted in English Common Law. But the human\ngap of a century yawns between this strict doctrine and\nindustrial jurisprudence. The source and strength of the\nindustrial branch of Third World Jurisprudence is social\njustice proclaimed in the Preamble to the Constitution. This\nCourt in Ganesh Beedi case [(1974) 4 SCC 43: 1974 SCC\n(L&S) 204: (1974) 1 LLJ 367] has raised on British and\nAmerican rulings to hold that mere contracts are not decisive\nand the complex of considerations relevant to the\nrelationship is different. Indian Justice, beyond Atlantic\nliberalism, has a rule of law which runs to the aid of the Rule\nof life. And life, in conditions of poverty aplenty, is livelihood,\nand livelihood is work with wages. Raw societal realities, not\nfine-spun legal niceties, not competitive market economics\nbut complex protective principles, shape the law when the\nweaker, working class sector needs succour for livelihood\nthrough labour. The conceptual confusion between the\nclassical law of contracts and the special branch of law\nsensitive to exploitative situations accounts for the\nsubmission that the High Court is in error in its holding\nagainst the petitioner.\n\n5. The true test may, with brevity, be indicated once\nagain. Where a worker or group of workers labours to\nproduce goods or services and these goods or services are\nfor the business of another, that other is, in fact, the\nemployer. He has economic control over the workers'\nsubsistence, skill, and continued employment. If he, for any\nreason, chokes off, the worker is, virtually, laid off. The\npresence of intermediate contractors with whom alone the\nworkers have immediate or direct relationship ex contractu is\nof no consequence when, on lifting the veil or looking at the\nconspectus of factors governing employment, we discern the\nnaked truth, though draped in different perfect paper\narrangement, that the real employer is the Management, not\nthe immediate contractor. Myriad devices, half-hidden in fold\nafter fold of legal form depending on the degree of\nconcealment needed, the type of industry, the local\nconditions and the like may be resorted to when labour\nlegislation casts welfare obligations on the real employer,\nbased on\nArticles 38\n, 39\n, 42\n, 43\nand\n43-A\nof the\nConstitution. The court must be astute to avoid the\nmischief and achieve the purpose of the law and not be\nmisled by the maya of legal appearances.\n\n- 33 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\n6. If the livelihood of the workmen substantially\ndepends on labour rendered to produce goods and services\nfor the benefit and satisfaction of an enterprise, the absence\nof direct relationship or the presence of dubious\nintermediaries or the make-believe trappings of detachment\nfrom the Management cannot snap the real life-bond. The\nstory may vary but the inference defies ingenuity. The\nliability cannot be shaken off.\"\n\n33. Thus, as long as respondents no.1 to 5 and 20\n\ndecide to continue present manner of serving said need, as\n\nheld in Sheo Narain Nagar, Manish Gupta and Mahanadi\n\nCoalfields Ltd. cases (supra), claims of petitioners for\n\ncontinuation until regular appointments are made would require\n\nconsideration.\n\n34. Insofar as prayer for framing rules providing for\n\nweightage to petitioners on basis of their service experience,\n\nit is seen same would be in nature of direction to legislate.\n\nAs held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nState of\n\nJammu and Kashmir v. A.R.Zakki and Ors\nreported in\n\nAIR 1992 SC 1546, prayer for direction to legislate would\n\nnot be tenable. Said prayer is accordingly rejected.\n\n35. At same time, it would be apposite to clarify that\n\npetitioner's claim for continuation cannot be absolute. In case,\n\nas stated by learned counsel for respondents no.1 to 5 and 20\n\n- 34 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC-D:13675\n\nWP No. 106025 of 2023\n\nthat said respondents may outsource provision of healthcare to\n\nits employees in toto, same cannot be challenged or opposed\n\nby petitioners. In such case, they would be entitled to claim\n\nretrenchment compensation by relying upon Umesha T.N's\n\ncase (supra).\n\nIn terms of above, writ petition is disposed of.\n\nSd/-\n\n(RAVI V.HOSMANI)\nJUDGE\n\nEM,AM\nCT-ASC\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 51",
