  "text": "(Passed on day of April, 2017)\n\nPer :Ved Prakash Sharma, J.\n\nA Division Bench of this Court comprising two of us\n(Hon'ble Shri Justice P.K. Jaiswal and Hon'ble Shri Justice\nVirender Singh) while considering the prayer for suspension of\ncustodial sentence under Section 389(1) of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973 (for short 'the Code') in Cr.A. No.1248/2005\nexpressing its reservation to subscribe to the legal proposition made\nby a co-ordinate Bench (Gwalior Bench) of this Court in Raghuvar Cr.A. No.1248/2005 2 Singh @ Raghuveer Singh vs. State of M.P. , reported in 2015 (2)\nJLJ 218, has referred the question of law to be answered by a larger\nBench. Pursuant to this Hon'ble the Chief Justice has been pleased\nto constitute this Bench. The question of law referred to this Bench\nis as follows :\n\n02. A brief conspectus of the facts relevant to unfold the\ncontroversy is as under :\n\n03. Appellant Dashrath, vide judgment dated 20.06.2005\nrendered in S.T. No.15/15 by learned First Additional Sessions\nJudge, Mandsaur, was convicted for offences punishable under Section 376 & 302 of IPC, 1860 (for short 'the IPC ') for\nsubjecting 10 years old girl child to rape and committing her\nmurder. He was ordered to suffer RI for 10 years with fine of\nRs.1000/- under Section 376 of IPC and further to suffer life\nimprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- under Section 302 of\nIPC with usual default stipulation.\n\n04. The conviction and sentence was challenged by the\nappellant by way of criminal appeal No.1248/2005. He also made\nan application for suspension of sentence and grant of bail which Cr.A. No.1248/2005 3 came to be rejected on 16.04.2007 as not pressed. Repeat\napplication for suspension of sentence in terms of Section 389 of\n'the Code' was rejected on merits, vide order dated 02.11.2015.\n\n05. Third application for suspension under Section 389 of\nCr.P.C. was moved primarily on the ground that the appellant is in\njail since 20.10.2004 and has thus suffered a jail sentence of more\nthan 11 years 9 months. It was submitted that the final hearing of\nthe appeal is likely to take sufficient long period, therefore, the\nsentence imposed against the appellant be suspended. The learned\ncounsel for the appellant in support of the plea for suspension\npressed into service the decision rendered by a Division Bench of\nthis Court (Gwalior Bench) in Raghuvar Singh @ Raghuveer\nSingh (supra), wherein it has been held that the factor of\nprolonged post-conviction incarceration, bleak possibility of the\nappeal coming up for final hearing in near future and the appellant\nnot having misused the liberty for temporary bail granted earlier\nand absence of criminal antecedents outweigh the gravity of\noffence and the manner of commission of the offence. In para-8 of\nthe report, the Bench posed to itself the following question:-\n\n06. Referring to decisions rendered by the apex Court in Kashmira Singh vs. State of Punjab reported in (1977) 4 SCC Cr.A. No.1248/2005 4 291, Babu Singh vs. State of U.P. reported in (1978) 1 SCC 579\nand Shailendra Kumar vs. State of Delhi reported in (2000) 4\nSCC 178, the Court observed that an appeal being continuation of\ntrial, the conviction, though binding on the parties is not final\nand remains subject to the appellate order as and when passed.\nThe Court went on observing that while considering an\napplication under Section 389 of 'the Code' at the initial stage of\nthe appeal, the merits of the case are seen, though perfunctorily, to\nascertain justifiability of release on bail; however, when\nsubstantial part of the sentence is suffered with no foreseeable\nhope of final hearing in the appeal in near future, 'the factor of\nmerit involving gravity of offence, nature of commission of\noffence and quality of evidence on record, takes a backseat' and\ninstead, the factors pertaining to the post-conviction period, i.e.\n'period of custody, post-conviction behaviour, instances of\nmisuse of bail, age, possibility of hearing of the appeal in near\nfuture and efforts made by the counsel for convict to get the\nappeal heard,' assume prominence and primacy. Accordingly, the\nBench felt inclined to suspend the sentence of life imprisonment\nthat was imposed against the appellant.\n\n07. The Division Bench in Criminal Appeal No.1248/2005\nhas been of the view that Hon'ble the Supreme Court in a catena\nof decisions has consistently held that mere fact of incarceration\nfor a certain period nor the fact that the trial is not likely to be\nconcluded in the near future either by itself or with the period of\nincarceration, would not be sufficient to enlarge a person on\nbail, when the gravity of the offence alleged is severe.\nResultantly, expressing its inability to subscribe to the view taken Cr.A. No.1248/2005 5 by the co-ordinate Division Bench in Raghuvar Singh @\nRaghuveer Singh (supra), the matter was referred to larger\nBench.\n\n08. Shri C.L. Yadav, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the appellant referring to decisions of the apex Court in Kashmira Singh (supra), Hussainara Khatun vs. Home Secretary,\nState of Bihar , AIR 1979 SC 1360, Smt. Akhtari Bi vs. State, AIR\n2001 SC 1528, Moti Lal Saraf vs. State of Jammu & Kashmir , AIR 2007 SC 56 and Bhagwan Rama Shinde Gosai & Ors. vs.\nState of Gujarat , AIR 1999 SC 1859, has submitted before us that\nright to speedy trial is a fundamental right being implicit in the\nbroad sweep of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as interpreted\nby the apex Court in Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India reported\nin AIR 1978 SC 597. It is further submitted that as held in Akhtari\nBi (supra), the trial Court's verdict does not attain finality during\nthe pendency of the appeal and for that purpose trial is deemed to be\ncontinuing despite conviction of an accused. The contention is that\nspeedy trial being a fundamental right, the State is under an\nobligation that the criminal matters particularly, criminal appeals\nare disposed of expeditiously. The further submission is that since\nthe Criminal Appeals filed in 1998, 1999 and the year 2000 are still\nwaiting for their turn to be taken for final hearing, therefore, the\nappellants, who are in jail and have suffered substantial part of the\nsentence imposed against them, deserve to be released on bail under Section 389 of 'the Code'.\n\n09. The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant has also referred to decisions of the apex Court in Kamal\nvs. State of Haryana , (2004) 13 SCC 526, A.E. Premanand vs. Cr.A. No.1248/2005 6 Escorts Finance Ltd. & Ors.,(2004) 13 SCC 527 and Salim Javed\nvs. State of Rajsthan, (2006) 9 SCC 602, where Hon'ble the apex\nCourt has been pleased to grant suspension on account of the\nimprisonment suffered by appellant in cases where the appellant\nwas sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a term. Noticeably,\nnone of these cases relates to sentence of life imprisonment.\n\n10. Per contra, referring to the decisions of the apex Court in Kishori Lal vs. Rupa and others reported in ( 2004) 7 SCC 638,\nAnil Ari vs. State of West Bengal , ( 2009) 11 SCC 363 and State of\nHaryana vs. Hasmat , (2004) 6 SCC 175, it is submitted by Shri\nSunil Jain, learned Additional Advocate General that in exercise of\npowers under Section 389 of 'the Code' the appellate Court has to\ndecide about the question of suspension of sentence on the basis of\nall relevant aspects of the case including seriousness of the crime\nand that no straight jacket formula can be laid down with regard to\nsuspension of sentence.\n\n11. Learned Senior Counsel Shri P.K. Saxena has also\naddressed the Court. It is submitted by him that this Court cannot re-\nwrite the provisions of Section 389 of 'the Code' by formulating\nthat an appellant who has served 12 years or more imprisonment,\nbeing substantive part of the sentence imposed against him, is\nentitled for suspension of sentence and release on bail. The\ncontention is that prescribing any time limit in this regard will\namount to judicial legislation which is not permissible under the\nscheme of the things. It is further submitted that though an appeal is\nrequired to be disposed of within a reasonable time, however, there\nis difference between a person facing a trial who carries with him a\npresumption of innocence and a person who has been found guilty Cr.A. No.1248/2005 7 and has preferred appeal against conviction in which case the\npresumptions of innocence is no more available. The contention is\nthat prescription of any time limit may rather prove counter-\nproductive in the sense that those accused who on merits of the case\ndeserve suspension of their sentence within a year or so of filing of\nappeal, in such a situation will have to wait for 12 years and thus,\nthe remedy may prove worst than the malady itself. Lastly, it is\nsubmitted that the jurisdiction under Section 389 (1) of 'the Code'\ncannot be bracketed within any airthmetical formula as it cannot be\nsaid that every person who has challenged the conviction is\nultimately going to be acquitted.\n\n12. We have bestowed our anxious consideration to the\nsubmissions raised at the Bar and have gone through the record.\n\n13. Section 389 of 'the Code', which falls under Chapter\nXXIX, reads as follows:\n\n[Provided that the Appellate Court shall, before\nreleasing on bail or on his own bond a convicted\nperson who is convicted of an offence punishable with\ndeath or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a\nterm of not less than ten years, shall give opportunity\nto the Public Prosecutor for showing cause in writing\nagainst such release:\n\n14. Inordinate delay in disposal of criminal appeals at the\nlevel of High Court has been a perennial problem faced by the\njudicial system and time to time the apex Court has attempted to\naddress the same. Expressing its deep concern over delay in\ndisposal of Criminal Appeals, the apex Court in the case of\nAkhtari Bi (supra), observed as under (para-5) :\n\n15. In Moti Lal Saraf (supra), the apex Court observed that\nspeedy trial is one of the facets of the fundamental right to life and\nliberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the\nlaw must ensure 'reasonable, just and fair' procedure which has a\ncreative connotation after the decision in Maneka Gandhi 's case\n(supra).\n\n16. In Kashmira Singh (supra), another case relied upon by\nthe learned counsel for the appellant, the apex Court in para-2 of the\nreport had expressed its concern in the following words :\n\nHon'ble the apex Court in view of the aforesaid further\nheld that:\n\n17. Another case on which strong reliance has been placed\nby the learned Counsel for the appellants is that of Babu Singh vs.\nState of U.P. , (1978) 1 SCC 579, wherein the apex Court\nobserved, that, the significance and sweep of Article 21 of the\nConstitution make the deprivation of liberty a matter of grave\nconcern and permissible only when the law authorising it is\nreasonable, even-handed and geared to the goals of community\ngood as spelt out in Article 19.\n\n18. In Surinder Singh alias Shingara Singh vs. State of\nPunjab , AIR 2005 SC 3669, Hon'ble the apex Court had an\noccasion to consider the sweep and objective of the observations\nmade by it in the cases of Kashmira Singh (supra), Akhtari Bi\n(supra) and Babu Singh (supra) and observed that none of the\ndecisions lay down any invariable rule for grant of bail on\ncompletion of a specified period of detention in custody as in a\ndiscretionary matter, like grant or refusal of bail, it would be\nimpossible to lay down any invariable rule or evolve a strait jacket\nformula. Relevant observations run as under:\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n19. In Kishori Lal Vs. Rupa and Others , (2004) 7 SCC\n638, the apex Court delineated the factors to be taken into\nconsideration while exercising jurisdiction under Section 389 of\n'the Code' in cases involving serious offences like murder etc. The\nrelevant observations run as under:\n\n20. Reiterating the aforesaid in Anil Ari vs. State of West\nBengal , (2009) 11 SCC 363, the apex Court observed thus:\n\n21. Recently in Atul Tripathi vs. State of U.P. and another ,\n(2014) 9 SCC 177, the apex Court summing up the legal parameters Cr.A. No.1248/2005 14 regarding exercise of discretionary power under section 389(1) of\n'the Code' stressed that the Court is required to judiciously consider\nall the relevant factors including gravity of offence and the nature of\nthe crime. The relevant observations in this regard run as under:\n\n22. In State of Haryana v. Hasmat , (2004) 6 SCC 175, the\napex Court again held as under:\n\n23. The aforesaid view has consistently been held by the\napex Court in most of the decisions on the point including in the\ncase of Vasant TukaramPawar Vs. State of Maharashtra , ( 2005) 5\nSCC 281 and Gomti Vs. Thakurdas and Others , (2007) 11 SCC\n160 and SidharthVashisht @ Manu Sharma Vs.The State (N.C.T.\nof Delhi), (2008) 5 SCC 230.\n\n24. In Sidharth Vashisht @ Manu Sharma Vs. The State\n(N.C.T. of Delhi ), (2008) 5 SCC 230, the apex Court taking due\nnote of the observations made in the cases of Kashmira Singh (supra) and Babu Singh (supra), the cases relied on by the learned\nCounsel for the appellant, so also referring to few other decisions on\nthe point had held as under:\n\n25. Clearly, as held by Hon'ble the apex Court in State of\nPunjab vs. Deepak Mattu , (2007) 11 SCC 319 & 2008 Cr.L.J. 322,\npossible delay in disposal of the appeal and the fact that there are\narguable points may not by itself be sufficient to grant suspension of\na sentence.\n\n26. To have a clearer perspective of the issue it may be\nworthwhile to refer to few of the pronouncements of the apex Court,\nwherein applicability of Section 389 of 'The Code' came for\nconsideration.\n\n27. In Akhilesh Kumar Sinha vs. State of Bihar , (2000) 6\nSCC 461, the appellant who was convicted u/s. 302 / 34 of IPC, in\nappeal applied for suspension of sentence or for taking up his appeal\nfor out of turn hearing. The High Court of Patna declined the prayer\nfor out of turn hearing so also the prayer for suspension of sentence.\nIn an appeal against this order, the apex Court refusing to interfere\nin the matter observed as under:\n\n28. In Vijay Kumar vs. Narendra , (2002) 9 SCC 364 the\napex Court reversing an order of suspension passed in a case where\nthe appellant was convicted u/s. 302 / 34 of the IPC, held as under :\n\n29. In Ramji Prasad vs. Rattan Kumar Jaiswal , (2002) 9\nSCC 366, the apex Court held that the normal practice in cases\nwhere a person has been found guilty by the trial Court u/s. 302 of\nthe IPC is not to suspend the sentence and it is only in exceptional\ncases that the benefit of suspension of sentence can be granted.\n\n30. In State of Haryana vs. Hasmat , (2004) 6 SCC 175, the\napex Court reiterated that there is a distinction between the bail and\nthe suspension of sentence. The apex Court observed that one of the\nessential ingredients of Section 389 is the requirement of the\nappellate Court to record reasons in writing for ordering suspension\nof execution of sentence or order appealed. It was further observed\nthat the requirement of recording reasons in writing clearly indicates\nthat there has to be a careful consideration of the relevant aspects\nand the order directing suspension of sentence and grant of bail\nshould not be passed as a matter of routine. The apex Court in para\n9 of the report quoted with approval the view expressed earlier in\nVijay Kumar vs. Narendra, (2002) 9 SCC 364 and Ramji Prasad v.\n\nRattan Kumar Jaiswal, (2002) 9 SCC 366 to the effect that in cases\ninvolving conviction u/s. 302 of IPC, it is only in exceptional cases\nthat the benefit of suspension of sentence can be granted. Para-9 of\nthe report runs as under :\n\n31. In Kishori Lal vs. Rupa , (2004) 7 SCC 638, again a\nmatter involving suspension of sentence in a case relating to murder,\nthe apex Court did not approve the view taken by the High Court\nthat custodial sentence can be suspended only on account of absence\nof allegation regarding misuse of liberty of bail during trial. The\nrelevant observations, which find place in Para 6, run as under :\n\nIt was reiterated that in cases involving conviction u/s. 302 of\nIPC, it is only in exceptional cases that the benefit of suspension can\nbe granted.\n\n32. In State of Maharashtra vs. Madhukar Wamanrao\nSmarth , (2008) 5 SCC 721, the apex Court referred to the\nparameters delineated in Kishori Lal vs. Rupa , (2004) 7 SCC 638 to\nbe observed by the High Court while dealing with an application for\nsuspension of sentence and grant of bail and reiterated the view\ntaken in Vasant Tukaram Pawar vs. State of Maharashtra , (2005)\n5 SCC 281. The relevant part of the report runs as under :-\n\n33. Recently, in Hussain and another vs. Union of India,\n(Criminal Appeal No.509/2017 , order dated 09/03/2017), the issue\nwith regard to suspension of sentence of an appellant, who was in\ncustody since 11.01.2009 was agitated before the apex Court\ncontending that regard being had to the long period of custody, he\ndeserves to be released on bail. The apex Court, instead of granting\nsuspension, directed disposal of appeal within a period of six\nmonths. Apart this, exhaustive directions with regard to speedy trial\nof cases including criminal appeal pending in the High Court were\nalso issued.\n\n34. From the aforesaid, it is abundantly clear that the apex\nCourt has consistently taken the view that, while dealing with\nquestion of suspension under Section 389 of 'The Code', the Court\nis required to judiciously take into consideration 'all the relevant\nfactors', like - gravity of offence, nature of crime, manner in which\nit was committed, age, criminal antecedents of the convict and\nimpact of public confidence in Court. It further clearly emerges that\nsole factor that the appellant was on bail during trial and that there is\nno allegation of misuse of liberty or that the appellant's appeal is\nlikely to take long time in its final disposal by itself cannot be\nsufficient to grant suspension.\n\n35. In Siddarth Vashist ' case (supra), in an admitted\ncriminal appeal pending before the apex Court, the appellant prayed\nfor early hearing of the appeal or grant of suspension. Reliance in\nthis regard was also placed on the decisions rendered by the apex\nCourt in Kashmira Singh 's case (supra), Babu Singh's case\n(supra) and Akhtari Bi's case (supra). Declining the prayer for Cr.A. No.1248/2005 21 suspension the apex Court held that the Court while considering the\nprayer for bail in a case involving serious offence like murder,\nshould consider 'all the relevant factors' like nature of accusation\nmade against the accused, manner in which the crime alleged to\nhave been committed, the gravity of offence, desirability of\nreleasing the accused on bail after he has been convicted for\ncommitting serious offence of murder etc. It was reiterated that\nnormal practice in such cases has been not to suspend the sentence\nand it is only in exceptional cases, that the benefit of suspension can\nbe granted.\n\n36. No doubt, speedy trial is a fundamental right implicit in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, however, the Court\nconsidering the question of bail is required to struck a balance\nbetween right of the individual and societal interest and the bare fact\nthat the appellant has suffered substantial part of sentence cannot be\nthe sole criteria for grant of suspension. Needless to say that there\nmay be cases, including under Section 302 of IPC where sentence is\nsuspended on merits within a year or two. Again, contrarily there\nmay be cases, where in view of the gravity of the offence and the\nmanner in which it was committed, a Court of law, may find it\ndifficult to grant suspension. It was for, preciously, this reason that\nthe apex Court in Surinder Singh @ Shingara Singh 's case\n(supra), referring to observations made in the Kashmira Singh's\ncase (supra), has held that such observations and similar\nobservations found in some of the other decisions of the Court only\nlay down broad guidelines and that none of the decisions lay down\nany invariable rule for grant of bail on completion of a specified\nperiod of detention in custody and indeed, in a discretionary matter, Cr.A. No.1248/2005 22 like grant or refusal of bail, it would be impossible to lay down any\ninvariable rule or evolve a strait jacket formula and that the Court\nmust exercise its discretion having regard to all the relevant facts\nand circumstances. It was in these premises that a Full Bench of\nRajasthan High Court, Mohd. Mohsin Khan @ Bhooria versus\nState of Rajasthan , 2013 Cr.L.J. 4156 dealing with an identical\nissue concluded in para-29 that merely because a convict has served\nfive years or one half of the sentence including remission would not\n'ipse dixit' make him or her entitled to be released on bail as a\nmatter of right.\n\n37. In the aforesaid premises we are of the considered view\nthat proposition of law laid down by the Division Bench of this\nCourt in Raghuwar Singh 's case (supra) to the effect that where\nsubstantial part of the sentence is suffered with no foreseeable hope\nof final hearing of the appeal in near future, the factor of the merits\ninvolving gravity of offence, nature of commission of offence and\nquality of evidence on record take a backseat, cannot be held to be a\ngood law.\n\n38. As a fallout of the aforesaid discussion and analysis, we\nare of the considered view that sentence for life imprisonment or\nimprisonment for any lesser term of a convict cannot be suspended\n'solely' on the ground of his having served sentence of any\nparticular period or one half of the maximum sentence, inclusive or\nexclusive of remission, therefore, the view taken in this regard by\nthe Division Bench of this Court in Raghuwar Singh 's case (supra)\ndoes not reflect correct position of law.\n\n39. Accordingly, we answer the reference as under:\n\nReference is answered, accordingly.",
