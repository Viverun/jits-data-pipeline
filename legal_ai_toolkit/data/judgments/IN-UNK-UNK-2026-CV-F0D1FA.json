JUSTICE S. KUMAR\n CAV JUDGMENT\n (Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)\n\n Date : 11-05-2022\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n 2/38\n\n The following questions arise for consideration in the\n\n instant writ petition:-\n\n 1. Whether denial of earned remuneration and post retiral\n benefits constitute an infringement of the right to life\n under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution of India?\n 2. Whether the acts of the State in delaying the\n disbursement of retiral benefits can be countenanced\n given the established notion of the State as a Model\n Employer?\n 3. Whether a case is made out for punitive\n damages/heavy cost in the instant set of facts in light\n of the inordinate lapses?\n 4. Whether the State is obligated to constitute an\n effective grievance redressal mechanism with respect\n to payment of legitimate dues of a salaried employee,\n including pension and other post retiral benefits, to\n ensure that earned dues are disbursed on time?\n FACTS\n\n 2. The petitioner namely Lilawati Mishra (referred to as\n\n the petitioner) is the wife of late Shri Krishna Kumar Mishra\n\n (hereinafter referred to as the employee), whose salary in arrear\n\n and non-disbursement of retiral benefits are the subject of this\n\n petition.\n\n 3. The employee was appointed as a Temporary Estimator\n\n on 05.12.1961 and joined the office of Superintending Engineer\n\n Chhotanagpur Circle. After a series of internal and\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n 3/38\n\n interdepartmental postings in several districts such as the office\n\n of Executive Engineer, Ranchi Division, Rajendra Agriculture\n\n College, Pusa, etc., he was promoted to the post of Assistant\n\n Engineer in1994 and was to join the office of Executive\n\n Engineer, Advance Planning Division, Munger Road\n\n Construction Department, but since his joining was not\n\n accepted, was ultimately allowed to retire on 31.12.1996,\n\n without getting such posting.\n\n 4. The first communication with respect to payment of\n\n arrears of salary, pension and post retiral benefits was to the\n\n Engineer-in-Chief-cum-Secretary, Rural Engineering\n\n Organization, Patna, Bihar, on 04.01.1997. Since then, letters to\n\n many of the respondents were written by the employee during\n\n his lifetime and by the petitioner (annexed with the petition).\n\n Such letter, Annexure-2 to the writ petition, contains details of\n\n salary arrears totalling ten years, nine months and 13 days.\n\n 5. It is to be noted that even before superannuation of the\n\n employee, a letter was written by the then Executive Engineer,\n\n Rural Engineering Organization, Works Division, Ranchi to\n\n Engineer-in-chief-cum-Additional Commissioner-cum-Special\n\n Secretary, Rural Engineering Organization, Bihar Patna\n\n (Annexure-3 to the writ petition) putting onto paper the various\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n 4/38\n\n periods for which the employee was not paid his earned\n\n remuneration. Further requesting the concerning authority to\n\n initiate said payment, keeping in view the approaching date of\n\n superannuation, i.e. 31.12.1996.\n\n 6. A number of inter-departmental communications were\n\n undertaken to verify the papers, service book etc., of the\n\n employee, which, according to the petitioner, stood already\n\n submitted, but to no avail. Such facts evident from Annexure 9\n\n dated 18.01.2011, Page-45, remain uncontroverted by the State.\n\n The last pay certificate and other related documents were also\n\n sent to the Executive Engineer, Works Division, Ranchi, on\n\n 17.01.2011.\n\n 7\n. The further representation made on 07.04.2011\n\n (Annexure-11, page-47) resulted in other interdepartmental\n\n communications. On 01.04.2013, another representation was\n\n made before respondent no.5 herein (Annexure-20, page-60),\n\n but despite all these communications, no resolution of their\n\n demands/needs were forthcoming.\n\n 8. Ultimately, the employee died in 2017, not receiving\n\n any of the amounts due to him.\n\n 9. This writ petition was filed on 06.03.2021 for a writ of\n\n mandamus to the respondents' authorities for payment of retiral\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 5/38\n\n benefits and arrears in salary and interest.\n\n 10. The delay in filing the writ petition has not escaped\n\n this Court. However, in light of the attending facts, it cannot\n\n impede the petition's adjudication on merits.\n\n 11. A counter affidavit has been filed, noticeably after\n\n considerable delay by respondent no.6, namely Deputy\n\n Secretary, Road Construction Department, Government of\n\n Bihar, Patna, on behalf of the State on 25.04.2022. In such\n\n counter affidavit, it is stated that all possible efforts are being\n\n taken for the redressal of grievance of retiral dues of the\n\n deceased employee. Prior to the filing of this writ petition, the\n\n last communication was 01.11.2013 by the Secretary, Road\n\n Construction Department, Government of Bihar to the Principal\n\n Secretary, Rural Works Department, Jharkhand, Ranchi,\n\n requesting to make available the complete pension papers along\n\n with no dues certificate of the employee (Annexure-A to the\n\n counter affidavit).\n\n 12. Further explaining the delay, subsequently, a series of\n\n departmental memos were issued and one such being dated\n\n 27.10.2021 to the Accountant General, Bihar, Patna, seeking a\n\n report regarding the issuance of an authorization letter of\n\n pension/gratuity of the deceased employee. Also to the in charge\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 6/38\n\n officer, Finance (D.C.F.C.), Department, Patna, regarding\n\n issuance of sanction letter of utilized earned leave of the\n\n deceased employee; and to the Executive Engineer, Rural Works\n\n Department, Works Division, Ranchi to supply duly filled\n\n pension papers, service history, last pay record, departmental no\n\n dues certificate, housing no dues certificate and duly filled up\n\n form for withdrawal of G.P.F. along with relevant information of\n\n Group Insurance Amount. A similar memo for documents was\n\n sent to the Executive Engineer, Region Survey Advance\n\n Division, Road Construction Department, Munger.\n\n 13. Attempting, with the above issued memos, to show\n\n the efforts being taken, it is prayed for on behalf of \"the State\"\n\n to \"dismiss the present writ petition\".\n\n 14. The petitioner filed a response to the counter-affidavit\n\n on 27.04.2022, annexing the service book, stating that the same\n\n to have been submitted to the relevant authority way back in the\n\n year 2011 itself.\n\n 15. It is also noted therein that the respondents have not\n\n made any effort to deny the bonafide employment of the\n\n petitioner's late husband or his having served the State, thus\n\n entitling him to the dues in issue.\n\n 16. Significantly, it is not the respondents' case that the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 7/38\n\n employee in question was facing any inquiry/disciplinary\n\n proceedings; not diligent, or there being any other justifiable\n\n reasons for withholding the dues. Also, there is no dispute about\n\n the amount and the period to which the employee is entitled to\n\n salary; pension; gratuity; and all other admissible dues still\n\n payable.\n\n LAW\n\n 17. The law with regard to pension, retiral dues has been\n\n laid down in a number of cases by Hon'ble the Supreme Court.\n\n Right to a sum of money as salary and consequential dues\n is property under the Constitution of India\n\n \n18. A Five Judges Bench of the Apex Court in \nState of\n\n Madhya Pradesh v. Ranjojirao Shinde & another\n, AIR\n\n 1968 SCC 1053, has observed:\n\n \"It is obvious that a right to a sum of money is\n property\"\n\n \n19. A Seven Judges Bench of the Apex Court in\n\n \nMadan Mohan Pathak and another v. Union of India and\n\n others\n, (1978) 2 SCC 50 observed:\n\n \n\"... The right to pension was also regarded as property\n for the purpose of \nArticle 19(1)(f)\n by the decisions of this\n Court in \nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n [(1971) 2\n SCC 330 : 1971 Supp SCR 634] and State of Punjab v. K.R.\n Erry & Sobhag Rai Mehta [(1973) 1 SCC 120 : (1973) 2\n SCR 405] .\n \nThis Court adopted the same line of reasoning\n when it said in \nState of Gujarat v. Shri Ambica Mills Ltd.,\n Ahmedabad\n [(1974) 4 SCC 656 : (1974) 3 SCR 760] (SCC,\n p. 664, para 19) that\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 8/38\n\n \"unpaid accumulations represent the obligation of the\n employers to the employees and they are the property of the\n employees. Mathew, J., speaking on behalf of the Court,\n observed that the obligation to the employees owed by the\n employers was 'property from the standpoint of the\n employees'.\"\n\n It would, therefore, be seen that property within the\n meaning of \nArticle 19(1)(f)\n and clause (2) of \nArticle 31\n\n comprises every form of property, tangible or intangible,\n including debts and choses-in-action, such as unpaid\n accumulation of wages, pension, cash grant and\n constitutionally protected Privy Purse. The debts due and\n owing from the Life Insurance Corporation in respect of\n annual cash bonus were, therefore, clearly property of Class\n III and Class IV employees within the meaning of \nArticle\n 31\n, clause (2). And so also was their right to receive annual\n cash bonus for the period from the date of commencement\n of the impugned Act up to March 31, 1977, for that was a\n legal right enforceable through a Court of law by issue of a\n writ of mandamus. (Vide the observations of Hegde, J., at p.\n 194 in the Privy Purse case.)\"\n\n \n20. Prior to the 44th Amendment of the Constitution,\n\n which led to the repeal of \nArticle 31\n, by virtue of the\n\n Constitution (44th \nAmendment) Act, 1978\n, a Constitution\n\n Bench (Five Judges) of the Apex Court in \nBombay Dyeing &\n\n Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bombay and others\n,\n\n AIR 1958 SC 328, held - unpaid wages of an employee, so\n\n earned by him, would become a debt due to him from the\n\n employer and as such was a property which could be assigned\n\n under the law. The observation was made in the context where,\n\n under the provisions of the \nBombay Labour Welfare Fund Act\n,\n\n unclaimed accumulated wages of employees working with\n\n several private entities, stood transferred to a body constituted\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 9/38\n\n under the said Act.\n \nThe context being different but the principle\n\n of the unpaid wage of an employee, so earned by him, is a\n\n property continued to be reiterated, even subsequently, by\n\n another Constitution Bench (Five Judges) of the Apex Court in\n\n \nMaharana Shri Jayvantsinghji Ranmalsinghji v. The State\n\n of Gujarat and others\n, AIR 1962 SC 821.\n\n 21. With repeal of \nArticle 31\n, right to property\n\n continued to remain as Constitutional Right, by virtue of\n\n insertion of \nArticle 300A.\n\n \nArticle 21 -\n Right to life- Receipt of\n wages/salary/dues is one such facet.\n\n 22. A Constitution Bench (Five Judges) of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Olga Tellis and others v.\n\n Bombay Municipal Corporation and others, (1985) 3\n\n SCC 545, has held that right to livelihood, which\n\n is comprehended in the right guaranteed by \nArticle 21\n of the\n\n Constitution, cannot be deprived, except according to the\n\n procedure established by law.\n\n 23. The principles \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court in Olga\n\n Tellis (supra), stand reiterated by a Constitution Bench (Nine\n\n Judges) in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) & another v.\n\n Union of India and others, AIR 2017 SC 4161, in the\n\n following terms:\n\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 10/38\n\n \"114. \nIn \nOlga Tellis v Bombay Municipal\n Corporation195, Chandrachud C J\n, while explaining\n the ambit of \nArticle 21\n found a rationale for\n protecting the right to livelihood as an incident of\n the right to life. For, as the Court held, deprivation of\n livelihood would result in the abrogation of the right\n to life: \"148. The sweep of the right to life conferred by\n \nArticle 21\n is wide and far reaching. It does not mean\n merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as,\n for example, by the imposition and execution of the death\n sentence, except according to procedure established by\n law. That is but one aspect of the right to life. An equally\n important facet of that right is the right to livelihood\n because, no person can live without the means of living,\n that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood\n is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life,\n the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life\n would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the\n point of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only\n denude the 195 (1985) 3 SCC 545 PART I 111 life of its\n effective content and meaningfulness but it would make\n life impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would\n not have to be in accordance with the procedure\n established by law, if the right to livelihood is not\n regarded as a part of the right to life. That, which alone\n makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life\n liveable, must be deemed to be an integral component of\n the right to life. Deprive a person of his right to\n livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life...\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 24. \nIn M/s \nShantistar Builders v. Narayan Khimalal\n\n Totame & others\n, (1990) 1 SCC 520, the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\n held:\n\n \"9. Basic needs of man have traditionally been\n accepted to be three - food, clothing and shelter. The right to\n life is guaranteed in any civilized society. That would take\n within its sweep the right to food, the right to clothing, the\n right to decent environment and a reasonable\n accommodation to live in. The difference between the need\n of an animal and a human being for shelter has to be kept in\n view. For the animal it is the bare protection of the body; for\n a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which\n would allow him to grow in every aspect - physical, mental\n and intellectual. The Constitution aims at ensuring fuller\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 11/38\n\n development of every child. That would be possible only if\n the child is in a proper home. It is not necessary that every\n citizen must be ensured of living in a well-built comfortable\n house but a reasonable home particularly for people in India\n can even be mud-built thatched house or a mud-built fire-\n proof accommodation.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 25. That 'right to life' includes 'right to livelihood'\n\n stood settled way back in by a Constitution Bench of the\n\n Apex Court in the year 1991. \nIn \nDelhi Transport Corporation\n\n v. D.T.C. Mazdoor Congress & others\n, 1991 Supp(1)\n\n SCC 600, while dealing with the constitutional\n\n validity of Regulation 9(b) of the Delhi Road\n\n Transport Authority (Conditions of Appointment and\n\n Service) Regulations, 1952, enabling the employer to\n\n terminate services of the employee by issuance of one\n\n month notice or payment in lieu thereof, the Court held that:\n\n \"262. The right to life includes right to livelihood.\n The right to livelihood therefore cannot hang on to the\n fancies of individuals in authority. The employment is\n not a bounty from them nor can its survival be at their\n mercy. Income is the foundation of many fundamental\n rights and when work is the sole source of income, the\n right to work becomes as much fundamental.\n Fundamental rights can ill-afford to be consigned to the\n limbo of undefined premises and uncertain applications.\n That will be a mockery of them.\"\n\n \"316. ...It would, further, be held that right to public\n employment which includes right to continued public\n employment till the employee is superannuated as per\n rules or compulsorily retired or duly terminated in\n accordance with the procedure established by law is an\n integral part of right to livelihood which in turn is an\n integral facet of right to life assured by \nArt. 21\n of the\n Constitution. Any procedure prescribed to deprive such a\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 12/38\n\n right to livelihood or continued employment must be just,\n fair and reasonable procedure. In other words an\n employee in a public employment also must not be\n arbitrarily unjustly and unreasonably be deprived of\n his/her livelihood which is ensured in continued\n employment till it is terminated in accordance with just,\n fair and reasonable procedure...\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 26. It was further held that income is the foundation of\n\n many fundamental rights and when work is the sole source of\n\n income, the right to work becomes as much fundamental and\n\n fundamental rights can ill-afford to be consigned to the limbo\n\n of undefined premises and uncertain applications.\n\n \n27. That right to life, enshrined in \nArticle 21\n, would\n\n include right to livelihood, stood reiterated by the Apex\n\n Court in \nD.K. Yadav v. J.M.A. Industries Ltd.\n, (1993) 3 SCC\n\n 259, in the following terms:\n\n \"12. ...\nArticle 21\n clubs life with liberty, dignity of\n person with means of livelihood without which the\n glorious content of dignity of person would be\n reduced to animal existence...\"\n\n 28. \nIn \nChameli Singh & others v. State of U.P. &\n\n another\n, (1996) 2 SCC 549 (Three Judges), the Apex Court\n\n observed:\n\n \"8. ...Right to live guaranteed in any civilised\n society implies the right to food, water, decent\n environment, education medical care and shelter.\n These are basic human rights known to any civilised\n society...\"\n\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 13/38\n\n \n29. A salaried person by and large depends upon\n\n income from salary for his sustenance and sustenance of\n\n his family and if he is not paid salary despite working for a long\n\n period, will it not affect his life and liberty? This amounts\n\n to denial of basic human rights of a citizen and would\n\n also amount to deprivation of his life and liberty\n\n guaranteed to every citizen under \nArticle 21\n of the\n\n Constitution. (\nProfessor Devendra Mishra v. University of Delhi\n,\n\n 167 (2010) DLT 259).\n\n 30. Income of a person is the cornerstone of many of his\n\n fundamental rights. This can be interpreted to mean that\n\n receiving of income is a foundational feature of the Right\n\n to Livelihood. Thereby, it becomes obvious that a deprivation\n\n of income on part of the State directly violates the Right to Life\n\n under \nArticle 21.\n\n \n31. The State through its inaction has thwarted self-\n\n development of the employees and his family who were\n\n deprived of their hard earned money. After all, a man may use\n\n his income for purposes other than the three basic needs which\n\n have been mentioned in \nShantistar\n (supra). Thereby the state\n\n prevented the welfare of its own citizens which goes against the\n\n core objectives of a welfare state like India.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 14/38\n\n 32. There is multiplicity of legislations whereby the state\n\n has imposed a duty on varied Departments to ensure that\n\n their employees enjoy a decent standard of living.\n\n Procedure for timely disbursement is prescribed and the\n\n employee un-refutingly complied with the same. Therefore,\n\n when the State did not disburse the salaries to its employees\n\n despite having the money in its coffers, money which was\n\n ready to be disbursed, it was clearly engaging in practicing\n\n double standards.\n\n 33. The State through its administrative inaction has\n\n clearly desecrated the dignity which is inherent in its employees.\n\n Thereby, the State has also acted contrary to the provisions of\n\n Chapter IV and Chapter IV A of the Constitution of India. \nIn\n\n \nSudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.\n,\n\n (1984) 3 SCC 369l, Hon'ble the Apex Court observed-\n\n \"16. \nArticle 37\n provides that \"the provisions contained\n in Part IV -- Directive Principles of State Policy, shall not\n be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid\n down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of\n the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply\n these principles in making laws\". \nArticle 41\n provides that\n \"the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity\n and development, make effective provision for securing\n the right to work, to education and to public assistance in\n cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and\n disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want\".\n\n \nArticle 43\n obligates the State \"to secure, by suitable\n legislation to all workers, a living wage, conditions of\n work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment\n of leisure...Pension and gratuity are both retiral benefits\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 15/38\n\n ensuring that the workman who has spent his useful span\n of life in rendering service and who never got a living\n wage, which would have enabled him to save for a rainy\n day, should not be reduced to destitution and penury in his\n old age. As a return of long service he should be assured\n social security to some extent in the form of either\n pension, gratuity or provident fund whichever retiral\n benefit is operative in the industrial establishment. It must\n not be forgotten that it is not a gratuitous payment, it has\n to be earned by long and continuous service.\"\n\n \n34. It can clearly be seen that none of the three\n\n basic needs of man mentioned in \nShantistar\n (Supra) can be\n\n acquired without monetary power. Thereby, through its\n\n inaction the state has clearly exhibited a lethargic and\n\n callous, attitude towards disbursal of its mandated duties.\n\n Therefore, the inaction of the state clearly enables a\n\n violation of the Right to Life as mandated under the\n\n Constitution of India.\n\n 35. Coming to the facts of the present case, an employee,\n\n i.e., a salaried person primarily depends upon his income from\n\n salary for the purpose of subsistence of his family. In our\n\n considered view, if such a salaried person is not paid his due and\n\n admissible salary despite having zealously worked and served\n\n the State, the same will obviously affect his life and liberty. This\n\n definitely would amount to denial of basic human rights of a\n\n citizen and would violate fundamental right of life and liberty\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 16/38\n\n guaranteed to a citizen under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution of\n\n India.\n\n 36. Therefore, by arbitrarily denying wages to the\n\n employee right to livelihood was denied by the State\n\n without following the procedure established by law, which in\n\n our considered view, is a blatant violation of \nArticle 21\n of the\n\n Constitution of India.\n\n Statutory Right Of Receiving Pension\n\n \n37. The Apex Court in \nState of W.B. v. Haresh\n\n C.Banerjee & others\n, (2006) 7 SCC 651, has held that\n\n pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and the\n\n pleasure of the Government and to receive pension is a\n\n valuable right of a government servant, is a sell-settled legal\n\n proposition.\n\n \n38. Pension, as is well established, is the deferred\n\n portion of the compensation for rendering long years of\n\n service. It is a hard-earned benefit, accruing to an employee\n\n in the nature of property. [\nState of Jharkhand v. Jitendra\n\n Kumar Srivastava\n, (2013) 12 SCC 210; \nVeena Pandey\n\n versus Union of India & Others\n, 2021 SCC Online SC\n\n 1078]\n\n \n39. Emphasizingly, the Hon'ble Supreme has held that\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 17/38\n\n pensionary provisions must be given liberal construction\n\n more so as a social welfare measure. It is not a bounty to be\n\n dispersed contrary to the rules, but very basis for grant of\n\n such pension is to facilitate a retired government employee,\n\n live with dignity, in the winter of his life. This fundamental\n\n principle must be kept in mind while taking action, depriving\n\n benefits which ought not to be done, unreasonably, more so,\n\n on technicalities. [\nV. Sukumaran v. State of Kerala\n, (2020) 8\n\n SCC 106; \nState of W.B. v. Haresh C. Banerjee and others\n,\n\n (2006) 7 SCC 651]\n\n \n40. We may only extract, for benefit, both of the employer\n\n and the employee, as to how another Constitution Bench of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court elucidated the principles behind the\n\n policy for grant of pension in \nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n,\n\n (1983) 1 SCC 305.\n\n \"19. What is a pension? What are the goals of\n pension? What public interest or purpose, if any, it seeks\n to serve? If it does seek to serve some public purpose, is it\n thwarted by such artificial division of retirement pre and\n post a certain date? We need seek answer to these and\n incidental questions so as to render just justice between\n parties to this petition.\n\n \n20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a\n gratuitous payment depending upon the sweet will or\n grace of the employer not claimable as a right and,\n therefore, no right to pension can be enforced through\n Court has been swept under the carpet by the decision of\n the Constitution Bench in \nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of\n Bihar\n [(1971) 2 SCC 330 : AIR 1971 SC 1409 : 1971\n Supp SCR 634 : (1971) 1 LLJ 557] wherein this Court\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 18/38\n\n authoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the\n payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of the\n Government but is governed by the rules and a\n government servant coming within those rules is entitled\n to claim pension. It was further held that the grant of\n pension does not depend upon anyone's discretion. It is\n only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having\n regard to service and other allied matters that it may be\n necessary for the authority to pass an order to that effect\n but the right to receive pension flows to the officer not\n because of any such order but by virtue of the rules.\n \nThis\n view was reaffirmed in \nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n.\n [(1976) 2 SCC 1 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 172 : AIR 1976 SC\n 667 : (1976) 3 SCR 360]\n\n 21. There are various kinds of pensions and there are\n equally various methods of funding pension programmes.\n The present enquiry is limited to non-contributory\n superannuation or retirement pension paid by Government\n to its erstwhile employee and the purpose and object\n underlying it. Initially this class of pension appears to\n have been introduced as a reward for loyal service.\n Probably the alien rulers who recruited employees in\n lower echelons of service from the colony and exported\n higher level employees from the seat of Empire, wanted to\n ensure in the case of former continued loyalty till death to\n the alien rulers and in the case of latter, an assured decent\n living standard in old age ensuring economic security at\n the cost of the colony.\n\n 22. In the course of transformation of society from\n feudal to welfare and as socialistic thinking acquired\n respectability. State obligation to provide security in old\n age, an escape from undeserved want was recognised and\n as a first step pension was treated not only as a reward for\n past service but with a view to helping the employee to\n avoid destitution in old age. The quid pro quo was that\n when the employee was physically and mentally alert, he\n rendered unto master the best, expecting him to look after\n him in the fall of life. A retirement system therefore exists\n solely for the purpose of providing benefits. In most of the\n plans of retirement benefits, everyone who qualifies for\n normal retirement receives the same amount\n (see Retirement Systems for Public Employees by\n Bleakney, p. 33).\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n Right To Receive Gratuity\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 19/38\n\n \n41. Gratuity has also been held to be a statutory\n\n right which cannot be taken away. (Allahabad Bank\n\n Retirees Assn v. All India Allahabad Bank Retired\n\n Employees Association (2010) 2 SCC 44); \nSecretary,\n\n ONGC Limited and another v. V.U.

State of Bihar\n, (2003) 6\n\n SCC 1, the Apex Court has observed as under:\n\n \"30. The Government companies/public sector\n undertakings being 'states' would be constitutionally liable\n to respect life and liberty of all persons in terms of \nArticle\n 21\n of the constitution of India. They, therefore, must do so\n in cases of their own employees. The government of the\n State of Bihar for all intent and purport is the sole\n shareholder. Although in law, its liability towards the\n debtors of the company may be confined to the shares\n held by it but having regard to the deep and pervasive\n control it exercises over the Government companies; in\n the matter of enforcement of human rights and/or rights of\n the citizen of life and liberty, the State has also an\n additional duty to see that the rights of employees of such\n corporations are not infringed.\n\n 31. The right to exercise deep and pervasive control\n would in its turn make the Government of Bihar liable to\n see that the life and liberty clause in respect of the\n employees is fully safeguarded. The Government of the\n State of Bihar, thus, had a constitutional obligation to\n protect the life and liberty of the employees of the\n government-owned companies/corporations who are the\n citizens of India. It had an additional liability having\n regard to its right of extensive supervision over the affairs\n of the company.\"\n\n \"71. The States of India are welfare States.

Further, the Apex Court in \nKapila Hingorani v.\n\n State of Bihar\n, (2005) 2 SCC 262, has held that the\n\n employees have a human right as also a fundamental right\n\n under \nArticle 21\n which the States are bound to protect.\n\n Even where the public sector undertakings were unable to pay\n\n the salaries of its employees, the Apex Court directed the State\n\n to disburse the same on the basis of the aforesaid principle. We\n\n see it fit to quote as under:-\n\n \"37. We make it clear that we have not issued the\n aforementioned directions to the States of Bihar and\n Jharkhand on the premise that they are bound to pay the\n salaries of the employees of the public sector\n undertakings but on the ground that the employees have a\n human right as also a fundamental right under \nArticle 21\n\n which the States are bound to protect. The directions,\n which have been issued by this Court on 9-5-2003\n [(2003) 6 SCC 1 : 2004 SCC (L&S) 586] as also which\n are being issued herein, are in furtherance of the human\n and fundamental rights of the employees concerned and\n not by way of an enforcement of their legal right to\n arrears of salaries...\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 44. We notice that the Court was dealing with a case,\n\n where salaries of several employees of instrumentalities owned\n\n by the State were not disbursed and on the basis of news paper\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 21/38\n\n report a public spirited citizen, a Supreme Court lawyer, had\n\n invited attention of the Court to the apathy on the part of the\n\n State.\n\n 45. Financial difficulties of employer cannot be a ground\n\n for non-payment or delayed payment of wages to workmen.\n\n Obviously, the State has not pleaded financial bankruptcy. Also\n\n it has not sought exercise of power declaring financial\n\n emergency envisaged under \nArticle 360\n of the Constitution of\n\n India.\n\n State - a Model Employer\n\n \n46. The Apex Court in \nState of Jharkhand and\n\n another v. Harihar Yadav and others\n, (2014) 2 SCC 114,\n\n observed:\n\n \"52. Having regard to the position that has emerged,\n we are compelled to dwell upon the role of the State\n as a model employer. \nIn \nSom Prakash Rekhi v. Union of\n India\n, (1981) 1 SCC 449, Krishna Iyer, J., has stated\n thus: -\n\n \"Social justice is the conscience of our\n Constitution, the State is the promoter of\n economic justice, the founding faith which\n sustains the Constitution and the country is\n Indian humanity. The public sector is a model\n employer with a social conscience not an\n artificial person without soul to be damned or\n body to be burnt.\"\n\n \n53 In \nGurmail Singh and others v. State of Punjab and\n others\n, (1991) 1 SCC 189 it has been held that the State\n as a model employer is expected to show fairness in\n action.\n\n 54. \nIn \nBalram Gupta v. Union of India and Another\n,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 22/38\n\n 1987 Supp1 SCC 228 the Court observed that as\n a model employer the Government must conduct\n itself with high probity and candour with its employees.\n\n 55. \nIn \nState of Haryana v. Piara Singh\n, (1992) 4 SCC 118\n the Court has ruled that the main concern of the court\n in such matters is to ensure the rule of law and to see\n that the Executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its\n employees consistent with the requirements of \nArticles\n 14\n and \n16.\n\n 56. \nIn \nBhupendra Nath Hazarika and another v. State of\n Assam and others\n, (2013) 2 SCC 516 while laying emphasis\n on the role of the State as a model employer, though in a\n different context, the Court observed:\n\n \"65.......It should always be borne in mind that\n legitimate aspirations of the employees\n are not guillotined and a situation is not\n created where hopes end in despair. Hope for\n everyone is gloriously precious and a model\n employer should not convert it to be deceitful\n and treacherous by playing a game of chess\n with their seniority. A sense of calm\n sensibility and concerned sincerity should be\n reflected in every step. An atmosphere of trust\n has to prevail and when the employees\n are absolutely sure that their trust shall not be\n betrayed and they shall be treated with\n dignified fairness then only the concept of good\n governance can be concretized.\"\n\n \"57. If the present factual matrix is tested on the\n anvil of the aforesaid principles, there can be no\n trace of doubt that both the States and the\n Corporations have conveniently ostracized the concept\n of \"model employer\". It would not be wrong to say\n that they have done so with Pacific calmness, sans\n vision, shorn of responsibility and oblivious of their\n role in such a situation. Their action reflects the attitude\n of emotionlessness, proclivity of impassivity and\n deviancy with cruel impassibility. Neither of the States\n nor the Corporations have even thought for a moment\n about the livelihood of the employees. They have\n remained totally alien to the situation to which the\n employees have been driven to. In a State of good\n governance the Government cannot act like an alien. It\n has an active role to play. It has to have a constructive\n and progressive vision...........\"\n\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 23/38\n\n 47. The Corporate and Industrial Houses are\n\n expected by the Indian State to take measures which\n\n provide a decent standard of living to members of the\n\n society generally and more specifically, to their employees.\n\n Therefore, the State has the duty to set an example of\n\n being a model employer to its employees. If State does\n\n itself does not give salary to its employees for their hard\n\n work then how can it be expected that the private\n\n entrepreneur will take care of their employees.\n\n Litigation Policy Of State\n\n 48. We notice that State has formulated a Litigation\n\n Policy with the avowed object of not only reducing litigation,\n\n saving avoidable cost on unproductive litigation; but also\n\n reducing avoidable load on judiciary with respect to\n\n Government induced litigation. This is in tune with the\n\n mandate of \nArticle 39-A\n of the Constitution of India,\n\n obligating the State to promote equal justice. Now, if the\n\n employees are not paid their salaries within time, obviously,\n\n they are left with no remedy but to rush to the Courts.\n\n 49. Of late, litigation pertaining to employees of the\n\n State has increased and it is not that State is the petitioner.\n\n The action assailed is of mis-governance or avoidable\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 24/38\n\n omissions on the part of the Government. Why should the\n\n State force an employee to litigate in a case where\n\n emoluments/salaries, which are undisputed, are not disbursed\n\n in time.\n\n 50. In the light of the recommendation of 13 th Finance\n\n Commission, the State of Bihar has formulated the State\n\n Litigation Policy, 2011, notified on 31st March 2011. The Policy\n\n is comprehensive, self speaking and self serving, though,\n\n perhaps, with the passage of time, may require a review. Be that\n\n as it may, as of date, the said policy is binding, more so, on the\n\n employer. The object of the policy is to \"transform the State\n\n Government into an efficient and responsible litigant\" and also\n\n to deal with the genuine grievances of the employee with\n\n reasonable dispatch. In the Policy, the State terms itself to be a\n\n 'responsible litigant' and for that term to mean - \"(a) That\n\n litigation will not be resorted to for the sake of litigating. (b)\n\n That false pleas and hyper-technical points will not be taken and\n\n shall be discouraged. (c) Ensuring that the correct facts and all\n\n relevant documents are placed before the Court. (d) That\n\n nothing shall be suppressed from the court and there will be no\n\n attempt to mislead any court or Tribunal.\"\n\n 51. As per clause 1.2, the Policy is based on the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 25/38\n\n recognition \"that it is the responsibility of the Government to\n\n protect the rights of the citizens, to respect fundamental rights\n\n and that those in charge of the conduct of the Government\n\n litigation should never forget these basic principles.\"\n\n 52. In terms of clause 1.3 underlying objective of the\n\n Policy is also to reduce pressure on \"the overloaded judiciary\n\n and expedite dispensation of justice.\"\n\n 53. Clause 2 of the Policy provides for establishment of a\n\n mechanism, though not termed, but in the nature of pre-\n\n litigation consideration/resolution of the dispute. At various\n\n levels, the Empowered Committee is mandated to be\n\n constituted, enabling the employees to vent out their grievances\n\n prior to initiation of litigation.\n\n 54. Part IV of the said Policy deals with prevention of\n\n avoidable litigation. The relevant portion thereof is extracted as\n\n under:-\n\n \"IV. PREVENTION/CONTROL OF AVOIDABLE\n LITIGATION\n A\n\n 4. A Setting up Grievance Redressal System\n\n 4. A(1). Very often the major causes of litigation\n involving the State Government are from arbitrariness\n in decision making or non application of mind or non-\n response/ improper response to representations made\n by employees, including retired employees/ parties. It\n is seen that in most cases in respect of service matters\n the cause of action arises out of relief not being given\n as per the Rules, Government instructions or policy\n decisions as are in force. It is also seen that in most\n cases before the matter reaches the Court the affected\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 26/38\n\n party undeservedly spends a lot of his time and effort\n over redressal of his grievance through normal\n administrative channels. In this situation all\n Departments of the State Government shall set up\n effective Grievance Redressal Committees in order to\n pre-empt a large number of avoidable litigation.\n\n 4. A (2). It shall be mandatory for employees, including\n those retired, to seek redressal, at the first instance,\n through this system before approaching the Courts.\n\n 4. A(3). A time limit of eight weeks or so may be fixed\n for deciding such representations.\n\n 4. A(4). Such Grievance Redressal Committees shall be\n set up in each Department at the State Level, District\n Level and Sub-Divisional Level and each of them shall\n have a Grievance Cell. All cases and issues at the\n request of the aggrieved party shall be reviewed to\n redress genuine grievances.\n\n 4. A(5) The Department Level Grievance Committee\n shall be headed by the Principal Secretary/ Secretary of\n the Department concerned and shall meet once a month\n to review the efficiency of the Grievance Redressal\n System in the Department. Similarly at the District and\n Sub-Divisional Level, the Committee shall be headed\n by the District Magistrate or Sub Divisional Officer, as\n the case may be. The District Sub Divisional Level\n Grievance Redressal Committees shall meet once every\n month on the first Tuesday of each month; if this is a\n holiday, the Committee will meet on the next working\n day excluding \"Janata ka Darbar\" days, i.e., Mondays\n and Thursdays. Where it is found that certain\n Government instructions require to be reviewed, it shall\n refer the same to the State Level Empowered\n Committee. As seniority matters are a major source of\n litigation these shall be resolved expeditiously by the\n Department and seniority lists should be updated,\n printed and published regularly.\n\n B\n\n 4. B. Quick Action on Representations/ Legal\n Notices\n\n 4.B(1). A legal notice is intended to alert the State to\n negotiate a just settlement or at least have the courtesy\n to tell the potential outsider why the claim is being\n resisted. Nowadays such notices have become a\n formality. When such a legal notice is served upon any\n Department asking for the relief the same should be\n decided expeditiously in accordance with the prevalent\n Rules/ Instructions and by a detailed speaking order.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 27/38\n\n Timely response would avoid waste of public money\n and promote expeditious work in Court in cases which\n deserve to be attended to.\n\n 4. B(2). While passing orders in original jurisdiction or\n in appeals in respect of disciplinary proceedings a\n detailed speaking order should be passed. It is the\n bounden duty of the enquiry officer to follow all the\n prescribed procedures for conducting the enquiry so\n that no lapse occurs in the procedural parts and orders\n are not set aside on that ground and the matter is\n remanded back for fresh decision. Officers should be\n trained periodically in these aspects.\n\n 4.B(3). While deciding cases relating to seniority of\n employees, the decision should be taken promptly and\n strictly in accordance with the Rules so that the interest\n of the employees is not jeopardized due to a delayed\n decision. ...\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 55. It seems that the Policy was never put to practice, for,\n\n had it been so, all adjudicatory forums, including this Court\n\n would not have been flooded with litigation. The information\n\n obtained from the Registry reveals that 39,000 (approx.) [36,596\n\n (Group 13, 14 and 15) original + 2191 (LPA)] cases pertaining\n\n to the employees' dispute with the State Government/ its\n\n instrumentalities are pending consideration before this Court.\n\n Methods of alternative dispute resolution must be implemented\n\n so as to reduce this number so far as possible.\n\n 56. The Hon'ble Supreme Court speaking through\n\n Hon'ble Mr. Justice M.M. Shantanagoudar in High Court of\n\n Judicature at Madras Rep. by its Registrar General v. M. C.\n\n Subramaniam & Ors., (2021) 3 SCC 560, held that:-\n\n \"13. The provisions of \nSection 89\n CPC must be\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 28/38\n\n understood in the backdrop of the longstanding proliferation\n of litigation in the civil courts, which has placed undue\n burden on the judicial system, forcing speedy justice to\n become a casualty. As the Law Commission has observed in\n its 238th Report on Amendment of \nSection 89\n of the Code\n of Civil Procedure, 1908 and Allied Provisions, Section 89\n has now made it incumbent on civil courts to strive towards\n diverting civil disputes towards alternative dispute\n resolution processes, and encourage their settlement outside\n of court (Para 2.3). These observations make the object and\n purpose of Section 89 crystal clear -- to facilitate private\n settlements, and enable lightening of the overcrowded\n docket of the Indian judiciary. This purpose, being\n sacrosanct and imperative for the effecting of timely justice\n in Indian courts,...\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 57. The importance and fundamental nature of salary and\n\n other emoluments to be paid to an employee place an obligation\n\n upon the machinery of the State to ensure that such cases where\n\n the claims are bonafide and genuine, do not get delayed as a result\n\n of the judicial process and pendency and that they should be\n\n resolved at the pre-litigation stage itself.\n\n 58. An employee has a constitutional right to receive\n\n wages/ salary/emoluments/retiral benefits within time, so also\n\n State is under a constitutional obligation and duty to disburse\n\n the same.\n\n 59. In the instant case, the law, as discussed above,\n\n renders the path clear. The Husband of the petitioner,\n\n employee herein, rendered services for a period of thirty-four\n\n years from 12.05.1961 to 31. 12. 1996. It is an admitted\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 29/38\n\n position, as evidenced by Annexure-3, page-34, dated\n\n 22.11.1996, that dues of the various period were to be paid to\n\n the employee, which was never done. Post-retirement, the\n\n employee and later the petitioner made several\n\n representations to various authorities over the year for\n\n disbursal of arrears in salary and retirement benefits which\n\n unfortunately fell on deaf ears. It is saddening that the\n\n employee was denied the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour\n\n only on account of procedural wrangles and back and forth of\n\n bureaucratic channels and for no fault of his.\n\n 60. The counter affidavit filed by the State admits that\n\n despite the passage of twenty-five years, pension papers and\n\n other no dues certificates have yet not been prepared. It is\n\n only six months after the filing of the present writ petition\n\n that the State now wishes to ascertain the facts vide\n\n communications dated 27.10.2021, Annexure-B to E, from\n\n different authorities. It is further noted, as on the date of filing\n\n of the said counter affidavit, i.e. 25.04.2022, no responses to\n\n such departmental memos are reflected from the record. Such\n\n a callous and lax attitude on the part of the State which has\n\n been held by Hon'ble the Supreme Court to be a model\n\n employer does not fit the description.\n\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 30/38\n\n 61. With the passage of several years, from the\n\n employee's superannuation to the payment of post retiral\n\n benefits resulting from this order, it would no longer serve the\n\n cause of justice if the State is let off by doing just that.\n\n \n62. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in \nNalabati Behera v.\n\n State of Orissa\n, (1993) 2 SCC 746, while discussing the\n\n public law remedy of compensatory or exemplary damages\n\n held as under:-\n\n \"34. The public law proceedings serve a different\n purpose than the private law proceedings. The relief of\n monetary compensation, as exemplary damages, in\n proceedings under \nArticle 32\n by this Court or under\n \nArticle 226\n by the High Courts, for established\n infringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed under\n \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution is a remedy available in\n public law and is based on the strict liability for\n contravention of the guaranteed basic and indefeasible\n rights of the citizen. The purpose of public law is not only\n to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that\n they live under a legal system which aims to protect their\n interests and preserve their rights. Therefore, when the\n court moulds the relief by granting \"compensation\" in\n proceedings under \nArticle 32\n or 226 of the Constitution\n seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights,\n it does so under the public law by way of penalising the\n wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on\n the State which has failed in its public duty to protect the\n fundamental rights of the citizen. The payment of\n compensation in such cases is not to be understood, as it is\n generally understood in a civil action for damages under\n the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief\n by an order of making 'monetary amends' under the\n public law for the wrong done due to breach of public\n duty, of not protecting the fundamental rights of the\n citizen. The compensation is in the nature of 'exemplary\n damages' awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of\n its public law duty and is independent of the rights\n available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 31/38\n\n under the private law in an action based on tort, through a\n suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or/and\n prosecute the offender under the penal law.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 63. It has also been recognized by Hon'ble a bench of\n\n Hon'ble Allahabad High Court headed by Hon'ble Chief Justice\n\n Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud [as His Lordship then was] in Rekha\n\n Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh, Civil Writ No.24947 of 2014\n\n decided on May 2, 2014, that a High Court is not powerless to\n\n issue exemplary damages under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n\n of India.\n\n 64. Plenary power of this Court under the Constitution is\n\n wide enough.\n\n 65. Therefore, in the considered opinion of this Court, the\n\n petitioner is not only entitled to arrears in salary (para 4), post-\n\n retirement benefits along with interest as per law thereupon, but\n\n also punitive damages/costs on the ground of inordinate delay\n\n and for having had to run from pillar to post to get the earned\n\n dues.\n\n 66. Questions of law answered hereinunder:\n\n 1. Whether denial of earned remuneration and post\n retiral benefits constitute an infringement of the right to\n life under \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution of India?\n\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 32/38\n\n 67. Hon'ble, the Supreme Court has, as discussed above,\n\n held in several judgments that salary and equally post retiral\n\n benefits, which have been duly earned, are rights vesting in such\n\n employee. Denial of wages and post retiral benefits in the\n\n instant case is a classical case of infringement of \nArticle 21\n,\n\n owing almost entirely to the indifferent attitude of the State\n\n towards its employees and former employees. \nIn M/s\n\n \nShantistar Builders\n (supra), the three primary actions of\n\n human existence have been listed, and in \nD. K. Yadav\n (supra),\n\n livelihood is recognized as a facet of \nArticle 21.\n\n 2. Whether the acts of the State in delaying the\n disbursement of retiral benefits can be countenanced\n given the established notion of the State as a Model\n Employer?\n\n 68. The State, in its myriad of functions, is not only an\n\n employer but is also a lawmaker. The lawmaker has stipulated\n\n various methods to regulate employment, balancing the interest\n\n of both the employer and the employee, conceiving redressal\n\n mechanisms to ensure timely resolution of disputes, and\n\n evolving ways to protect the vulnerable party in a particular\n\n transaction. In the instant case and many other such cases, the\n\n State itself has laid waste to its own rules and regulations-\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 33/38\n\n calling into question the very basis of such laws and regulations.\n\n 69. As the stipulated model employer, it is incumbent\n\n upon the State to ensure the proper application of such\n\n regulations to set an example for other entities. This\n\n responsibility has clearly been abdicated.\n\n 3. Whether a case is made out for punitive\n damages/heavy cost in the instant set of facts in light of\n the inordinate lapses?\n\n 70. Hon'ble the Supreme Court held that exemplary\n\n damages are awarded in cases where the right to life under\n\n \nArticle 21\n has been grossly infringed. In the instant case, the\n\n petitioner's husband retired in 1996, which is 25 years ago.\n\n However, till today, documents disbursement of salary,\n\n including gratuity and pension etc., are being sought from\n\n various departments. Hence the answer has to be in the\n\n affirmative.\n\n 71. This Court further takes strong exception to the State's\n\n stand taken before this Court to dismiss the present petition in\n\n light of the light of recent efforts being made, evidenced by the\n\n numerous memoranda issued on 27.10.2021.\n\n 72. In the considered view of this Court, this case is fit for\n\n an award of exemplary damages/costs over and above the dues\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 34/38\n\n of the petitioner's husband, to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees\n\n Five Lacs).\n\n 4. Whether the State is obligated to constitute an\n effective grievance redressal mechanism with respect to\n payment of legitimate dues of a salaried employee,\n including pension and other post retiral benefits, to ensure\n that earned dues are disbursed on time?\n\n 73. As already discussed, India is a welfare State and\n\n has been termed a model employer. The directive principles\n\n of State policy which are fundamental to the governance of\n\n the State, impose an obligation upon the State to ensure a\n\n living way and decent standard of living. Further, it has been\n\n observed that a salaried person is almost entirely dependent\n\n upon the same, and delay or denial would impede such\n\n obligation infringing the very core of \nArticle 21\n guaranteeing\n\n a dignified existence.\n\n 74. Considering the large number of such cases filed\n\n before this Court, it would be appropriate in our view to ask\n\n the Chief Secretary to conceive an accessible and easy\n\n mechanism for timely redressal of salary and pension-related\n\n grievances. Such a mechanism developed with a holistic view\n\n will go a long way in extinguishing the need for an aggrieved\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 35/38\n\n person to knock on the doors of justice.\n\n 75. In the light of the discussion above, we dispose of\n\n the writ petition in the following manner:-\n\n (a) The respondents-authorities shall positively pay the\n\n entire amount constituting unpaid salary, gratuity,\n\n pension etc., to the writ petitioner, namely Lilawati\n\n Mishra, within two months from today. The\n\n Department's principal Secretary shall file an\n\n affidavit of compliance within two months from\n\n today. For compliance the matter be listed on\n\n 12.07.2022.\n\n (b) Petitioner shall be entitled to interest on such\n\n amounts @ 18% per annum or the prevalent\n\n statutory interest, whichever is lower.\n\n (c) Also, She shall be entitled to an exemplary cost\n\n quantified at Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lacs). It\n\n shall be open for the State to recover the same from\n\n the erring officials.\n\n (d) The Chief Secretary to the Government shall ensure\n\n that the mechanism in terms of the Bihar State\n\n Litigation Policy, 2011 is not only put in place, but\n\n also made effectively functional. He shall also\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 36/38\n\n endeavour to provide further mechanism, enabling\n\n the employees to vent out their grievances, be it of\n\n whatever nature. One such tool is setting up a 'Web\n\n Portal' at the level of the Principal Secretary/\n\n Secretary of the concerned Department(s), where\n\n the employees can lodge their\n\n grievances/complaints. Such grievances/\n\n complaints shall be processed and adequately\n\n responded to within a reasonable period. This\n\n would facilitate speedy redressal of genuine\n\n grievances and prevent unnecessary litigation,\n\n clogging the wheels of the administration of\n\n justice. Such endeavour shall only be in the spirit\n\n of Litigation Policy, framed by the State\n\n Government. We see a significant advantage in the\n\n use of information and technology. It would result\n\n in effective and efficient redressal of grievances, if\n\n any, and improve efficiency in the affairs of\n\n governance of the State, further instilling\n\n confidence and trust amongst the employees.\n\n (e) It is to be noted that this Court passed similar\n\n directions on an earlier occasion to set up a web\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 37/38\n\n portal. However, no progress in this regard has\n\n been reported to the Court.\n\n (f) All Grievances Redressal Committees stipulated\n\n under the Litigation Policy shall be made\n\n immediately functional and operational.\n\n (g) In the light and spirit of clause (c) of sub-section (1)\n\n of \nSection 89\n of the Code of Civil Procedure, an\n\n endeavour shall be made of having the matters of\n\n the employees resolved through the process of\n\n judicial settlement, including settlement through\n\n Lok Adalat. The Patna High Court Legal Services\n\n Authority is requested to have the needful done.\n\n (h) We direct the State to immediately undertake such a\n\n measure at the earliest.\n\n (i) We also request the learned Advocate General, State\n\n of Bihar, who plays a pivotal role in the\n\n implementation of the Litigation Policy to\n\n undertake such a drive at the earliest. This he can\n\n do by engaging all the stakeholders, more\n\n specifically the Principal Secretaries of the\n\n concerned Departments.\n\n 76. The writ petition stands disposed of with the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022\n\n 38/38\n\n aforesaid directions/observations.\n\n 77. Interlocutory Application, if any, shall stand\n\n disposed of.\n\n (Sanjay Karol, CJ)\n\n S. Kumar, J. I agree.\n\n (S.

For, as the Court held, deprivation of\n livelihood would result in the abrogation of the right\n to life: \"148. The sweep of the right to life conferred by\n \nArticle 21\n is wide and far reaching. It does not mean\n merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as,\n for example, by the imposition and execution of the death\n sentence, except according to procedure established by\n law. That is but one aspect of the right to life. An equally\n important facet of that right is the right to livelihood\n because, no person can live without the means of living,\n that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood\n is not treated as a part of the constitutional right to life,\n the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life\n would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the\n point of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only\n denude the 195 (1985) 3 SCC 545 PART I 111 life of its\n effective content and meaningfulness but it would make\n life impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would\n not have to be in accordance with the procedure\n established by law, if the right to livelihood is not\n regarded as a part of the right to life. That, which alone\n makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life\n liveable, must be deemed to be an integral component of\n the right to life. Deprive a person of his right to\n livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life...\""

This purpose, being\n sacrosanct and imperative for the effecting of timely justice\n in Indian courts,...\""

The relief of\n monetary compensation, as exemplary damages, in\n proceedings under \nArticle 32\n by this Court or under\n \nArticle 226\n by the High Courts, for established\n infringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed under\n \nArticle 21\n of the Constitution is a remedy available in\n public law and is based on the strict liability for\n contravention of the guaranteed basic and indefeasible\n rights of the citizen. The purpose of public law is not only\n to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that\n they live under a legal system which aims to protect their\n interests and preserve their rights. Therefore, when the\n court moulds the relief by granting \"compensation\" in\n proceedings under \nArticle 32\n or 226 of the Constitution\n seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights,\n it does so under the public law by way of penalising the\n wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on\n the State which has failed in its public duty to protect the\n fundamental rights of the citizen. The payment of\n compensation in such cases is not to be understood, as it is\n generally understood in a civil action for damages under\n the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief\n by an order of making 'monetary amends' under the\n public law for the wrong done due to breach of public\n duty, of not protecting the fundamental rights of the\n citizen. The compensation is in the nature of 'exemplary\n damages' awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of\n its public law duty and is independent of the rights\n available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation\n Patna High Court CWJC No.6852 of 2021 dt.11-05-2022"
