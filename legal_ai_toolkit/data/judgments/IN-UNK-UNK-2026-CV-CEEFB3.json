Learned counsel for applicant contended that applicant has been\n\n prosecuting the matter due diligently and cause of action relates to the pension\n\n - arising every month fresh cause successive wrongs exception to principles of\n\n limitation.\n\n 3 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n 5. \nIn view of averments made in the application for condonation of delay\n\n and law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nM.R.

In view whereof, MA No.38/2024 is hereby allowed and delay in filing\n\n the present OA is condoned. MA No.38/2024 accordingly stands disposed off.\n\nPatna\nBench OA No.050/00033/2024\n\n 7. Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA are that\n\n applicant was initially appointed as Casual Labour through due process of law\n\n on 29.11.1989 and was subsequently granted Temporary Status w.e.f.\n\n 29.11.1993 by the respondents vide order dated 31.10.1991 (Annexure A-2).\n\n After completion of three years regular service with temporary status, the\n\n respondents declared him a temporary government servant at par with Group-D\n\n employee we.f. 29.11.1993 vide order dated 27.07.1995 (Annexure A-5) and\n\n holding the same status, applicant retired from service on 29.02.2020 at par\n\n with Group-D employee against MTS post after getting all benefits applicable\n\n to a permanent government employee, except pension. The respondents\n\n regularized batch-mate Shri Kaushal Kumar Singh vide order dated 02.01.2020\n\n and other similarly placed Annexure A-7 & Annexure A-1 but discriminated\n\n applicant.\n\n 8. It is further stated by the applicant that respondents issued one Gradation\n\n List as on 01.01.2019 of such employees in which name of applicant figured at\n\n sl. No.06 where in the date of his temporary status has been shown but date at\n\n 4 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n par with Group-D status has not been shown purposely for the reasons best\n\n known to the respondents. As the applicant was near to retire, he submitted a\n\n self-explanatory representation on 25.01.2019 for granting pension and other\n\n consequential benefits but when the said representation was not responded to by\n\n the respondents, applicant along with two others filed OA No.278/2019 which\n\n came to be disposed of on 02.01.2020 with direction to the respondents to take\n\n decision about regularization of the applicant within 30 days since he is going\n\n to superannuate from service on 29.02.2020.\n\n 9. It is further stated that applicant retired from service on 29.02.2020 but\n\nPatna no action was taken by the respondents on the representation of the applicant.\nBench\n\n But after one year of his retirement, respondents passed the Impugned Order\n\n mechanically without application of mind towards the fact and legal position\n\n that applicant has completed more than 27 yeas of service as a temporary\n\n Government servant at par with Group-D employee whereas other two co-\n\n applicants have been regularized against same post of MTS vide order dated\n\n 09.03.2020 (Annexure A-7) discriminating the applicant.\n\n 10. Applicant stated that in many similar and identical cases, this Tribunal\n\n has decided cases granting pension and other pensionary benefits to the\n\n applicants therein and upheld by Hon'ble High Court of Patna where it has been\n\n held that once an employee has completed more than 10 years of service at par\n\n with Group-D employee even without any order of regularization, have been\n\n allowed pension and other consequential benefits, hence impugned order is per-\n\n se-illegal and contrary to judicial pronouncements. Even after receipt of said\n\n order dated 28.01.2021, applicant preferred a representation dated 24.08.2021\n\n for re-consideration but no order has been passed till date.\n\n 5 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n 11. It is clear from the aforesaid submissions and judicial pronouncements\n\n mentioned above that the applicant is being deprived of pension which is\n\n recurring in nature and he is not at fault rather it is an administrative fault/lapse\n\n as his representation dated 24.08.2021 is still pending adjudication. Hence,\n\n applicant humbly stated that the present OA be decided in his favour.\n\n 12. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have filed\n\n written statement and narrated the background of the present matter. It is stated\n\n that the applicant was initially engaged as Casual Labour on 29.11.1989 and\n\n thereafter on completion of three years regular service, he was promoted at par\n\nPatna with temporary group-D employee vide Office Memo dated 27.07.1995.\nBench\n\n Applicant retired on 29.02.2020 as Casual Worker at par with temporary\n\n Group-D. Hence, the applicant is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for in\n\n the present OA.\n\n 13. It is further stated in the WS that as per settled position, applicant would\n\n have come under old pension scheme had his service got regularized before\n\n retirement whereas applicant retired on 29.02.2020. It is asserted that there were\n\n only two (UR-01 and OBC-01) approved vacancies at Patna GPO for the year\n\n 2020 as communicated by order dated 02.01.2020 in OA No.278 of 2019\n\n (Annexure A-6) complied vide letter dated 26.02.2020 (Annexure R/2) batch-\n\n mates regularized. Further, on recommendation of DPC two officials were\n\n found fit for promotion to MTS cadre namely Shri Mahendra Kumar and Shri\n\n Kaushal Kumar Singh against the unfilled vacancies for the year 2020 vide\n\n office order dated 09.03.2020 (Annexure R/3) and candidature of the applicant\n\n was not considered as sufficient number of eligible senior employees were\n\n available.\n\n 6 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n 14. Respondents have further stated in the WS that since the applicant was\n\n not regularized before his retirement, he cannot lay a claim for pension and/or\n\n pensionary benefits as also the benefit of MTS.\n\n SUBMISSIONS\n\n 15. Shri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel for applicant contended that:-\n\n (i) Applicant was initially appointed as casual labour through due\n process of law, granted temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1993 and on\n completion of three years from 29.11.1993 as temporary\n employee, respondents declared at par with Group 'D' regular\n employee w.e.f. 27.07.1995 and granted all benefits admissible to\n regular Group 'D' vide order dated 31.10.1991 as temporary\nPatna status at par with Group-D declared vide order dated 2707.1995\nBench\n (Annexure A-3).\n\n (ii) Applicant retired on 29.02.2020 as temporary status employee at\n par with Group 'D', lapses on part of respondents not regularized\n in last more than 27 years of continuous services.

Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in case of \nRekha Mukherjee vs. Ashish Kumar Das\n,\n (2005) 3 SCC 427 held that \"Government cannot be permitted to\n take advantage of its own wrong\".\n \nSo also in case of \nR.S. Mathur\n vs. Union of India\n (2008) 10 SCC 271, wherein it has held that\n \"delay in appointments ought not causes disadvantages to the\n employee in any manner.\n\n (iv) Applicant after grant of temporary status, worked for three years\n and as per scheme, related to casual labour (Grant of Temporary\n Status and Regularization) Scheme, Para 5 of the scheme, entitled\n for such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employee on\n regular basis.

Hon'ble High Court,\n Patna in case of \nU.O.I. & Ors. Vs. Ratneshwar Singh\n in CWJC\n No. 13117 of 2019, vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 held that\n offer made by respondents employer to applicant to promote him\n and then treat as regularized was not accepted by applicant for\n personal reason, but cannot construe to mean that he had\n declined regularization on post he was occupying and upheld\n order of this Tribunal.\n\n 16. Shri H.P. Singh, learned Senior C.G.S.C. appearing for respondents\n submitted that :\n\n (i) Applicant was engaged through due process as Casual Labour in\nPatna\nBench\n the year 1989 and continued with Temporary Status w.e.f.\n\n 29.11.1993 but at time of promotion as sanctioned regular Group\n 'D' posts/applicant could not be considered at time of promotion\n for regular post.

From the above submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and\n material placed on record. The admitted fact that applicant joined services as\n casual labour in 1989. Thereafter conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1993\n rendering continuous long, efficient service all his active life till retired on\n 29.02.2020. The core issue arises before this Tribunal for determination is:-\n\n \"Whether applicant who was appointed as a casual lobourer and thereafter\n conferred the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 29.11.1993 and retired\n on 29.02.2020 entitled to benefit of pension or not?\"\n\n ANALYSIS\n\n 18. Before dealing with the rival contentions advanced at the Bar. It is\n apposite to quote relevant portion of language of the statutory scheme, policy of\n Union of India Ministry of Communications & I.T., Department of Posts, The\n Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules, 1965, the Central Civil\n Services (Pension) Rules 2021, judgment binding precedents in similar cases,\n\n 9 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n in cases of pari-materia provisions passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble\n High Courts, our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and Benches of the Central\n Administrative Tribunal as under:-.\n\n RULE OF LAW\n (A)(i) The casual labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization\n Scheme issued by Department of Posts, Govt. of India dated 12.04.1991 drawn in\n compliance of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and approved by his Excellency\n President of India relevant portion is reproduced as under for appreciation of the\n Core issue involved in the present OA:-\n\n Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularisation)\n Scheme : In compliance with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme\n Court a scheme was drawn up by this Department in consultation with the\n Ministries of Law, Finance and Personnel and the President has been\n pleased to approve the said scheme. The scheme is as follows :-\n\n 1. Temporary status would be conferred on all casual labourers in\n employment as on 29.11.1969 and who continue to be currently\n employed and have rendered continuous service of at least one\n year during the year during the year they must have been engaged\n for a period of 240 days (206 days in the case of offices observing\nPatna five days week).\n\nBench 2. Such casual workers engaged for full working hours viz 8 hours\n including ½ hour's lunch time will be paid at daily rate on the\n basis of the minimum of the pay scale for a regular Group 'D'\n official including DA, HRA with CCA.\n\n 3. Benefit of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'\n employee would be taken into account for calculating per month\n rate wages after completion of one year of service from the date\n of conferment of Temporary Status. Such increment will be taken\n into account after every one year of service subject to\n performance of duty for at least 240 days (206 days in\n establishments observing five days week) in the year.\n\n 4. Leave entitlement will be one day for every 10 days' of work\n Casual leave or any other kind of leave except maternity leave,\n will not be admissible. No encashment of leave is permissible on\n termination of services for any reason or on the casual labourers\n quitting service.\n\n 5. Maternity leave to lady full time casual lanbourers will be\n allowed as admissible to regular Group 'D' employees.\n\n 6. 50% of the service rendered under Temporary Status would be\n counted for the purpose of retirement benefits after regularization\n as a regular Group 'D'. official.\n\n 7. Conferment of Temporary Status does not automatically imply\n that the casual labourers would be appointed as a regular Group\n 'D' employees within any fixed time frame. Appointment in\n Group 'D' vacancies will continue to be done as per the extant\n Recruitment Rules, which stipulate preference to eligible ED\n employee.\n\n 8. After rendering three years' continuous service after\n conferment of temporary status the casual labourers would be\n treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees for the\n purposes of contribution to General Provident Fund. They\n would also further be eligible for the grant of Festival\n Advance, Flood Advance on the same conditions as are\n applicable to temporary Group 'D' employee provided they\n furnish two sureties from permanent Government servants of\n this Department.\n\n 9. Their entitlement to Productivity Linked Bonus will continue to\n be at the rate applicable to casual labourers.\n\n 10. Temporary status does not debar dispensing with the service of\n the casual labourers after following the due procedure.\n\n 10 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n 11. If a labourer with temporary status commits a misconduct and the\n same is proved in an enquiry after giving him reasonable\n opportunity his services will be dispensed with.\n\n 12. Casual labourers may be regularized in units other than recruiting\n units also subject to availability of vacancies.\n\n 13. For purpose of appointment as a regular Group 'd' official the\n casual labourers will be allowed age relaxation to the extent of\n service rendered by them as casual labourers.\n\n 14. The casual labourers can be deployed any where within the\n recruitment unit /territorial circle on the basis of availability of\n work.\n\n 15. The engagement of the casual labourers will continue to be on\n daily rates of pay on need basis.\n\n 16. The conferment of temporary status has no relation to availability\n of sanctioned regular Group 'D' posts.\n\n 17. No recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts except\n compassionate appointment will be done till casual labourers\n with the requisite qualification are available to fill up the posts in\n question.\n\n Further action may be taken in regard to the casual labourers by each unit\n as per the above said scheme. This issues with the approval of Ministry of Finance\n and concurrence of Integrated finance vide their Dy No. 1282 FM/91 dated\nPatna\n 10.4.1991.\n\nBench [G.I. Dept of Posts.Lr.

According to him to earn pension it was\n necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.\n It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was\n in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary\n benefits.\n\n There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the Government for\n 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied\n the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a\n permanent employee of the government. The appellant having\n served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to\n treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\n Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we\n hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent\n after he served the Government for such a long period.

Their Lordships decided in favour of temporary status\n employee at par with Group 'D' employee and upheld order dated\n 22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna).

Their Lordships further\n observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs are\n entitled to family pension in light of Rule 10(2) of Temporary Service\n Rules i.e Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules 1965 read\n with CCS Pension Rules 1972 and temporary rules is a social legislation\n beneficial legislation to a beneficiary is required to be extended with\n reference to various judicial pronouncements on the principle of\n beneficial legislation and affirmed order dated 20.3.2013 in OA No. 164\n of 2008 (CAT, Patna) rejecting CWJC No. 7760/2015 of Department of\n Posts.

The Hon'ble High\n Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such\n lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The\n Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family\n Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased\n employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary\n capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary\n employee.\n\n The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of\n family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by\n notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for\n a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.\n\n 16 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n 20.

The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order\n relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n in case of \nPrem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others\n\n reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-\n\n \"35. There are some of the employees who have not been\n regularized in spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or\n more years whereas they have been superannuated.

This Court in the said decision has laid down that in\n case services have been rendered for more than ten years without\n the cover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services\n be regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those\n employees who have worked for ten years or more should have\n been regularized. It would not be proper to regulate them for\n consideration of regularisation as others have been regularised,\n we direct that their services be treated as a regular one.

In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue \"applicant casual\n labour of department of posts obtaining temporary status accordance with the\n scheme not regularized retired on 29.02.2020 is entitled to pension and\n pensionary benefits.\"\n\n 22. Admittedly, applicant was initially engaged as Casual Labourer in year\n 1989. The department of posts vide instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all\n daily wagers working in post offices are to be treated as casual labourers. The\n department of posts has made Scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of\n Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme effective from 01.10.1989.\n The scheme provided provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual\n labourers. So also the scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D'\n regular employee available on conferment of status of temporary employee.\n\n \n23. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus\n Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n 1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that\n\n 18 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same\n emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n temporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal\n department on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240\n days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal\n employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly\n with regular employees in the department.\n\n \n24. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in \nJagrit Mazdoor\n Union\n (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-\n\n \"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the\n casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of\n the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are\n admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\nPatna\nBench\n\n 25. \nIn compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra). The Department of Posts, Government of\n India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary\n Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been\n drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and\n Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously\n pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers\n working continuously for long period.\n\n 26. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and\n beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits\n to long continuous working of casual labourers.\n\n 27. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on applicant -\n while working as casual labour in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant\n is appointee of year 1989 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize\n and ought to have been regularized before superannuation on 29.02.2020\n accordance with law as regular employee for no fault of applicant made to\n suffer violating \nArticle 14\n, 21\n, 31A\n and \n300\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 28. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1993\n pursuant to order dated 31.10.1991 (Annexure A-2) and the statutory binding\n scheme has conferred after 3 years certain advantages to temporary employee\n w.e.f. 29.11.1993 as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the pay scale\n\n 19 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA. Para 3 provides\n for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'\n employee after completion of one year of service from date of conferment of\n Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of increment to a\n government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent is clear as\n noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and writ in the\n nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as social\n legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The Central\n Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State\n Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating temporary\n status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group 'D'\n employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and\n entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on\nPatna\nBench regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity\n Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary\n status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on\n absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation\n with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically\n provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three\n years continuous service as temporary status.\n\n 29. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 29.11.1993 and\n accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\n construction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after three\n years since 29.11.1993 has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees\n and regularly contributed to G.P.F w.e.f. 27.07.1995 vide Order dated\n 27.07.1995.

The applicant declared at par with Group -D employee vide order dated\n 27.07.1995 (Annexure A-3) acquired status of Group 'D' employee of\n Department of Posts and it is well settled in law that entitled for such benefits\n as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.

Batch-mate of\n applicant in OA No.278 of 2019 Kaushal Kumar Singh regularized vide order\n dated 26.02.2020 (Annexure R/2 annexed with WS).\n\n 31. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no\n recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers\n available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged\n statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the\n Constitution of India and applicant husband not regularized as for no fault\nPatna\nBench cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his duty\n and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take\n advantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them\n that since no regularization no pension etc.\n\n 32. The applicant before retirement submitted representation dated\n 25.01.2019 to allow to regularize services on regular cadre post. Respondents\n stated in WS that applicant could not be considered for regularization as Group\n 'D' through selection in view of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual\n labourers. The written statement and averments of OA that respondents not\n regularized services of applicant and rejected the representation after retirement\n vide Impugned Order dated 28.01.2021 (Annexure A-1). The applicant was\n never at fault for such lack of regularization served for more than 27 years as\n temporary employee.\n\n 33. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in\n the O.A that respondents have not regularized services on regular post as per\n law on time, in spite of written requests dated 25.01.2019 and retired on\n 29.02.2020 without being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view since\n respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated\n 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 1982. Hence\n respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny\n retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee before retirement. The\n matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to\n\n 21 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n applicant and he ought to have at least considered for regularization before date\n of superannuation. The applicant worked since 1989 till 29.02.2020 almost\n more than twenty seven (27) years in the department as temporary employee at\n par with Group-D.\n\n 34. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein\n above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated\n 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of\n casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status\n reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the employee in\n light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away by\n respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.\n Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of\nPatna\nBench\n implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged\n in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are\n substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to\n employee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and\n tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless\n regularized no pensionry benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not\n be denied relief claimed.\n\n 35. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992\n quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal\n department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly\n acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits admissible to temporary\n Group 'D' employee such as counting of service for purpose of pension and\n terminal benefits as in case of temporary employees appointed on regular basis\n while granting them pension and retirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n 36. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are\n regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The\n Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death\n gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as\n are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS\n Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension\n and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2\n\n 22 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive\n appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Rules 2021.\n\n 37. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as\n extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes\n temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021\n are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So also the\n explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6) cases\n of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services and\n posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December, 2003,\n who retired or were retired before having been appointed in a substantive\n capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the government\n servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)\nPatna\nBench\n Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as admissible to any other\n public servant and respondents have violated fundamental right enshrined in\n \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of India.\n\n 38. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years\n service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992\n provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement\n benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed\n by regularization.\n\n 39. The applicant stood retired on 29.02.2020 as temporary employee for no\n fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge his duties and no\n rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2021\n and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension, family pension and\n retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status of employee was at par\n with regular employee on long continuation on temporary post in welfare state.\n The Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would\n prevail over any policy decision.\n\n 40. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it\n clear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a\n substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type of category of\n temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity,\n death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant same scale as\n\n 23 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n admissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent\n provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-\n\n (i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation\n after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent\n service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of\n continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n 41. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes\n clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021\n (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of\n whereof of the affirm view that Government of India, Department of Posts\n instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992\n and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read\nPatna conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial\nBench\n legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered\n service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes\n entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the\n part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension\n Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers\n the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state\n as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy\n envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.\n\n \n42. Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses\n and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and applicant entitled to\n receive pension as if retired from regular establishment and so also held by\n Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgment in case of \nPrem Singh versus\n State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced herein above.\n\n \n43. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in\n case of \nUnion of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.\n 154 of 2019 decided\n on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in\n O.A. No. 372/2017 (\nBhikhani Devi Vs Union of India\n) as Tribunal relied on\n ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against\n same.\n \nTheir Lordships in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) observed that\n judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none\n of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that\n\n 24 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'\n unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an\n employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be\n admissible.\n\n \n44. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the Division\n Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal issue dealt in\n detail rules applicable in case of \nUnion of India and ors versus Meena Devi\n @ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n 7760 of 2015 decided on 08.12.2022,\n reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated 20.3.2013 in similar OA\n No. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of family pension arrears as per Rule\n 10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972 widow of employee died as\n temporary employee without being regularized.\n \nThis Tribunal has considered\nPatna\nBench\n the submissions of the counsel for the parties and in judgement in case of\n \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) previous cases not referred to the larger bench perused\n the ratio \nlaid down by\n their Lordships in case of \nMeena Devi @ Meena\n Kunwar\n (supra) decided on 08.12.2022. Their Lordships considering scheme\n for Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization) and held\n that husband of the applicant being temporary employee governed by CCS TS\n Rules 1965 and as per Rule 10 of CCSTS Rule 1965 read with CCS Pension\n Rule Their Lordships in Para 10 of judgement directed reads as under :-\n\n \"10.

Mehrotra v. State of U.P. (2001)9 SCC 687.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n \n45. Their Lordships in case of Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar , reported\n in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 considered impact effect of scheme dated 30.11.1992 of\n Postal Department and also considered Rule 10 of CCS TS Rules 1965 and\n applicability of CCS Pension Rules. After considering the proposition of law\n precedent/ratio decidendi has been laid down. This Tribunal is bound by the\n precedent in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) principle of law laid\n down interpreting service rules applicable in the case. The present case is also\n covered by the above binding-ratio decedendi, precedent.\n \nThe preposition of\n law as laid down considering relevant service rules in \nMeena Devi @ Meena\n\n 25 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n Kunwar\n (supra) by Hon'ble High Court Patna constitutes binding precedent\n on this Tribunal and present case is also deserves same treatment.\n\n 46. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and legal\n issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial\n pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court\n of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and\n Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This\n Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered\n matter on facts and legal issue involved in the present case and no more res-\n integra. The applicant is also entitled for the same treatment and consequential\n benefits envisaged in the Fundamental Right under \nArticle 14\n \n& 21\n of\n Constitution of India guaranteed to the applicant too.\nPatna\nBench\n\n 47. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of the\n Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual\n labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual\n Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal\n clear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if\n he has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by\n regularization. The applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1993 and\n not been regularized by respondents in spite of requests and for no fault stood\n retired on 29.02.2020.\n\n 48.

It is also submitted that\n Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a regular\n employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari Kakkar\n (supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary\n benefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent employee not\n regularized after served for 18 ½ years.\n\n 50. \nIn case of Rameshwari Devi versus Union of India, OA No.36 of 2021\n (CAT Patna Bench) vide order dated 17.01.2022 in case of employee with\n temporary status, placed reliance on judgment of \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n versus Union of India\n, (1996) 7 SCC 113, order of Principal Bench in OA\nPatna\nBench\n No.1287 of 2000. This Tribunal held that applicant's husband served\n continuously as Temporary Status Casual Labour for almost 22 years and not\n been regularized for reasons best known to the employer.\n Hon'ble High Court,\n Patna upheld order in O.A. No.143 of 2018, (CAT Bench Patna) Awadhesh\n Prasad Singh versus Union of India & Ors. related to temporary status\n employee not regularized, allowed OA directing respondents to settle pension\n and all pensionary benefits treating his superannuation. This Tribunal in case\n Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order dated 17.01.2022 directed respondents to\n process for issuance of Pension Payment Order. \nOrder dated 17.01.2022 in \nOA\n No.36/2021, Rameshwari Devi\n case was challenged in CWJC No.7859 of\n 2022 and Hon'ble High Court, Patna, their Lordships on all arrears amount\n directed to pay interest at rate of 8% in light of Hon'ble Supreme Court\n decision in case of Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of UP, (2001) 9 SCC 687.\n\n 51. Case of Rita Devi versus Union of India, OA No.2630 of 2021 (CAT\n Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased employee\n worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while working\n as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in Postal\n Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension etc. \nThis\n Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008 (\nMeena Devi vs.\n Union of India\n) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015\n (\nUnion of India versus Meena Devi\n) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,\n Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.\n\n Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was\n\n 27 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -\n without regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this\n Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as\n regular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at\n par with Group 'D' employee and issue pension, family pension and benefits\n with arrears.\n\n 52. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others\n\n O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) upheld by Hon'ble High Court of\n Patna. This Tribunal was seisin with issue - whether applicant who retired more\n than 25 years service as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' without\n regularization is entitled for pension and other retirement benefits? Applicant\n was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post and applicant did not accept\nPatna\nBench\n and continued as Temporary Status and retired as temporary status employee at\n par with Group 'D'. Applicant started employment as Night Guard on daily\n basis in Postal Department, conferred status of Temporary Status, selected as\n MTS, did not join denied pension, family pension.\n \nThis Tribunal in case \nShiv\n Shankar Sah\n (Supra) considered orders passed in similar facts in OA\n No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015 upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017\n by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on part of Postal Department not to\n regularize the services of husband, private respondent in 23 years of service\n after having granted temporary status at par with Group 'D' employee and\n conduct of postal department cannot be appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble\n High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017 upheld order passed by this\n Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing respondents to grant pensionary\n benefits even without regularization under old pension scheme.\n\n 53. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that as per rules\n for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on\n regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service\n after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On\n working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'\n employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not\n regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of\n respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise\n meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible\n for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order\n\n 28 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not\n regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah\n\n (Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant\n entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary\n Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on\n 03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service\n and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n\n 54. In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.\n No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue\n applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary\n status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at\n part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension\nPatna\nBench\n denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on\n regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not\n issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right\n accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule\n 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. \nSo also placed reliance in case OA\n No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of\n 2017 in \nRatneshwar Singh\n (Supra) this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018,\n allowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other\n retiral dues in light of judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and\n CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA\n No.372/2017.\n\n 55. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India\n & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this\n Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships\n considered argument of respondents department that contention of department\n cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be\n construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying\n for more than 27 years. \nThis Tribunal in \nOA No.050/00396 of 2019\n Shatrughan Prasad versus Union of India\n vide order dated 02.07.2024 has\n allowed identical OA.\n\n 56. The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by\n above precedents.\n\n 29 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n 57.

Respondents Department of Posts filed CWJC No.128 of 2024, Union\n of India & Ors. Versus Awadhesh Prasad Singh challenging order dated\n 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018 and Hon'ble High Court vide order dated\n 08.04.2024, heard at length and observed that prima-facie no case is made out,\n\nPatna\n directed respondents to comply directions of the CAT as a last chance.\nBench\n\n \n59. This Tribunal in case titled \nNaina Devi versus Union of India and\n others\n, OA No.1109 of 2015 vide order dated 24.11.2023 allowed OA. Relevant\n paragraphs 39 to 48 for ready reference are reproduced as under:-\n\n 39. \nIn \nYashwant Hari Katakkar\n (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court\n held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was\n not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½\n years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary\n benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent\n employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances\n appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the\n government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be\n permanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.\n\n 40. \nIn \nKritnarain Singh\n (Supra), \nSmt Ram Kali Devi\n (supra),\n \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra), Division Bench of Hon'ble\n High Court Patna examined core issue involved in present OA and their\n Lordships upheld the orders passed by this Tribunal in same facts and\n law and observed that failure on part of postal department respondents\n not to regularize services of employees serving for long period can not be\n appreciated and directed respondents to extend benefits of pension, family\n pension etc. So also upheld orders of this Tribunal in identical cases.\n\n 41. In Shri Painu Ram (supra) Division Bench of Hon'ble High\n Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla dealing with identical issue on\n similar facts upheld order dated 31.1.2014 passed by coordinate Bench\n Chandigarh of this Tribunal in O.A.

It is also submitted that Rule for family pension no where provides\n that the individual is to be a regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in case of \nYashwant Hari Kakkar\n (supra) has held that it would\n be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on\n ground that he was not a permanent employee not regularized after served\n for 18 ½ years.\n\n The legal issue in hand also qualified by judicial binding\n precedents pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme\n Court, Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana, Hon'ble High Court of\n Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna, their\n Lordships upheld judgements of this Tribunal in identical facts and legal\n issue binding precedents and present case is no different and core issue\n is no more res-integra.\n\n 46. For the above reasons, the issue accordingly decided in the\n favour of the applicant.\n\n 47. In consequences, the deceased employee is held entitled for the\n pension to be computed as per findings supra . The respondents are also\n directed to settle the family pension and other retiral benefits of the\n deceased employee and pay the arrears of pension and family pension\nPatna\n from 28.5.2022 onwards with interest @ 8 percent per annum from the\nBench date of entitlement within three months failing which the interest shall be\n paid @ 9 percent per annum from the date of entitlement till final\n payment\n\n 48. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\"\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n 60. The legal issue involved in the present case is also qualified by binding\n precedents cited herein above upheld by our own Hon'ble High Court Patna.\n Their Lordships upheld orders passed by this Tribunal in identical facts, legal\n issue and binding precedents. This Tribunal is of considered opinion that\n present case is no different and core issue is involved is no more res-integra.\n\n 61. Respondents much emphasized that applicant while working as\n Temporary Status - there were no vacancies to be promoted as regular\n employee, due to this he could not be appointed regular Group 'D' employee.\n As evident from pleadings applicant worked since year 1984 as casual labour\n thereafter as employee at par with Group 'D' and retired after 27 years.\n\n \n62. Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar case of \nUnion of India versus\n Ratneshwar Singh, CWJC No.13117\n of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019\n (Annexure - A/5 with OA) in paragraph 3, their Lordships held - \"These\n letters nowhere indicate that the respondent-petitioner had declined to accept\n regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by\n petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted\n by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be\n construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was\n\n 32 OA No. /050/0033/2024\n\n occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed\n in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in\n paragraph 11 of impugned judgment comes to the aid of respondent-\n petitioner.\" In view of law \nlaid down in\n similar facts and contention raised by\n respondents, Ho'ble High Court, Patna their Lordships repelled similar\n contention as raised in case on hand. Arguments of learned counsel for\n respondents has no force no document produced of promotion order and no\n application of refusal and repelled. In view whereof, OA deserves to be allowed\n and impugned order dated 27.07.2022 (Annexure - A/1) is set-aside and\n quashed with all consequential benefits.\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n 63. For the above reasons, impugned order dated 28.01.2021 Annexure -\nPatna\nBench A/1 so far relates to applicant is set- aside and the applicant is held entitled for\n the pension to be computed as per findings supra. Respondents are directed to\n settle the pension and all other retiral benefits and pay the arrears within period\n of three months from date of production/receipt of order passed today, with\n interest @8% per annum from date of entitlement failing which the interest\n shall be paid @9% per annum from date of entitlement till final payment.\n\n 64. The Original Application is accordingly allowed.\n\n 65. Any pending Misc. Application (s), if any, shall also stands disposed of.\n\n 66. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\n\n 67. Registry is directed to send copy of order passed today to Chief Post\n Master General, Bihar Circle, Patna-800001 to report compliance of order\n passed today and submit report within four months for compliance of order\n passed today and in case of non-compliance.
