Case Nos. 582 and 583\n\nof 2023.\n\nJyotsna Rewal Dua, Judge\n\nBackground of the case\n\nA dispute arose between Sh. Kashmir Singh, a\n\nGovernment Contractor and the Telecom Department in relation to\n\ntwo works awarded to him in Division Mandi Himachal Pradesh. Sh.\n\nKashmir Singh moved two Arbitration Case Nos. 37 & 38 of 2019\n\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (in\n\nshort 'the Act') for appointment of arbitrator. Considering total value\n\nof claim in both cases at around Rs. 11 lacs, a learned Advocate\n\nwas appointed as arbitrator for deciding both the claims. The\n\narbitrator entered into the references and passed separate awards\n\nin two cases on 11.11.2022 directing the Telecom Department to\nWhether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the judgment? Yes.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\npay Rs. 4,40,521/- alongwith interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of\n\nfiling of the claim petition in one claim and Rs. 2,26,554/- in the other\n\nalongwith interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the claim\n\npetition. Respondents were also directed to refund the security\n\namount within 30 days failing which interest @ 6% p.a. was\n\nchargeable. Sh. Kashmir Singh filed objections under\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Act before the learned District Judge, Mandi. Learned District\n\nJudge considered the provisions of\nSection 2(1)(e)\n,\nSection 11\n&\n\nSection 42\nof the Act, judicial precedents of various Hon'ble High\n\nCourts & Hon'ble Supreme Court and held that arbitrator was\n\nappointed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, which is vested\n\nwith original civil jurisdiction, therefore, it will fall within the definition\n\nof 'Court' under\nSection 2(i)(e)\n, hence by virtue of\nSection 42\nof the\n\nAct, all subsequent applications are required to be filed before the\n\nHigh Court and not before the District Court. Accordingly learned\n\nDistrict Judge held that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the\n\nobjections filed by Sh. Kashmir Singh. Objections were ordered to be\n\nreturned to him for presentation before the appropriate Court i.e. this\n\nCourt. Learned District Judge had also observed that all arbitration\n\nproceedings were conducted at Shimla, therefore, the District Judge\n\nMandi will have no jurisdiction to entertain the objections.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nConsequently, these objections i.e. Arbitration Case Nos.\n\n582 & 583 of 2023 have been filed by Sh. Kashmir Singh under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act challenging the awards passed by the learned\n\narbitrator on 11.11.2022. Counter Arbitration Case Nos. 581 & 584\n\nof 2023 have been filed by the Telecom Department assailing the\n\nsame awards passed by the learned arbitrator.\n\n2. The Point involved\n\nBefore embarking upon merits of the objections, the first\n\nquestion that needs addressing is: Whether upon appointment of\n\narbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act by the High Court more\n\nparticularly where the High Court also exercises original civil\n\njurisdiction, the objections against the award are to be filed before\n\nthe High Court or the District Judge.\n\nIn the instant case, applications under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\n\nAct were moved by Sh. Kashmir Singh in this Court seeking\n\nappointment of arbitrator in Arbitration Case Nos. 37 & 38 of 2019.\n\nSole arbitrator was appointed by the High Court on 02.08.2019. So\n\nwhether the High Court which also exercises original civil jurisdiction\n\nhas exclusive jurisdiction to entertain objections under\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Act, is the point to be delved upon. Learned Counsel for the\n\nparties have been heard accordingly.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n2(i). Legal Provisions\n\nSections 42\n,\n2(1)(e)\n&\nof the Act have bearing on the\n\nquestion concerned:-\n\n2(i)(a) \"42. Jurisdiction. - Notwithstanding anything contained\nelsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in\nforce, where with respect to an arbitration agreement any\napplication under this Part has been made in a Court, that\nCourt alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings\nand all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement\nand the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in\nno other Court.\"\n\nSection 42\nstarts with a non-obstante clause i.e.\n\n'notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any\n\nother law for the time being in force'. The words 'this Part' refers to\n\nPart-I which encompasses\nSections 1\n- 43. As per\nSection 42\n,\n\nwhere an application with respect to an arbitration agreement under\n\nPart-I has been made to a Court then that Court alone will have the\n\njurisdiction over (a) arbitral proceedings & (b) all subsequent\n\napplications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral\n\nproceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court.\n\n2(i)(b) 'Court' has been defined in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act to\n\nmean:-\n\n2(1)(e) \"Court\" means -\n\n\"(i) in the case of an arbitration other than international\ncommercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of original\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\njurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in\nexercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having\njurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-\n\nmatter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-\nmatter of a suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a\ngrade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any Court of\nSmall Causes;\n\n(ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration, the\nHigh Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction,\nhaving jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the\nsubject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the\nsubject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a High Court\nhaving jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts\nsubordinate to that High Court;\"\n\n2(1)(c)\nSection 11\nof the Act pertains to appointment of\n\narbitrators. Relevant portion of this Section is as follows:-\n\n'11. Appointment of arbitrators.--(1) A person of any nationality\nmay be an arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n(2) Subject to sub-section (6), the parties are free to agree on a\nprocedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators.\n(3) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), in an\narbitration with three arbitrators, each party shall appoint one\narbitrator, and the two appointed arbitrators shall appoint the\nthird arbitrator who shall act as the presiding arbitrator.\n(3A) The Supreme Court and the High Court shall have the\npower to designate, arbitral institutions, from time to time, which\nhave been graded by the Council under\nSection 43-I\n, for the\npurposes of this Act:\n\nProvided that in respect of those High Court jurisdictions,\nwhere no graded arbitral institution are available, then, the\nChief Justice of the concerned High Court may maintain a panel\nof arbitrators for discharging the functions and duties of arbitral\ninstitution and any reference to the arbitrator shall be deemed\nto be an arbitral institution for the purposes of this section and\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nthe arbitrator appointed by a party shall be entitled to such fee\nat the rate as specified in the Fourth Schedule:\n\nProvided further that the Chief Justice of the concerned High\nCourt may, from time to time, reviews the panel of arbitrators.\n\n(4) If the appointment procedure in sub-section (3) applies\nand--\n\n(a) a party fails to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days\nfrom the receipt of a request to do so from the other\nparty; or\n\n(b) the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the third\narbitrator within thirty days from the date of their\nappointment,\nthe appointment shall be made, on an application of the party,\nby the arbitral institution designated by the Supreme Court, in\ncase of international commercial arbitration, or by the High\nCourt, in case of arbitrations other than international\ncommercial arbitration, as the case may be.\n(5) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), in an\narbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree on the\narbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request by one\nparty from the other party to so agree the appointment shall be\nmade on an application of the party in accordance with the\nprovisions contained in sub-section (4).\n(6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the\nparties,--\n\n(a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure;

The other provisions of\nSection 11\nwere also amended\n\naccordingly.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nUse of the words 'High Court' in\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\n\ninstead of 'Chief Justice' has given rise to the question in the\n\npresent case that when the appointment of the arbitrator is not by\n\nthe Chief Justice but by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh and\n\nincidentally this High Court exercises original civil jurisdiction and\n\nfalls within the definition of 'Court' under\nSection 2(1)(e)\nthen by\n\nvirtue of\nSection 42\nof the Act, objections challenging the arbitral\n\naward should also be filed before this Court.\n\n3. Legal Position\nThe question - Whether appointment of arbitrator by the\n\nChief Justice under the Act (prior to 2015 amendment) was an\n\nadministrative or judicial act came up for consideration in several\n\ncases.\n\n3(i).\nKonkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. & others vs. Mehul\n\nConstruction Co.2\n, held that order of appointment of arbitrator\n\npassed under\nSection 11(6)\nwas administrative in nature. The Chief\n\nJustice does not function as a Court or a Tribunal. The said order\n\ncannot be subjected to judicial scrutiny of the Supreme Court. The\n\nnature of function performed by the Chief Justice being essentially\n\nto aid, constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be held to be a\n\njudicial function or otherwise legislature would have used the\n(2000) 7 SCC 201\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nwords 'Court' or 'a judicial authority' instead of choosing the\n\nexpression 'the Chief Justice or his nominee'. Relevant paras from\n\nthe judgment are as under:-\n\n\"4. ... ... In fact a Bench of this Court in\nSundaram Finance case3 while considering the scope of\n\nSection 9\nof the Act has approached the problem from this\nperspective and incidental observation has been made that\n\nSection 11\ndoes not require the Court to pass a judicial order\nappointing arbitrator. The nature and function performed by\nthe Chief Justice or his nominee under sub- section (6) of\n\nSection 11\nbeing essentially to aid the constitution of the\narbitral tribunal cannot be held to be a judicial function as\notherwise the legislature could have used the expression\n'court' or 'judicial authority' instead of choosing the\nexpression 'the Chief Justice or his nominee'. If a\ncomparison is made with the\nEnglish Arbitration Act\n1996 it\nwould appear that under the\nEnglish Act\nit is the Court which\nhas been vested with the function of appointment of an\narbitrator upon failure of the agreed appointment procedure\nand an order made by the Court becomes appealable under\n\nSection 11(5)\nwhereas under the\nArbitration and Conciliation\nAct\nof 1996 in India the power of appointment is vested with\nthe Chief Justice or his nominee.\n\n5. An analysis of different sub-sections of\nSection 11\n\nwould indicate the character of the order, which the Chief\nJustice or his nominee passes under Sub-section (6) of\n\nSection 11\n. Sub-section (3) and sub-section (4) deals with\ncases, in which a party fails to appoint an arbitrator or the\narbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator and thus seeks\n(1999) 2 SCC 479\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nto avoid frustration or unreasonable delay in the matter of\nconstitution of the arbitral tribunal. It authorises the Chief\nJustice of India or the Chief Justice of a High Court\nconcerned, or any person or institution designated by him to\nmake the appointment upon request of a party, if the other\nparty has failed to appoint an arbitrator within thirty days\nfrom the receipt of a request to that end. Sub-\nsections 4\n,\nand\ndesignedly use the expression 'Chief Justice' in\npreference to a Court or other authority as in paragraphs (3)\nand (4) of\nArticle 11\nof the Model Law, obviously for the\nreason that the Chief Justice acting in his administrative\ncapacity, is expected to act quickly without encroaching on\nthe requirements that only competent persons are appointed\nas arbitrators. Sub-section (4) does not lay down any time\nlimit within which the Chief Justice or his nominee,\ndesignated by him, has to make the appointment. It however\nexpects that these functionaries would act promptly. While\nsub-sections (4) and (5) deal with removal of obstacles\narising in the absence of agreement between the parties on\na procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators, sub-\nsection (6) seeks to remove obstacles arising when there is\nan agreed appointment procedure. These obstacles are\nidentified in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section(6). Sub-\nsection(6) provides a cure to these problems by permitting\nthe aggrieved party to request the Chief Justice or any\nperson or institution designated by him to take the necessary\nmeasure i.e. to make the appointment, unless the agreement\non the appointment procedure provides other means for\nsecuring the appointment. Sub-section(6), therefore, aims at\nremoving any dead-lock or undue delay in the appointment\nprocess. This being the position, it is reasonable to hold\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nthat while discharging the functions under sub-\nsection(6), the Chief Justice or his nominee will be\nacting in his administrative capacity and such a\nconstruction would subserve the very object of the new\nArbitration Law.\n\n6. The nature of the function performed by the Chief\nJustice being essentially to aid the Constitution of the\nArbitration Tribunal immediately and the legislature having\nconsciously chosen to confer the power on the Chief Justice\nand not a Court, it is apparent that the order passed by the\nChief Justice or his nominee is an administrative order, as\nhas been held by this Court in Ador Samia case4 and the\nobservations of this Court in\nSundaram Finance Ltd.3\ncase\nalso is quite appropriate and neither of those decisions\nrequire any re-consideration. This being the position even an\norder refusing to appoint an arbitrator will not be amenable\nto the jurisdiction of this Court under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution. Needless to mention such an order refusing to\nappoint an arbitrator after deciding the contentious issues\nwould be an act of non-performance of duty and in view of\nwhat has been stated earlier the concerned authority could\nbe directed by mandamus to perform its duty.\"\n\n3(ii) Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. & others2 was approved by\n\nthe Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in\nKonkan Railway\n\nCorporation Ltd. & another vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.5\nholding\n\nthat nature of function performed by the Chief Justice or his\n\nnominee under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is purely administrative. It is\n(1999) 8 SCC 572\n(2002) 2 SCC 388\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nneither judicial nor quasi judicial. No contentious issue can be\n\ndecided while performing functions under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n3(iii) SBP & Co. vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. & another6,\n\noverruled\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. vs. Rani Construction\n\nPvt. Ltd.5\n. The majority decision held that under\nSection 11(6)\nthere\n\nare several preliminary matters to be determined by the Chief\n\nJustice or his designate before appointment of an arbitrator viz.\n\nWhether application for appointment of arbitrator has been moved\n\nbefore the High Court having jurisdiction; Whether valid arbitration\n\nagreement exists between the parties; Whether dispute between\n\nthe parties is arbitrable etc. For deciding these questions before\n\nappointing arbitrator, the Chief Justice or his designate can proceed\n\neither on the basis of affidavits or documents produced or take such\n\nevidence as may be necessary. It was held that once the statute\n\ncreates an authority, confers on it power to adjudicate and makes its\n\ndecision final on matters to be decided by it, normally, that decision\n\ncannot be said to be purely administrative though power to appoint\n\narbitrator is not conferred on the Supreme Court or the High Court\n\nbut on the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High\n\nCourt. One possible reason for this is that conferment of power upon\n\nthe High Court would be governed by normal procedure of the Court\n(2005) 8 SCC 618\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nincluding right of appeal. However this situation is to be avoided\n\nsince object of the Act itself is to restrict interference by the Courts.\n\nTherefore, power is conferred on highest judicial authority in the\n\ncountry & in the states in their capacities as Chief Justices. But the\n\npower so conferred is not as persona designata. The mere fact that\n\npower is conferred upon Chief Justice and not on the Court presided\n\nby him, would not mean that power conferred is only administrative\n\nand not judicial. Relevant paragraphs of the judgment read as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"9. Normally, any tribunal or authority conferred with a\npower to act under a statute, has the jurisdiction to satisfy\nitself that the conditions for the exercise of that power\nexisted and that the case calls for the exercise of that power.\nSuch an adjudication relating to its own jurisdiction which\ncould be called a decision on jurisdictional facts, is not\ngenerally final, unless it is made so by the Act constituting\nthe tribunal. Here, sub-section (7) of\nSection 11\nhas given a\nfinality to the decisions taken by the Chief Justice or any\nperson or institution designated by him in respect of matters\nfalling under sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of\nSection 11\n.\nOnce a statute creates an authority, confers on it power to\nadjudicate and makes its decision final on matters to be\ndecided by it, normally, that decision cannot be said to be a\npurely administrative decision. It is really a decision on its\nown jurisdiction for the exercise of the power conferred by\nthe statute or to perform the duties imposed by the statute.\nUnless, the authority satisfies itself that the conditions for\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nexercise of its power exist, it could not accede to a request\nmade to it for the exercise of the conferred power. While\nexercising the power or performing the duty under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act, the Chief Justice has to consider whether\nthe conditions\nlaid down by\nthe section for the exercise of\nthat power or the performance of that duty, exist. Therefore,\nunaided by authorities and going by general principals, it\nappears to us that while functioning under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act, a Chief Justice or the person or institution\ndesignated by him, is bound to decide whether he has\njurisdiction, whether there is an arbitration agreement,\nwhether the applicant before him, is a party, whether the\nconditions for exercise of the power have been fulfilled and if\nan arbitrator is to be appointed, who is the fit person, in\nterms of the provision.\nSection 11(7)\nmakes his decision on\nthe matters entrusted to him, final.\n\n10. The very scheme, if it involves an adjudicatory\nprocess, restricts the power of the Chief Justice to\ndesignate, by excluding the designation of a non-judicial\ninstitution or a non-judicial authority to perform the functions.\nFor, under our dispensation, no judicial or quasi-judicial\ndecision can be rendered by an institution if it is not a judicial\nauthority, court or a quasi-judicial tribunal. This aspect is\ndealt with later while dealing with the right to designate\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nand the scope of that designation.\n\n11. The appointment of an arbitrator against the\nopposition of one of the parties on the ground that the Chief\nJustice had no jurisdiction or on the ground that there was\nno arbitration agreement, or on the ground that there was no\ndispute subsisting which was capable of being arbitrated\nupon or that the conditions for exercise of power under\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act do not exist or that the qualification\ncontemplated for the arbitrator by the parties cannot be\nignored and has to be borne in mind, are all adjudications\nwhich affect the rights of parties. It cannot be said that when\nthe Chief Justice decides that he has jurisdiction to proceed\nwith the matter, that there is an arbitration agreement and\nthat one of the parties to it has failed to act according to the\nprocedure agreed upon, he is not adjudicating on the rights\nof the party who is raising these objections. The duty to\ndecide the preliminary facts enabling the exercise of\njurisdiction or power, gets all the more emphasized, when\nsub-section (7) designates the order under sub-sections (4),\n(5) or (6) a 'decision' and makes the decision of the Chief\nJustice final on the matters referred to in that sub-Section.\n\nThus, going by the general principles of law and the\nscheme of\nSection 11\n, it is difficult to call the order of\nthe Chief Justice merely an administrative order and to\nsay that the opposite side need not even be heard before the\nChief Justice exercises his power of appointing an arbitrator.\nEven otherwise, when a statute confers a power or imposes\na duty on the highest judicial authority in the State or in the\ncountry, that authority, unless shown otherwise, has to act\njudicially and has necessarily to consider whether his power\nhas been rightly invoked or the conditions for the\nperformance of his duty are shown to exist.\n\n...\n\n13. It is common ground that the Act has adopted the\nUNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial\nArbitration. But at the same time, it has made some\ndepartures from the model law.\nSection 11\nis in the place of\n\nArticle 11\nof the Model Law. The Model Law provides for the\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nmaking of a request under\nArticle 11\nto \"the court or other\nauthority specified in\nArticle 6\nto take the necessary\nmeasure\". The words in\nSection 11\nof the Act, are \"the Chief\nJustice or the person or institution designated by him\". The\nfact that instead of the court, the powers are conferred on\nthe Chief Justice, has to be appreciated in the context of the\nstatute. 'Court' is defined in the Act to be the principal civil\ncourt of original jurisdiction of the district and includes the\nHigh Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction.\nThe principal civil court of original jurisdiction is normally the\nDistrict Court. The High Courts in India exercising\nordinary original civil jurisdiction are not too many. So in\nmost of the States the concerned court would be the District\nCourt. Obviously, the Parliament did not want to confer the\npower on the District Court, to entertain a request for\nappointing an arbitrator or for constituting an arbitral tribunal\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act. It has to be noted that under\n\nSection 9\nof the Act, the District Court or the High Court\nexercising original jurisdiction, has the power to make\ninterim orders prior to, during or even post arbitration. It\nhas also the power to entertain a challenge to the award\nthat may ultimately be made. The framers of the statute\nmust certainly be taken to have been conscious of the\ndefinition of 'court' in the Act. It is easily possible to\ncontemplate that they did not want the power under\n\nSection 11\nto be conferred on the District Court or the\nHigh Court exercising original jurisdiction. The intention\napparently was to confer the power on the highest judicial\nauthority in the State and in the country, on Chief Justices of\nHigh Courts and on the Chief Justice of India. Such a\nprovision is necessarily intended to add the greatest\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\ncredibility to the arbitral process. The argument that the\npower thus conferred on the Chief Justice could not even be\ndelegated to any other Judge of the High Court or of the\nSupreme Court, stands negatived only because of the power\ngiven to designate another. The intention of the legislature\nappears to be clear that it wanted to ensure that the power\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act was exercised by the highest\njudicial authority in the concerned State or in the country.\nThis is to ensure the utmost authority to the process of\nconstituting the arbitral tribunal.\n\n...\n\n18. It is true that the power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act\nis not conferred on the Supreme Court or on the High Court,\nbut it is conferred on the Chief Justice of India or the Chief\nJustice of the High Court. One possible reason for\nspecifying the authority as the Chief Justice, could be\nthat if it were merely the conferment of the power on the\nHigh Court, or the Supreme Court, the matter would be\ngoverned by the normal procedure of that Court,\nincluding the right of appeal and the Parliament\nobviously wanted to avoid that situation, since one of\nthe objects was to restrict the interference by Courts in\nthe arbitral process. Therefore, the power was conferred\non the highest judicial authority in the country and in\nthe State in their capacities as Chief Justices. They have\nbeen conferred the power or the right to pass an order\ncontemplated by\nSection 11\nof the Act. We have already\nseen that it is not possible to envisage that the power is\nconferred on the Chief Justice as persona designata.\nTherefore, the fact that the power is conferred on the Chief\nJustice, and not on the court presided over by him is not\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nsufficient to hold that the power thus conferred is merely an\nadministrative power and is not a judicial power.\"\n\nThe conclusions were summed up by the Hon'ble Court in\n\nthe following paragraph:-\n\n\"47. We, therefore, sum up our conclusions as follows:\n\ni) The power exercised by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court or the Chief Justice of India under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act is not an administrative\npower. It is a judicial power.\n\nii) The power under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, in its\nentirety, could be delegated, by the Chief Justice of\nthe High Court only to another judge of that court and\nby the Chief Justice of India to another judge of the\nSupreme Court.\n\niii) In case of designation of a judge of the High Court or\nof the Supreme Court, the power that is exercised by\nthe designated, judge would be that of the Chief\nJustice as conferred by the statute.\n\niv) The Chief Justice or the designated judge will have\nthe right to decide the preliminary aspects as\nindicated in the earlier part of this judgment. These\nwill be, his own jurisdiction, to entertain the request,\nthe existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the\nexistence or otherwise of a live claim, the existence of\nthe condition for the exercise of his power and on the\nqualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief\nJustice or the judge designated would be entitled to\nseek the opinion of an institution in the matter of\nnominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of\nSection\n11(8)\nof the Act if the need arises but the order\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nappointing the arbitrator could only be that of the\nChief Justice or the judge designate.\n\nv) Designation of a district judge as the authority under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court is not warranted on the scheme of the Act.\n\nvi) Once the matter reaches the arbitral tribunal or the\nsole arbitrator, the High Court would not interfere with\norders passed by the arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal\nduring the course of the arbitration proceedings and\nthe parties could approach the court only in terms of\n\nSection 37\nof the Act or in terms of\nSection 34\nof the\nAct.\n\nvii) Since an order passed by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court or by the designated judge of that court is\na judicial order, an appeal will lie against that order\nonly under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India to\nthe Supreme Court.\n\nviii) There can be no appeal against an order of the\nChief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme\nCourt designated by him while entertaining an\napplication under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\nix) In a case where an arbitral tribunal has been\nconstituted by the parties without having recourse to\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act, the arbitral tribunal will have\nthe jurisdiction to decide all matters as contemplated\nby\nSection 16\nof the Act.\n\nx) Since all were guided by the decision of this Court in\n\nKonkan Railway Corporation Ltd. and Anr. v. Rani\nConstruction Pvt. Ltd.5\nand orders under\nSection\n11(6)\nof the Act have been made based on the\nposition adopted in that decision, we clarify that\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nappointments of arbitrators or arbitral tribunals thus\nfar made, are to be treated as valid, all objections\nbeing left to be decided under\nSection 16\nof the Act.\n\nAs and from this date, the position as adopted in this\njudgment will govern even pending applications under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\nxi) Where District Judges had been designated by the\nChief Justice of the High Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Act, the appointment orders thus far made by\nthem will be treated as valid; but applications if any\npending Page 1824 before them as on this date will\nstand transferred, to be dealt with by the Chief Justice\nof the concerned High Court or a Judge of that court\ndesignated by the Chief Justice.\n\nxii) The decision in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd.\n\nand\nAnr. v. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd.5\nis\noverruled.\"\n\n3(iv) In Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. Vs. Krishna Travel\n\nAgency7, the contention raised before the Hon'ble Apex Court was\n\nsince the arbitrator had been appointed by the Apex Court, it alone\n\nwould have the jurisdiction to decide the objections against the\n\naward. The answer given was that once an arbitrator is appointed\n\nthen the appropriate forum for filing and challenging the award will\n\nbe the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction. Parties will\n\nhave the right to move under\nSections 34\nand\nof the Act\n\naccordingly. In scheme of things if appointment is made by the\n(2008) 6 SCC 741\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nHigh Court or the Supreme Court, Principal Civil Court of Original\n\nJurisdiction remains the same as contemplated under\nSection\n\n2(1)(e)\nof the Act. It was also observed that in case objections to the\n\naward were to lie to High Court/Supreme Court that appointed the\n\narbitrator that would mean that in every case the High\n\nCourt/Supreme Court will become the Principal Civil Court of\n\nOriginal Jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. A valuable right\n\nof appeal will be lost. The expression 'court' used in\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Act will have to be understood ignoring the definition of 'court'\n\nin the Act.\n\nThe Apex Court also affirmed the view taken in\nState of\n\nGoa vs. Western Builders8\nthat in case of appointment of arbitrator\n\nby High Court under\nSection 11(6)\n, the Principal Civil Court of\n\nOriginal Jurisdiction remained the District Court and not the High\n\nCourt. If arbitrator is appointed by the Supreme Court, the\n\nobjections can be filed before the Principal Civil Court of Original\n\nJurisdiction as defined in\nSection 2(1)(e)\n. It was also held that\n\nconverse position would result in depriving the party of its valuable\n\nright to appeal under\nSection 37\nof the Act. The Court also held that\n\nit was not the intention of the Legislature to make the High Court as\n\nPrincipal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction when arbitrator is\n(2006) 6 SCC 239\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nappointed by the High Court under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. Once\n\nan arbitrator is appointed then the appropriate forum for filing the\n\naward and for challenging the same will be the Principal Civil Court\n\nof Original Jurisdiction.\n\nRelevant paragraphs of the judgment read as under:-\n\n\"8. Apart from these four cases, which have been brought\nto our notice, the position of law is very clear that in case the\nargument of learned counsel is accepted, that would mean\nthat in every case where this court passes an order, be it\non appeal, from the order passed by the High Court\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996, this court will become a Principal Civil Court\nof Original Jurisdiction. If the argument is further taken to\nits logical conclusion that would mean that the parties will\nhave to approach this Court by making an application under\n\nSection 34\ni.e. for setting aside the award. The expression\n'Court' used in\nSection 34\nof the Act will also have to be\nunderstood ignoring the definition of '\nCourt' in the Act\n.\n\n9. There is another facet of the problem. The party will\nbe deprived of the right to file an appeal under\nSection\n37(i)(b)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. This means\nthat a valuable right of appeal will be lost. Therefore, in the\nscheme of things, the submission of the learned counsel\ncannot be accepted. Taking this argument to a further logical\nconclusion, when the appointment is made by the High Court\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Conciliation Act, then\nin that case\n,\nin every appointment made by the High Court in exercise of\nits power under\nSection 11 (6)\n, the High Court will become\nthe Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction, as defined in\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act. That is certainly not the\nintention of the legislature. Once an arbitrator is\nappointed then the appropriate forum for filing the\naward and for challenging the same, will be the Principal\nCivil Court of Original Jurisdiction. Thus, the parties will\nhave the right to move under\nSection 34\nof the 1996 Act\nand to appeal under\nSection 37\nof the 1996 Act.\nTherefore, in the scheme of things, if appointment is\nmade by the High Court or by this Court, the Principal\nCivil Court of Original Jurisdiction remains the same as\ncontemplated under\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act.\n\n10. We further reiterate that the view taken by this Court\nin\nNational Aluminium Co. Ltd. Vs. Pressteel & Fabrications\n(P) Ltd.9\nand\nState of Goa vs. Western Builders8\nis the\ncorrect approach and we reaffirm the view that in case\nany appointment of arbitrator is made by the High Court\nunder\nSection 11(6)\n, the principal Civil Court of Original\nJurisdiction remains the District Court and not the High\nCourt. And likewise, if an appointment of the arbitrator is\nmade by this Court\n,\nin that case\nalso, the objection can only\nbe filed before the Principal Civil Court of Original\nJurisdiction as defined in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the 1996 Act.\n\nThus, in this view of the matter, we hold that the plea raised\nby learned counsel for the petitioner that this Court should\nentertain the award given by the arbitrator appointed by this\nCourt and all objections to at should be disposed of by this\nCourt is inacceptable and consequently, the prayer made in\nthe application is rejected.\"\n(2004) 1 SCC 540\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n3(v) In State of Maharashtra through\nExecutive Engineer vs.\n\nAtlanta Limited10\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered\nSection\n\n2(1)(e)\nof the Act and said that where the High Court exercised\n\nordinary civil jurisdiction over a district, the High Court will have\n\npreference to the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction in that\n\ndistrict. In that case one party had moved under\nSection 34\nbefore\n\nthe District Judge and the other party challenged the award before\n\nthe High Court. It was held that 'Court' for the purpose of\nSection 42\n\nwill be the High Court and not the District Court. Reasons assigned\n\ninter alia were that firstly inclusion of the High Court in definition of\n\nthe 'Court' in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nwould become nugatory if the above\n\nconclusion was not accepted as the Principal Civil Court of Original\n\nJurisdiction would always be court lower in grade than the High\n\nCourt. Secondly, it is the superior court exercising orginal jurisdiction\n\nwhich has been chosen to adjudicate the disputes arising out of\n\narbitration agreement. Relevant paragraphs of the judgments read\n\nas under:-\n\n\"32. All the same, it is imperative for us to determine,\nwhich of the above two courts which have been approached\nby the rival parties, should be the one, to adjudicate upon\nthe disputes raised. For an answer to the controversy in\nhand, recourse ought to be made first of all to the provisions\n(2014) 11 SCC 619\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nof the\nArbitration Act\n. On the failure to reach a positive\nconclusion, other principles of law, may have to be relied\nupon. Having given out thoughtful consideration to the issue\nin hand, we are of the view, that the rightful answer can be\ndetermined from\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Arbitration Act, which\ndefines the term \"Court\". We shall endeavour to determine\nthis issue, by examining how litigation is divided between a\nHigh Court exercising \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\", and\nthe \"principal civil court of original jurisdiction\" in a district.\n\nWhat needs to be kept in mind is, that the High Court of\nBombay is vested with \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\"\n\nover the same area, over which jurisdiction is also exercised\nby the \"principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction\" for the\nDistrict of Greater Mumbai (i.e. the Principal District Judge,\nGreater Mumbai). Jurisdiction of the above two courts on the\n\"ordinary original civil side\" is over the area of Greater\nMumbai. Whilst examining the submissions advanced by the\nlearned counsel for the appellant under\nSection 15\nof the\nCode of Civil Procedure, we have already concluded, that in\nthe above situation, jurisdiction will vest with the High Court\nand not with the District Judge. The aforesaid choice of\njurisdiction has been expressed in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the\nArbitration Act, without any fetters whatsoever.\n\n33. It is not the case of the appellants before us, that\nbecause of pecuniary dimensions, and/or any other\nconsideration(s), jurisdiction in the two alternatives\nmentioned above, would lie with the Principal District Judge,\nGreater Mumbai. Under the scheme of the provisions of the\n\nArbitration Act\ntherefore, if the choice is between the High\nCourt (in exercise of its \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\") on\nthe one hand, and the \"principal civil court of original\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\njurisdiction\" in the District i.e. the District Judge on the other;\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Arbitration Act has made the choice in\nfavour of the High Court. This in fact impliedly discloses a\nlegislative intent. To our mind therefore, it makes no\ndifference, if the \"principal civil court of original\njurisdiction\", is in the same district over which the High\nCourt exercises original jurisdiction, or some other\ndistrict. In case an option is to be exercised between a\nHigh Court (under its \"ordinary original civil\njurisdiction\") on the one hand, and a District Court (as\n\"principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction\") on the\nother, the choice under the\nArbitration Act\nhas to be\nexercised in favour of the High Court.\n\n34. In the present controversy also, we must choose the\njurisdiction of one of two courts i.e. either the \"ordinary\noriginal civil jurisdiction\" of the High Court of Bombay; or the\n\"principal civil court of original jurisdiction\" in District Thane\ni.e. the District Judge, Thane. In view of the inferences\ndrawn by us, based on the legislative intent emerging out of\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Arbitration Act, we are of the\nconsidered view, that legislative choice is clearly in favour of\nthe High Court. We are, therefore of the view, that the\nmatters in hand would have to be adjudicated upon by the\nHigh Court of Bombay alone.\"\n\n3(vi) In\nState of West Bengal & others vs. Associated\n\nContractors11\n, the question of law before the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt was as to which Court will have the jurisdiction to entertain\n\nand decide applications under\nSection 34\nof the Act. Under\nSection\n(2015)\nSCC 32\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n9 of the Act an interim order was passed by the High Court. In an\n\napplication under\nSection 11\nof the Act, arbitrator was appointed to\n\nadjudicate the dispute between the parties. An argument was raised\n\nthat by virtue of\nSection 42\nof the Act it is only the High Court that\n\nwill have jurisdiction to decide the applications under\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Act. Hon'ble Apex Court held that definition of word 'Court' in\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act is exhaustive as the Section uses the\n\nexpression \"means and includes\". Under this definition Principal Civil\n\nCourt of Original Jurisdiction or the High Court in exercise of its\n\noriginal civil jurisdiction will be 'Court' as defined under\nSection\n\n2(1)(e)\nof the Court. Apex Court also affirmed the view taken in State\n\nof Maharashtra through Executive Engineer10 and held that the\n\nexpression 'with respect to an arbitration agreement' widens the\n\nscope of\nSection 42\nto include all matters which directly or indirectly\n\npertain to an arbitration agreement. Applications made to Courts\n\nwhether before, during or after arbitral proceedings, made under\n\nPart-I of the Act\n, are all covered by\nSection 42\n. The essential\n\ningredient of the Section is that an application under Part-I must be\n\nmade in a 'Court'. It was held that\nSection 11\napplications are not to\n\nbe moved before the 'court' as defined but before the Chief Justice\n\neither of the High Court or the Supreme Court, as the case may be,\n\nor their delegates. This is despite the fact that the Chief Justice or\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nhis delegate has now to decide judicially and not administratively.\n\nSection 42\nwould not apply to applications made before the Chief\n\nJustice or his delegate for the simple reason that the Chief Justice or\n\nhis delegate is not 'court' as defined by\nSection 2(1)(e)\n. The Chief\n\nJustice does not represent the High Court. In contrast to\n\napplications moved under\nSections 8\nand\nof the Act, the\n\napplications under\nSection 9\nare moved to the 'court' for passing of\n\ninterim orders before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time\n\nafter the making of the arbitral award but before its enforcement.\n\nTherefore, they attract\nSection 42\nto preclude the making of all\n\nsubsequent applications under Part-I to any court except the court to\n\nwhich an application has been made under\nSection 9\nof the Act. The\n\nCourt gave following reasons for holing that when the Apex Court\n\nappoints arbitrator it will not be construed as Court within the\n\nmeaning of\nSection 2(1)(e)\n:--\n\n\"20. As noted above, the definition of \"court\" in\nSection\n2(1)(e)\nis materially different from its predecessor contained\nin\nSection 2(c)\nof the 1940 Act. There are a variety of\nreasons as to why the Supreme Court cannot possibly\nbe considered to be \"court\" within the meaning of\n\nSection 2(1)(e)\neven if it retains seisin over the arbitral\nproceedings. Firstly, as noted above, the definition is\nexhaustive and recognizes only one of two possible courts\nthat could be \"court\" for the purpose of\nSection 2(1)(e)\n.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nSecondly, under the 1940 Act, the expression \"civil court\"\n\nhas been held to be wide enough to include an appellate\ncourt and, therefore would include the Supreme Court as\nwas held in the two judgments aforementioned under the\n1940 Act. Even though this proposition itself is open to\ndoubt, as the Supreme Court exercising jurisdiction under\n\nArticle 136\nis not an ordinary Appellate Court, suffice it to\nsay that even this reason does not obtain under the present\ndefinition, which speaks of either the Principal Civil Court or\nthe High Court exercising original jurisdiction. Thirdly, if an\napplication would have to be preferred to the Supreme Court\ndirectly, the appeal that is available so far as applications\nunder\nSections 9\nand\nare concerned, provided for under\n\nSection 37\nof the Act, would not be available. Any further\nappeal to the Supreme Court under\nArticle 136\nwould also\nnot be available. The only other argument that could possibly\nbe made is that all definition sections are subject to context\nto the contrary. The context of\nSection 42\ndoes not in any\nmanner lead to a conclusion that the word \"court\" in\nSection\nshould be construed otherwise than as defined. The\ncontext of\nSection 42\nis merely to see that one court alone\nshall have jurisdiction over all applications with respect to\narbitration agreements which context does not in any\nmanner enable the Supreme Court to become a \"court\"\nwithin the meaning of\nSection 42\n. It has aptly been stated\nthat the rule of forum conveniens is expressly excluded by\n\nsection 42\n. See:\nJSW Steel Ltd. vs. Jindal Praxair Oxygen\nCo.Ltd.\n, (2006) 11 SCC 521 at para 59.\nSection 42\nis also\nmarkedly different from\nSection 31(4)\nof the 1940 Act in that\nthe expression \"has been made in a court competent to\nentertain it\" does not find place in\nSection 42\n. This is for the\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nreason that, under\nSection 2(1)(e)\n, the competent Court is\nfixed as the Principal Civil Court exercising original\njurisdiction or a High Court exercising original civil\njurisdiction, and no other court. For all these reasons, we\nhold that the decisions under the 1940 Act would not obtain\nunder the 1996 Act, and the Supreme Court cannot be\n\"court\" for the purposes of\nSection 42\n.\"\n\nIt was also held that\nSection 42\napplies to all proceedings\n\nwith respect to arbitration agreements including the applications\n\nmade after the final award as under:-\n\n\"21. One other question that may arise is as to whether\n\nSection 42\napplies after the arbitral proceedings come to an\nend. It has already been held by us that the expression \"with\nrespect to an arbitration agreement\" are words of wide\nimport and would take in all applications made before during\nor after the arbitral proceedings are over. In an earlier\njudgment, Kumbha Mawji v. Dominion of India, AIR 1953 SC\n313, the question which arose before the Supreme Court\nwas whether the expression used in\nSection 31(4)\nof the\n1940 Act \"in any reference\" would include matters that are\nafter the arbitral proceedings are over and have culminated\nin an award. It was held that the words \"in any reference\"\n\ncannot be taken to mean \"in the course of a reference\", but\nmean \"in the matter of a reference\" and that such phrase is\nwide enough and comprehensive enough to cover an\napplication made after the arbitration is completed and the\nfinal Award is made. (See Paras 317-18). As has been\nnoticed above, the expression used in\nSection 42\nis wider\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nbeing \"with respect to an arbitration agreement\" and would\ncertainly include such applications.\"\n\nFollowing conclusions were drawn by the Court:-\n\n\"25. Our conclusions therefore on\nSection 2(1)(e)\nand\n\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 are as follows:\n\n(a)\nSection 2(1)(e)\ncontains an exhaustive definition\nmarking out only the Principal Civil Court of\nOriginal Jurisdiction in a district or a High Court\nhaving original civil jurisdiction in the State, and\nno other court as \"court\" for the purpose of\nPart-I\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996\n.\n\n(b) The expression \"with respect to an arbitration\nagreement\" makes it clear that\nSection 42\nwill\napply to all applications made whether before or\nduring arbitral proceedings or after an Award is\npronounced under Part-I of the 1996 Act.\n\n(c) However,\nSection 42\nonly applies to applications\nmade under Part-I if they are made to a court as\ndefined. Since applications made under\nSection 8\n\nare made to judicial authorities and since\napplications under\nSection 11\nare made to the\nChief Justice or his designate, the judicial\nauthority and the Chief Justice or his designate\nnot being court as defined, such applications\nwould be outside\nSection 42\n.\n\n(d)\nSection 9\napplications being applications made to a\ncourt and\nSection 34\napplications to set aside arbitral\nawards are applications which are within\nSection 42\n.\n\n(e) In no circumstances can the Supreme Court be\n\"court\" for the purposes of\nSection 2(1)(e)\n, and\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nwhether the Supreme Court does or does not\nretain seisin after appointing an Arbitrator,\napplications will follow the first application made\nbefore either a High Court having original\njurisdiction in the State or a Principal Civil court\nhaving original jurisdiction in the district as the\ncase may be.\n\n(f)\nSection 42\nwill apply to applications made after the\narbitral proceedings have come to an end provided\nthey are made under Part-I.\n\n(g) If a first application is made to a court which is neither\na Principal Court of original jurisdiction in a district or a\nHigh Court exercising original jurisdiction in a State,\nsuch application not being to a court as defined would\nbe outside\nSection 42\n. Also, an application made to a\ncourt without subject matter jurisdiction would be\noutside\nSection 42\n.\n\nThe reference is answered accordingly.\"\n\n3(vii).\nEmm Enn Associates vs. Commander Works Engineer\n&\n\nothers12 relied upon SBP & Co. Vs. Patel Engg. Ltd. Case6 to hold\n\nthat exercise of power under\nSection 11(6)\nis judicial in nature;\n\nWhile exercising this power, the Chief Justice can examine whether\n\nthe claim is live and needs to be adjudicated. In cases of stale\n\nclaims the applications can be rejected.\n\n4. Learned Counsel for the claimant - Sh. Kashmir Singh\n\nfalls back upon State of Maharashtra through Executive Engineer\n(2016) 13 SCC 61\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nvs. Atlanta Ltd. Case10 to support the order passed by the learned\n\nDistrict Judge and submits that this High Court exercises ordinary\n\noriginal Civil jurisdiction. The arbitrator was appointed by this Court.\n\nBetween the High Court that exercises original civil jurisdiction and\n\nthe Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction, the choice is to be\n\nexercised in favour of the High Court for filing the objections against\n\nthe award passed by the arbitrator as it would make no difference if\n\nthe Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction is in the same\n\ndistrict over which the High Court exercises original jurisdiction or\n\nsome other district. Learned Counsel for the claimant also pressed\n\ninto service the amendment of\nSection 11(6)\nunder Act 3 of 2016\n\nthat came into force w.e.f. 23.10.2015 and replaced the words\n\n'Chief Justice' with 'High Court' in case of other than international\n\ncommercial arbitration as under:-\n\n\"(6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon\nby the parties,--\n\n(a) a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n\n(b) the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to\nreach an agreement expected of them under that\nprocedure; or\n\n(c) a person, including an institution, fails to perform any\nfunction entrusted to him or it under that procedure,\nThe appointment shall be made, on an application of the\nparty, by the arbitral institution designated by the Supreme\nCourt, in case of international commercial arbitration, or by\nthe High Court, in case of arbitrations other than\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\ninternational commercial arbitration, as the case may be to\ntake the necessary measures, unless the agreement on the\nappointment procedure provides other means for securing\nthe appointment.\"\n\nLearned Counsel for the Telecom Department outlined the\n\ndevelopment of law on the subject and contended that in the instant\n\ncases it is the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction that ought\n\nto have decided the objections against the arbitral award and\n\nprayed for setting aside the judgments passed by the learned\n\nDistrict Judge. It was submitted that Telecom Department filed its\n\ntwo Arbitration Cases bearing Nos. 581 & 584 of 2023 in this Court\n\nonly to avoid conflicting orders and in light of impugned orders\n\npassed by the learned District Judge.\n\n5. Consideration\n\n5(i). It was by way of Act 3 of 2016 that the words 'Chief Justice\n\nor any person or institution designated by him' in\nSection 11(6)\nof\n\nthe Act were substituted by the words 'Supreme Court', or as the\n\ncase may be, the 'High Court', or any person or institution\n\ndesignated by such Court'.\n\nIt would be appropriate to first examine the reasons for\n\namending\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\nby Act 3 of 2016. Report No. 246 of the Law Commission of India,\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nthe basis for amending the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n1996 by\n\nthe\nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n(3 of 2016)\n\nwould be a relevant factor.\n\n5(i)(a) In para-24 of the report, the Commission proposed\n\nchanging the existing scheme of power of appointment being\n\nvested in the 'Chief Justice' to the 'High Court' & the 'Supreme\n\nCourt' and clarified that delegation of power of appointment (as\n\nopposed to a finding regarding the existence/nullity of the arbitration\n\nagreement) shall not be regarded as a judicial act. This was\n\nproposed to rationalize the law and provide greater incentive for the\n\nHigh Court and/or Supreme Court to delegate the power of\n\nappointment (being a non-judicial act) to specialized, external\n\npersons or institutions. The Commission further recommended\n\namendment of\nSection 11(7)\nso that the decisions of the High Court\n\nregarding existence/nullity of the arbitration agreement are final\n\nwhere the arbitrator has been appointed and as such are non-\n\nappealable. Para of the report relevant to the context reads as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"24. Two further sets of amendments have been proposed\nin this context. First, it is observed that a lot of time is spent\nfor appointment of arbitrators at the very threshold of\narbitration proceedings as applications under\nsection 11\nare\nkept pending for many years. In this context, the\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nCommission has proposed a few amendments. The\nCommission has proposed changing the existing scheme of\nthe power of appointment being vested in the \"Chief Justice\"\n\nto the \"High Court\" and the \"Supreme Court\" and has\nexpressly clarified that delegation of the power of\n\"appointment\" (as opposed to a finding regarding the\nexistence/nullity of the arbitration agreement) shall not be\nregarded as a judicial act. This would rationalize the law and\nprovide greater incentive for the High Court and/or Supreme\nCourt to delegate the power of appointment (being a non-\njudicial act) to specialized, external persons or institutions.\nThe Commission has further recommended an amendment\nto\nsection 11 (7)\nso that decisions of the High Court\n(regarding existence/nullity of the arbitration agreement) are\nfinal where an arbitrator has been appointed, and as such\nare non-appealable. The Commission further proposes the\naddition of\nsection 11 (13)\nwhich requires the Court to make\nan endeavor to dispose of the matter within sixty days from\nthe service of notice on the opposite party.\"\n\n5(i)(b). The Law Commission also took note of SBP & Co. Vs.\n\nPatel Engineering Ltd. Case6 wherein power to appoint an arbitrator\n\nunder\nSection 11\nhad been held to be judicial power and also the\n\nlaw laid down in\nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Boghara Polyfab\n\nPvt. Ltd.13\n, as under:-\n\n\"30. After a series of cases culminating in the decision in\nSBP v Patel Engineering, (2005) 8 SCC 618, the Supreme\nCourt held that the power to appoint an arbitrator under\n(2009) 1 SCC 267\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nsection 11\nis a \"judicial\" power.\nThe underlying issues in this\njudgment, relating to the scope of intervention, were\nsubsequently clarified by Raveendran J. in\nNational\nInsurance Co. Ltd. v Boghara Polyfab Pvt. Ltd.\n, (2009) 1\nSCC 267, where the Supreme Court laid down as follows -\n\n\"1. The issues (first category) which Chief Justice/his\ndesignate will have to decide are:\n\n(a) Whether the party making the application has\napproached the appropriate High Court?\n\n(b) Whether there is an arbitration agreement and whether\nthe party who has applied under\nsection 11\nof the Act, is\na party to such an agreement?\n\n2. The issues (second category) which the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate may choose to decide are:\n\n(a) Whether the claim is a dead (long barred) claim or a live\nclaim?\n\n(b) Whether the parties have concluded the\ncontract/transaction by recording satisfaction of their\nmutual rights and obligation or by receiving the final\npayment without objection?\n\n3. The issues (third category) which the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate should leave exclusively to the arbitral tribunal\nare:\n\n(a) Whether a claim falls within the arbitration clause (as\nfor example, a matter which is reserved for final\ndecision of a departmental authority and excepted or\nexcluded from arbitration)?\n\n(b) Merits of any claim involved in the arbitration.\"\n\nThe Law Commission recommended amending\nSections\nand\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 observing that\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nscope of judicial intervention is only restricted to a situation where\n\nCourt/judicial authority finds that arbitration agreement does not exist\n\nor is null & void. Insofar as nature of intervention is concerned, the\n\nCommission recommended that in the event the Court /judicial\n\nauthority is prima facie satisfied against the argument challenging\n\nthe arbitration agreement it shall appoint the arbitrator and/or refer\n\nthe parties to arbitration, as the case may be. The amendment\n\nenvisages that judicial authority shall not refer the parties to\n\narbitration only if it finds that there does not exist arbitration\n\nagreement or that it is null & void. If the judicial authority is of the\n\nopinion that prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, the dispute\n\nshall be referred to arbitration and leave the existence of arbitration\n\nagreement to be finally determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nHowever, if the judicial authority concludes that the arbitration\n\nagreement does not exist, then the conclusion will be final and not\n\nprima facie. In the event the judicial authority refers the dispute to\n\narbitration and appoints arbitrator under\nSections 8\nand\nrespectively such decision would be final and non-appealable. An\n\nappeal can be maintained under\nSection 37\nonly in the event of\n\nrefusal to refer the parties to arbitration or refusal to appoint\n\narbitrator. Relevant paragraph of the report reads as under:-\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n\"33. It is in this context, the Commission has\nrecommended amendments to\nsections 8\nand\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The scope of the\njudicial intervention is only restricted to situations where the\nCourt/Judicial Authority finds that the arbitration agreement\ndoes not exist or is null and void. In so far as the nature of\nintervention is concerned, it is recommended that in the\nevent the Court/Judicial Authority is prima facie satisfied\nagainst the argument challenging the arbitration agreement,\nit shall appoint the arbitrator and/or refer the parties to\narbitration, as the case may be. The amendment envisages\nthat the judicial authority shall not refer the parties to\narbitration only if it finds that there does not exist an\narbitration agreement or that it is null and void. If the judicial\nauthority is of the opinion that prima facie the arbitration\nagreement exists, then it shall refer the dispute to arbitration,\nand leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to be\nfinally determined by the arbitral tribunal. However, if the\njudicial authority concludes that the agreement does not\nexist, then the conclusion will be final and not prima facie.\n\nThe amendment also envisages that there shall be a\nconclusive determination as to whether the arbitration\nagreement is null and void. In the event that the judicial\nauthority refers the dispute to arbitration and/or appoints an\narbitrator, under\nsections 8\nand\nrespectively, such a\ndecision will be final and non-appealable. An appeal can be\nmaintained under\nsection 37\nonly in the event of refusal to\nrefer parties to arbitration, or refusal to appoint an\narbitrator.\"\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n5(ii) The High Court in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction\n\nand Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction are 'Court' as\n\ndefined in\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act. With respect to an arbitration\n\nagreement\nSection 42\nof the Act delineates jurisdiction of the Court\n\nand states where an application under\nPart-I of the Act\n(i.e. under\n\nSections 1\n- 43) in relation to an arbitration agreement has been\n\nmoved in a Court then that Court alone will have jurisdiction not\n\nonly over the arbitral proceedings but also over all subsequent\n\napplications arising out of that agreement. All arbitral proceedings\n\ncan be made in that Court alone.\nSection 42\napplies to all\n\napplications whether made before or during arbitral proceedings or\n\nafter an award is pronounced under\nPart-1 of the Act\n. The only rider\n\nis that such an application must have been made to a Court as\n\ndefined.\n\n5(iii) In the instant case, application in question was moved\n\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act for appointment of arbitrator.\n\nApplication was thus under\nPart-1 of the Act\n. The application was\n\nmade to the High Court of Himachal Pradesh, which incidentally\n\nalso exercises original civil jurisdiction. The High Court of Himachal\n\nPradesh, therefore, technically falls within the definition of 'Court'\n\nunder\nSection 2(1)(e)\nof the Act but the arbitrator was not appointed\n\nby the High Court in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction. The\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nappointment was made in exercise of\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\nFurther, the pecuniary limit/ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the\n\nHigh Court of Himachal Pradesh is over the matters where value\n\nexceeds rupees one crore.\n\n5(iv) The arbitrator was appointed on 02.08.2019 when the Act\n\nstood amended and the words 'Chief Justice' stood replaced with\n\nthe words 'High Court'. Hence appointment of arbitrator was by the\n\nHigh Court. The object behind replacing the words 'Chief Justice'\n\nwith 'High Court' in\nSection 11(6)\nas given by the Law Commission is\n\nthat \"delegation of the power of 'appointment' as opposed to a\n\nfinding regarding the existence/nullity of the arbitration agreement\n\nshall not be regarded as a judicial act\". The amendment has been\n\nproposed \"for rationalizing the law and providing greater incentive\n\nfor the High Court and/or Supreme Court to delegate the power of\n\nappointment 'being a non-judicial act' to specialized, external\n\npersons or institutions\". 'In the event the judicial authority refers the\n\ndispute to arbitration and/or appoints an arbitrator under\nSections 8\n\nand\n, such a decision will be final and non-appealable.\nSection\n\n11(7)\nof the Act had also been amended. An appeal can be\n\nmaintained under\nSection 37\nonly in the event of refusal to refer\n\nparties to arbitration or refusal to appoint an arbitrator'.\nSection\n\n11(7)\n, however was omitted by Act 33 of 2019. The arbitrator was\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nappointed by the High Court not because this High Court exercises\n\noriginal civil jurisdiction or in exercise of its original civil jurisdiction\n\nbut because of the power given in\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. In\n\nGarhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd.7 Hon'ble Apex Court held 'Once\n\nan arbitrator is appointed then the appropriate forum for filing the\n\naward and for challenging the same will be the Principal Civil Court\n\nof Original Jurisdiction. The expression 'Court' used in\nSection 34\nof\n\nthe Act will also have to be understood ignoring the definition of\n\n'\nCourt' in the Act\n. Thus the parties will have the right to move under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act and to appeal under\nSection 37\nof the Act.\n\nTherefore, in the scheme of things, if appointment is made by the\n\nHigh Court or by this Court, the Principal Civil Court of Original\n\nJurisdiction remains the same as contemplated under\nSection\n\n2(1)(e)\nof the Act.'\n\n5(iv) Appointing an arbitrator under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act by\n\nthe Court which exercises original civil jurisdiction may not even\n\notherwise vest the Court with jurisdiction under\nSection 42\nof the Act\n\nto entertain objections under\nSection 34\nof the Act, if the Court does\n\nnot have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the objections. In the\n\ninstant cases, in both the claims put together, the total amount\n\ninvolved is around Rs. 11 lacs. In M/s Ravi Ranjan Developers Pvt.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nLtd. vs. Aditya Kumar Chatterjee14, the Supreme Court noted that\n\n\"\nSection 42\ncannot possibly have any application to an application\n\nunder\nSection 11(6)\n, which necessarily has to be made before a\n\nHigh Court.....\". This is regardless of whether that High Court has\n\noriginal jurisdiction to decide suits or jurisdiction related to subject\n\nmatter of arbitration. Consequently the definition provided in\nSection\n\n2(1)(e)\ndoes not directly apply even where appointment of arbitrator\n\nis by a High Court that exercises original jurisdiction.\n\n5(v). The sum total of above discussion is that the High Court\n\nof Himachal Pradesh, which exercises original civil jurisdiction\n\ncannot be classified as 'Court' for the purpose of\nSection 42\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act when it merely appointed arbitrators\n\nunder\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\nSection 42\nof the Act will not be\n\nattracted where High Court of Himachal Pradesh has only\n\nappointed the arbitrator and has not undertaken any other exercise.\n\n6. The next point to be deliberated upon is which Court will\n\nhave the jurisdiction to hear objections against the arbitral awards\n\ninvolved in the instant case. Learned District Judge Mandi has held\n\nthat it will not have any jurisdiction over the objections arising out\n\nof the arbitral awards. I am inclined to agree with this conclusion\n\ndrawn by the learned Court.\n2022 SCC Online SC 568\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nIn\nHindustan Construction Company Limited vs. NHPC\n\nLimited\n& another15, contract was executed between the parties at\n\nFaridabad and part of cause of action also arose there. However,\n\nNew Delhi was the chosen seat of the parties.\n\nLearned Additional\n\nDistrict Judge held that though seat of arbitration was at New Delhi\n\nyet by virtue of BALCO vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services\n\nInc.16, since both Delhi as well as Faridabad Courts would have\n\njurisdiction as the contract was executed & part of cause of action\n\narose in Faridabad, Faridabad Court would have the jurisdiction to\n\ndecide all other applications as\nSection 42\nof the Act would kick in.\n\nRelying upon\nBGS SGS Soma JV vs. NHPC17\n, Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nheld that Courts at New Delhi alone would have jurisdiction for the\n\npurposes of challenge to the award. Relevant paras of the report\n\nread as under:-\n\n\"3. This Court in Civil Appeal No. 9307 of 2019 entitled\n\nBGS SGS Soma JV vs. NHPC Ltd.17\ndelivered a judgment\non 10.12.2019 i.e. after the impugned judgment was\ndelivered, in which reference was made to\nSection 42\nof the\nAct and a finding recorded thus:\n\n\"59. Equally incorrect is the finding in\nAntrix\nCorporation Ltd. Vs. Devas Multimedia (P) Ltd.\n\n(supra)18 that\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996\nwould be rendered ineffective and useless.\nSection 42\n(2020)\nSCC 310\n(2012) 9 SCC 552\n(2020) 4 SCC 234\n2018 SCC OnLine Del 9338\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nis meant to avoid conflicts in jurisdiction of Courts by\nplacing the supervisory jurisdiction over all arbitral\nproceedings in connection with the arbitration in one\nCourt exclusively. This is why the section begins with\na non-obstante clause, and then goes on to state\n'...where with respect to an arbitration agreement any\napplication under this Part has been made in a\nCourt...' It is obvious that the application made under\nthis part to a Court must be a Court which has\njurisdiction to decide such application. The\nsubsequent holdings of this Court, that where a seat\nis designated in an agreement, the Courts of the seat\nalone have jurisdiction, would require that all\napplications under Part I be made only in the Court\nwhere the seat is located, and that Court alone then\nhas jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all\nsubsequent applications arising out of the arbitral\nagreement. So read,\nSection 42\nis not rendered\nineffective or useless. Also, where it is found on the\nfacts of a particular case that either no \"seat\" is\ndesignated by agreement, or the so-called \"seat\" is\nonly a convenient \"venue\", then there may be several\nCourts where a part of the cause of action arises that\nmay have jurisdiction. Again, an application under\n\nSection 9\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996 may be\npreferred before a court in which part of the cause of\naction arises in a case where parties have not agreed\non the \"seat\" of arbitration, and before 3 such \"seat\"\n\nmay have been determined, on the facts of a\nparticular case, by the Arbitral Tribunal under\nSection\n20(2)\nof the Arbitration Act, 1996. In both these\nsituations, the earliest application having been made\nto a Court in which a part of the cause of action arises\nwould then be the exclusive Court under\nSection 42\n,\nwhich would have control over the arbitral\nproceedings. For all these reasons, the law stated by\nthe Bombay19, 20 and Delhi18 High Courts in this\nregard is incorrect and is overruled.\"\n\n4. This was made in the backdrop of explaining para 96\nof the Balco16 (supra), which judgment read as a whole\ndeclares that once the seat of arbitration is designated, such\nKonkola Copper Mines vs. Stewarts & Lloyds of India Ltd.\n2013 SCC OnLine Bom 777.\nNivaran Solutions vs. Aura Thia Spa Services (P) Ltd., 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 5062.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nclause then becomes an exclusive jurisdiction clause as a\nresult of which only the courts where the seat is located\nwould then have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other\ncourts.\n\n5. Given the finding in this case that New Delhi was the\nchosen seat of the parties, even if an application was first\nmade to the Faridabad Court, that application would be\nmade to a court without jurisdiction. This being the case, the\nimpugned judgment is set aside following\nBGS SGS Soma\nJV17\n(supra), as a result of which it is the courts at New Delhi\nalone which would have jurisdiction for the purposes of\nchallenge to the Award.\n\n6. As a result of this judgment, the\nSection 34\n\napplication that has been filed at Faridabad Court will stand\ntransferred to the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi. Any\nobjections taken on the ground that such objection filed\nunder\nSection 34\nis out of time hence cannot be\ncountenanced. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.\"\n\nIn\nInox Renewables Limited vs. Jayesh Electricals\n\nLimited21\nthe parties had agreed for holding arbitration at Jaipur.\n\nHowever, an application for appointment of arbitrator was made\n\nbefore the High Court of Gujarat. The arbitrator was appointed.\n\nArbitral proceedings were held at Ahmedabad. The arbitral award\n\nwas assailed before the Courts at Vadorara. The jurisdiction of\n\nCourts at Vadodara was unsuccessfully resisted. The matter\n(2023) 3 SCC 733\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nreached Hon'ble Apex Court. It was held that by mutual agreement\n\nparties had shifted venue/place of arbitration from Jaipur to\n\nAhmedabad. The moment seat is chosen as Ahmedabad, it is akin\n\nto an exclusive jurisdiction clause, thereby vesting the Courts at\n\nAhmedabad with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the arbitration. It\n\nwas observed as follows:-\n\n\"11.\nIn\nBGS SGS\n17 (supra), this Court, after an exhaustive\nreview of the entire case law, concluded thus :\n\n\"32. It can thus be seen that given the new concept of\n\"juridical seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, and the\nimportance given by the\nArbitration Act, 1996\nto this\n\"seat\", the arbitral award is now not only to state its\ndate, but also the place of arbitration as determined in\naccordance with\nSection 20\n. However, the definition\nof \"court\" contained in\nSection 2(1)(c)\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1940, continued as such in the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996\n, though narrowed to mean only\nprincipal civil court and the High Court in exercise of\ntheir original ordinary civil jurisdiction. Thus, the\nconcept of juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings\nand its relationship to the jurisdiction of courts which\nare then to look into matters relating to the arbitral\nproceedings - including challenges to arbitral awards -\nwas unclear, and had to be developed in accordance\nwith international practice on a case by case basis by\nthis Court.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n48. The aforesaid amendment carried out in the\ndefinition of \"Court\" is also a step showing the right\ndirection, namely, that in international commercial\narbitrations held in India, the High Court alone is to\nexercise jurisdiction over such proceedings, even\nwhere no part of the cause of action may have arisen\nwithin the jurisdiction of such High Court, such High\nCourt not having ordinary original jurisdiction. In such\ncases, the \"place\" where the award is delivered alone\nis looked at, and the High Court given jurisdiction to\nsupervise the arbitration proceedings, on the footing\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nof its jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of\ncourts subordinate to it, which is only on the basis of\nterritorial jurisdiction which in turn relates to the\n\"place\" where the award is made. In the light of this\nimportant change in the law,\nSection 2(1)(e)(i)\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1996 must also be construed in the\nmanner indicated by this judgment.\n\n49. Take the consequence of the opposite conclusion,\nin the light of the facts of a given example, as follows.\nNew Delhi is specifically designated to be the seat of\nthe arbitration in the arbitration clause between the\nparties. Part of the cause of action, however, arises in\nseveral places, including where the contract is\npartially to be performed, let us say, in a remote part\nof Uttarakhand. If concurrent jurisdiction were to be\nthe order of the day, despite the seat having been\nlocated and specifically chosen by the parties, party\nautonomy would suffer, which BALCO16 specifically\nstates cannot be the case. Thus, if an application is\nmade to a District Court in a remote corner of the\nUttarakhand hills, which then becomes the court for\nthe purposes of\nSection 42\nof the Arbitration Act,\n1996 where even\nSection 34\napplications have then\nto be made, the result would be contrary to the stated\nintention of the parties - as even though the parties\nhave contemplated that a neutral place be chosen as\nthe seat so that the courts of that place alone would\nhave jurisdiction, yet, any one of five other courts in\nwhich a part of the cause of action arises, including\ncourts in remote corners of the country, would also be\nclothed with jurisdiction. This obviously cannot be the\ncase. If, therefore, the conflicting portion of the\njudgment of BALCO16 in para 96 is kept aside for a\nmoment, the very fact that parties have chosen a\nplace to be the seat would necessarily carry with it the\ndecision of both parties that the courts at the seat\nwould exclusively have jurisdiction over the entire\narbitral process.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n53. In Indus Mobile Distribution (P) Ltd.22, after\nclearing the air on the meaning of\nSection 20\nof the\nArbitration Act, 1996, the Court in para 19 (which has\nalready been set out hereinabove) made it clear that\nthe moment a seat is designated by agreement\nbetween the parties, it is akin to an exclusive\n(2017) 7 SCC 678\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\njurisdiction clause, which would then vest the courts\nat the \"seat\" with exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of\nregulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the\nagreement between the parties.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it\nmay be concluded that whenever there is the\ndesignation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration\nclause as being the \"venue\" of the arbitration\nproceedings, the expression \"arbitration proceedings\"\n\nwould make it clear that the \"venue\" is really the\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid\nexpression does not include just one or more\nindividual or particular hearing, but the arbitration\nproceedings as a whole, including the making of an\naward at that place. This language has to be\ncontrasted with language such as \"tribunals are to\nmeet or have witnesses, experts or the parties\" where\nonly hearings are to take place in the \"venue\", which\nmay lead to the conclusion, other things being equal,\nthat the venue so stated is not the \"seat\" of arbitral\nproceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting.\nFurther, the fact that the arbitral proceedings \"shall be\nheld\" at a particular venue would also indicate that the\nparties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a\nparticular place, signifying thereby, that that place is\nthe seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with\nthere being no other significant contrary indicia that\nthe stated venue is merely a \"venue\" and not the\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, would then\nconclusively show that such a clause designates a\n\"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings. In an International\ncontext, if a supranational body of rules is to govern\nthe arbitration, this would further be an indicia that\n\"the venue\", so stated, would be the seat of the\narbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would\nbe replaced by the\nArbitration Act, 1996\nas applying\nto the \"stated venue\", which then becomes the \"seat\"\n\nfor the purposes of arbitration.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n98. However, the fact that in all the three appeals\nbefore us the proceedings were finally held at New\nDelhi, and the awards were signed in New Delhi, and\nnot at Faridabad, would lead to the conclusion that\nboth parties have chosen New Delhi as the \"seat\" of\narbitration under\nSection 20(1)\nof the Arbitration Act,\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n1996. This being the case, both parties have,\ntherefore, chosen that the courts at New Delhi alone\nwould have exclusive jurisdiction over the arbitral\nproceedings. Therefore, the fact that a part of the\ncause of action may have arisen at Faridabad would\nnot be relevant once the \"seat\" has been chosen,\nwhich would then amount to an exclusive jurisdiction\nclause so far as Courts of the \"seat\" are concerned.\"\n\n12. This case would show that the moment the seat is\nchosen as Ahmedabad, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction\nclause, thereby vesting the courts at Ahmedabad with\nexclusive jurisdiction to deal with the arbitration. However,\nlearned counsel for the Respondent referred to and relied\nupon paragraphs 49 and 71 of the aforesaid judgment.\nParagraph 49 only dealt with the aspect of concurrent\njurisdiction as dealt with in BALCO 16 (supra) which does not\narise on the facts of the present case. Paragraph 71 is\nequally irrelevant, in that, it is clear that the parties have, by\nmutual agreement, entered into an agreement to substitute\nthe venue at Jaipur with Ahmedabad as the place/seat of\narbitration under\nSection 20(1)\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n16. The reliance placed by learned counsel for the\nRespondent on Indus Mobile22 (supra), and in particular, on\nparagraphs 18 and 19 thereof, would also support the\nAppellant's case, inasmuch as the \"venue\" being shifted\nfrom Jaipur to Ahmedabad is really a shifting of the\nvenue/place of arbitration with reference to\nSection 20(1)\n,\nand not with reference to\nSection 20(3)\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, as it has been made clear that Jaipur\ndoes not continue to be the seat of arbitration and\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\nAhmedabad is now the seat designated by the parties, and\nnot a venue to hold meetings. The learned arbitrator has\nrecorded that by mutual agreement, Jaipur as a \"venue\" has\ngone and has been replaced by Ahmedabad. As clause 8.5\nof the Purchase Order must be read as a whole, it is not\npossible to accept the submission of Shri Malkan that the\njurisdiction of Courts in Rajasthan is independent of the\nvenue being at Jaipur. The two clauses must be read\ntogether as the Courts in Rajasthan have been vested with\njurisdiction only because the seat of arbitration was to be at\nJaipur. Once the seat of arbitration is replaced by mutual\nagreement to be at Ahmedabad, the Courts at Rajasthan are\nno longer vested with jurisdiction as exclusive jurisdiction is\nnow vested in the Courts at Ahmedabad, given the change\nin the seat of arbitration.\"\n\nIn the present case, even though part of cause of action\n\narose in District Mandi yet all arbitral proceedings were conducted\n\nat Shimla. It is not the case of either of the parties that any\n\nsitting was held within the jurisdiction of Court of learned District\n\nJudge Mandi. Parties have not even placed on record copy of\n\nagreement to show that they had agreed for fixing seat of\n\narbitration at Mandi. For all these reasons and keeping in view the\n\nlaw laid down by the Apex Court, District Judge Mandi will not have\n\njurisdiction over the objections under\nSection 34\nof the Act against\n\nthe arbitral awards.\n\n( 2025:HHC:305 )\n7. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing discussion, the judgments passed by the\n\nlearned District Judge Mandi on 12.01.2023 in Case Nos. (i)\n\nObjection Pet. No. 02/2022 (Reg. No. 03/2022) and Objection Pet.\n\nNo. 03/2022 (Reg. No. 04/2022) are set aside to the extent they hold\n\nthat this Court alone will have the jurisdiction to entertain & decide\n\nthe objections preferred under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act against the arbitral awards. It is held that in the\n\ninstant case, jurisdiction to decide the objections preferred under\n\nSection 34\nof the Act against the arbitral awards will be before the\n\nPrincipal Court of original jurisdiction at Shimla. As a result, Arb.\n\nCase Nos. 582 & 583 of 2023 filed by claimant - Kashmir Singh\n\nand Arb. Cases Nos. 581 & 584 filed by the Telecom Department\n\nare disposed of as not maintainable before this Court. The\n\npetitioners in these cases shall be at liberty to move the appropriate\n\nCourt having jurisdiction for filing objections against the arbitral\n\nawards. In case such objections are preferred within two weeks from\n\ntoday, the same shall be decided in accordance with law.\n\nPetitions stand disposed of in the aforesaid terms, so also\n\nthe pending miscellaneous application(s), if any.\n\nJyotsna Rewal Dua,\nJudge\nJanuary 02 , 2025 (PK)",
