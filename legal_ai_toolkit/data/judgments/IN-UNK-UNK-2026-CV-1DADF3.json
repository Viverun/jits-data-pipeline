On 11.06.1997, approval was granted by CIT to the Pension\n Trust under Rule 2(1) of Part 'B' of 4th Schedule of 1961 Act to take\n effect from 01.04.1995. Subsequently, MoU was executed on\n 10.01.1998 for employees of NTPC in the workmen category.\n Meetings were held by Board of Trustees on 05.12.1997 and\n 22.01.1998 regarding investment of the Trust Funds, recovery of\n contributions, authorization to investment committee for purchase of\n annuities etc. Pension Trust Communication (PTC) 03/98 was issued\n on 06.02.1998 for deduction of Past Service Contribution for\n Executives and Supervisors from February, 1998 onwards in\n maximum 120 installments.\n\n H. Petitioners were members of the 1995 Scheme and having\n made contributions, they were entitled to continue to receive benefits\n thereunder. However, illegally and arbitrarily, the Board of Trustees\n introduced a new restructured scheme on 03.02.2003, which was a\n 'Defined Contribution' Scheme ('2003 Scheme') instead of the earlier\n 'Defined Benefit' Scheme and adversely affected the rights of the\n Petitioners to higher pension. The Scheme was arbitrarily made\n applicable retrospectively from 01.04.2002, taking away vested and\n accrued rights of even those who had retired prior to the introduction\n of the Scheme.\n\n I. Aggrieved with the 2003 Scheme, one Mohd. Yunus, an ex-\n employee of NTPC who retired as a Senior Materials Officer on\n 31.07.2002 filed a Writ Petition (Civil) No. 740/2004, before the\n Allahabad High Court. His pension was not sanctioned, as according\n to NTPC, annuities from LIC were kept in abeyance on the ground\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 20 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n that there was steep hike in annuity prices affecting the viability of the\n Pension Scheme. Upon restructuring, pension of Mohd. Yunus was\n fixed at Rs.1,015/- whereas under the 1995 Scheme, he would have\n been entitled to Rs.8,078/-.\n\n J. The writ petition was allowed by Allahabad High Court vide\n judgment dated 17.12.2009 holding that since Mohd. Yunus had\n retired on 31.07.2002, he was entitled for pension under the 1995\n Scheme. This judgment was challenged by the Pension Trust before\n the Supreme Court and Civil Appeal No. 8054/2011 was dismissed on\n 09.12.2015. Supreme Court observed that retiral benefits of Mohd.\n Yunus stood crystalized on the date of his retirement i.e. 31.07.2002\n and any rules/guidelines notified thereafter including Circular dated\n 03.02.2003 could not be made applicable to him.\n\n K. While the matter was pending in the Supreme Court, the\n judgment of Allahabad High Court possibly paved the way for the\n Trustees to carry out an amendment to the Trust Deed dated\n 12.03.1997, invoking para 8 of the Deed and a Supplementary Trust\n Deed was executed on 09.08.2011 and the CIT granted approval vide\n order dated 06.02.2013, retrospectively from 01.04.2002.\n\n \n3. Owing to the amendment in the 1995 Scheme, three writ petitions\n being W.P. (C) Nos. 108/2011, 109/2011 and 1259/2013 were filed in this\n Court challenging the amendment and the consequential reduction in the\n pension. The remaining writ petitions referred to above were filed post the\n judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of \nSecretary, NTPC Pension\n Trust v. Mohd. Yunus and Others\n, Civil Appeal No. 8054/2011, dated\n 09.12.2015, seeking similar reliefs.

The judgment was challenged\n before the Division Bench of this Court and the appeals were disposed of\n vide judgment dated 01.11.2018.\n \nThe Division Bench held that after the\n judgment of the Supreme Court in \nMohd. Yunus\n (supra), it was no longer\n open to NTPC/Pension Trust to contend that writ petitions were not\n maintainable against them. During the course of hearing of the appeals,\n NTPC/Pension Trust also raised an objection that the writ petitions were\n barred by delay and laches.\n \nThis contention was also negated by the\n Division Bench observing that the Petitioners were awaiting the outcome of\n the decision of the Supreme Court with regard to the correctness of the\n judgment of Allahabad High Court in \nMohd. Yunus\n (supra) and could not\n be faulted for filing petitions after the decision was pronounced. It also\n needs mention at this stage that the Division Bench segregated the appeals\n into two categories based on the dates of retirement of the Petitioners i.e.\n those who retired prior to 03.02.2003 and those who retired post thereto. In\n the former category were the Appellants in appeals being LPA Nos. 200,\n 229, 230, 233, 241, 242 and 253/2017. In the case of these Appellants, the\n Division Bench additionally observed that they were similarly placed as\n Mohd. Yunus, who had retired prior to the said date and deserved to be\n placed on the same pedestal. This judgment was taken up in appeal by\n NTPC Pension Trust and by order dated 29.09.2022, in Civil Appeal Nos.\n 4695-4726/2019, the Supreme Court remitted the matter back to the learned\n Single Judge of this Court for examining the writ petitions on merits\n upholding the judgment of the Division Bench on the issue of\n maintainability. All rights and contentions of the parties were kept open.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 22 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Subsequently, the earlier three writ petitions were also tagged with the batch\n of petitions remanded by the Supreme Court and all were heard together.\n\n 4. From a holistic reading of the documents filed by the Pension Trust,\n further chronology of events is:\n\n A. On 18.01.1999, PTC 07/99 was issued with respect to options\n with regard to change in the number of installments for recovery of\n Past Service Contributions due to change in retirement age from 58 to\n 60 years. By letter dated 16.08.1999, clarification was given by the\n Actuary, M/s. K.A. Pandit, on Annuity and Resignation Rates in\n actuarial valuation. Meeting of the Board of Trustees was held on\n 20.08.1999 to discuss actuarial valuation of 1995 Scheme to assess\n the impact of increase in retirement age.\n\n B. On 06.07.2000, CPR No. 444/2000 was issued by NTPC\n revising the pay scales and allowances for employees in the Executive\n category below scheduled posts at the Board level. Revision was to\n take effect from 01.01.1997 and basis this revision, meeting of the\n Board of Trustees was convened on 02.08.2000 to assess the impact\n of the pay revision. It was felt that an increase in contributions was\n required to keep the Trust economically viable and presentation was\n made by the Actuary giving various options toward the viability\n including increase in contributions. Actual data of revised pay was\n called from all the Units to be provided to the Actuaries to enable\n them to make realistic estimates of increase required in the\n contributions and it was decided that for the time being, pension\n would be paid on pre-revised salaries and decision to pay pension on\n revised pay, including in cases already settled, was to be taken along\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 23 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n with decision regarding increase in Contributions.\n\n C. Various meetings were held thereafter as brought forth by\n Pension Trust, including presentations and discussions by and with\n the Actuaries on enhancement of additional contributions and\n provisional recovery of lumpsum amounts from all categories of\n employees. Finally, in the 20th Meeting of the Board of Trustees held\n on 19.12.2002, decision was taken to restructure the 1995 Scheme\n from 'Defined Benefit' to 'Defined Contribution' Scheme. Under the\n restructured Scheme, contribution structure was changed for\n Executives by contribution of 1% of Basic Pay w.e.f. September,\n 2002 as Monthly Percentage Salary and Additional Contribution at\n Rs.788/- per month escalating at 8% per annum. The Defined Benefit\n was also changed to payment of pension based on actual contribution\n of the principal amount with interest at the rate not exceeding pro rata\n earnings on the investment by the Trust. It was decided that all cases\n of superannuation after 01.04.2002 and cases of death while in service\n or of incapacitation after 31.08.2002, except cases already settled, will\n be settled based on the new principles. Resolution was subject to\n approval by NTPC and CIT as per Clause 8 of the Trust Deed.\n Pending the final decision, pension payable to employees who retired\n w.e.f. 01.04.2002 was kept in abeyance.\n\n D. Following the aforesaid decision, PTC No. 16/2002 was issued\n on 19.12.2002, restructuring the 1995 Scheme for Executives both in\n respect of contributions and the benefits. The changes can be\n encapsulated as follows:-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 24 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n \"2.0 The contribution structure has been changed as under for\n executives:\n\n a) Monthly Percentage salary contribution in case of\n Executives shall be 1% of Basic Pay w.e.f.

PTC 17/2003 was issued on 03.02.2003 formulating the\n restructured Defined Benefit Scheme as Defined Contribution Scheme\n (hereinafter referred to as the '2003 Scheme').

In the 21st meeting of the Board of Trustees held on 11.03.2003,\n the decision taken in the 20th meeting was confirmed along with\n confirmation of PTC 17/03 dated 03.02.2003 and PTC 18/03 dated\n\n 03.02.2003. As per the documents placed on record by Pension Trust,\n several attempts were made from time to time for revival of 1995\n Scheme by looking into fresh actuary valuations etc. but no resolution\n could be found. By communication dated 28.10.2010, approval was\n sought from CMD, NTPC for amendment of 1995 Scheme w.e.f.\n 01.04.2002 and execution of Supplementary Trust Deed in accordance\n with provisions of Trust Deed and 1961 Act, as also approval from\n CIT.\n\n H. Supplementary Trust Deed was executed on 09.08.2011 for\n restructuring the Pension Scheme as Defined Contribution Scheme\n with effect from 01.04.2002 and approval was received from Ministry\n of Power, Government of India on 01.12.2011. Ministry directed that\n administrative cost of the Scheme shall be borne by the Trust Fund\n and members' contribution should not be less than 1% of Basic Pay +\n DA as also that NTPC should immediately stop contribution to the\n existing 1995 Scheme. Admittedly, CIT, granted approval on\n 06.02.2013 under Rule 4 of Part 'B' of Fourth Schedule of 1961 Act,\n retrospectively from 01.04.2002.\n\n SUBMISSIONS AND CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE\n PETITIONERS:\n\n 5. The action of the Respondents in not paying post-retirement benefits\n to the Petitioners as per 1995 Scheme is arbitrary, illegal and discriminatory.\n\n The Scheme was introduced in 1995 as a welfare measure for providing\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 28 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n social security to the employees, who at the relevant time were members as\n also those who were to join in the future. The 1995 Scheme was made\n operative from 01.04.1995 and was formulated with the prior approval of\n Government of India, Board of Directors of NTPC and CIT. As per MoU\n dated 07.03.1997, the 1995 Scheme was a Self-Contributory Scheme\n wherein NTPC's liability was limited only to Rs.100/- per annum for all\n employees taken together and the rest of the contribution was by the\n employees. Employees were made members of the Scheme compulsorily\n and had no option not to become members and/or contribute to this Scheme.\n In consonance with the salient features of the 1995 Scheme, members of the\n Scheme including the Petitioners were to contribute in three ways i.e.\n Monthly Fixed Percentage Salary Contribution, Past Service Contribution\n and Monthly Additional Contribution. The Scheme assured defined benefits\n on the date of superannuation providing that a member on superannuation\n will be entitled to pension commencing from the month following the month\n of superannuation at the rate of 1.25% per year of Reckonable Service\n limited to 50% of the salary last drawn and for Reckonable Service of less\n than 40 years, the benefit was proportionately reduced. It was thus assured\n that by contributing substantial parts of their earnings including for the past\n service, Petitioners would have a defined pension to cater for their post-\n retirement period for a life time. In case of death or disablement of an\n employee while in service, the Beneficiary was entitled to pension at the rate\n of 50% of the last drawn salary of the employee. There was thus no\n justification for the amendment in the Scheme and that too, resulting in\n considerable reduction in the quantum of monthly pension.\n\n 6.

Albeit,\n Clause 8 of the Trust Deed empowered the Trustees at any time with the\n consent of NTPC or on its recommendation to amend or add to the\n provisions of the Trust Deed by a Supplementary Deed but this was subject\n to two riders i.e. the alteration should not adversely affect the benefits paid\n under the Trust or the benefits accrued upto the date of such amendment or\n the object of the Trust and no alteration would be without 'prior approval' of\n the CIT. In the present case, both conditions have been violated inasmuch as\n firstly, there was no prior approval from the CIT which was admittedly\n granted on 06.02.2013 w.e.f. 01.04.2002 and secondly, the restructured\n Scheme was a Defined Contributary Scheme and the pension payable was\n considerably reduced. Thus, the amendment was illegal and invalid and\n cannot be sustained in law. Moreover, the amendment was sought to be\n made applicable retrospectively to those who had retired prior to 03.02.2003\n i.e. to employees who retired on or after 01.04.2002 and whose pensions\n were kept in abeyance awaiting the restructuring of the pension. It is a\n settled law that any change in service condition of an employee and that too,\n the one which adversely effects his or her interest can only be prospective\n and with the consent of the employee.\n\n 7. Right of the Petitioners to receive retiral benefits under 1995 Scheme\n stood crystallized on the respective dates of their retirements prior to\n 03.02.2003 and therefore, 2003 Scheme could not be made applicable to\n take away vested rights that had accrued on retirement. The Supreme Court\n in Mohd. Yunus clearly held that retiral benefits of Mohd.

Insofar as the Petitioners who retired post 03.02.2003 are concerned,\n they would also be governed by the 1995 Scheme and 2003 Scheme will be\n inapplicable. 1995 Scheme was regulated by Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997.\n Clause 8 of the Deed provided that any amendment could be with the prior\n approval of Board of NTPC and CIT. Therefore, any amendment could be\n valid only when the approval came. There is no dispute that in the present\n case, CIT gave his approval on 06.02.2013 albeit retrospectively from\n 01.04.2002. Therefore, there was no prior approval and post-facto approval\n cannot take the place of 'prior approval' in law. Therefore, at the highest,\n the 2003 Scheme could be valid and operate from on or after 06.02.2013,\n when the approval was granted and will be inapplicable to retirees before the\n said date. Additionally, even the Supplementary Trust Deed was executed\n only on 09.08.2011 and there is no gainsaying that a Trust Deed could be\n amended only by a Supplementary Deed and even on this score, the 2003\n Scheme cannot apply retrospectively.\n\n 9. The employees of NTPC including the Petitioners had no option but\n to compulsorily become members of the Pension Scheme and their\n contributions were deducted directly from the pay. Petitioners contributed\n not only a percentage from their current salary and also made additional\n contribution on a monthly basis but the contributions extended to past\n service also. These contributions were on an assurance of a defined benefit\n in the form of monthly pension to the extent of 50% of the last drawn salary\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 31 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n to cater to the needs of their retired lives. Illustratively, Petitioner No. 2\n joined NTPC on 24.12.1982 and after receiving six promotions retired as\n Additional General Manager on 30.06.2008. Thus, calculation under the\n 1995 Scheme taking the Reckonable Service, which includes past and\n escalated future service, said Petitioner was entitled to a sum of Rs.24,934/-\n as pension on the last drawn salary of Rs.75,121/- (Basic Pay + DA)\n whereas under the 2003 Scheme, he is getting Rs.583/-.\n\n 10. The cut-off date of 01.04.2002 for implementation of the restructured\n Pension Scheme has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved as the\n pensioners who retired prior to this date and those thereafter, were a\n homogenous class of retirees who had all contributed under the 1995\n Scheme. Moreover, the justification given by the Pension Trust for\n restructuring the Pension Scheme is also without any basis and incorrect on\n facts. Trustees assert four reasons for restructuring the 1995 Scheme i.e.\n increase in wages, enhancement in age of retirement, increase in rates of\n purchase of annuities and reduction in returns from investments. If there was\n a revision in the salary, employees' contribution also increased since\n contributions were a fixed percentage of the salaries. If there was\n enhancement in age of retirement from 58 to 60 years, the employees\n contributed for two more years. It is Trust's own imagination that the Trust\n fund was unviable. The Actuaries were hired by the Trustees and rendered\n reports to suit their dictates. Neither were the reports shared with the\n employees and/or their representatives nor the basis of the reports were ever\n shared or made known. The income of the Trust, to the best of knowledge of\n the Petitioners, was manifold higher than the money invested in the purchase\n of pension annuity.

Similarly, for every\n preceding year, the interest income from the contributions of the Member\n was far more than the money spent on purchase of annuities. Moreover, as\n per Guidelines of Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Trust had to\n invest its investable funds in Central and State Governments securities and\n PSUs/Financial Institutions securities, but the Trustees never furnished any\n details of the investments of the funds and/or the quantum of returns against\n each investment. Additionally, the liveries, shoes and raincoats which were\n being given to all NTPC employees on yearly basis free of charge were also\n stopped and value of these items was added to pension contribution for each\n employee.\n\n 11. The prime reason sought to be brought forth by the Respondents for\n restructuring the Pension Scheme was increase in purchase price of\n annuities, which is nothing but a disguise to take away the defined benefits\n under 1995 Scheme. There can be no doubt that while formulating the 1995\n Scheme, NTPC would have taken the assistance of Consultants and\n Accountants/Actuaries, who in turn would have taken into consideration\n factors such as price escalation, availability of funds in future etc. and\n catered for all the fluctuations. No details have been furnished by the\n Respondents with regard to investments of its investable funds in Central\n Government and State Governments Securities as well as in PSU/Financial\n Institutions Securities. No documents have been filed to show the alleged\n paucity of funds by the Pension Trust and in fact, strangely now the\n argument is taken that the 1995 Scheme had become unviable in the initial\n years, which albeit incorrect, only goes to show that all the while the 1995\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 33 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Scheme was being operated by the Trust, they were not managing the same\n in the manner it should have been.\n\n 12. Contention of the Respondents that from time to time, decisions were\n taken in various meetings to ascertain the viability of the Trust and that too,\n in a transparent manner with the consent and in the presence of the\n Petitioners and the other employees, is of no aid to the Respondents.\n Petitioners and other similarly placed employees The amendment was\n carried out by the Board of Trustees without putting the Petitioners to notice\n and/or hearing them. Much emphasis was laid on the meeting held on\n 02.09.2002 but the fact is that only employees working in the Noida office\n attended the meeting, which was a miniscule percentage of the total\n employees. Petitioners or individual employees had no voice vote in these\n meetings. Even otherwise, in law the new restructured Scheme could not be\n made applicable retrospectively and therefore, their consent or knowledge is\n meaningless. Objection of delay and laches is misconceived.

Jal Nigam and Another v. Jaswant Singh and Another\n, (2006)\n 11 SCC 464]\n\n 14. DPE issued O.M. dated 12.04.1991 permitting individual CPSEs at\n their discretion to work out a suitable annuity scheme through LIC based on\n purely voluntary contributions by the employees to the fund without any\n liability on the PSE or the Government of India and contribution of the\n Management to the superannuation fund was restricted to Rs.100/- per\n annum for all employees taken together. Board of Directors of NTPC in\n 141st meeting held on 18.03.1994 approved the proposal to formulate a self-\n\n contributory superannuation benefit pension scheme. Pursuant thereto, an\n MoU was executed on 07.03.1997 between NTPC, NEFI and SEJC,\n respectively envisaging formulation of a Trust to regulate the Pension\n Scheme. Another MoU was executed on 10.01.1998 with the Associations\n of workmen. Accordingly, Pension Trust was created and Trust Deed was\n executed on 12.03.1997. The Pension Trust comprised originally of four\n Trustees from NTPC Management and six from employees' representatives.\n Trust was irrevocable and governed by the rules framed in this regard. The\n effective date of the Pension Scheme was fixed as 01.04.1995.\n\n 15. The contributions made by the employees were directly deducted\n from the salary and sent to Pension Trust created for the purpose and the\n Trustees were solely responsible to administer the pension fund for\n employees of NTPC. Annuities were purchased from LIC and upon\n superannuation of an employee, cost of annuity was to be paid by the Trust\n to LIC after which the latter would start paying monthly pension to the\n retiree. Therefore, NTPC had no control over the affairs and day-to-day\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 35 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n administration of the Trust and contributions from the Petitioners and other\n employees were solely the domain of the Pension Trust.\n\n 16. Pension Scheme was introduced vide \nCPC\n dated 09.10.1997 for\n employees in the Executive and Supervisory categories w.e.f. 01.04.1995\n and for administration of the Scheme, Trust had taken a Master Policy from\n LIC to pay the pension benefits as per the Scheme. Trust invested the funds\n in approved securities as per Government Guidelines and provisions of 1961\n Act. 1995 Scheme was based on defined benefit pattern in which pension\n payable was already pre-defined as a percentage of last salary drawn and\n was paid based on length of service i.e. Reckonable Service which is total of\n Escalated Future Service and Past Continuous Service and salary included\n the Basic Pay and Dearness Allowance. For those in service before\n 01.04.1995, Past Service Contribution was to be made while for those who\n joined after 01.04.1995, contributions included Percentile Salary\n Contribution and Additional Contribution, which was a fixed lumpsum\n amount. The contributions were deposited in a Pool Account of the Trust to\n constitute the corpus.\n\n 17. Prior to introduction of the 1995 Scheme, Pension Trust had called for\n an Actuarial Report on the viability of the Scheme. Scheme was proposed\n based on certain assumptions such as: (a) rate of mortality in service;\n\n (b) cost of annuity; (c) rate of increase in salaries; and (d) return on\n investment. The Scheme was not etched in stone or immutable. Clause D.4.5\n in the MoU contemplated discontinuation of the Scheme itself as is clear\n from the expression 'till the Pension Scheme continues' and thus, no\n permanency could be attached to the Scheme. Secondly, availability of\n money was subject to periodical review, which is clear from a reading of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 36 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Clause 6.3 of the salient features of the 1995 Scheme and Clause 3.3 of the\n Trust Rules and the Actuaries had to be engaged from time to time to\n scrutinize the availability of funds.\n\n 18. In 2000, there was a shift as changed circumstances transformed the\n basis of actuarial assumptions for the Scheme, necessitating restructuring of\n the same to make the Scheme workable. Increased additional contributions\n were required from members, but there was disinclination on the part of the\n members to do so. Other factors also contributed to the viability of the\n Scheme being: enhancement in age of superannuation from 58 to 60 years;\n revision in annuity rates by more than 50% by LIC w.e.f. 01.04.2002;\n increase in salaries w.e.f. 01.01.1997; and decline in the return on\n investments. The issue of age enhancement was considered by the Board of\n Trustees in 9th Meeting held on 20.08.1999 along with the issue of payment\n of pension on revised salaries and it was felt that actuarial valuation was\n required. The agenda was again considered in the 12th Board Meeting held\n on 02.08.2000, 13th Board Meeting held on 11.10.2000, 14th Board Meeting\n held on 16.02.2001 and 15th Board Meeting held on 08.06.2001. In the 14th\n and 15th meetings, there was discussion on the increase in annuity rates as\n also return on investments. Board of Trustees decided that since there was\n increase of about 20% in the cost of annuity purchased from LIC and\n reduction in interest rates on investment from 12.5% to 10.5% per annum,\n members' contributions should increase correspondingly. However, it was\n also decided that till actuarial valuation report was received regarding the\n impact of these factors on the 1995 Scheme, pension should continue on the\n pre-revised salaries.\n\n 19. In the subsequent meetings, it was brought forth by the Actuaries that\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 37 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n the increase in salaries and cost of purchase of annuity made it imperative\n that there was a substantial increase in the contributions by employees from\n 3% to 8% i.e. 2.75 times increase in Percentage Salary Contribution and\n increase upto Rs.730/- per month in Additional Contribution or if entire\n contribution was to be made from Percentage Salary Contribution then\n members were to pay at the rate 6% to 25% of the salary. However,\n employees did not agree to the increase in contributions. In the 18th meeting\n held on 28.12.2001, Actuary was asked to study various alternatives of the\n benefit and contribution structure and make a detailed presentation in the\n next meeting. Board of Trustees also took a second opinion from Mercer\n Human Resource Consulting ('Mercer'). It was highlighted by the\n Consultant that there was a deficit of Rs.1,443.82 crores as against total\n liability of Rs.2,226.02 crores.\n\n 20. A communication was issued by the then Senior Manager (HR) on\n 03.07.2002 to all Heads of HR in each project, highlighting the change in\n assumptions and informing that: (i) Pension Scheme was viable only if there\n was 50% increase in the members' contributions; (ii) private insurance\n companies when contacted for purchase of annuities were unable to offer\n anything in the near future; and (iii) Income Tax Authorities were contacted\n to modify the rules allowing a direct disbursement of pension by the Trust.\n Feedbacks were sought from the employees and meetings were held at\n different levels with the employees' association and in fact NEFI\n representing the Executive cadre sought closure of the 1995 Scheme.\n However, all efforts to continue the Scheme in its present form failed and\n hence, in the 20th Board Meeting held on 20.12.2002, Trustees decided to\n restructure the Pension Scheme and make payment of pension on the basis\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 38 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n of actual contributions by the members and pro rata interest earned by the\n Trust on such contributions. Thus, the nature of the Scheme changed from\n Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution and it was decided that in all cases\n of retirement on or after 01.04.2002, payment would be made as per the\n amended Scheme. Employee-wise account was created from earlier pool\n fund and contribution of the employee was utilized to pay pension only to\n that employee. Element of cross-subsidy amongst employees was\n eliminated. Under the restructured 2003 Scheme, there was no linkage either\n with last drawn salary of the member or the length of service.\n\n 21. Accordingly, PTC 17/2003 was issued implementing the 2003\n Scheme and under the said Scheme purchase value of annuity remained\n limited to 'Actual Accumulated Contribution' of an employee. The\n Accumulated Contribution paid by each employee till September, 2002\n along with pro rata earnings was credited into the individual account of the\n employee. Initially, for collection of contributions, Executive and\n Supervisors were divided into categories 'A' and 'B', however, pursuant to\n 25th Meeting of the Trustees on 23.07.2004, the categories were merged.\n Executives and Supervisors now contributed a Fixed Percentage of the\n Salary being 1% of the Basic Pay and Additional Contribution of Rs.388/-\n per month from April, 2003 along with a one-time lumpsum Contribution of\n Rs.3,401/- in the month of April, 2004.\n\n 22. In the 27th Board Meeting held on 29.04.2005, it was resolved that\n monthly Pension payable to all employees will be uniform and for Financial\n Year 2005-06, contribution will be Rs.453/- per month, which constituted\n surrender value of Washing Allowance of Rs.147/- per month, Tea Subsidy\n Component of cash and Canteen Compensation of Rs.306/-. Additionally, a\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 39 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n sum of Rs.3,967/- was payable in the month of April, 2005, which was\n reimbursement value of summer liveries for the year 2005. This was\n communicated earlier to all employees vide Circular dated 15.04.2005.\n Therefore, pension payable to an employee under 2003 Scheme was the\n contribution of the employee plus interest on it till the date of his\n superannuation. Where an employee decided to withdraw his contribution\n before superannuation to invest in other pension schemes, his contribution\n retained with the Trust was reduced according to withdrawal and interest\n continued to accumulate on the balance amount.\n\n 23. The fact the Scheme as originally conceived could not work was\n found in both the actuarial reports i.e. report dated 15.02.2007 by M/s. A.K.\n Pandit and report dated 10.06.2008 by M/s. Watson and Wyatt. The change\n in 1995 Scheme did not infringe any vested rights of the Petitioners as 1995\n Scheme was never conceived as a never ending Scheme. Review of the\n working of the scheme was engrained in the Scheme as a continuous process\n and entitlement of pension was contingent upon revision of the contributions\n by members, which they refused to increase. If the Trust became unviable,\n there was no way the Scheme could have continued in its present form. It\n would be travesty of justice to remaining employees if the Scheme\n continued, as with the depletion of the Trust Fund there would be nothing\n remaining for the future employees.\n\n 24. The decision to restructure the 1995 Scheme was not a hasty decision\n and was taken after due deliberations and consideration. Process of review\n of contributions and benefit structure was started from the year 2000 itself.\n Consultative process was adopted and matter was discussed at length with\n stakeholders such as different unions, employees' associations, Actuaries,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 40 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Board of Trustees etc. It is not correct for the Petitioners to contend that they\n were not put to notice before allegedly adversely reducing the pensions as\n they were duly represented in most of the meetings through their Unions etc.\n and in fact, the Unions and Associations requested for the 1995 Scheme to\n be terminated forthwith as they were not willing to deposit extra\n contributions. It was neither feasible nor practical to expect NTPC or the\n Trust to take individual consent from each employee being thousands in\n numbers. In any case, mere amendment in a Pension Scheme does not and\n cannot tantamount to change in service conditions of the Petitioners as it is\n always open to an employer to fix a cut-off date, which in the present case\n was taken after weighing the pros and cons of continuing the 1995 Scheme\n and the viability of the Trust Fund and was not arbitrary.\n\n \n25. It is clear from a reading of the Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997 that\n while the Trust was irrevocable, the Deed itself envisaged a provision for\n alteration, addition or amendment to the Deed and power to alter emanated\n from Clause 8 of the Deed, which provides that the Trustees may at any time\n with the consent of NTPC or on its recommendation by a Supplementary\n Deed amend or add to the provision of the Trust Deed or the Rules. Much\n was argued by the Petitioners that a condition precedent to amendment of\n the Deed was that there should be no adverse effect on the benefits being\n paid to the employees, overlooking the fact that 1995 Scheme was never\n intended for the benefit of an individual employee but was for the collective\n interest of the whole class of employees and once it could not address the\n larger interest, it had to be restructured. Petitioners have accepted the 1995\n Scheme with all its terms and cannot question the change. [Ref. \nUnion of\n India and Others v. N. Murugesan and Others\n, (2022) 2 SCC 25].

In any case, the\n only effect of delayed approval would be that the Trustees shall be held\n liable for tax implications on the contributions received as per Rule 9 of\n Schedule 4, Part B of 1961 Act but this cannot invalidate the changes made\n in the Pension Scheme.\n\n 26. Petitioners have completely glossed over the fact that the 1995\n Scheme was a purely, voluntary, self-contributory scheme and not a\n statutory pension scheme. The Scheme was not a part of the conditions of\n service of the Petitioners and was brought in as an added benefit and\n therefore, it is not open to the Petitioners to even argue that by the change in\n Scheme, there is an adverse effect on their service conditions. The Trust was\n created with a purpose of regulating and managing the Pension Scheme and\n NTPC/Trust cannot be saddled with any liability if the Trust became\n unviable.\n\n 27. Petitioners wrongly contend that they have paid full amount of Past\n Service Contributions with interest. Recovery with respect to Past Service\n Contribution was stopped from 01.09.2002. The Scheme itself envisaged\n recovery in 120 installments starting from October, 1997 and therefore, only\n 50% of the 120 installments was actually paid by the members and all\n contributions made were credited to their respective accounts along with due\n interest. From September, 2002, amount of Additional Contribution was\n reduced to Rs.360/- per month and lumpsum contribution of Rs.3,149/- was\n paid annually while Rs.5,508/- was payable once in three years. Moreover,\n Fixed Percentage Contribution payable at the rate of 1% to 5% of the salary\n depending upon of age of the member, was initially reduced to 1% for all\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 42 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n age groups from September, 2002 onwards and altogether stopped from\n December, 2003. From April, 2012 onwards, no contribution was recovered.\n\n 28. NTPC Trust has filed a plethora of financial documents during the\n hearing of the petitions but there were no substantive arguments by the\n Petitioners to controvert them. The viability of the 1995 Scheme was\n determined as per actuarial valuation by qualified Actuaries, who are experts\n in the field. Long term viability of the Pension Scheme is determined by an\n Actuary based on sources of contributions to the funds (contributions\n payable by the Member and earnings from investments) and total liability of\n pension payment for all members as per benefit structure of the Scheme;\n current and expected annuity rates; mortality and morbidity data; and\n employees' age profile etc. Before amendment of the Scheme to defined\n contribution pattern, expert Actuaries undertook a detailed exercise and\n deliberated on many alternatives: (a) payment of pension on notional salary\n with some assumed increase in the salary instead of calculation of pension\n on actual salary; (b) calculate pension in two parts i.e. separate pension\n calculation for service rendered upto 01.01.1997 (pension to be calculated\n based on salary drawn as on 31.12.1996) and second, to calculate pension\n based on service on or after 01.01.1997 till date of separation of an\n employee; (c) refund of annuity purchase price to the Trust instead of return\n to the nominee; and (d) multiple time increase in contribution payable by the\n employees. On a holistic exercise, it was found that only restructuring of the\n Scheme would be in the interest of the collective of the employees.\n\n 29. Petitioners wrongly rely on the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n Mohd. Yunus. Firstly, the judgment is not a judgment in rem. Secondly,\n validity of Circular dated 03.02.2003, impugned in the present petition was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 43 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n never challenged and thirdly, most of the members of Petitioner No.1 have\n superannuated much after the 2003 Scheme being notified while Mohd.\n Yunus retired prior to the notification of the 2003 Scheme. Moreover, the\n Trust had not provided complete details of the Actuary reports and financial\n impact on the Trust Fund before the Allahabad High Court. The judgment\n does not decide the workability of the pension Trust or the legality of the\n 2003 Scheme and it is for this reason that the Supreme Court remanded the\n present writ petitions for a hearing on merits. Reliance was placed on the\n following judgments:-\n\n \n(\nA) Deccan Paper Mills Company Limited v.

There can be no dispute with the\n legal proposition that doctrine of delay and laches is a well-recognized\n doctrine and from time to time, the Supreme Court has held that doctrine of\n delay and laches or for that matter limitation are statutes of repose and peace\n and rest on foundations of greater public interest. It is, however, equally\n settled that if in every case an argument against relief, which is otherwise\n available to a party and just, is founded on mere delay, validity of that\n defence must be tried on principles of equity, save and except, where there is\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 44 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n a statutory bar to condone the delay. It is also settled that law recognizes a\n continuing cause of action which may give rise to a recurring cause of action\n as in the case of salary or pension. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme\n Court in \nM.R. Gupta v. Union of India and Others\n, (1995) 5 SCC 628, in\n \nUnion of India and Others v. Tarsem Singh\n, (2008) 8 SCC 648, the\n Supreme Court held that it is the very essence of a continuing wrong that it\n is an act which creates a continuing source of injury and renders the doer of\n the act responsible and liable for continuance of the injury. If the wrongful\n act is of such a character that injury caused continues then the act constitutes\n a continuing wrong. It was further held that normally, a belated service\n related claim will be rejected on ground of delay and laches in a writ petition\n but one of the exceptions to the rule is in cases relating to continuing wrong\n and where the claim is based on a continuing wrong, relief can be granted\n even if there is a long delay in seeking the remedy, with reference to the date\n on which the continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing wrong\n creates a continuing source of injury. Of-course, there is an exception to the\n exception where the grievance effects rights of third parties which in the\n meantime have crystallized such as in cases of seniority or promotion. The\n Supreme Court observed that if the issue relates to payment or re-fixation of\n pay or pension, relief may be granted in spite of delay as it does not affect\n rights of third parties.\n\n \n31. By these writ petitions, Petitioners ventilate their grievances with\n respect to re-fixation of their pension on account of restructuring in a\n Pension Scheme, which has impacted their monthly pension and thus there\n can be little doubt that their cause is a continuous cause arising out of a\n continuing injury and the judgment in \nTarsem Singh\n (supra), will apply in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 45 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n all four corners. Be that as it may, I am of the view that there is no\n inordinate delay in filing the writ petitions and the reason is not far to seek.\n It is true that the restructured 2003 Scheme was introduced on 03.02.2003.\n However, it cannot be overlooked that having introduced the Scheme, the\n Pension Trust was continuing to have deliberations and discussions on the\n revival of the 1995 Scheme and in fact, the original Trust Deed was\n amended by the Supplementary Trust Deed only on 09.08.2011 and\n significantly, even the approval by the CIT was given on 06.02.2013. All\n this while, Petitioners were hopeful that the 1995 Scheme may be restored.\n\nPertinently, a categorical stand is taken in most of the writ petitions that\n whenever Petitioners represented, orally or in writing, protesting against the\n restructuring of the Pension Scheme, they were asked to await the outcome\n of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of \nMohd. Yunus\n (supra) as\n even the Respondents lacked clarity on the validity and applicability of 2003\n Scheme. This argument is even otherwise without any basis for the singular\n reason that the Supreme Court remanded these writ petitions to be heard on\n merits conscious of when the writ petitions were filed. The order does not\n indicate that the issue of delay and laches was left open to be decided by this\n Court considering that the Supreme Court was examining the judgment of\n the Division Bench dated 01.11.2018, where Pension Trust had categorically\n raised an objection qua some of the writ petitions that they were barred by\n delay and laches. In light of this, the preliminary objection raised by the\n Pension Trust is rejected.\n\n 32. Genesis of the disputes between the parties in the present writ\n petitions lies in 1995 Scheme introduced by NTPC vide \nCPC\n No. 354/1997\n dated 09.10.1997. Background to introduction of the 1995 Scheme was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 46 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n persistent demands from various Unions and Associations of the employees\n of all categories in different PSEs of Government of India to introduce a\n scheme, in addition to statutory schemes such as Contributory Provident\n Fund and Employees' Pension Scheme, 1995 under \nEmployees' Provident\n Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952\n and Gratuity, for payment of\n retirement benefits in case of superannuation, death or permanent disability\n of an employee. Looking into these demands, Ministry of Programme\n Implementation, DPE, Government of India, vide O.M. dated 12.04.1991,\n issued a directive that individual PSEs may 'work out a suitable Annuity\n Scheme through LIC, based on purely voluntary contributions made by the\n employees to a fund outside the PSE without any liability on the\n PSE/Government'. It was also decided that Management contribution to the\n Superannuation Fund would be restricted to Rs.100/- per annum for all\n employees of the PSE, taken together.\n\n 33. Pursuant to the said O.M., Board of Directors of NTPC in the 141st\n meeting held on 18.03.1994, approved the introduction of a Self-\n contributory Superannuation Benefit (Pension) Scheme to be administered\n through a Pension Trust. Ministry of Power, Government of India gave its\n in-principle approval for introduction of a pension scheme, vide letter dated\n 18.05.1995. NTPC appointed M/s. K.A. Pandit as an Actuary and Actuarial\n Valuation Report dated 28.04.1993, formulating salient features of the\n pension scheme, was received from the Actuary, wherein the assumptions\n considered for valuation were: (a) Future Salary increase @ 7% p.a.;\n\n (b) Return on Investment of Trust Fund @ 12%; and (c) Annuity rate of\n LIC-100 times of monthly pension under Pension for Life with Return of\n Capital to Nominee option, Mortality in service @ LIC table of 1970-73\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 47 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n (3.45 death per 1000).\n\n 34. Subsequently, a revised Actuarial Valuation Report dated 16.03.1994\n was received, as per which total value of pension liability at that time was\n assessed at Rs.154.66 crores, to be funded by Percentage Salary\n Contribution ranging from 1% to 5% depending on the age of the employee\n along with Additional Contribution of Rs.280/- per month per employee,\n escalated at the rate of 8% per annum. An MoU was executed on 07.03.1997\n between NTPC and NEFI and SEJC, wherein it was mutually agreed to\n formulate a Self-Contributory Superannuation Benefit (Pension) Scheme for\n benefit of all NTPC employees and to create a Pension Trust to manage and\n administer the Scheme. It was also agreed that NTPC's contribution shall be\n limited to Rs.100/- per annum for all employees taken together and rest of\n contribution will be by employees to make the Scheme financially viable\n and the contributions were to be deducted from the salaries of the employees\n on a monthly basis. Executives and the Supervisors, who were on roll of\n NTPC on the date of signing of the MoU as also those who joined in future,\n were to compulsorily become members of the Scheme. The percentage of\n contributions as also Additional Contribution were prescribed in the MoU.\n Clause D.4.1 provided that three Trustees would be from Executives'\n Association and three from Supervisors' Association as nominated and\n seven were to be nominated by the Management including the Chairman of\n the Trust for managing the Trust properties. It was decided that NTPC shall\n execute a Trust Deed and frame Rules for proper implementation of the\n Pension Scheme with the approval of CMD, NTPC or any other authorized\n officer. Trust was to be registered with the Registrar of Assurances.\n\n 35. Clause D.4.3 provided that income tax exemption will be obtained to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 48 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n the effect that income of the Trust will not be chargeable to income tax.\n Clause D.4.5 stipulated that MoU shall be irrevocable and remain operative\n and effective in perpetuity till the Pension Scheme continues to be in\n operation. Salient features of the Scheme were enumerated in Annexure-1 to\n the MoU and were integral part of the MoU. Clause D.4.7 categorically\n provided that MoU shall become effective for all purposes and intents\n from 01.04.1995 and recoveries/contributions shall start from 01.04.1995\n and all employees on the rolls of NTPC as on 01.04.1995 shall make\n contributions.\n\n 36. Trust Deed was executed on 12.03.1997 and Rules were framed. Soon\n thereafter, the 1995 Scheme was introduced on 09.10.1997 with approval of\n CIT on 11.06.1997. The Scheme became operational and several Circulars\n were issued thereafter from time to time regulating the deductions made\n from the employees towards contributions from past as well as present\n service.\n\n 37. The 1995 Scheme was a defined benefit scheme and the corpus of the\n Trust Fund was funded by contributions from the members through:\n\n (a) monthly Percentage Salary Contributions fixed as per the employee's\n age; (b) Past Service Contributions; and (c) Monthly Additional\n Contributions. Being in the nature of a 'Defined Benefit' Scheme, the 1995\n Scheme asssured pension at the rate of 1.25% per annum per year of\n Reckonable Service, limited to 50% of last drawn salary and for Reckonable\n Service less than 40 years, benefit was proportionately reduced. Therefore,\n the 1995 Scheme had a direct linkage to the last drawn salary and\n Reckonable Service and clearly, the pension was pre-defined. Reckonable\n Service as defined in the Rules was total of Escalated Future Service + Past\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 49 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Continuous Service and Salary included Basic Pay + Dearness Allowance.\n\n The sum of three contributions was deposited in a Pool Account of the\n Pension Trust to make a corpus and the money in the corpus was to be\n utilized by the Trust to buy annuities from LIC, as and when an employee\n superannuated, died etc. The Trust invested the contributions in approved\n securities as per Government Guidelines and provisions of 1961 Act.\n\n 38. There was a paradigm shift in 2000 with respect to the working of the\n 1995 Scheme and viability of the Trust Fund and the trigger, as brought\n forth by the Respondents, was revision in salaries of the NTPC employees\n w.e.f. 01.01.1997, following the ten years wage revision pattern in PSEs.\n This and several other factors, as brought out above, eventually led to\n introduction of the 2003 Scheme, which was a 'Defined Contribution'\n Scheme in contrast to the 1995 Scheme, which was a 'Defined Benefit'\n Scheme. Under the restructured 2003 Scheme, pension was to be calculated\n based on actual contributions by the members and interest credited by the\n Trust on such contributions with no linkage to last drawn salary or length of\n service and the purchase value of annuity remained limited to the 'Actual\n Accumulated Contribution' of an employee. Aggrieved by the restructuring\n of the 1995 Scheme, one Mohd. Yunus, an ex-employee of NTPC who\n retired on 31.07.2002, approached the Allahabad High Court and vide\n judgment dated 17.12.2009, the Court held that he was entitled for pension\n under the 1995 Scheme. The judgment was challenged by Pension Trust\n before the Supreme Court but the Civil Appeal was dismissed on 09.12.2015\n on the ground that rights of Mohd. Yunus crystalized on the date of his\n retirement and any future Scheme, Rules or Guidelines, including 2003\n Scheme, would be inapplicable to him.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 50 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n 39. At the cost of repetition, I may note that in the present batch of\n petitions, in writ petitions, bearing W.P. (C) Nos. 2327/2016, 2092/2016,\n 9539/2016, 6179/2016, 2289/2016, 4839/2016 and 2010/2016, Petitioners\n are those members of the 1995 Scheme who retired prior to 03.02.2003\n while Petitioners in the other writ petitions, save and except one, are those\n who retired post 03.02.2003, the date on which the 2003 Scheme was\n introduced albeit retrospectively to apply to all cases of superannuation after\n 01.04.2002 and to cases of death while in service/total incapacitation after\n 31.08.2002, except cases already settled by the Trust. Some members of\n Petitioner No. 1 in W.P.(C) 6357/2019 are also retirees prior to 03.02.2003.\n\n 40. The moot question that arises for consideration before this Court is\n whether the Petitioners will be governed by 1995 Scheme or the restructured\n 2003 Scheme. But before examining the said questions, it is important to\n segregate the Petitioners in two categories. \nIn my view, cases of Petitioners\n who retired prior to 03.02.2003 cannot be placed on the same pedestal as\n those who retired post the said date as they are squarely covered by the\n judgment of the Supreme Court in \nMohd. Yunus\n (supra). Therefore, in\n these cases, this Court need not enter into deciding the vexed question of\n validity of the 2003 Scheme, which cannot be made applicable to them\n retrospectively.\n\n 41. The case of Mohd. Yunus before the Allahabad High Court was that\n since he had attained the age of superannuation on 31.07.2002, he was\n entitled for payment of pension under the 1995 Scheme. Agreeing with\n Mohd. Yunus, Allahabad High Court held that he would be entitled for\n payment of post-retiral dues in accordance with the 1995 Scheme, existing\n on the date of his retirement and any change made subsequently shall not\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 51 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n affect his rights and accordingly, direction was issued to pay his post-retiral\n dues as per the 1995 Scheme. The judgment was carried in appeal, which\n was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 09.12.2015, holding that retiral\n benefits of Mohd. Yunus crystalized on the date of his retirement i.e.\n 31.07.2002 and any rules or guidelines notified thereafter including the 2003\n Scheme could not be made applicable to him. Applying the aforesaid\n judgment, cases of Petitioners who retired prior to 03.02.2003, will be\n governed by the 1995 Scheme and the 2003 Scheme, which was introduced\n post their retirement will be inapplicable. The action of the Pension Trust to\n make the scheme retrospectively applicable to retirees from 01.04.2002 to\n take away their vested rights which crystallised on the dates of their\n respective retirements, cannot be sustained.\n\n \n42. The argument made on behalf of the Pension Trust that the judgment\n is not a judgment in rem has no force. Supreme Court dismissed the appeal\n holding that settled and crystallised right of Mohd. Yunus to receive pension\n at the time of retirement cannot be adversely affected by any subsequent\n change in a scheme or policy by giving it a retrospective effect. The ratio is\n certainly applicable to the present cases and binding. Even otherwise, it is a\n well settled proposition of law that once an employee retires under the\n existing pension scheme, his right crystallizes on the said date and\n subsequent change in the pension scheme cannot take away the said vested\n right, retrospectively. Amendment if any, can only operate prospectively.\n [Ref.: \nPunjab State Cooperative Agricultural Development Bank Limited\n v.

The next question that arises is as to what relief can be given to these\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 52 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Petitioners considering that many years have elapsed from the respective\n dates of their retirements as also considering that the 1995 Scheme was a\n Self-Contributory Scheme requiring the members to contribute Fixed\n Percentage Monthly Salaries, Monthly Additional Contributions and Past\n Service Contributions. To answer this question, I am guided by the judgment\n of the Supreme Court in \nUniversity of Delhi v. Shashi Kiran and Others\n,\n (2022) 15 SCC 325. In the said case, the primary issue before the Supreme\n Court in the Shashi Kiran batch of cases was whether having opted for CPF\n while in service upto the cut off date consciously, the employees could\n exercise an option to switch over to GPF for grant of pension. The Supreme\n Court upheld the judgment of the Division Bench permitting the Appellants\n in the said batch to switch over so that they could receive pension. Since the\n litigation took many years to conclude, the second question that arose before\n the Supreme Court was as to the financial impact of the decision of the\n Division Bench. In this context, the Supreme Court examined that the Shashi\n Kiran batch of cases involved only 75 persons and the shift of those\n employees from CPF to GPF would not in any manner affect the strength\n and character of the Fund as also considering that the original Petitioners\n had approached the Court in 2010. It was further held that at this length of\n time, it is not as if any floodgates would be opened or there will be a drain\n on the resources of the State. In this light, the Supreme Court held that the\n decision of the Division Bench did not warrant interference with the caveat\n that original Petitioner would recoup the contribution under CPF with\n interest. Mindful of the fact that years had elapsed in the litigation and some\n of the employees may not be interested in switching over to GPF since it\n entailed recouping the contribution under CPF, the Supreme Court directed\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 53 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n that option must be given to them to decide if they wanted to switch over to\n GPF at that point of time.\n\n 44. In the present case, Trust has taken a stand in the counter affidavit,\n which is uncontroverted, that recoveries with respect to Past Service\n Contribution were stopped from 01.09.2002 and Additional Contributions\n payable monthly were reduced to Rs.360/-. Therefore, wherever part\n contributions were not made till the date of retirements, the contributions as\n envisaged in the 1995 Scheme shall have to be made to recoup the corpus of\n the Trust Fund. However, with the passage of over two decades and at this\n distant point in time, it may be possible that some of these Petitioners or\n their beneficiaries may not be interested in recouping the balance\n contributions under the 1995 Scheme. The only way to resolve this issue\n will be to direct the Pension Trust to give an option to these Petitioners or\n their beneficiaries, as the case may be, to contribute to the corpus and\n wherever the option is favourably exercised, the member shall make the\n required contribution, upon which the 1995 Scheme will apply and Defined\n Benefits envisaged under the said Scheme will be granted along with\n arrears. Be it ingeminated that the total number of these Petitioners is\n miniscule and therefore, in any event, there is no apprehension of opening\n floodgates or any significant financial impact on the Pension Trust Fund.\n\n 45. Coming now to the Petitioners who retired post 03.02.2003. The\n submissions of the Petitioners, eloquently articulated by their learned\n Senior Counsel can be encapsulated as: (a) 2003 Scheme cannot apply\n retrospectively to those who were members of the 1995 Scheme when the\n same was introduced and had contributed to the corpus of the Trust; (b) the\n restructured Scheme adversely affected the pension of the members of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 54 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n 1995 Scheme and therefore, the alteration/amendment was wholly illegal in\n light of the embargo in Clause 8 of the Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997; and\n\n (c) albeit there is no quarrel with respect to the powers of the Trustees to\n amend or add to the provisions of the Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997, but the\n same could only be done by the mechanism and procedure provided in\n Clause 8 of the said Deed, which stipulated that any alteration or addition to\n the Trust Deed will be with the consent of NTPC or on its recommendation\n by a Supplementary Deed and with the prior approval of the CIT and in the\n present case, there was no prior approval, as admittedly CIT gave his\n approval on 06.02.2013 retrospectively from 01.04.2002 and the\n Supplementary Deed was executed on 09.08.2011 and therefore, at the\n highest, 2003 Scheme would take effect from 06.02.2013.\n\n 46. Indisputably, the 1995 Scheme was introduced by NTPC in\n furtherance of the Directive of the Government in O.M. dated 12.04.1991,\n whereby individual PSEs were to work out a suitable Annuity Scheme\n through LIC on purely voluntary contributions by the employees and the\n Scheme was to be administered through a Trust by constituting a Pension\n Fund. The liability of NTPC as a PSE was limited to Rs.100/- per annum for\n the total employees taken together and remaining contribution was by\n the employees. It needs emphasis that there are no allegations of\n mismanagement or maladministration of the Trust Fund or misfeasance or\n embezzlement by the Trustees. In fact, no serious arguments were canvassed\n on behalf of the Petitioners to controvert the financial documents, including\n actuarial reports or balance sheets etc., placed on record by the Trust, despite\n hearings post the filing of these documents.\n\n 47. The main plank of the argument of the Pension Trust is that the 1995\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 55 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Scheme was not one etched in stone or immutable and by the very nature of\n the Scheme it was vulnerable to discontinuation and to say the least subject\n to periodic reviews for which purpose Actuaries had to be kept engaged in\n order to scrutinize the availability of funds and consequently the viability of\n the Trust and the Scheme.\n\n 48. One thing that comes out clearly from a close perusal of the\n documents on record as also arguments of the respective parties is that in\n less than 3 years from when the 1995 Scheme was introduced in the year\n 1997 albeit with effect from 01.04.1995, serious issues started cropping up\n with respect to the viability of the Scheme. Respondents attribute this to\n various factors such as enhancement in the age of retirement of employees\n from 58 to 60 years; increase in the salaries first of the Executives and then\n of the Supervisors followed by the workmen from 01.01.1997; increase in\n rates of purchase of annuities from LIC; and decline in return on\n investments. Plethora of financial documents have been placed on record by\n the Respondents jointly which include minutes of several meetings of Board\n of Trustees, balance sheets, communications with LIC and the\n representatives of Unions and Associations of the employees, the main\n stakeholders, as also Actuarial Reports by different Actuaries, being experts\n in their field, with the purpose of showing that the Scheme was not viable in\n its present form with the contemplated incoming contributions as also to\n show the bona fides in making every possible attempt to keep the 1995\n Scheme viable and ongoing. It would be pertinent to refer to some of these\n documents in order to examine whether there is any force in the submissions\n of the Respondents.\n\n 49.

Both the reports dated 28.04.1993 and 16.03.1994 indicate that the\n assumptions considered during the actuarial valuation were: (a) Future\n Salary increase @ 7% p.a.; (b) Return on Investment of Trust Fund @ 12%;\n and (c) Annuity rate of LIC-100 times of monthly pension under Pension for\n Life with Return of Capital to Nominee option. The total liability was\n assessed at Rs.154.66 crore to be funded by Percentage Salary Contribution\n ranging from 1 to 5% and Additional Contribution of Rs.280/- per month\n escalated at the rate of 8% per annum.\n\n 50. After the age of retirement was enhanced and salaries were revised in\n NTPC in 2000, Board of Trustees held a meeting on 21.08.2000 to assess\n the impact of the changed circumstances and to see if the Trust was\n economically viable. Presentation was called for from the Actuary and as\n suggested, actual data of revised pay was called for while deciding that for\n the time being, pension will be paid on pre-revised salaries. In the 13th\n meeting held on 11.10.2000, it was felt that increase in employees'\n contribution will be required to keep the Trust viable and the rate of\n Additional Contribution was revised to Rs.915/- from 01.04.2000. Circular\n dated 15.11.2000 was issued for increase in Additional Contribution for\n Financial Year 2000-01 for Executives. In the 14th meeting held on\n 16.02.2001, the impact of wage revision of workmen and Supervisors as\n also increase in purchase price of annuity by LIC and lower rate of return on\n investment was discussed again. Details of investments made during the\n year 2000-01 was also circulated for consideration.\n\n 51.

These issues were again deliberated\n upon extensively in the 15th meeting of the Board of Trustees held on\n 08.06.2001. It was brought forth in the meeting by the Secretary of the Trust\n that increase in annuity rates of LIC was about 19 to 20% and reduction in\n interest rates was approximately from 12.5 to 11% in one year. In the same\n meeting, Trustees also discussed various alternate modules to make the fund\n viable such as: (a) determination of rate of contribution based on single\n percentile contribution rate varying with age group; (b) payment of pension\n on fixed salary escalation instead of last drawn salary; and (c) return of\n capital amount to the Trust instead of going to individual nominee.\n Possibility of giving loans to the Trust against bonds for good investment\n was also discussed.\n\n 52. In the 18th meeting held on 28.12.2001 elaborate discussions took\n place on the Pension Scheme and views were expressed by Trustees\n nominated by NEFI and Supervisory Associations and Unions as also views\n of Management Trustees. After taking the respective views, it was decided\n that the Actuary would study the various alternatives of benefit and\n contribution structures to suggest alternatives including one with which\n basic benefit structure does not change and in the meantime, pension was to\n be paid treating the salary as 2/3rd of the salary drawn as an ad hoc measure.\n\n 53. Documents show that on 01.05.2002, CMD, Pension Trust wrote to\n Chairman, LIC, requesting for reduction in annuity rates pointing out that in\n the Self-Contributory Scheme of NTPC, entire corpus of the Fund was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 58 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n generated by the employees and till March, 2002, for a pension of Rs.1,000/-\n per month, the annuity purchase price used to be approximately\n Rs.1,13,852/- on annuity factor of 105.4, however, w.e.f. 01.04.2002 LIC\n had substantially increased the price to Rs.1,71,184/- on annuity factor of\n 70.10 i.e. more than 50.36%, which was a huge burden on the Trust. In\n furtherance thereof, efforts were made to explore any alternate agency for\n purchasing the annuity, however, inter-office Memo dated 03.07.2002\n shows that none of the agencies contacted was in a position to offer the\n services.\n\n 54. Respondents have also placed on record the report by Mercer\n indicating the detailed exercise undertaken to study the impact of rise in\n annuity rates, salaries and reduction in interest regime as also to analyse the\n way forward. It was inter alia recommended that: (a) under current\n circumstances, it may be necessary to buy annuity from LIC; (b) annuity\n with return of corpus would be a costly proposition and life annuity with a\n ten years guarantee period was more feasible option being cost effective\n with a return of significant portion of purchase price; (c) accrual rate of\n pension at 1.25% was difficult to sustain unless the option of frozen past\n service pension was adopted; and (d) accrual rate of pension of 1% was\n feasible if contribution rates were enhanced as suggested.\n\n 55. Another significant document relied upon by the Trust is a\n communication dated 10.09.2002 from Secretary General, NEFI addressed\n to CMD, NTPC wherein it is stated that during the course of NEFI's\n interaction with the Management on 07.08.2002, a presentation was made\n proposing 3 models as alternatives, as suggested by the Actuaries, however,\n as discussed in the subsequent meeting held on 10.09.2002, it was resolved\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 59 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n after due deliberations that since none of the three models inspire\n confidence, the Scheme be foreclosed and recovery from salaries of the\n Executives on this count be stopped forthwith.\n\n 56. In light of all this, 20th meeting of the Board of Trustees was held on\n 19.12.2002. It is recorded in the minutes of the meeting that restructuring of\n the 1995 Scheme was under review for quite some time as review was\n needed in light of changes in the economic scenario in the country as well as\n downward changes in the interest rates. Consequently, certain assumptions\n made by formulating this Scheme by Actuaries also underwent substantial\n changes. Detailed discussions held in various Trust meetings yielded no\n useful solutions and no consensus could be reached on either the change in\n benefit structure or contributions. It is also noted that pending the decision,\n pension payments to employees retired after 01.04.2002 had been kept in\n abeyance. After deliberation, it was resolved that the Self-Contributory\n Defined Benefit Scheme must give way to the Defined Contributory Scheme\n and pension would be then payable on the actual contribution of the\n employee. In furtherance thereof, PTC 16/2002 was issued circulating the\n change in the contribution structure for the Executive as follows:-\n\n \"NTPC LTD.

On 03.02.2003, PTC 17/2003 was issued i.e. the 2003 Scheme\n postulating the salient features of the restructured contributions and the\n benefits accruing thereon. From the aforementioned documents, it is\n palpably clear that the decision to restructure the 1995 Scheme was not a\n hasty or an overnight decision. Serious attempts and efforts were made by\n the Respondents to continue the existing Scheme and to explore all\n possibilities to make the same viable. Actuarial Reports were sought with\n recommendations to work the Scheme. Request was made to LIC to reduce\n the purchase price of annuities as that was a major factor impacting the\n working of the Scheme financially. Several agencies were contacted to sell\n the annuities on low price but none of the agencies were able to offer the\n annuities being new in the field. Three alternatives were suggested by the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 61 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Actuaries to continue the Scheme with some variations but neither of them\n could be enforced. It is also pertinent to mention that at all stages, the\n Employees' Associations and Unions were kept in the loop. They were\n informed of the reasons for which the 1995 Scheme was no longer viable\n and that enhanced contributions from them could work towards making the\n Scheme viable, however, as the Minutes of the Meetings indicate the\n employees expressed their disinclination to enhance the contributions as\n sought and/or as recommended by the Actuaries. In fact, NEFI had sent a\n written communication to CMD, NTPC to foreclose the Scheme as they\n were unable to enhance the contribution. Finally, a decision was taken to\n restructure the Scheme with a different structure of contribution as also\n benefits to the employees.\n\n 58. The actuarial reports show that to maintain the existing pension\n benefits Percentage Salary Contribution would have to be increased from 3\n to 8% or 2.75 times with an Additional Contribution of Rs.730/- per month\n escalated by 8% for Non-Executive or else if entire contribution was met\n from Percentage Salary Contribution, then it will be 6% to 25% i.e. 7.25\n times of the present rate with no Additional Contribution. For Executives,\n Actuary informed that if only Percentage Salary Contribution was recovered\n it had to be 6% to 25% or 7 times of present rate with no Additional\n Contribution or Additional Contribution at Rs.988/- per month with 8% per\n annum escalation etc. However, the employees were not willing to enhance\n the contributions and pertinently on 07.02.2003, Supervisory Services\n Associations sent a letter to Chairman of the Trust to implement the\n restructured Pension Scheme with a rider that 1% of the Basic Pay deposited\n in the accounts of the individuals should not be diverted in the Death Pool\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 62 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n Account and Additional Contribution should be only kept on surrender items\n which was Rs.788/- per month with escalation at 8% and no additional\n deduction for Additional Contribution should be made. None of the\n Associations were inclined to increase the Additional Contribution any\n further.\n\n 59. Holistically seen, the restructuring was in the larger interest of all the\n members and based on the availability of Funds with the Trust. Several\n factors cumulatively resulted in the decision to restructure the 1995 Scheme\n such as more than 50% increase in annuity rates by LIC of India, the annuity\n service provider from 01.04.2002; salary revisions from 01.01.1997,\n Actuary Reports suggesting manifold increase in contributions to sustain the\n Scheme; employees and their representative bodies not agreeing to pay\n revised contributions as suggested by the Actuaries. It was rightly flagged\n by the Respondents that long term viability of the Pension Scheme is\n determined by the Actuary Valuations based on sources of contributions to\n the Funds by members and/or earnings from investments and total liability\n of pension for all members as per the Defined Benefit structure of the\n Scheme, current and expected annuity rates, mortality and morbidity data,\n employees' age profile etc. As noted above, before restructuring the 1995\n Scheme, Actuaries had undertaken a detailed exercise of actuarial valuation\n deliberating over several alternatives such as payment of pension on\n notional salary with some assumed increase in salary instead of calculations\n of pension on actual salary. In fact, at some stage, it was also suggested to\n calculate pension in two parts i.e. separate pension for service rendered prior\n to 01.01.1997 (pension to be calculated based on salary drawn as on\n 31.12.1996) and second part to be calculated based on service on or after\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 63 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n 01.01.1997 till date of separation of employees. Refund of annuity purchase\n price to the Trust instead of return to nominee etc. was also discussed. In\n fact, even prior to introduction of the 1995 Scheme, actuary valuations were\n carried out on certain assumptions as these valuations form the basis of\n formulating any Pension Scheme. Mr. Lekhi, learned Senior Counsel\n appearing for the Pension Trust rightly contended that even in the earlier\n Actuary Report dated 16.03.1994, the Actuary had indicated present value of\n pension as Rs.154.66 crore with the value of Percentage Salary Contribution\n being Rs.29.33 crore and the resultant deficit as Rs.125.33 crores. It was\n recommended that the Actuarial valuation of the Scheme should be carried\n out every five years to monitor the Fund as this was how the viability could\n be tested. The financial difficulties experienced by the Trust in operating the\n 1995 Scheme is duly supported by detailed actuarial reports indicating a\n deficit which would have made the Scheme unviable. Having analysed the\n documents and the financials, I am unable to come to a conclusion that the\n action of restructuring the 1995 Scheme was malafide or arbitrary or\n perverse.\n\n 60. Petitioners are right in arguing that Clause 8 of the Trust Deed while\n empowering the Trustees to amend or add to the provision of the Trust Deed\n placed two caveats on the Trustees. The first was that the amendment should\n not adversely affect the benefits being paid from the Trust or accruing upto\n the date of such amendment or the object of the Trust and the second being\n the requirement of prior approval of the CIT. In fact, reading of Clause 8 of\n the Trust Deed itself shows that the Pension Scheme was not cast in stone\n and the Trustees had the power to amend, alter or add to the Scheme. Insofar\n as the first condition is concerned, it is amply clear from the documents on\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 64 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n record that had the Scheme continued in its present form of contributions\n and defined benefits, it was unviable to run the Trust. Therefore, benefit of\n few would have possibly resulted in discontinuing the Scheme totally and\n this would have been detrimental to the larger interest of the collective of\n employees and thus by restructuring and continuing the Scheme with a\n different structure, the pension scheme could be sustained albeit with a\n different structure. \nInsofar as the prior approval of the CIT is concerned,\n Pension Trust has taken a stand, and in my view rightly so that at best, the\n delayed approval would result in tax liabilities but this cannot invalidate the\n Scheme and in this view, I am fortified by a judgment of the Co-ordinate\n Bench of this Court in \nA.K. Saini & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, 2015\n SCC OnLine Del 13637, where a similar contention was raised by the\n Petitioners that any amendment to the Trust Deed was permissible only with\n the prior written approval of the Corporation and CIT. This contention was\n negatived by the Court by holding that the third amendment was brought in\n to bring parity amongst the employees and the mere fact that it was not\n approved by CIT will not render the amendment void and at best it would\n only deprive the Trust of tax benefits. In the present case, NTPC has stated\n in its separate affidavit that it had approved the restructuring of the Scheme\n and insofar as the CIT is concerned, approval was granted on 06.02.2013\n from 01.04.2002 and at the highest, the impact of the delayed approval\n would be in the tax regime but this cannot be a reason to invalidate the 2003\n Scheme brought in after due deliberations and considerations, taking into\n account actuarial reports as also keeping all stakeholders in loop. Execution\n of the Supplementary Deed was only a ministerial act and no mileage can be\n drawn by the Petitioners from its execution in 2011.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 65 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n 61. It is a settled law that judicial review is concerned not with the\n decision but with the decision-making process and a petition under \nArticle\n 226\n of the Constitution of India is for judicial review and not an appeal.\n Supreme Court has from time to time held that judicial review is not\n concerned with the merits of the decision but the manner in which it was\n taken. \nIn \nR v. Panel\n on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Guinness Plc,\n Lord Donaldson, M.R. referred to the judicial review jurisdiction as being\n supervisory or longstop jurisdiction and held that unless the restriction is\n observed, the Court, under the guise of preventing abuse of power will be\n guilty of usurping the power.\n \nIn \nTata Cellular v. Union of India\n, (1994) 6\n SCC 651, the Supreme Court held that the duty of the Court is to confine\n itself to question of legality. Its concern should be: (a) whether the decision-\n making authority exceeds its powers; (b) commits an error of law; (c)\n commits a breach of rules of natural justice; (d) reaches a decision which no\n reasonable authority would have reached; or (e) abused its power. Applying\n these principles, in matters like the present one, this Court has only to see if\n the restructuring of the Scheme is so irrational, arbitrary or perverse that it\n cannot be sustained in law. For all the aforesaid reasons, this Court is unable\n to reach a conclusion that the restructuring was irrational or perverse or that\n the decision-making process was flawed or arbitrary.\n\n 62. Insofar as the argument of the Petitioners that individual notices were\n not given to the Petitioners before restructuring the Scheme which had an\n adverse impact on their pensions which were considerably reduced,\n suffice would it be to hold that the representatives of the employees through\n various Unions and Associations were also associated with the process of\n restructuring and their suggestions on the actuarial reports including the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 66 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n advise to increase the contributions to keep the Scheme viable were invited.\n It was neither practical nor feasible for the Respondents to serve individual\n notices on the Petitioners and in my view, there is no legal requirement for\n serving individual notices in matters of policy decisions pertaining to\n restructuring of Pension Schemes.\n\n 63. Before parting, it is pertinent to mention that the 1995 Scheme was\n introduced on 09.10.1997 and within a short span of less than 3 years,\n questions were raised on the viability of the Scheme and the Trustees started\n the process of actuarial valuations. Therefore, the Scheme did not run for\n more than five years albeit the deductions/recoveries were made from\n 01.04.1995. Petitioners were completely aware of this process and the\n possible unviability of the Scheme and as per the uncontroverted stand of\n the Respondents, recovery with respect to Past Service Contribution was\n stopped from 01.09.2002 and from the same date, amount of Additional\n Contribution was also reduced to Rs.360/- per month. When the\n restructuring took place, the Accumulated Contribution paid by each\n employee till September, 2002 along with pro rata earnings was credited\n into the individual account of the employee as under the 2003 Scheme,\n purchase value of annuity was limited to 'Actual Accumulated Contribution'\n of an employee. The present is not a case where the 1995 Scheme had a long\n span giving rise to legitimate expectations and thus even on equity,\n Petitioners have no case to assert that this Court should direct the\n Respondents to restore the 1995 Scheme for retirees post 03.02.2003.\n\n 64. In light of the above findings, W.P. (C) Nos. 2327/2016, 2092/2016,\n 9539/2016, 6179/2016, 2289/2016, 4839/2016 and 2010/2016, are allowed\n directing that the Petitioners therein will be entitled to pension under the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 67 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n 1995 Scheme. However, keeping in view the long passage of time that has\n elapsed since their retirements, Respondents shall within six weeks from\n today give an option to these Petitioners/Beneficiaries, if they wish to\n receive pension under the 1995 Scheme. Wherever the Petitioners choose to\n be governed by the 1995 Scheme, they will make the requisite balance\n contributions, if any, as envisaged under the Scheme and pension shall\n resume.

Finally, in the 20th Meeting of the Board of Trustees held\n on 19.12.2002, decision was taken to restructure the 1995 Scheme\n from 'Defined Benefit' to 'Defined Contribution' Scheme. Under the\n restructured Scheme, contribution structure was changed for\n Executives by contribution of 1% of Basic Pay w.e.f. September,\n 2002 as Monthly Percentage Salary and Additional Contribution at\n Rs.788/- per month escalating at 8% per annum. The Defined Benefit\n was also changed to payment of pension based on actual contribution\n of the principal amount with interest at the rate not exceeding pro rata\n earnings on the investment by the Trust. It was decided that all cases\n of superannuation after 01.04.2002 and cases of death while in service\n or of incapacitation after 31.08.2002, except cases already settled, will\n be settled based on the new principles. Resolution was subject to\n approval by NTPC and CIT as per Clause 8 of the Trust Deed.\n Pending the final decision, pension payable to employees who retired\n w.e.f. 01.04.2002 was kept in abeyance."

To answer this question, I am guided by the judgment\n of the Supreme Court in \nUniversity of Delhi v. Shashi Kiran and Others\n,\n (2022) 15 SCC 325. In the said case, the primary issue before the Supreme\n Court in the Shashi Kiran batch of cases was whether having opted for CPF\n while in service upto the cut off date consciously, the employees could\n exercise an option to switch over to GPF for grant of pension. The Supreme\n Court upheld the judgment of the Division Bench permitting the Appellants\n in the said batch to switch over so that they could receive pension. Since the\n litigation took many years to conclude, the second question that arose before\n the Supreme Court was as to the financial impact of the decision of the\n Division Bench. In this context, the Supreme Court examined that the Shashi\n Kiran batch of cases involved only 75 persons and the shift of those\n employees from CPF to GPF would not in any manner affect the strength\n and character of the Fund as also considering that the original Petitioners\n had approached the Court in 2010. It was further held that at this length of\n time, it is not as if any floodgates would be opened or there will be a drain\n on the resources of the State. In this light, the Supreme Court held that the\n decision of the Division Bench did not warrant interference with the caveat\n that original Petitioner would recoup the contribution under CPF with\n interest. Mindful of the fact that years had elapsed in the litigation and some\n of the employees may not be interested in switching over to GPF since it\n entailed recouping the contribution under CPF, the Supreme Court directed"

In fact, at some stage, it was also suggested to\n calculate pension in two parts i.e. separate pension for service rendered prior\n to 01.01.1997 (pension to be calculated based on salary drawn as on\n 31.12.1996) and second part to be calculated based on service on or after"

Mr. Lekhi, learned Senior Counsel\n appearing for the Pension Trust rightly contended that even in the earlier\n Actuary Report dated 16.03.1994, the Actuary had indicated present value of\n pension as Rs.154.66 crore with the value of Percentage Salary Contribution\n being Rs.29.33 crore and the resultant deficit as Rs.125.33 crores.

This contention was\n negatived by the Court by holding that the third amendment was brought in\n to bring parity amongst the employees and the mere fact that it was not\n approved by CIT will not render the amendment void and at best it would\n only deprive the Trust of tax benefits. In the present case, NTPC has stated\n in its separate affidavit that it had approved the restructuring of the Scheme\n and insofar as the CIT is concerned, approval was granted on 06.02.2013\n from 01.04.2002 and at the highest, the impact of the delayed approval\n would be in the tax regime but this cannot be a reason to invalidate the 2003\n Scheme brought in after due deliberations and considerations, taking into\n account actuarial reports as also keeping all stakeholders in loop.
