PUBLIC PROSECUTOR (AP)\n\nCounsel for the Respondent:\n\n 1. A PRABHAKAR RAO\n\nThe Court made the following JUDGMENT:\n\n1. This appeal is preferred by the Appellant / State against the judgment of\nacquittal rendered by the Trial Court in Sessions Case No.423 of 2004 on the\nfile of II Additional Senior Civil Judge-cum-Assistant Sessions Judge, Fast\nTrack Court, Guntur (for short, 'the Trial Court') by its judgment dated\n29.04.2008, acquitted the accused for the offences punishable under \nsections\n306\n of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, '\nIPC\n').\n\n2. Perused the impugned judgment of acquittal rendered by the Trial\nCourt, which is now under challenge in this appeal. The record consists of the\nevidence of PWs.1 to 9, and the documents marked as Exs.P.1 to P.13 on\nbehalf of the prosecution. On behalf of the defence, no witnesses were\nexamined, and the accused filed 29 documents at the time of his examination\nunder \nsection 313\n of Cr.P.C.\n\n3. The facts in a nutshell, which give rise to the present appeal, are as\nfollows:\n\n The deceased, Venkata Lakshmi, was the daughter of Eluri\n Venkatamma (PW.1). She married Nallapati Chinnabbayi of\n Narasaraopet in 1985 and had two children: a son, Venkata Naga\n Bala Krishna (PW.2), and a daughter, Durga Bhavani (LW.3). After\n her divorce, the deceased lived with her mother along with her\n children. She mortgaged her house at Kakumanuvarithota, Guntur,\n and borrowed money from the accused for family needs. The\n accused also rented two shops belonging to her and her mother for\n his business. He later developed an attraction to her and repeatedly\n pressured her to marry him, but she refused. Without her consent,\n he sold the house she had mortgaged as security. He also failed to\n\n 3\n\n pay rent despite repeated requests. He frequently came to her home\n in a drunken state, demanded money by misusing documents\n fraudulently obtained from her, and attempted to coerce her into\n marriage. He further threatened to ruin the lives of her and her\n children if she did not comply. On 29.03.2004 at about 11:00 AM,\n she poured kerosene on her body behind the house, in the absence\n of her mother and children, and set her clothes on fire. Her mother\n and daughter returned home, heard her cries, extinguished the\n flames, and took her to the Government General Hospital, Guntur.\n She died on 03.04.2004 at 3:10 PM due to burn injuries. The\n government doctor (LW.9), who conducted the autopsy, opined that\n she died from complications caused by burns. In the dying\n declaration recorded by the Judicial Magistrate of First Class\n (LW.10), she stated that the accused pressured her to marry him,\n and she could not bear the harassment. She therefore poured\n kerosene on herself and set her clothes on fire to end her life. Thus,\n the accused abetted her suicide and is liable for the offence under\n \nSection 306\n IPC.\n\n4. The V Additional Junior Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate of First\nClass, Guntur, vide orders in P.R.C.No.6 of 2004, has committed the accused\nto the Court of Sessions, Guntur Division, to take up the trial for the offences\npunishable under \nSection 306\n of the IPC.\n\n5. The Court of Sessions, Guntur Division, has taken up the case on file\nunder \nSection 306\n of the IPC against the accused and has referred it to the\nCourt of the Assistant Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court, Guntur, for disposal\nin accordance with law. Subsequently, the case in Sessions Case No.423 of\n2004 has been numbered. After hearing the Public Prosecutor and the\ndefence counsel, the Trial Court framed a charge against the accused under\n\nSection 306\n of the IPC, which was read over and explained to him in Telugu,\n\n 4\n\nas required under \nSection 228\n of the Cr.P.C. The accused did not plead guilty\nand claimed to be tried.\n\n6. The learned Sessions Judge examined the accused as required under\n\nSection 313\n of the Cr.P.C., to enable him to consider the evidence led on\nbehalf of the prosecution and also against him. However, the accused denied\nthe evidence adduced by the prosecution. He filed 29 documents in his\ndefence, and his counsel submitted a memorandum of arguments on his\nbehalf.\n\n7. After considering the available material on record, the learned Sessions\nJudge found the accused not guilty of the offences punishable under \nSection\n306\n of the IPC and acquitted him.\n\n8. Sir K. Sandeep, learned Assistant Public Prosecutor appearing for the\nState, contends that the prosecution has clearly established all the essential\ningredients constituting an offence punishable under \nSection 306\n IPC against\nthe accused; the learned Judge failed to properly appreciate the cogent and\nreliable evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses; it is evident from the\ndying declaration of the deceased, as well as from the testimony of the\nsupporting prosecution witnesses, that the accused was solely responsible for\nabetting the deceased's suicide; despite the prosecution having proved the\nguilt of the accused, the learned Judge, without assigning adequate weight to\nthe prosecution's case, proceeded to acquit him; the additional reasons given\nby the learned Judge for the acquittal are also asserted to be unsustainable.\n\n9. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the accused\nsupported the findings and conclusions recorded by the Trial Court.\n\n10. I have heard the learned counsel on both sides and perused the\nmaterial on record, including the oral and documentary evidence produced by\nthe prosecution before the Trial Court.\n\n11. The point for determination is:\n\n 5\n\n Was the Trial Court justified in acquitting the accused?\n\nP O I N T:\n\n12. Before re-appreciation of the evidence on record, it is necessary here to\nmention the power of the Appellate Court regarding interference. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, in the case of \nA. Shankar V. State of Karnataka\n 1 , at\nparagraph 26 of the judgment, has held as follows:\n\n \"26. It is settled legal proposition that in exceptional circumstances the\n appellate court, under compelling circumstances, should reverse the\n judgment of acquittal of the court below if the findings so recorded by the\n court below are found to be perverse i.e. the conclusions of the court\n below are contrary to the evidence on record or its entire approach in\n dealing with the evidence is found to be patently illegal leading to\n miscarriage of justice or its judgment is unreasonable based on erroneous\n law and facts on the record of the case. While dealing so, the appellate\n court must bear in mind the presumption of innocence of the accused and\n further that acquittal by the court below bolsters the presumption of his\n innocence.\"\n\n13. \nIn \nState of Goa V. Sanjay Thakran & Anr.\n 2, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt, while considering the power of the Appellate Court to interfere in an\nappeal against acquittal, after adverting to various earlier decisions on this\npoint, has concluded as under:\n\n \"16.....while exercising the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal\n the court of appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal\n unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest\n illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by any\n reasonable person and, therefore, the decision is to be characterized as\n perverse. Merely because two views are possible, the court of appeal\n would not take the view which would upset the judgment delivered by the\n court below. However, the appellate court has a power to review the\n evidence if it is of the view that the view arrived at by the court below is\n perverse and the court has committed a manifest error of law and ignored\n the material evidence on record. A duty is cast upon the appellate court, in\n such circumstances, to reappreciate the evidence to arrive at a just\n decision on the basis of material placed on record to find out whether any\n of the accused is connected with commission of the crime he is charged\n with.\"\n\n1\n\n (2011) 6 SCC 279\n\n2\n\n (2007) 3 SCC 755\n\n 6\n\n14. With the above principles in mind, this Court analyze the reasoning and\nultimate conclusion of the Trial Court in interfering with the order of acquittal.\n\n15. Reading the \nsection 306\n of IPC would indicate that there must be either\ninstigation, or an engagement or intentional aid to doing of a thing. \nIn\n\nS.S.Chheena V. Vijay Kumar Mahajan\n 3 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nexplained the concept of abetment along with necessary ingredient for offence\nunder \nSection 306\n of IPC as under:\n\n \"25. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or\n intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on\n the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction\n cannot be sustained. The intention of the legislature and the ratio of the\n cases decided by this Court is clear that in order to convict a person under\n \nSection 306\n IPC there has to be a clear mens rea to commit the offence. It\n also requires an active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit\n suicide seeing no option and that act must have been intended to push the\n deceased into such a position that he committed suicide.\"\n\n16. \nIn \nAmalendu Pal V. State of W.B.\n 4 , the Hon'ble Supreme court\nexplained the parameters of \nSection 306\n in following words:\n\n \"12. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that before holding an\n accused guilty of an offence under \nSection 306\n IPC, the court must\n scrupulously examine the facts and circumstances of the case and also\n assess the evidence adduced before it in order to find out whether the\n cruelty and harassment meted out to the victim had left the victim with no\n other alternative but to put an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind\n that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide there must be proof of direct or\n indirect acts of incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the\n allegation of harassment without there being any positive action proximate\n to the time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or\n compelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of \nSection 306\n\n IPC is not sustainable.\n\n 13. In order to bring a case within the purview of \nSection 306\n IPC there\n must be a case of suicide and in the commission of the said offence, the\n person who is said to have abetted the commission of suicide must have\n played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to\n facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of abetment by the\n\n3\n\n (2010) 12 SCC 190\n\n4\n\n (2010) 1 SCC 707\n\n 7\n\n person charged with the said offence must be proved and established by\n the prosecution before he could be convicted under \nSection 306\n IPC.\"\n\n17. \nIn \nRamesh Kumar V. State of Chhattisgarh\n 5 , while explaining the\nmeaning of Instigation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that:\n\n \"20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do\n \"an act\". To satisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is not\n necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes\n \"instigation\" must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the\n consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must\n be capable of being spelt out. Where the accused had, by his acts or\n omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances\n that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in\n which case, an \"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit\n of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow,\n cannot be said to be instigation.\"\n\n18. These principles and necessary ingredients of \nSection 306\n and \n107\n of\nIndian Penal Code were reiterated and summarized by the Hon'ble Supreme\ncourt in the case of \nGurucharan Singh V. State of Punjab6\n.\n\n19. PW.1 is the mother, PW.2 is the son, and PW.3 is the sister of the\ndeceased, Venkata Lakshmi. PW.4 is the husband of PW.3. PWs.3 and 4 did\nnot support the prosecution's case and have been treated as hostile\nwitnesses. Their evidence indicates that they are unaware of the reasons\nbehind the deceased's suicide. However, PW.3 stated that the police did not\nexamine her and that her testimony did not consistent with the statement\nrecorded in Ex.P1. PW.4 also did not support the prosecution's case regarding\nthe observation of the scene of the offence by the police and the seizure of\nmaterial objects in his presence. He did, however, state that he signed the\nobservation report at the Government General Hospital, Guntur, at the request\nof the police.\n\n20. PW.7 is the Head Constable of Arundelpet L & O Police Station, who\nrecorded the statement of the deceased at the Government General Hospital,\n\n5\n\n (2001) 9 SCC 618\n\n6\n\n (2020) 10 SCC 200\n\n 8\n\nGuntur, upon receiving information. PW.8 is the Judicial Magistrate of First\nClass, who recorded the dying declaration of the deceased, Venkata Lakshmi,\nafter receiving intimation from the hospital. It is not seriously disputed that the\ndeceased, Venkata Lakshmi, was married in 1985 to one Nallapati\nChinnabbai, and the couple was blessed with a son, Venkata Naga Bala\nKrishna (PW.2), and a daughter, Durga Bhavani, during their marriage.\nSubsequently, the deceased obtained a divorce from her husband and was\nliving with her mother, along with her son and daughter.\n\n21. The evidence of PWs.1 and 2 reveals that the deceased had borrowed\nRs.2,00,000/- from the accused to meet her family necessities and had\nmortgaged her house as security for the said loan. PW.1 and her deceased\ndaughter, Venkata Lakshmi, had also leased out their shops to the accused\nfor his business, on payment of rent. However, the accused repeatedly\ninsisted that the deceased should marry him. On her refusal, he sold the\nmortgaged house without her consent or knowledge, and further failed to pay\nrent despite repeated requests made by the deceased and her mother. It was\nfurther stated that the accused used to visit her house in a drunken condition,\ndemand money, and take advantage of the documents obtained from her, with\nthe intention of forcing her to marry him. On 29.03.2004, at about 11:00 AM, in\nthe absence of her mother and children, the deceased poured kerosene over\nher body at the rear portion of the house and set herself on fire; when her\nmother and daughter returned home, they heard her cries, immediately\nextinguished the flames, and admitted her to the Government General\nHospital, Guntur, for treatment. Upon receiving information, PW.7 went to the\nhospital, recorded her statement, registered the case, and sent a copy of the\nFIR to the concerned authorities. PW.8, the Judicial Magistrate of First Class,\nalso received intimation, visited the hospital, identified the victim, Venkata\nLakshmi, with the aid of the medical officer, and recorded her statement.\n\n22. The evidence of the Investigating Officer, PW.9, shows that he visited\nthe scene of the offence and, in the presence of mediators PWs.4 and 5,\n\n 9\n\nfound a partially burnt saree and blouse, along with a plastic bottle. He seized\nthe semi-burnt saree, blouse and plastic bottle (MOs.1 and 2) in the presence\nof the mediators. The prosecution examined PW.6, the doctor who conducted\nthe autopsy on the dead body of the deceased, and issued the certificate\nmarked as Ex.P5. His undisputed evidence shows that, upon receiving a\nrequisition from the S.H.O., Arundelpet Police Station in Crime No.153 of 2004\non 04.04.2004, he conducted the post-mortem examination on the body of\nEluri Venkata Lakshmi between 12.00 PM and 1.00 PM. On examination, he\nfound burn injuries on the body and opined that the cause of death was\ncomplications arising from burns.\n\n23. PW.5 acted as a mediator during the inquest held over the dead body of\nthe deceased, and was also present at the time of observation of the scene of\noffence and the seizure of the saree, blouse, and plastic bottle (MOs.1 and 2)\nfrom the spot. According to the prosecution, the deceased stated before\nPWs.7 and 8 that she was unable to bear the harassment and torture inflicted\nby the accused, and therefore poured kerosene over her body and set her\nclothes on fire to end her life.\n\n24. Although PWs.1 and 2 testified that the deceased had borrowed\nRs.2,00,000/- from the accused and mortgaged her house as security, and\nthat the accused subsequently sold the said house, during cross-examination,\nboth witnesses admitted that they had no personal knowledge of those\ntransactions and that they were only informed about the mortgage by the\ndeceased. However, PW.2, the son of the deceased, categorically admitted in\ncross-examination that he had perused the document executed by his mother,\nand that the said deed was in fact a Sale-cum-General Power of Attorney. The\naccused produced a certified copy of an Agreement of Sale, along with a\nGeneral Power of Attorney dated 03.11.1999, for a consideration of\nRs.3,70,000/-. The document shows that the deceased sold her house to the\naccused on 03.11.1999 for Rs.3,70,000/-, executed a registered agreement of\nsale, and that her father, the husband of PW.1, attested the agreement. Once\n\n 10\n\nthis document establishes the execution of a registered sale agreement\ncoupled with a General Power of Attorney in favour of the accused by the\ndeceased, and in the absence of any supporting documentary evidence, the\nversion of PWs.1 and 2 that the deceased borrowed Rs.2,00,000/- from the\naccused and mortgaged her house towards security cannot be accepted. A\nplain reading of the document, as rightly observed by the Trial Court, clearly\nindicates that the accused had the right to sell the house property in terms of\nthe agreement of sale and the accompanying General Power of Attorney\nexecuted by the deceased.\n\n25. The defence produced documents, namely receipts issued by\nUshodaya Publications of Eenadu dated 30.05.2001, 19.10.2001, and\n09.06.2002, along with a certified copy of the registered sale deed dated\n06.03.2003. These documents show that the accused sold the house, which\nhe had purchased from the deceased, to one Bathini Sreenivasa Rao for\nRs.3,70,000/- on 06.03.2003, under a registered sale deed executed in\naccordance with the terms of the original agreement. It was further elicited\nduring the cross-examination of PWs.1 and 2 that the deceased, Venkata\nLakshmi, did not file any suit against the accused either in relation to the sale\nagreement executed by her or the subsequent sale deed executed by the\naccused pursuant to that agreement. These circumstances clearly show that\nthe deceased had no grievance regarding the sale transaction effected by the\naccused; otherwise, she could have questioned the transaction in accordance\nwith the law.\n\n26. The evidence on record establishes that the deceased, Venkata\nLakshmi, did not choose to question the transactions entered into between\nherself and the accused, nor the subsequent transactions made by the\naccused. Accordingly, the Trial Court rightly observed that, as the accused\nexecuted the sale deed pursuant to the General Power of Attorney granted by\nher, and in accordance with the terms of the agreement of sale, such conduct\nwould not amount to provoking or forcing the deceased to take the extreme\n\n 11\n\nstep of committing suicide, particularly on 29.03.2004. The Trial Court further\nnoted that the sale transaction had evidently taken place on 06.03.2003,\nleaving a time gap of more than one year between the two events.\n\n27. The Trial Court extensively referred to the inconsistencies between the\nstatements of PWs.1 and 2 and the dying declarations made by the deceased,\nVenkata Lakshmi, to PWs.7 and 8. In her statement recorded by PW.7, the\ndeceased stated that she had borrowed money from the accused and\nmortgaged her properties, and that the accused had obtained promissory\nnotes from her for amounts exceeding those actually borrowed. She further\nstated that he attempted to deprive her of her properties, and, unable to bear\nthe humiliation caused by him, she committed suicide to end her life. It is\npertinent to note that she did not mention to the Investigating Officer the\nexecution of the registered agreement of sale, or the sale of the property by\nthe accused pursuant to that agreement, nor did she refer to the newspaper\npublications made prior to the sale in the Eenadu daily. In contrast, in the\ndying declaration given to PW.8, the deceased stated that the accused had\nsold her house without her consent or knowledge, compelled her to pay\nmoney as demanded, came to her home in a drunken condition, insisted that\nshe should marry him, threatened to ruin the lives of her and her children, and\ncontinued to persecute her to marry him even though she had lodged a case\nagainst him.\n\n28. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that the Trial Court observed that\nneither the evidence of PW.1 nor PW.2 disclosed any consistent instance of\nthe accused harassing or torturing the deceased to marry him, either at the\ntime of the incident or proximate to the date of her suicide. Furthermore, the\nstatement given by the deceased to PW.7 did not contain any allegation that\nthe accused demanded her to marry him. Consequently, the Trial Court rightly\nentertained doubt regarding the credibility of the version put forth by the\ndeceased in her statement to PW.8 on this aspect.\n\n 12\n\n29. Another inconsistency noted by the Trial Court is that, in her statement\nto PW.7, the deceased alleged that the accused had taken promissory notes\nfrom her for amounts exceeding the sums actually borrowed, with the intention\nof depriving her of her property. In contrast, in her statement before PW.8,\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class, the deceased stated that the accused\ndemanded repayment of the amounts claimed by him towards the discharge\nof debts. PWs.1 and 2, however, did not depose that the accused had\nobtained promissory notes from the deceased for amounts more than those\nactually borrowed, or that he pressurized her to pay such amounts. Although\nPW.1 stated during cross-examination that the accused had obtained her\nthumb impressions on ten blank promissory notes, her evidence did not\nestablish that the accused had obtained any promissory notes from the\ndeceased.\n\n30. The accused produced a certified copy of a promissory note dated\n31.12.1999, along with the certified copy of the award passed before the Lok\nAdalat in O.S.No.1117 of 2002 on the file of the I Additional Junior Civil Judge,\nGuntur. These documents reveal that the deceased borrowed Rs.50,000/-\nfrom the accused on 31.12.1999 for her family needs and executed a\npromissory note in his favour, agreeing to repay the said amount with interest\nat 24% per annum. As she failed to discharge the debt, the accused filed\nO.S.No.1117 of 2002, and subsequently, the matter was compromised before\nthe Lok Adalat, where the deceased paid Rs.50,000/- to the accused towards\nfull and final settlement of the claim, and an award was passed in terms of the\ncompromise. In view of the settlement reached before the Lok Adalat, it\ncannot be said that the claim made by the accused was unsupported by\nconsideration. Had PW.1 not borrowed any amount from the accused, there\nwould have been no occasion for her to repay any amount before the Lok\nAdalat.\n\n31. As already observed, the evidence of PWs.1 and 2 does not establish\nthat the accused obtained promissory notes from the deceased. In these\n\n 13\n\ncircumstances, the Trial Court rightly held that it is not justifiable to conclude\nthat the conduct of the accused in relation to the money transactions \nreferred\nto above\n amounted to instigation or abetment to commit suicide.\n\n32. PWs.1 and 2 testified that the accused took two shop rooms from the\ndeceased on lease but failed to pay rent regularly and harassed her. However,\nPW.1 admitted during cross-examination that the accused had paid\nRs.60,000/- as advance rent and that she and her daughter, the deceased,\nhad executed a lease agreement in his favour for a period of ten years. She\nfurther confirmed that the shops were leased out for business purposes and\nthat the accused had paid a total of Rs.1,00,000/- towards rent.\n\n33. In support of his defence, the accused produced a certified copy of the\nregistered lease deed dated 09.05.2001 and a copy of the agreement dated\n15.05.2001. These documents show that the deceased, Venkata Lakshmi,\nand her mother had leased out their shops to the accused upon receiving a\nsum of Rs.1,00,000/- as rent. In view of the admissions made during the\ncross-examination of PWs.1 and 2, coupled with the registered lease deed\nand the agreement \nreferred to above\n, the allegation of PWs.1 and 2 that the\naccused failed to pay rent regularly and harassed or abetted the deceased to\ncommit suicide is rendered untenable. On the contrary, as rightly observed by\nthe Trial Court, the statement of the deceased recorded by PWs.7 and 8 does\nnot indicate that the accused failed to pay rent regularly or caused her any\ntrouble leading to her suicide. Had there been any truth in the version put\nforward by PWs.1 and 2, the deceased would not have omitted to mention\nsuch facts before PW.7 or PW.8.\n\n34. As already noted, in her statement before PW.7, the deceased did not\nstate that the accused had asked her to marry him, that she refused, or that\nhe thereafter harassed, tortured, or threatened to ruin the lives of her children.\nInstead, she stated that she had borrowed money from the accused,\nmortgaged her properties, and that the accused had taken promissory notes\n\n 14\n\nfor amounts exceeding the sums actually lent. She further stated that, being\nunable to bear the hardship caused by his actions, she attempted to commit\nsuicide. Whereas, in the dying declaration made before PW.8, the deceased is\nsaid to have stated that the accused sold her house without her consent or\nknowledge, compelled her to pay the amounts he demanded, came to her\nhome in a drunken state, asked her to marry him, and threatened to ruin her\nchildren's lives. Taking these inconsistent versions into account, the Trial\nCourt expressed doubt that the dying declarations were the result of tutoring\nor prompting, or the product of imagination.\n\n35. The Trial Court noted that PW.1 testified in cross-examination that the\naccused had harassed the deceased only two or three years prior to her\ndeath. Similarly, PW.2 stated that the accused had harassed his mother under\nthe influence of alcohol, and that she had lodged a complaint with the police,\nwith PW.2 accompanying her to the police station. He further stated that this\nincident occurred about one year before her death. Thus, the evidence of\nPWs.1 and 2 does not indicate that the accused harassed or tortured the\ndeceased immediately before her suicide or within a period proximate to its\noccurrence.\n\n36. \nIn \nRajesh V. State of Haryana\n 7 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court after\nreferring to \nSections 306\n and \n107\n of the IPC held as follows:\n\n 9. Conviction under \nSection 306\n IPC is not sustainable on the allegation\n of harassment without there being any positive action proximate to the time\n of occurrence on the part of the accused, which led or compelled the\n person to commit suicide. In order to bring a case within the purview of\n \nSection 306\n IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in the commission of\n the said offence, the person who is said to have abetted the commission of\n suicide must have played an active role by an act of instigation or by doing\n certain act to facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of\n abetment by the person charged with the said offence must be proved and\n established by the prosecution before he could be convicted under \nSection\n 306\n IPC.\n\n7\n\n (2020) 15 SCC 359\n\n 15\n\n37. The Trial Court also took into consideration the fact that the evidence of\nPWs.1 and 2 does not corroborate each other and is contrary to both the\nstatement of the deceased recorded by PW.7 and the dying declaration\nrecorded by PW.8. The testimony of PWs.1 and 2 indicates that the alleged\nharassment by the accused occurred either two to three years prior to the\ndeceased's death, as stated by PW.1, or one year prior to her death, as stated\nby PW.2. Further, the statement recorded by PW.7 does not disclose that the\naccused demanded the deceased to marry him. These inconsistencies create\ndoubt as to whether the deceased committed suicide due to instigation or\nabetment by the accused. Consequently, the Trial Court extended the benefit\nof doubt to the accused.\n\n38. Upon appreciation of the evidence on record, the Trial Court rightly\nconcluded that the alleged acts of the accused were not the proximate cause\nof the death of Venkata Lakshmi. Even if the version put forth by PWs.1 and 2\nis assumed to be accurate and correct, this Court is of the view that the\nquarrels that occurred between the accused and the deceased one to three\nyears prior to the suicide of the deceased cannot be taken into consideration\nto conclude that the suicide was a direct result of those quarrels.\n\n39. The Trial Court further observed that there is no indication in the\ntestimony of material witnesses implicating the accused in the offence. It\nfurther observed that the conduct of the accused towards the deceased prior\nto her death was not of such a nature as to drive her to commit suicide on\n29.03.2004. Thus, the evidence on record does not conclusively establish the\ncircumstances that led the deceased to take the extreme step of ending her\nlife. Taking these facts into consideration, the Trial Court concluded that their\nevidence lacked rationality.\n\n40. Upon a careful consideration of the facts and evidence recorded by the\nTrial Court, as well as the legal principles established through statutory\nprovisions and judicial precedents, this Court is of the view that no proximate\n\n 16\n\nlink has been established between the accused and the commission of suicide\nby the deceased. The prosecution has failed to produce any evidence\nsubstantiating the allegations against the accused. The material on record\ndoes not demonstrate any act of goading, solicitation, or insinuation by the\naccused that could have prompted the deceased to take the extreme step.\nThere is nothing to suggest that the accused played an active role or\ncommitted any positive or direct act amounting to instigation, aiding, or\nabetment of suicide. The Trial Court also observed inconsistencies in the\nprosecution's evidence, further undermining the reliability of the version\npresented. In these circumstances, and upon a comprehensive evaluation of\nthe entire evidentiary record, the Trial Court correctly concluded that the\nprosecution had failed to prove the charge of abetment of suicide under\n\nSection 306\n of the IPC. Consequently, the Trial Court acquitted the accused of\nthe said charge.\n\n41. In a criminal case, the degree of proof is the standard that is required in\ncivil proceedings, and if there is the slightest doubt in the mind of the Court\nregarding the involvement of the accused person, then the Court should not\nconvict the accused person with such a doubt. Rather, it would be proper for\nthe Court to pass a judgment of acquittal in favour of the accused. When Trial\nCourt after adequate appreciation of the evidence of witnesses passed a\njudgment of the acquittal, it would not be appropriate for the Appellate Court to\ndisturb \nthe said judgment\n, unless \nthe said judgment\n of acquittal is\nunreasonable, even if two views are possible, then also, the Appellate Court\nshould not disturb \nthe said judgment\n, instead, the Court should upheld the\nview favoured the accused.\n\n42. It is a cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that in an acquittal\nappeal, if another view is possible, then also the Appellate Court cannot\nsubstitute its view by reversing the acquittal into a conviction unless the\nfindings of the Trial Court are perverse, contrary to the material on record,\npalpably wrong, manifestly erroneous or demonstrably unsustainable.\n\n 17\n\n43. \nIn \nMohan @ Srinivas @ Seena @ Tailor Seena V. State of\nKarnataka8\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed the scope of \nsection\n378\n of the Code as under:\n\n \"\nSection 378\n Cr.P.C. enables the State to prefer an appeal against an order\n of acquittal. \nSection 384\n Cr.P.C., speaks of the powers that can be\n exercised by the appellate court. When the trial court renders its decision by\n acquitting the accused, the presumption of innocence gathers strength\n before the appellate court. Consequently, the onus on the prosecution\n becomes more burdensome as there is a double presumption of innocence.\n Certainly, the court of the first instance has its advantages in delivering its\n verdict, which is to see the witnesses in person while they depose. The\n appellate court is expected to involve itself in a deeper, studied scrutiny of\n not only the evidence before it. Still, it is duty bound to satisfy itself whether\n the decision of the trial court is both a possible and plausible view. When\n two views are possible, the one taken by the trial court in a case of acquittal\n is to be followed on the touchstone of liberty and the advantage of having\n seen the witnesses.\n\n44. So far as the main issue is concerned, that scope of acquittal appeal is\nwell defined by now by series of decisions and the same is not to be repeated\ntime and again, however, one of the recent decision in case of \nHarbeer Singh\nV. Sheeshpal\n 9 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down that mere fact that\nanother view could also have been possible that cannot be a ground to\nreverse the acquittal. The powers of High Court are wide enough to turtle the\nacquittal order, however, some parameters are well defined by series of\ndecisions in which this Court is of the considered opinion that State has not\nmade out any case which would permit this Court to exercise such wide\npowers. Neither any material irregularity is pointed out nor any perversity is\nreflecting on the contrary it is reflecting that there is an application of mind on\nthe part of learned Judge as the entire material on record has been dealt with\nspecifically and the principle of appreciation of evidence appears to have been\nrightly undertaken by the Court below and therefore when such eventuality is\nreflecting sitting in a jurisdiction dealing with an order of acquittal Court is of\nthe opinion not to interfere with such exercise. The relevant observations of\n\n8\n\n 2021 (15) SCALE Pg. 184\n\n9\n\n (2017) CriLJ 169\n\n 18\n\nthe aforesaid decision in paras:10 and 11 (Cri.L.J.) are reproduced herein\nafter:\n\n \"10. The above principle has been reiterated by this court in a number of\n judicial decisions and the position of law that emerges from a\n comprehensive survey of these cases is that in an appeal under \nArticle 136\n\n of the Constitution of India, this court will not interfere with the judgment of\n the High Court unless the same is clearly unreasonable or perverse or\n mainfestly illegal or grossly unjust. The mere fact that another view could\n also have been taken on the evidence on record is not a ground for\n reversing an order of acquittal.\n\n 11. It is a cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that the guilt of the\n accused must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The burden of\n proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt lies with the prosecution, and\n it never shifts. Another golden thread that runs through the web of\n administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible\n on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the\n accused and the other to his innocence, the view that is favourable to the\n accused should be adopted.\n\n45. Considering the aforesaid set of circumstances and in view of the\nconjoint reading of the conclusion arrived at in co-relation with the evidence on\nrecord, this Court is of the considered opinion that the prosecution makes out\nno case to establish a definite guilt of the respondent / accused.\n\n46. It is a settled principle of law that if the Trial Court takes the view, it\nshould not be reversed, even if another view is possible. The view taken by\nthe Trial Court is a plausible one. Therefore, considering the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, this Court is not inclined to reverse the Trial\nCourt's finding.\n\n47. The Trial Court rightly reached its conclusion, providing sound and\njustifiable reasons. Therefore, the appellant's request for interference lacks\nmerit. A re-appreciation of the evidence reveals no misdirection or\nmisinterpretation by the Trial Court. Upon careful reconsideration, there is no\nflaw in the findings of fact by the Trial Court. Therefore, the acquittal of the\nrespondent/accused cannot be interfered with. Accordingly, the appeal against\nthe acquittal is dismissed, and the judgment of acquittal is confirmed, and\n\n 19\n\nthere is no reason to interfere with the judgment of the Trial Court.\nAccordingly, the point is answered.\n\n48. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present\nCriminal Appeal No.1675 of 2009 fails and the same deserves to be dismissed\nand is dismissed, accordingly. The judgment and order of acquittal passed by\nthe learned II Additional Senior Civil Judge-cum-Assistant Sessions Judge,\nFast Track Court, Guntur, in Sessions Case No.423 of 2004, dated\n29.04.2008, stands confirmed.\n\n Interim orders, if any, granted earlier shall stand vacated, and all\npending miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed.\n\n _____________________________\n JUSTICE T.

When the trial court renders its decision by\n acquitting the accused, the presumption of innocence gathers strength\n before the appellate court. Consequently, the onus on the prosecution\n becomes more burdensome as there is a double presumption of innocence.\n Certainly, the court of the first instance has its advantages in delivering its\n verdict, which is to see the witnesses in person while they depose. The\n appellate court is expected to involve itself in a deeper, studied scrutiny of\n not only the evidence before it. Still, it is duty bound to satisfy itself whether\n the decision of the trial court is both a possible and plausible view. When\n two views are possible, the one taken by the trial court in a case of acquittal\n is to be followed on the touchstone of liberty and the advantage of having\n seen the witnesses."

Sheeshpal\n 9 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down that mere fact that\nanother view could also have been possible that cannot be a ground to\nreverse the acquittal. The powers of High Court are wide enough to turtle the\nacquittal order, however, some parameters are well defined by series of\ndecisions in which this Court is of the considered opinion that State has not\nmade out any case which would permit this Court to exercise such wide\npowers. Neither any material irregularity is pointed out nor any perversity is\nreflecting on the contrary it is reflecting that there is an application of mind on\nthe part of learned Judge as the entire material on record has been dealt with\nspecifically and the principle of appreciation of evidence appears to have been\nrightly undertaken by the Court below and therefore when such eventuality is\nreflecting sitting in a jurisdiction dealing with an order of acquittal Court is of\nthe opinion not to interfere with such exercise.
