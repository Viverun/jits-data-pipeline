Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\n\nDigitally signed by R\n\nNatarajan\n\nDate: 2023.04.10\n\n16:38:21 IST\n\nReason:\n\nimpugned judgment and order dated\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 1 of 44\n\n23.02.2022 passed by the High Court of\nKarnataka, at Kalaburagi in Misc. First Appeal\nNo.201018/2018 by which the High Court has\ndismissed the said appeal and has confirmed\nthe order dated 02.04.2018 passed by the\nlearned III Additional District & Sessions\nJudge, Vijayapur (hereinafter referred to as\n“trial Court”) in rejecting the application for\ncondonation of delay caused in preferring the\napplication under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred\nto as “\nArbitration Act\n”) , the original applicant\nhas preferred the present appeal.\n\n2. The brief facts leading to filing of the present\nappeal in nut­shell are as under:\n\n2.1 That, an arbitral award was passed against the\nappellant under the provisions of the\n\nArbitration Act\non 24.08.2016. As per Section\n34(3) of the Arbitration Act, 90 days are\nprescribed for preferring an application under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act against the\narbitral award. However, the said period was\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 2 of 44\n\nextendable by a further period of 30 days in\nterms of the proviso to\nSection 34(3)\nof the Act,\n2016. In the present case, the period of 90\ndays prescribed under\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act expired on 24.11.2016. The\nappellant was entitled to a further extended\nperiod of 30 days from 23.11.2016 onwards in\nterms of the proviso to\nSection 34(3)\nwhich was\nupto 24.12.2016.\n\n2.2 The trial Courts were closed on account of\nwinter / Christmas vacations from 19.12.2016\nto 01.01.2017. However, it so happened that\nextendable / condonable period of 30 days as\ncontemplated in the proviso to\nSection 34(3)\n\nexpired on 24.12.2016 on which day the trial\nCourt was closed on account of winter /\nChristmas vacation. The appellant herein filed\nthe application under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act, challenging the award passed\nby the Arbitral Tribunal. The appellant also\nfiled IA No.1 for condonation of delay. Both,\n\nSection 34\napplication as well as the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 3 of 44\n\napplication for condonation of delay were filed\non the reopening day i.e. on 02.01.2017. As\nthe application under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act was beyond the prescribed\nperiod of provided under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act as well as beyond the\ncondonable period of 30 days, the learned trial\nCourt dismissed the IA No.1 and refused to\ncondone the delay by observing that the period\nbeyond 120 days is not condonable as under\n\nthe\nArbitration Act\n, maximum period provided\nfor preferring an application under\nSection 34\n\nis 120 days. At this stage it is required to be\nnoted that in the affidavit filed by the appellant\nbefore the High Court, filed in support of IA\nNo.1, the appellant as such admitted that it\nreceived the copy of the award on 24.08.2016.\nHowever, according to the appellant, the said\naward was misplaced and thereafter obtained a\nfresh copy on 29.12.2016. The learned trial\nCourt observed that in that view of the matter,\nthe period of limitation would commence from\n24.08.2016 and 120 days are to be counted\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 4 of 44\n\nfrom 24.08.2016.\n\n2.3 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\norder passed by the learned trial Court\nrefusing to condone the delay in preferring\napplication under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\nAct, the appellant herein preferred an appeal\nbefore the High Court.\n\n2.4 Before the High Court,\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation Act, 1963 and\nSection 10\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897 were pressed into\nservice. By the impugned judgment and order\nthe High Court has dismissed the said appeal\nby observing that the expression “prescribed\nperiod” appearing in\nSection 4\nof the Limitation\nAct cannot be construed to mean anything\nother than the period of limitation and\ntherefore, any period beyond the prescribed\nperiod, during which the Court or Tribunal has\nthe discretion to allow a person to institute the\nproceeding, cannot be taken to be “prescribed\nperiod”.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 5 of 44\n\n2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the\nHigh Court, the original applicant has\npreferred the present appeal.\n\n3. Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Senior Advocate\nhas appeared on behalf of the appellant and\nShri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate\nhas appeared on behalf of the contesting\nrespondent.\n\n4. Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Counsel has\nsubmitted that\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration\nAct specifies that the limitation period for filing\nan application for setting aside the arbitral\naward under\nSection 34\nis three months from\nthe date on which the party making application\nhas received the award. However, if the Court\nis satisfied that the applicant was prevented by\nsufficient cause from making the application\nwithin the said period of three months, the\nproviso to the Section specifies a further period\nof 30 days within which the application under\n\nSection 34\nmay be filed/entertained.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 6 of 44\n\n4.1 It is submitted that the central question in the\npresent petition is whether when the last day\nof condonable period of 30 days falls on a\nholiday or during a court vacation, would the\nbenefit of\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses\nAct, 1897 would be available to the appellant?\n\n4.2 It is submitted that in other words, can the\npetitioner – appellant file the application on the\nnext date when the Court reopens, in line with\nthe settled principle that the law does not\ncompel a person to do an impossible act. It is\nsubmitted that in the present case the\npetitioner – appellant had filed the application\nunder\nSection 34\non the very day when the\nCourt reopened.\n\n4.3 It is submitted by Shri Shyam Diwan, learned\nSenior Counsel that not extending the benefit\nof\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act to the\nappellant in such circumstances leads to an\nanomalous situation wherein the benefit of\nstatutorily prescribed condonable period is cut\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 7 of 44\n\nshort for some persons due to intervention of a\nholiday or a court vacation, while being fully\navailable to other persons due to the fortuitous\ncircumstance of no court vacation intervening.\n\nIt is submitted that this creates uncertainty\nand unpredictability in the application of\nprovision in question.\n\n4.4 It is submitted that the present case reflects an\nanomalous situation where\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation Act, which only deals with the\nperiod of limitation prescribed under the\n\nLimitation Act\n, leaves a vacuum as far as\nstatutory condonable period is concerned. It is\nsubmitted that the judgment in the case of\n\nAssam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage\nBoard vs. Subash Projects and Marketing\nLimited\nreported in (2012) 2 SCC 624 failed\nto take into account that in the case of such\nstatutory condonable periods,\nSection 10\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897, which is much\nwider in its import and applicability, and\nembodies the same legal principle, must\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 8 of 44\n\nnecessarily step in to fill the vacuum.\n\n4.5 It is submitted that while passing the\nimpugned judgment and order, the High Court\nhas heavily relied upon the decision of this\nCourt in the case of\nAssam Urban\n(Supra)\nwhile holding that the term “prescribed period”\nreferred to in\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act,\n1963 only includes the limitation period and\nnot the 30­day condonable / grace period.\n\nIt is\nsubmitted that however the case of\nAssam\nUrban\n(Supra) does not notice or deal with\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897. It\nonly notices and deals with\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation Act, 1963 and holds that the term\n“prescribed period” mentioned in\nSection 4\n\nmeans the period of limitation.\n\nIt is submitted\nthat the judgment in the case of\nAssam Urban\n\n(Supra) fails to notice that\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation Act, 1963 which deals with the\nperiod of limitation prescribed under the\n\nLimitation Act, 1963\n, leaves a vacuum as far\nas the statutory condonable period is\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 9 of 44\n\nconcerned.\n\n4.6 It is submitted that in failing to notice\nSection\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897, the\njudgment in the case of\nAssam Urban\n(Supra)\ndisregards the principle embodied in the\n\nGeneral Clauses Act\nwhich is much wider in its\nimport and applicability and must necessarily\nstep in to fill the vacuum left by\nSection 4\nof\nthe Limitation Act.\n\n4.7 It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned\nSenior Counsel appearing for the appellant\nthat although the same general principle of\n“elementary justice” is embodied in both\nSections of the two Acts, there is a crucial\ndistinction between the\nLimitation Act, 1963\n\nand the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n.\n\n4.8 It is submitted that\nSection 2(j)\nof the\nLimitation Act defines “period of limitation”. It\nis submitted that thus, while the term\n“prescribed period” has a narrower meaning in\nthe context of\nLimitation Act\n, there is no such\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 10 of 44\n\nrestrictive definition clause in the\nGeneral\nClauses Act\n. It is submitted that in fact, the\nscheme of\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses\nAct is clear from a bare perusal of the provision\nand indicates that there are two prescribed\nperiods in this Section viz. (1) the prescribed\nperiod within which something is directed to be\ndone, or (2) the prescribed period within which\nsomething is allowed to be done.\n\n4.9 It is submitted that therefore, reading of\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897\nmakes it clear that the period in which\nsomething is allowed to be done, such as 30\ndays condonable period provided by proviso to\n\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act is also a\nprescribed period within the meaning of the\n\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n.\n\n4.10 It is further submitted by Shri Shyam Diwan,\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe appellant that the principle embodied in\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897 is\nan elementary piece of justice. It is submitted\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 11 of 44\n\nthat the 60th Law Commission Report on the\nGeneral Clauses Act reiterated the\nparliamentary intention behind the Act and the\nprovision, which is to deliver elementary\njustice.\n\n4.11 It is submitted that in the case of\nHUDA &\nAnr. vs. Dr. Babeswar Kanhar & Anr.\n\nreported in (2005) 1 SCC 191, this Court has\nobserved and held that every consideration of\njustice and expediency would require that the\naccepted principle which underlines\nSection 10\n\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897 should be\napplied in cases where it does not otherwise in\nterms apply. It is observed that the principles\nunderlying are lex non cogit ad impossibilia (law\ndoes not compel a man to do the impossible)\nand actus curiae neminem gravabit (the act of\ncourt shall prejudice no man).\n\nIt is submitted\nthat in the case of\nManohar Joshi vs. Nitin\nBhaurao Patil and Ors.\nreported in (1996) 1\nSCC 169, it is observed and held by this Court\nthat the litigant has a right to avail limitation\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 12 of 44\n\nup to the last day and his only obligation is to\nexplain his inability to present the suit /\npetition on the last day of limitation and each\nday thereafter till it is actually presented.\n\n4.12 It is further submitted that if as held in the\ncase of\nAssam Urban\n(Supra), the benefit of\n\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act is only available\nfor the period of limitation and is not available\nfor the statutorily granted condonable period.\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897\nmust step in to fill the vacuum. It is submitted\nthat any contrary view would deny individuals\nthe full play of the statutory period of 30 days\nfor condonation of delay.\n\n4.13 Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the\nrespondent that present proceeding is “any Act\nor proceeding to which the\nLimitation Act\n\napplies” is a misconceived argument is\nconcerned, it is submitted that the\nrespondents have sought to rely on proviso to\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897.\nRelying upon Section 43(1) of the Arbitration\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 13 of 44\n\nAct to contend that the\nLimitation Act\napplies\nto the present proceedings, it is submitted that\n\nSection 43(1)\nof the Arbitration Act merely\nstates that “the\nLimitation Act, 1963\nshall\napply to arbitrations as it applies to\nproceedings in Court”. It is submitted that this\ncannot be interpreted to mean that the\n\nLimitation Act\n, in its entirety applies to\nproceeding under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\nAct and that the present proceedings are an\nact or proceeding to which the\nLimitation Act\n\napplies. It is submitted that in fact, in matters\nof limitation,\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\nis a complete code. It is submitted that the\nrespondent’s entire case, on one hand, is that\nthe benefit of\nLimitation Act\n, particularly\n\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act, cannot be given\nto the condonable period in the instant case. It\nis submitted that therefore on one hand, the\nrespondent is arguing that the benefit of\n\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act, as well as\n\nSection 5\nof the Limitation Act has no\napplication to the condonable period under\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 14 of 44\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act, i.e. the\n\nLimitation Act\nhas no application in the\npresent proceedings, at the same time, the\nrespondent is contending that the benefit of\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897\ncannot be given to the appellant, as the\npresent proceeding falls within the ambit of the\nphrase “any act or proceeding to which the\nIndian Limitation Act, 1877, applies”.\n\n4.14 It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned\nSenior Counsel that the reliance placed on the\ncase of\nSagufa Ahmed & Ors. vs. Upper\nAssam Polywood Products Private Limited\nand Others\nreported in (2021) 2 SCC 317 is\nmisconceived for the following two reasons:\n\n(1) The reference to\nSection 10\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897 in the case of\nSagufa\nAhmed\n(Supra) is tangential at best;\n(2) The facts of\nSagufa Ahmed\n(Supra) are\nclearly distinguishable from the case at\nhand. In that case, the appellants had\nwaited 5 months after the discretionary\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 15 of 44\n\nperiod had expired to file an appeal against\nthe order of the Ld. NCLT. In the present\ncase, there was no undue delay on the part\nof the Petitioner ­ appellant herein. The\npetitioner ­ appellant filed the petition under\nSection 34 of the very day of the reopening\nof the Ld. Court.\n\n4.15 It is submitted that this Court in its order\ndated 08.03.2021 in suo moto Writ Petition\n(Civil) No.3/2020, has put a quietus to the\nartificial distinction between the ‘limitation\nperiod’ and ‘grace period’, wherein it extended\nthe benefit of exemption due to COVID 19 to\nthe limitation period as well as the condonable\nperiod.\n\n4.16 It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned\nSenior Counsel that the aim and object of the\nlimitation period and statutory grace period /\ncondonable period provided in the\nArbitration\nAct\nis to ensure that parties who sleep over\ntheir rights and come to the court belatedly are\nnot allowed to upset the apple cart. It is\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 16 of 44\n\nsubmitted that in the present instance, the\nappellant has been nothing but diligent and\napproached the learned trial Court on the very\nday of reopening. It is submitted that\nSection\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897 has been\nenacted to address precisely this kind of a\nsituation and merely because the benefit of\n\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act, 1963 is\nunavailable in a case, should not ipso facto\nexclude the application of the\nGeneral Clauses\nAct, 1897\n.\n\n4.17 It is submitted that the appellant is an\nagriculturists’ society, and despite having\nsuffered losses due to non­fulfillment of their\nobligations by the respondent, the appellant’s\ncase has never been heard on merits. It is\nsubmitted that therefore non­suiting the\nappellant in the present instance and denying\nthe benefit of\nSection 10\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897 (with the elementary rule of\njustice captured in it) will cause a grave\nmiscarriage of justice.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 17 of 44\n\nMaking above submissions, it is prayed to\nset aside the order passed by the learned trial\nCourt as well as the High Court and to\ncondone the delay caused in preferring\napplication under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\nAct and to direct the learned trial Court to hear\nthe application under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act on merits by giving the\nappellant an opportunity to put forth its case\non merits.\n\n5. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri\nDhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing on behalf of the respondent.\n\n5.1 It is submitted that in the present case the\nappellant admittedly received the award on\n24.08.2016. As per\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act, “the prescribed period” of 3\nmonths to challenge the award expired on\n24.11.2016 and further period of 30 days\nunder the proviso to\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act expired on 24.12.2016. That,\nthe learned trial Court was on winter vacation\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 18 of 44\n\nbetween 19.12.2016 to 01.01.2017. The\nappellant preferred its\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act before the learned trial Court\non 02.01.2017 i.e. on the day of reopening,\naccompanied by an application seeking\ncondonation of delay. It is submitted that the\nlearned trial Court after considering both, the\nmaintainability and merits of the appellant’s\napplication for condonation, has found that the\napplication was not maintainable and also that\nno sufficient cause had been shown by the\nappellant. It is submitted that the High Court\nhas upheld the order of trial Court that the\npetition under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act\nwas not maintainable for being beyond the\n“prescribed period” under\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act. It is submitted that therefore\nthe following questions arise for consideration\nin the present case.\n\n(1)Whether the benefit of\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation Act, 1963 is available to a party\nwhen the “prescribed period” of 3 months for\nfiling a petition under Section 34(3) of the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 19 of 44\n\nArbitration Act\nhas already expired and the\ndiscretionary period of 30 days under the\nproviso to Section 34(3) falls on a day when\nthe Court is closed?\n\n(2)Whether the benefit of\nSection 10\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act,1897 is separately\navailable to a party in such circumstances?\n\n5.2 Now, so far as the applicability of\nSection 4\nof\nthe Limitation Act is concerned, it is\nvehemently submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta,\nlearned Senior Counsel that\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation Act shall not be applicable to the 30\ndays’ discretionary condonable period\ncontemplated under proviso to\nSection 34(3)\nof\nthe Arbitration Act. It is submitted that\nSection\n34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act stipulates that an\napplication under\nSection 34(1)\nof the\nArbitration Act challenging an arbitral award\nmay not be made after a period of three\nmonths from the date on which the party\nmaking the application had received the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 20 of 44\n\narbitral award. The proviso to\nSection 34(3)\n\ngives limited powers to the Court, on sufficient\ncause being shown, to condone delay in filing\nthe application under\nSection 34(1)\nonly for a\nmaximum period of 30 days, but not\nthereafter. It is submitted that in the case of\n\nUnion of India v. Popular Construction Co.\n\nreported in (2001) 8 SCC 470 (Paras 10, 12,\n14 and 16), this Court has observed that\nusage of words “but not thereafter” in the\nproviso to\nSection 34(3)\namounts to an express\nexclusion within the meaning of\nSection 29(2)\n\nof the Limitation Act. Therefore, the Court\nwould have no discretion to condone the delay\nin excess of 30 days.\nSection 5\nof the\nLimitation Act was, therefore, held to be\ninapplicable to\nSection 34(1)\nof the Arbitration\nAct.\n\n5.3 It is submitted that\nSection 4\nof the Limitation\nAct is only applicable when the last date of the\n“prescribed period” falls on a day on which the\nCourt is closed. It is submitted that the term,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 21 of 44\n\n“prescribed period” is defined in\nSection 2(j)\nof\nthe Limitation Act as being the period of\nlimitation computed in accordance with the\nprovisions of the\nLimitation Act\n.\n\n5.4 It is submitted that this Court in the case of\n\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) (Paras 10 to 14) has\nheld that “prescribed period” under\nSection\n34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act is three months. It\nis submitted that “further period” of 30 days\nmentioned in the proviso to\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act cannot be said to be the “period\nof limitation” and therefore, would not be the\n“prescribed period” for the purposes of making\nan application for setting aside the arbitral\naward. It is submitted that thus, in\nthe said\ndecision\n, this Court has categorically held that\n\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act which applies\nonly to “prescribed period” is not attracted\nwhen the last date of the “further period” of 30\ndays mentioned in\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nLimitation Act falls on a day on which the\nCourt is closed.\n\nIt is submitted that the facts of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 22 of 44\n\nthe case in\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) are identical\nto the facts of the present case.\n\nIt is submitted\nthat decision of this Court in the case of\n\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) has been affirmed by\nThree Judges’ Bench of this Court in the case\nof\nSagufa Ahmed\n(Supra) (Paras 20 – 22).\n\n5.5 It is further submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta,\nlearned Senior Counsel that the correct\napplication of\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act\nwill result in a petition being entertained as a\nmatter of right, without a party having to seek\ncondonation of delay, since it applies only to\npetitions that would otherwise be within the\n“prescribed period” but its presentation within\nthis period has been prevented due to closure\nof the Court. However, on the other hand, this\ncannot apply to a delayed petition where, in\nany event, the right to present the petition is\nsubject sufficient cause being shown and\ncondonation of delay being sought.\n\n5.6 Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\nappellant that the judgment in the case of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 23 of 44\n\nSagufa Ahmed\n(Supra) is not a good law or is\ndistinguishable is concerned, it is submitted\nthat as such the decision in the case of\nSagufa\nAhmed\n(Supra) lays down the correct law and\nshall be applicable with full force on\ninterpretation of “to condone delay within\nfurther period”.\n\n5.7 It is submitted that the judgment in the case of\n\nSagufa Ahmed\n(Supra), in the context of\n\nSection 421(3)\nof the Companies Act, 2013,\nwhich provides a prescribed period of 45 days\nfor filing an appeal, and empowers the\nappellate Tribunal to condone the delay within\n“further period” not exceeding 45 days. A\nThree­Judges Bench of this Court rejected the\ncontention of the appellants therein that the\nbenefit of order of this Court dated 23.03.2020\nin Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In\nre, (2020) 19 SCC 10, is extendable to them, by\nholding that under the order dated\n23.03.2020, which was extended was only “the\nperiod of limitation” and not the period up to\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 24 of 44\n\nwhich delay can be condoned in exercise of\ndiscretion conferred by statute.\n\n5.8 It is submitted that thus, in the case of\nSagufa\nAhmed\n(Supra), this Court while affirming\n\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) has held that the\nexpression “prescribed period” appearing in\n\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act cannot be\nconstrued to mean anything other than the\nperiod of limitation. Any period beyond the\n“prescribed period” during which the Court or\nTribunal has the discretion to allow a person to\ninstitute the proceedings cannot be taken to be\n“prescribed period”.\n\n5.9 Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\nappellant that the judgment in the case of\n\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) has the effect of denying\nthe parties to right to file their application for\ncondonation in situation where the\ndiscretionary period expires during vacation\nand that such interpretation was incorrect\ninasmuch as it leaves parties at the mercy of\n“fortuitous circumstance”, it is submitted that\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 25 of 44\n\nsuch a submission is not tenable. It is\nsubmitted that the Court vacations are notified\nwell in advance and would not account to a\nfortuitous circumstance as alleged. It is\nsubmitted that on the date of receipt of award,\nthe party would be well aware of the limitation\nperiod under\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration\nAct and ought to diligently secure its right. It is\nsubmitted that in the present case, having\nreceived the award on 24.08.2016, the\nappellant had a further period of 25 days after\nexpiry of “prescribed period” and before\ncommencement of the winter vacation of the\ntrial Court. However, the petitioner ­ appellant\nchose not to file its petition during this time\nand therefore, as to suffer for the inevitable\nconsequences.\n\n5.10 It is further submitted that right under\nSection\nof the Arbitration Act is a restricted right to\nchallenge an award on extremely limited\nground. The proviso to\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act further excludes the general\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 26 of 44\n\npower of the Court under\nSection 5\nof the\nLimitation Act and imposes a strict timeline for\npresentation of a petition under Section 34. In\nsuch circumstances, acceptance of appellant’s\nargument will have the effect of providing an\nunduly enlarged time period (beyond the\nstatutory 30 day discretionary period) for\ndelayed presentation of a petition under\nSection 34, which would be contrary to the\nscheme and intent of the\nArbitration Act\n.\n\n5.11 Now, so far as the applicability of\nSection 10\nof\nthe General Clauses Act, 1897 as per the case\nof the appellant is concerned, it is vehemently\nsubmitted that as such the contention is\nuntenable in light of the proviso to\nSection 10\n\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897, which\nspecifically excludes the application of this\nsection to any Act or proceeding to which the\n\nIndian Limitation Act\napplies. It is submitted\nthat reference to 1877 Act will now have to be\nread as reference to\nLimitation Act, 1963\nin\nview of\nsection 8\nof the General Clauses Act,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 27 of 44\n\n1897. It is submitted that it is no longer res\nintegra that the\nLimitation Act, 1963\napplies to\narbitrations and court proceedings arising out\nof the arbitrations in light of\nSection 41(3)\nof\nthe Arbitration Act. Reliance is placed upon the\ndecision of this Court in the case of\nState of\nMaharashtra v. Borse Brothers Engineers\nand Contractors Pvt. Ltd.\nreported in (\n2021)\n6 SCC 460 and Consolidated Engineering\nEnterprises vs. Principal Secretary,\nIrrigation Department and Ors.\nreported in\n(2008) 7 SCC 169. It is submitted that\ntherefore in light of the application of the\n\nLimitation Act, 1963\napplicable to the\nproceedings under the\nArbitration Act\n(both in\nCourt and in arbitration),\nSection 10\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897 is specifically\nexcluded, and therefore, cannot be relied upon\nby the appellant.\n\n5.12 It is submitted that even otherwise this Court\nin the\nSagufa Ahmed\n(Supra) has held that\nthe principle forming the basis of\nSection 10(1)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 28 of 44\n\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\nalso finds a\nplace in\nSection 4\nof the Limitation Act.\nTherefore, when the benefit of\nSection 4\nof the\nArbitration Act is not available, the appellant\ncannot seek to take recourse to\nSection 10\nof\nthe General Clauses Act, 1897 which embodies\nthe same principle.\n\n5.13 It is further submitted that just like\nSection 4\n\nof the Limitation Act,\nSection 10\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897 also uses the term\n“prescribed period”.\nSection 10\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897 provides that where any act\nis directed to be done on a certain day, or any\nproceeding is allowed to be done in any Court\nor office within prescribed period, if the Court\nor office is closed on that certain day, or the\nlast day of the prescribed period, it may be\ndone or taken on the next working day.\nAccordingly, if\nSection 10\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897 was to be applicable, the\nterm “prescribed period” must be given the\nsame meaning as that in the\nLimitation Act\n.\nThus,\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 29 of 44\n\n1897 will also only then apply for the\nprescribed period of three months under\n\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act and not to\nthe discretionary period of 30 days under the\nproviso to\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nMaking above submissions and relying\nupon the decision of this Court in the case of\n\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) and\nSagufa Ahmed\n\n(Supra), it is prayed to dismiss the present\nappeal.\n\n6. Having heard learned Counsel appearing for\nthe respective parties, a short question which\nis posed for consideration of this Court is\nwhether in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase, the learned trial Court was justified in\nnot condoning the delay in preferring the\napplication under\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act, which was filed after the expiry\nof 120 days but filed on the first day of\nreopening after the winter / Christmas\nvacation and in a case where the condonable\nperiod of 30 days under Section 34(3) of the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 30 of 44\n\nArbitration Act\nhad fallen during the winter /\nChristmas vacation ? The question is with\nrespect to applicability of\nSection 4\nof the\nLimitation and\nSection 10\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897 in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\n\nTherefore, the central question in the\npresent appeal is whether when the last day of\ncondonable period of 30 days (under\nSection\n34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act) falls on holiday or\nduring the Court vacation, would the benefit of\n\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897 be\navailable?\n\n7. While considering the aforesaid issues/\nquestions,\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act is\nrequired to be referred to, which reads as\nunder:\n\n“34. Application for setting aside\narbitral award.­ (3) An application for\nsetting aside may not be made after\nthree months have elapsed from the\ndate on which the party making that\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 31 of 44\n\napplication had received the arbitral\naward or, if a request had been made\nunder section 33, from the date on\nwhich that request had been disposed\nof by the arbitral Tribunal:\n\nProvided that if the Court is\nsatisfied that the applicant was\nprevented by sufficient cause from\nmaking the application within the said\nperiod of three months it may entertain\nthe application within a further period\nof thirty days, but not thereafter.”\n\nThe relevant provisions of the\nIndian\nLimitation Act and the General Clauses Act,\nare also required to be referred to which\nare as under:\n\n“2.(j) ‘period of limitation’ (which)\nmeans the period of limitation\nprescribed for any suit, appeal or\napplication by the Schedule, and\n‘prescribed period’ means the period of\nlimitation computed in accordance with\nthe provisions of this Act;”\n\n“4. Expiry of prescribed period\nwhen court is closed.­ Where the\nprescribed period for any suit, appeal\nor application expires on a day when\nthe court is closed, the suit, appeal or\napplication may be instituted,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 32 of 44\n\npreferred or made on the day when the\ncourt reopens.\n\nExplanation.­ A court shall be\ndeemed to be closed on any day within\nthe meaning of this section if during\nany part of its normal working hours it\nremains closed on that day.”\n\n“\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act,\n10. Computation of time.­ (1) Where,\nby any 47 (Central Act) or Regulation\nmade after the commencement of this\nAct, any act or proceeding is directed\nor allowed to be done or taken in any\nCourt or office on a certain day or\nwithin a prescribed period, then, if the\nCourt or office is closed on that day or\nthe last day of the prescribed period,\nthe act or proceeding shall be\nconsidered as done or taken in due\ntime if it is done or taken on the next\nday afterwards on which the Court or\noffice is open:\n\nProvided that nothing in this\nsection shall apply to any act or\nproceeding to which the Indian\nLimitation Act, 1877, 48 applies.\n\n(2) This section applies also to\nall 49 (Central Acts) and Regulations\nmade on or after the fourteenth day of\nJanuary, 1887.”\n(emphasis supplied)”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 33 of 44\n\n7.1\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration Act and\n\nSections 2(j)\nand\nof the Limitation Act, 1963\nfell for consideration before this Court in the\ncase of\nAssam Urban\n(Supra).\n\nEven the very\nissue raised in the present appeal fell for\nconsideration before this Court in the case of\n\nAssam Urban\n(Supra). In the aforesaid\ndecision, this Court interpreted the aforesaid\nprovisions and has specifically observed and\nheld that the benefit of exclusion of period\nduring which Court is closed is available only\nwhen application for setting aside the award is\nfiled within ‘prescribed period of limitation’ and\nit is not available in respect of period\nextendable by the Court in exercise of its\ndiscretion.\n\nBy holding so, this Court\nconsidered the earlier decisions in the case of\n\nPopular Construction Co.\n(Supra) and\nState\nof Maharashtra vs. Hindustan Construction\nCo. Ltd.\nreported in (2010) 4 SCC 518 and\nhas observed and held in paragraphs 6 to 9 as\nunder:\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 34 of 44\n\n“6. Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act provides\nthat an application for setting aside an award\nmay be made within three months of the\nreceipt of the arbitral award. The proviso that\nfollows sub­section (3) of Section 34 provides\nthat on sufficient cause being shown, the\ncourt may entertain the application for\nsetting aside the award after the period of\nthree months and within a further period of\n30 days but not thereafter.\n\n7. In Popular Construction Co.1, this Court has\nheld that an application for setting aside an\naward filed beyond the period mentioned in\nSection 34(3) would not be an application \"in\naccordance with sub­section (3) as required\nunder Section 34(1) of the 1996 Act\" and\n\nSection 5\nof the 1963 Act has no application\nto such application. In para 12 of the Report,\nit was held in Popular Construction Co.1\nthus: (SCC pp.474­75)\n\"12. As far as the language of Section 34\nof the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial\nwords are \"but not thereafter\" used in\nthe proviso to sub­section (3). In our\nopinion, this phrase would amount to an\nexpress exclusion within the meaning of\n\nSection 29(2)\nof the Limitation Act, and\nwould therefore bar the application of\n\nSection 5\nof that Act. Parliament did not\nneed to go further. To hold that the court\ncould entertain an application to set\naside the award beyond the extended\nperiod under the proviso, would render\nthe phrase \"but not thereafter\" wholly\notiose. No principle of interpretation\nwould justify such a result\".\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 35 of 44\n\n8. Recently, in State of Maharashtra v.\n\nHindustan Construction Company Limited2, a\ntwo­Judge Bench of this Court speaking\nthrough one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.)\nemphasised the mandatory nature of the limit\nto the extension of the period provided in\nproviso to Section 34(3) and held that an\napplication for setting aside arbitral award\nunder Section 34 of the 1996 Act has to be\nmade within the time prescribed under sub­\nsection (3) of Section 34 i.e., within three\nmonths and a further period of 30 days on\nsufficient cause being shown and not\nthereafter.\n\n9. Section 43(1) of the 1996 Act provides that\nthe 1963 Act shall apply to arbitrations as it\napplies to proceedings in court. The 1963 Act\nis thus applicable to the matters of\narbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and\nexcept to the extent its applicability has been\nexcluded by virtue of the express provision\ncontained in Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.”\n\nBefore this Court there existed, similar facts\nlike in the present case. In the case before this\nCourt, the arbitral awards were received by the\nappellants on 26.08.2003. No application for\nsetting aside the arbitral award was made\nbefore elapse of three months from the receipt\nthereof. Three months from the date of receipt\nof the award expired on 26.11.2003. The\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 36 of 44\n\nDistrict Court had Christmas vacation for the\nperiod from 25.12.2003 to 01.01.2004. On\nreopening of the Court i.e. on 02.01.2004, the\nappellants made application for setting aside\nthe award under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration\nAct. Considering the aforesaid facts and\nthereafter considering\nSections 2(j)\nand\nof the\nIndian Limitation Act, 1963, this Court\nobserved and held and concluded in\nparagraphs 11 to 15 as under:\n\n“11. The question, therefore, that falls for\nour determination is ­ whether the\nappellants are entitled to extension of time\nunder\nSection 4\nof the 1963 Act in the\nabove facts?\n\n12.\nSection 4\nof the 1963 Act reads as\nunder :­\n\"4. Expiry of prescribed period\nwhen court is closed.­ Where the\nprescribed period for any suit,\nappeal or application expires on a\nday when the court is closed, the\nsuit, appeal or application may be\ninstituted, preferred or made on the\nday when the court reopens.\n\nExplanation.­ A court shall be\ndeemed to be closed on any day\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 37 of 44\n\nwithin the meaning of this section\nif during any part of its normal\nworking hours it remains closed on\nthat day.\"\n\nThe above Section enables a party to\ninstitute a suit, prefer an appeal or make an\napplication on the day court reopens where\nthe prescribed period for any suit, appeal or\napplication expires on the day when the\ncourt is closed.\n\n13. The crucial words in\nSection 4\nof the\n1963 Act are “prescribed period”. What is\nthe meaning of these words?\n\n14.\nSection 2(j)\nof the 1963 Act defines:\n\n“2(j) ‘period of limitation' [which] means the\nperiod of limitation prescribed for any suit,\nappeal or application by the Schedule, and\n'prescribed period' means the period of\nlimitation computed in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Act.”\n\nSection 2(j)\nof the 1963 Act when read in\nthe context of Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act,\nit becomes amply clear that the prescribed\nperiod for making an application for setting\naside an arbitral award is three months.\nThe period of 30 days mentioned in proviso\nthat follows sub­section (3) of Section 34 of\nthe 1996 Act is not the “period of limitation”\nand, therefore, not the “prescribed period”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 38 of 44\n\nfor the purposes of making the application\nfor setting aside the arbitral award. The\nperiod of 30 days beyond three months\nwhich the court may extend on sufficient\ncause being shown under the proviso\nappended to sub­section (3) of Section 34 of\nthe 1996 Act being not the “period of\nlimitation” or, in other words, the\n“prescribed period”, in our opinion,\nSection\nof the 1963 Act is not, at all, attracted to\nthe facts of the present case.\n\n15. Seen thus, the applications made by the\nappellants on 2­1­2004 for setting aside the\narbitral award dated 26­8­2003 were liable\nto be dismissed and have rightly been\ndismissed by the District Judge, Kamrup,\nGuwahati, as time­barred.”\n\nTherefore, as such the question involved\nin the present appeal is squarely answered\nagainst the appellant and the said issue is as\nsuch not res integra.\n\n8. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\nappellant that the\nLimitation Act\nshall not be\napplicable to the proceedings under the\n\nArbitration Act\nis concerned, the aforesaid has\nno substance.\nSection 43(1)\nof the Arbitration\nAct specifically provides that\nLimitation Act\n,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 39 of 44\n\n1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to\nproceeding in Court. However, as observed and\nheld by this Court in the case of\nAssam Urban\n\n(Supra),\nLimitation Act, 1963\nshall be\napplicable to the matters of arbitration covered\nby 1996 Act save and except to the extent its\napplicability has been excluded by virtue of\nexpress provision contained in\nSection 34(3)\nof\nthe Arbitration Act.\n\n8.1 In the case of Popular Construction Co.\n\n(Supra), when\nsection 5\nof the Limitation Act\nwas pressed into service to proceedings under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act for setting\naside the arbitral award, this Court has\nobserved that the\nArbitration Act\nbeing a\nspecial law and provides a period of limitation\ndifferent from that prescribed under the\n\nLimitation Act\n, the period of limitation\nprescribed under the\nArbitration Act\nshall\nprevail and shall be applicable and to that\nextent the\nLimitation Act\nshall be excluded.\nThat, thereafter, it is observed and held that\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 40 of 44\n\napplication challenging an award filed beyond\nperiod mentioned in\nSection 34(3)\nof the\nArbitration Act would not be an application “in\naccordance with” sub­section (3) as required\nunder\nSection 34(1)\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n8.2 In the case of\nHindustan Construction\nCompany Ltd.\n(Supra), in fact this Court has\nemphasized the mandatory nature of limit to\nthe extension of period provided in proviso to\nSection 34(3) and has held that an application\nfor setting aside an arbitral award under\n\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act has to be\nmade within time prescribed under sub­section\n(3) of Section 34 i.e. within three months and a\nfurther period of 30 days on sufficient cause\nbeing shown and not thereafter.\n\n9. Now, so far as reliance placed upon\nSection 10\n\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897 on behalf of\nthe appellant is concerned, at the outset it is\nrequired to be noted that such a contention is\nuntenable in light of the proviso to\nSection 10\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 41 of 44\n\nof the\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n, which\nspecifically excludes the application of\nSection\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897 to any act\nor proceeding to which the Indian Limitation\nAct, 1877 applies. Reference to 1877 Act will\nnow have to be read as reference to\nLimitation\nAct, 1963\nin view of\nSection 8\nof the General\nClauses Act, 1897. Therefore, in light of the\napplication of\nLimitation Act, 1963\nto the\nproceedings under the\nArbitration Act\nand\nwhen\nSection 10\nof the General Clauses Act,\n1897 specifically excludes the applicability of\n\nSection 10\nto any act or proceeding to which\n\nIndian Limitation Act, 1963\napplies and in\nlight of the definition of “period of limitation” as\ndefined under\nSection 2(j)\nread with\nSection 4\n\nof the Limitation Act and as observed and held\nby this Court in the case of\nAssam Urban\n\n(Supra), benefit of exclusion of period during\nwhich the Court is closed shall be available\nwhen the application for setting aside award is\nfiled within “prescribed period of limitation”\nand shall not be available in respect of period\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 42 of 44\n\nextendable by Court in exercise of its\ndiscretion.\n\n10. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon\nthe decision of this Court in the case of\nSridevi\nDatla vs. Union of India\nreported in (2021) 5\nSCC 321 relied upon on behalf of the appellant\nis concerned, at the outset it is required to be\nnoted that in\nthe said decision\n, this Court has\nnot noticed the decision in the case of\nAssam\nUrban\n(Supra) and there is no discussion on\ndistinction between “prescribed period” and the\n“discretionary condonable period”.\n\nOn the\nother hand, the binding decision of this Court\nin the case of\nAssam Urban\n(Supra) is directly\non point.\n\n11.\nIn view of the above and for the reasons stated\nabove, applying the law\nlaid down by\nthis\nCourt in the case of\nAssam Urban\n(Supra), it\ncannot be said that the High Court and the\nlearned III Additional District & Sessions\nJudge, Vijaypur have committed any error in\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 43 of 44\n\nrefusing to condone the delay caused in\npreferring application under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which\nwas beyond the period prescribed under\n\nSection 34(3)\nof the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996. Under the\ncircumstances, the present Appeal deserves to\nbe dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. In\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, there\nshall be no order as to costs.\n\n…………………………………J.\n(M. R.
