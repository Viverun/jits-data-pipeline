No. 9483 of 2008)\n\nAmalendu Pal @ Jhantu .... Appellant\n\nVersus\n\nState of West Bengal .... Respondent\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nDr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, J.\n\n1. Leave granted.\n\n2. In the present appeal, the appellant has challenged the\n\nlegality of the judgment and order dated 24.07.2008 passed\n\nby the Calcutta High Court. The appellant is aggrieved by\n\nthe aforesaid judgment and order as by the said judgment,\n\nthe High Court has upheld the order of conviction and\n\nsentence passed by the trial Court whereby the appellant\n\nwas sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three\n\nyears for the offence punishable under\nSection 498-A\nof\n\nthe Indian Penal Code (in short \"the\nIPC\n\") and for eight\n\nyears together with a fine of Rs 1000/- for the offence\n\npunishable under\nSection 306\nof the IPC with a default\n\nstipulation. The sentences awarded to the appellant were\n\ndirected to run concurrently.\n3. The facts necessary for the disposal of the present appeal\n\nand as presented by the prosecution may be set out at this\n\nstage. The appellant - Amalendu Pal @ Jhantu and the\n\ndeceased - Dipika were married in the year 1977. Out of\n\nthe said wedlock, two sons were born. The appellant was\n\nresiding in Calcutta in connection with his work and\n\nearning. During his stay in Calcutta, the appellant\n\ndeveloped an extra-marital relationship with one Jyotsna @\n\nAnita. The relationship between the appellant and said\n\nAnita became known to the deceased and the deceased\n\nobjected to such illegal relationship. The appellant\n\nsought permission of the deceased to marry said Anita,\n\nwhich was also refused by the deceased. Consequently, the\n\nappellant started torturing the deceased both physically\n\nand mentally.\n\n4. After a few days, the appellant again tried to take the\n\nconsent of the deceased for marrying said Anita and on\n\nrefusal of the deceased, physical and mental torture was\n\nperpetrated on the deceased. It was alleged that the\n\ndeceased was provoked by the appellant to end her life by\n\nconsuming poison or by hanging herself. It was also the\n\ncase that three months prior to the date of death of the\n\ndeceased, the appellant brought said Anita to his house.\n\nAnita was sporting a vermillion mark on her forehead and\n\nwas wearing conch bangles on her wrist to indicate that\nshe is married to the accused. It was also stated that in\n\nthe evening prior to the date of the death of the\n\ndeceased, the deceased was assaulted by Anita, the\n\nappellant and his family members. On the morning of\n\n27.09.1991, the deceased was found hanging from the\n\nceiling of the house of the appellant.\n\n5. Ashoka Kumar Maity (PW-7) intimated Supriyo Das, brother\n\nof the deceased (PW-2) about the death of the deceased.\n\nUpon receipt of the aforesaid information, PW-2 arrived at\n\nthe house of the appellant where he learnt about the\n\nentire incident from the villagers who had assembled at\n\nthe scene of occurrence. Thereafter, PW-2 proceeded to the\n\nContai Police Station and got a complaint registered. On\n\nthe strength of the complaint, First Information Report\n\n(in short \"the FIR\") under\nSections 498-A\nand\nIPC was\n\nlodged on 28.09.1991 at 20.30 hrs.\n\n6. After completion of the investigation, the police filed a\n\ncharge sheet against the appellant and seven other accused\n\npersons. On the basis of the aforesaid charge sheet, the\n\ntrial Court framed charges under\nSection 498A\nread with\n\nSection 34\nIPC and\nSection 306\nread with\nSection 34\nIPC\n\nagainst the appellant and seven other accused persons to\n\nwhich all of them pleaded not guilty and claimed to be\n\ntried.\n\n7. During the trial, a number of prosecution witnesses were\nexamined. The defence produced two witnesses in support\n\nof its case. On conclusion of the trial, the trial Court\n\nby its judgment and order dated 25.11.1997 convicted the\n\nappellant under\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC and sentenced\n\nthe appellant to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three\n\nyears and for eight years together with a fine of Rs\n\n1000/- respectively. All the other seven accused persons\n\nwere acquitted of the above stated charges framed against\n\nthem.\n\n8. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of conviction and\n\nsentence passed by the trial Court, the appellant herein\n\npreferred an appeal before the High Court. The State,\n\nhowever, did not prefer any appeal before the High Court\n\nagainst the order of acquittal recorded by the trial Court\n\nwith regard to the seven accused persons who were also\n\ncharged with the appellant for the aforesaid offences. The\n\nHigh Court entertained the said appeal and heard the\n\ncounsel appearing for the parties. On conclusion of the\n\narguments, the High Court passed a judgment and order\n\nupholding the order of conviction and affirming the\n\nsentence awarded to the appellant by the trial Court. The\n\nsaid order of conviction upheld by the High Court is under\n\nchallenge in this appeal.\n\n9. Mr. Pradip K. Ghosh, learned senior counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the appellant, very painstakingly argued the\nappeal before us. He submitted that in the absence of\n\ncogent and reliable evidence to establish abetment of\n\nsuicide by the appellant, the conviction of the appellant\n\nunder\nSection 306\ncould not be sustained and was bad in\n\nlaw. He further submitted that the High Court erred in\n\nconvicting the appellant under\nSection 306\nIPC as the High\n\nCourt failed to properly appreciate the evidence on\n\nrecord. He further strenuously submitted before us that\n\nthere was no evidence of infliction of torture upon the\n\ndeceased by the appellant immediately prior to the\n\nincident of suicide by the deceased and as such it could\n\nnot be said that the appellant had incited the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide.\n\n10.On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the respondent State supported the judgments of\n\nthe courts below.\n\n11.We have carefully considered the submissions made before\n\nus by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and\n\nperused the evidence available on record before us. On a\n\nclose and careful scrutiny of the oral evidence of the\n\nprosecution witnesses namely, PW-2, PW-4, PW-6, PW-7 and\n\nPW-9, we find that the appellant and the deceased had got\n\nmarried in the year 1977 and they had enjoyed a happy\n\nmarried life for 5-6 years from the date of their\n\nmarriage. The aforesaid prosecution witnesses have also\ncategorically stated in their testimony before the trial\n\nCourt that the problems between the appellant and the\n\ndeceased cropped up and their matrimonial life got\n\nstrained only after the appellant developed an extra-\n\nmarital relationship with one Jyotsna @ Anita during his\n\nstay in Calcutta and the said liaison between the\n\nappellant and the said Anita became known to the deceased.\n\nIt was only when the appellant was denied permission by\n\nthe deceased to marry said Anita that the appellant\n\nstarted torturing the deceased both mentally as well as\n\nphysically.\n\n12.At the outset, we intend to address the issue regarding\n\nthe applicability of\nSection 306\nIPC in the facts of the\n\npresent case.\nSection 306\ndeals with abetment of suicide\n\nand\nSection 107\ndeals with abetment of a thing. They read\n\nas follows:\n\n\"306. Abetment of suicide.--If any person commits\nsuicide, whoever abets the commission of such\nsuicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of\neither description for a term which may extend to\nten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n* * *\n107. Abetment of a thing.--A person abets the\ndoing of a thing, who--\n\nFirst.--Instigates any person to do that thing; or\nSecondly.--Engages with one or more other person\nor persons in any conspiracy for the doing of\nthat thing, if an act or illegal omission takes\nplace in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in\norder to the doing of that thing; or\nThirdly.--Intentionally aids, by any act or\nillegal omission, the doing of that thing.\n\nExplanation 1.--A person who, by wilful\nmisrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a\nmaterial fact which he is bound to disclose,\nvoluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to\ncause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to\ninstigate the doing of that thing.\n\n* * *\nExplanation 2.--Whoever, either prior to or at the\ntime of the commission of an act, does anything\nin order to facilitate the commission of that\nact, and thereby facilitates the commission\nthereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.\"\n\n13. The legal position as regards\nSections 306\nIPC which is\n\nlong settled was recently reiterated by this Court in the case\n\nof\nRandhir Singh v. State of Punjab\n(2004) 13 SCC 129 as\n\nfollows in paras 12 and 13:\n\n\"12. Abetment involves a mental process of\ninstigating a person or intentionally aiding that\nperson in doing of a thing. In cases of conspiracy\nalso it would involve that mental process of\nentering into conspiracy for the doing of that\nthing. More active role which can be described as\ninstigating or aiding the doing of a thing is\nrequired before a person can be said to be\nabetting the commission of offence under\nSection\nIPC.\n\n13.\nIn\nState of W.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal\nthis Court\nhas observed that the courts should be extremely\ncareful in assessing the facts and circumstances\nof each case and the evidence adduced in the trial\nfor the purpose of finding whether the cruelty\nmeted out to the victim had in fact induced her to\nend the life by committing suicide. If it\ntranspires to the court that a victim committing\nsuicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance,\ndiscord and differences in domestic life quite\ncommon to the society to which the victim belonged\nand such petulance, discord and differences were\nnot expected to induce a similarly circumstanced\nindividual in a given society to commit suicide,\nthe conscience of the court should not be\nsatisfied for basing a finding that the accused\ncharged of abetting the offence of suicide should\nbe found guilty.\"\n\n14. Further in the case of\nKishori Lal v. State of M.P.\n(2007) 10 SCC 797, this Court gave a clear exposition of\n\nSection 107\nIPC when it observed as follows in para 6:\n\n\"6.\nSection 107\nIPC defines abetment of a thing.\nThe offence of abetment is a separate and distinct\noffence provided in\nIPC\n. A person, abets the doing\nof a thing when (1) he instigates any person to do\nthat thing; or (2) engages with one or more other\npersons in any conspiracy for the doing of that\nthing; or (3) intentionally aids, by act or\nillegal omission, the doing of that thing. These\nthings are essential to complete abetment as a\ncrime. The word \"instigate\" literally means to\nprovoke, incite, urge on or bring about by\npersuasion to do any thing. The abetment may be by\ninstigation, conspiracy or intentional aid, as\nprovided in the three clauses of\nSection 107\n.\n\nSection 109\nprovides that if the act abetted is\ncommitted in consequence of abetment and there is\nno provision for the punishment of such abetment,\nthen the offender is to be punished with the\npunishment provided for the original offence.\n\"Abetted\" in\nSection 109\nmeans the specific\noffence abetted. Therefore, the offence for the\nabetment of which a person is charged with the\nabetment is normally linked with the proved\noffence.\"\n\n[See also\nKishangiri Mangalgiri Swami v. State of Gujarat\n\n(2009) 4 SCC 52]\n\n15. Thus, this Court has consistently taken the view that\n\nbefore holding an accused guilty of an offence under\nSection\nIPC, the Court must scrupulously examine the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case and also assess the evidence adduced\n\nbefore it in order to find out whether the cruelty and\n\nharassment meted out to the victim had left the victim with no\n\nother alternative but to put an end to her life. It is also to\n\nbe borne in mind that in cases of alleged abetment of suicide\nthere must be proof of direct or indirect acts of incitement to\n\nthe commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of\n\nharassment without their being any positive action proximate to\n\nthe time of occurrence on the part of the accused which led or\n\ncompelled the person to commit suicide, conviction in terms of\n\nSection 306\nIPC is not sustainable.\n\n16. In order to bring a case within the purview of\nSection\nof IPC there must be a case of suicide and in the\n\ncommission of the said offence, the person who is said to have\n\nabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active\n\nrole by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to\n\nfacilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of\n\nabetment by the person charged with the said offence must be\n\nproved and established by the prosecution before he could be\n\nconvicted under\nSection 306\nIPC.\n\n17. The expression `abetment' has been defined under\n\nSection 107\nIPC which we have already extracted above. A\n\nperson is said to abet the commission of suicide when a person\n\ninstigates any person to do that thing as stated in clause\n\nfirstly or to do anything as stated in clauses secondly or\n\nthirdly of\nSection 107\nIPC.\nSection 109\nIPC provides that if\n\nthe act abetted is committed pursuant to and in consequence of\n\nabetment then the offender is to be punished with the\n\npunishment provided for the original offence.\n\n18. Learned counsel for the respondent-State, however,\nclearly stated before us that it would be a case where clause\n\n`thirdly' of\nSection 107\nIPC only would be attracted. According\n\nto him, a case of abetment of suicide is made out as provided\n\nfor under\nSection 107\nIPC.\n\n19. In view of the aforesaid situation and position, we\n\nhave examined the provision of clause thirdly which provides\n\nthat a person would be held to have abetted the doing of a\n\nthing when he intentionally does or omits to do anything in\n\norder to aid the commission of that thing. The Act further\n\ngives an idea as to who would be intentionally aiding by any\n\nact of doing of that thing when in Explanation 2 it is provided\n\nas follows:\n\n\"\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\"Explanation 2.- Whoever, either prior to or at\nthe time of the commission of an act, does\nanything in order to facilitate the commission of\nthat act, and thereby facilitate the commission\nthereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.\"\n\n20. Therefore, the issue that arises for our consideration\n\nis whether any of the aforesaid clauses namely firstly\n\nalongwith explanation 1 or more particularly thirdly with\n\nExplanation 2 to\nSection 107\nis attracted in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present case so as to bring the present\n\ncase within the purview of\nSection 306\nIPC.\n\n21. We have already considered a number of decisions of\n\nthis Court on the aforesaid aspect and having done so we revert\nback to the factual position of the present case. The\n\nprosecution has specifically alleged that on 26.09.1991, the\n\nday prior to the date of commission of suicide by the deceased,\n\nthe deceased was tortured by the appellant, Anita and the other\n\naccused persons present in the house of the appellant, as a\n\nresult of which the deceased committed suicide on the next day.\n\nOn a perusal of the record of the present case, we find that\n\nboth the trial Court as well as the High Court have disbelieved\n\nthe said incident as, according to them, the statement of the\n\nwitnesses to establish the said fact are not reliable and\n\ntrustworthy. Those findings recorded by the trial Court and the\n\nHigh Court have not been challenged before us. It is not the\n\ncase of the prosecution that the case in hand would fall within\n\nthe ambit of clause firstly of or Explanation 1 to\nSection 107\n\nIPC.\n\n22. The prosecution, however, heavily relies on the clause\n\nthirdly of\nSection 107\nIPC because, according to the\n\nprosecution, the appellant by way of harassment and torturing\n\nthe deceased at various point of time and by marrying said\n\nAnita for the second time without the permission and against\n\nthe will of the deceased, intentionally aided the commission of\n\nsuicide by the deceased.\n\n23. In support of the aforesaid contention, learned counsel\n\nfor the prosecution relied upon Explanation 2 to\nSection 107\n.\n\nHe submitted that prior to the commission of suicide by the\ndeceased, the appellant had, by bringing said Anita as his\n\nsecond wife to his house facilitated the commission of suicide\n\nby the deceased and thus, the appellant intentionally aided the\n\ncommission of suicide by the deceased. The evidence on record,\n\nhowever, does not support such a case. It is pertinent to note\n\nthat the appellant had brought Anita to stay with him at his\n\nhouse three months prior to the date of the death of the\n\ndeceased. If the deceased had been so perturbed by the act of\n\nthe appellant in marrying the said Anita and in bringing her to\n\nhis house that she felt impelled to commit suicide then she\n\ncould have done so on the very day when Anita had come to stay\n\nwith the appellant in his house as naturally at that point of\n\ntime her annoyance or dismay with life would have been at its\n\npinnacle. From the period of three months which elapsed in\n\nbetween the incidents of the appellant bringing Anita to his\n\nhouse and the deceased committing suicide, it can be clearly\n\ninferred that it was not the act of the appellant which\n\ninstigated or provoked the deceased to commit suicide.\n\n24. The perpetration of physical torture on the deceased on\n\nthe day prior to the date of the incident which led the\n\ndeceased to commit suicide is the prosecution case all\n\nthroughout. It is nowhere the case of the prosecution that the\n\nappellant had played any active role either in instigating or\n\naiding the commission of suicide by the deceased for denying to\n\naccept Anita as the wife of the appellant. Anita, the second\n\nwife of the appellant was brought by the appellant to his house\nabout three months prior to the date of the incident of suicide\n\nby the deceased and therefore, bringing of the second wife to\n\nthe house by the appellant cannot be said to have either\n\nincited or facilitated the commission of suicide by the\n\ndeceased. It is also not the case of the prosecution as\n\ndisclosed from the evidence led which we have scrutinised very\n\nminutely. The aforesaid contention, in our considered opinion,\n\nis far fetched and is not established by the facts of the\n\npresent case. After carefully assessing the evidence on record\n\nwe find that there is no direct evidence to show that the\n\nappellant had by his acts instigated or provoked the deceased\n\nto commit suicide and has not done any act which could be said\n\nto have facilitated the commission of suicide by the deceased.\n\n25. We now intend to proceed to find out whether a case\n\nunder\nSection 498A\nIPC is made out against the appellant or\n\nnot.\nIn the case of\nGirdhar Shankar Tawade v. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n(2002) 5 SCC 177, this Court gave a succinct\n\nenumeration of the object and ingredients of\nSection 498A\nIPC,\n\nwhen it observed as follows in paras 3 and 17:\n\n\"3. The basic purport of the statutory provision\nis to avoid \"cruelty\" which stands defined by\nattributing a specific statutory meaning attached\nthereto as noticed hereinbefore. Two specific\ninstances have been taken note of in order to\nascribe a meaning to the word \"cruelty\" as is\nexpressed by the legislatures: whereas Explanation\n\n(a) involves three specific situations viz. (i) to\ndrive the woman to commit suicide or (ii) to cause\ngrave injury or (iii) danger to life, limb or\nhealth, both mental and physical, and thus\ninvolving a physical torture or atrocity, in\nExplanation (b) there is absence of physical\ninjury but the legislature thought it fit to\ninclude only coercive harassment which obviously\nas the legislative intent expressed is equally\nheinous to match the physical injury: whereas one\nis patent, the other one is latent but equally\nserious in terms of the provisions of the statute\nsince the same would also embrace the attributes\nof \"cruelty\" in terms of\nSection 498-A\n.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n17. As regards the core issue as to whether\ncharges under\nSections 306\nand\n498-A\nof the Indian\nPenal Code are independent of each other and\nacquittal of one does not lead to acquittal on the\nother, as noticed earlier, there appears to be a\nlong catena of cases in affirmation thereto and as\nsuch further dilation is not necessary neither are\nwe inclined to do so, but in order to justify a\nconviction under the later provision there must be\navailable on record some material and cogent\nevidence. Presently, we have on record two\ninconsistent versions of the brother and the\ncousin, as such no credence can be attributed\nthereon -- the documentary evidence (namely, those\nthree letters), in our view, falls short of the\nrequirement of the statute: even on an assumption\nof the fact that there is no contradiction in the\noral testimony available on record, the cousin\ngoes to the unfortunate girl's in-laws' place and\nrequests the husband to treat her well -- at best\nsome torture and a request to treat her well. This\nby itself would not bring home the charge under\n\nSection 498-A\n. Demand for dowry has not seen the\nlight of day.\"\n\n26. From the evidence of record available before us, we\n\nfind that the prosecution witnesses have in their testimonies\n\nstated that the deceased was tortured both physically and\n\nmentally by the appellant for the first time after his marriage\n\nwith the deceased when he was refused permission for marriage\n\nwith said Anita by the deceased. On having been refused the\n\npermission for his second marriage with Anita, the appellant\nagain, after a few days requested the deceased to accede to his\n\nrequest for marriage with Anita, which request was again\n\nrefused by the deceased. Consequent to the said position and\n\ndue to the adamant position taken by the deceased, cruelty was\n\nmeted out to her by the accused which fact is sufficiently\n\nproved from the evidence on record. Therefore, we find no\n\nreason to take a different view than what has been taken by the\n\ntrial Court and the High Court as far as\nSection 498A\nIPC is\n\nconcerned.\n\n27. Accordingly, the present appeal is hereby partly\n\nallowed. We hereby set aside the conviction of the appellant\n\nunder\nSection 306\nbut uphold the conviction of the appellant\n\nunder\nsection 498A\n. As the appellant is on bail, his bail\n\nbonds stand cancelled. The appellant is directed to surrender\n\nhimself before the jail authorities within 15 days from today\n\nto serve out the remaining sentence under\nSection 498A\n, failing\n\nwhich the concerned authority shall proceed against the\n\nappellant in accordance with law.\n\n.....................J.\n[Dr. Mukundakam Sharma]\n\n.....................J.\n[R.M.
