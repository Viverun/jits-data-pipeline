These appeals involve the question of validity of the \nKarnataka\nDetermination of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the\nBasis of Reservation (To the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act,\n2002\n (the impugned Act). \nThe Act\n inter alia provides for grant of\nconsequential seniority to the Government servants belonging to Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes promoted under reservation policy. It also\nprotects consequential seniority already accorded from 27th April, 1978\nonwards.\n\n2. The validity of the Act was challenged before this Court by way of\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.61 of 2002 titled \nM. Nagaraj and others v. Union\nof India and others\n. The issue referred to larger Bench in the writ\npetition along with connected matters was decided by this Court on 19th\nOctober, 2006[1]. While upholding the constitutional validity of the\nConstitution (seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995; the \nConstitution\n(Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000\n; the \nConstitution (Eighty-Second\nAmendment) Act, 2000\n and the \nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act,\n2001\n, individual matters were remitted to the appropriate Bench[2].\nThereafter, the matter was remitted back to the High Court for deciding the\nquestion of validity of the said enactment[3].\n\n3. The petition was re-numbered by the High Court as Writ Petition\n(Civil) No.14672 of 2010. The High Court by the impugned judgment has held\nthe Act to be valid. The question framed for determination by the High\nCourt is as follows :\n\n“Whether the State Government has shown the compelling reasons, namely,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall administrative\nefficiency before making provision for reservation for Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes in matters of promotion and as to whether the extent of\nreservation provided for promotion in favour of the persons belonging to\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes at 15% and 3% respectively, in\nKarnataka is justified?\n\n4. It will be appropriate to notice the factual matrix relevant to\ndetermine the controversy. Policy of reservation in promotion was\nintroduced in the State of Karnataka vide Government Order dated 27th\nApril, 1978. The reservation in promotion was provided to the SCs and STs\nto the extent of 15% and 3% respectively but upto and inclusive of the\nlowest Group-A posts in the cadres where there is no element of direct\nrecruitment and where the direct recruitment does not exceed 66?\n%. A roster of 33 points was issued applicable to each cadre of posts\nunder each appointing authority. Prior to 1st April, 1992, there was no\ncarry forward system of the vacancies. It was introduced on 1st April,\n1992. In the stream of graduate Engineers, the reservation in promotion\nwas available upto and inclusive of third level, i.e., Executive Engineers\nupto 1999 and on the date of filing of the petition (in 2002), it was\navailable upto second level, i.e. Assistant Executive Engineer. In\nDiploma Engineers, it was available upto third level, i.e. Assistant\nExecutive Engineer – Division II. According to the appellants, Assistant\nEngineers of SC/ST category recruited in the year 1987 were promoted to the\ncadre of Assistant Executive Engineers while in general merit, Assistant\nEngineers recruited in 1976 were considered for promotion to the said\ncadre. The representation of the SC/ST group was as follows:\n\nEE Cadre 19.9%\n\nSE Cadre 23.95%\n\nCE Cadre 4.3% (being a selection post)\n\nEngineer-in-chief 44.44%\n\n5. Thus, according to the appellants, SC/ST candidates got promotion\nearly and on account of consequential seniority, percentage of SC/ST\ncandidates was much higher than the permitted percentage and all top\npositions were likely to be filled up by SC/ST candidates without general\nmerit candidates getting to higher positions. This aspect was considered\nin the judgment of this Court dated 1st December, 2000 in \nM.G. Badappanavar\n v. State of Karnataka\n[4].\n \nThis Court applying the principles \nlaid down in\n\nAjit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab (Ajit Singh I)[5]; Ajit Singh (II) v.\nState of Punjab[6] and \nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n[7] issued a\ndirection to the State of Karnataka to redo the seniority and take further\naction in the light of the said judgments. Pointing out the consequence of\naccelerated seniority to the roster point promotee, it has been averred in\nthe writ petition that the roster point promotee would reach the third\nlevel by the age of 45 and fourth, fifth and sixth level in next three, two\nand two years. The general merit promotee would reach the third level only\nat the age of 56 and retire before reaching the fourth level. This would\nresult in reverse discrimination and representation of reserved category\nwould range between 36% to 100%.\n\n6. Stand of the State and the contesting respondents who have been given\npromotion under the reservation, is that inter se seniority amongst persons\npromoted on any occasion is determined as per Karnataka Government Servants\n(Seniority) Rules, 1957 (1957 Rules). By amendment dated 1st April, 1992\nprovision was made to fill-up backlog vacancies which was upheld by this\nCourt in \nBhakta Ramegowda v. State of Karnataka\n[8]. On that basis,\nGovernment order dated 24th June, 1997 was issued for fixation of seniority\nof SC/ST candidates promoted under reservation. Thus, all candidates\npromoted ‘on the same occasion’ retained their seniority in the lower\ncadre.\n \nThis aspect was not considered in \nBadappanavar\n (supra). Extent of\nreservation for SC and ST was 15% and 3% respectively on the basis of\ncensus figures of 1951, though the population of SCs and STs has\nsubstantially increased. As per census figures of 1991 population of SC\nand ST was 16.38% and 4.26% respectively. The stand of the appellants that\nthe SC/ST candidates reach level four at 45 years or become Chief Engineers\nby 49 years or there is reverse discrimination has been denied.\n\n7. \nIn the light of the above pleadings and judgment of this Court in \nM.\nNagaraj\n (supra), the matter was put in issue before the High Court.\n The\ncontention raised on behalf of the appellants was that grant of\nconsequential seniority to candidates promoted by way of reservation\naffected efficiency of administration and was violative of Articles 14 and\n\n16. \nIn spite of 85th Amendment having been upheld, law \nlaid down in\n\nBadappanavar\n (supra), Ajit Singh II (supra) and \nUnion of India v. Virpal\nChauhan\n[9] remained relevant in absence of ‘backwardness’, ‘inadequacy of\nrepresentation’ and ‘overall administrative efficiency’ being independently\ndetermined. The State Government had not provided any material or data to\nshow inadequacy of reservation to the members of SC/ST nor the State has\ngiven any thought to the issue of overall administrative efficiency.\n\n8. On the other hand, the submission on behalf of the State was that\nreservation to SCs and STs to the extent of 15% and 3% respectively could\nnever be said to be excessive in view of progressive increase in population\nof SCs and STs.\n\n9. The High Court referring to this Court’s judgment in \nM. Nagaraj\n\n(supra) observed that concept of “catch up” rule and “consequential\nseniority” are judicially evolved concepts to control the effect of\nreservations. Deleting the said rule cannot by itself be in conflict with\n“equality code” under the Constitution. The 85th Amendment gave freedom to\nthe State to provide for reservation in promotion with consequential\nseniority under \nArticle 16(4-A)\n if ‘backwardness’, ‘inadequacy of\nrepresentation’ and ‘overall efficiency’ so warranted. There is no fixed\nyardstick to identify and measure the above three factors. If the State\nfails to identify and measure the above three factors, the reservation can\nbe invalid. Examining whether the State had in fact measured the above\nfactors, the High Court observed that Order dated 27th April, 1978 was\nissued by the State of Karnataka after considering the statistics available\nabout the representation of SCs and STs in promotional vacancies. On 3rd\nFebruary, 1999, the policy was modified to limit reservation in promotion\nin cadre upto and inclusive of the lowest category of Group-A posts in\nwhich there is no element of recruitment beyond 66? %. The said order was\nfurther amended on 13th April, 1999 to the effect that reservation in the\npromotion for SCs and STs will continue to operate till their\nrepresentation reached 15% or 3% respectively and promotion of SCs and STs\nand against backlog was to continue as per order dated 24th June, 1997 till\nthe said percentage was so reached in the total working strength. As per\nthe Karnataka Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes\n(Reservation of seats in Educational Institutions and of appointments or\nposts in the services under the State) Act, 1994 (the \nKarnataka Act\n 43 of\n1994), seniority in the lower cadre is maintained in promotional posts for\nthe persons promoted “on one occasion”. Since reservation had not exceeded\n15% and 3% for SCs and STs while population of the said categories had\nincreased, there was adequate consideration of the above three factors of\n“backwardness”, inadequacy of representation” and “overall efficiency”.\n\nSection 3\n of the Act provided for an inbuilt mechanism for providing\nreservation in promotion to the extent of 15% and 3% respectively for the\nSCs and STs. The State Government collects statistics every year. The\nHigh Court held that contention that if all the posts in higher echelons\nmay be filled by SCs and STs, the promotional prospects of general merit\ncandidates will get choked or blocked could not be accepted as reservation\nin promotion was provided only upto the cadre of Assistant Executive\nEngineers. It was further observed that there was no pleading that overall\nefficiency of service would be hampered by promoting persons belonging to\nSCs and STs.\n\n10. The impugned judgment has been challenged on behalf of the appellants\nmainly relying upon judgment of this Court in \nUttar Pradesh Power\nCorporation Limited v. Rajesh Kumar\n[10]. It was submitted that the High\nCourt erroneously held that there was an inbuilt mechanism under \nSection 3\n\nof the impugned Act or that the seniority rule maintaining lower cadre\nseniority in respect of persons promoted on a particular occasion was a\nsafeguard against excessive reservation. Similarly, the finding that\nreservation was only upto a particular level and not beyond or that\naccelerated promotion upto that level did not affect further promotions was\nerroneous. It was also submitted that there was no provision for excluding\nthe creamy layer which also rendered the Act invalid.\n \nIt was submitted\nthat no exercise whatsoever in terms of \nM. Nagaraj\n case has been\nundertaken by the State.\n\n11. Shri Basava Prabhu S. Patil, learned senior counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the State submitted that the Act did not deal with the\nreservation. It only dealt with seniority. Seniority was not a\nfundamental right but a civil right as held in \nBimlesh Tanwar vs. State of\nHaryana\n[11]. M. Nagaraj judgment of this Court had dealt with reservation\nand not with consequential seniority. Once reservation is within the\nprescribed limit, there was no bar to consequential seniority being\ngranted. It was further submitted that even if seniority is to be struck\ndown, the clock cannot be entirely reversed so as to affect seniority of\npersons who had retired or who are about to retire or who had reached\nhigher positions.\n\n12. Shri S.N. Bhat, learned counsel for the private respondents supported\nthe impugned judgment and submitted that the Government was not required\nto carry out the exercise of finding out ‘backwardness’, ‘inadequacy of\nrepresentation’ and ‘overall administrative efficiency’ for providing\nconsequential seniority to officers on the basis of reservation. The said\nexercise was required to be carried out only for providing reservation in\npromotion. Reservation in promotion was permissible only upto Class I\nposts in Karnataka. Moreover, inter se seniority of reserved category and\ngeneral category candidates promoted together was not disturbed. The\nroster points ensured that there was no excessive representation in\ndifferent cadres of service. In view of Government Order dated 3rd\nFebruary, 1999 there was enough data available to justify continuance of\nprovision for consequential seniority under the impugned Act. Data\ncollected by the Department of Statistics with regard to overall\nrepresentation of SCs and STs as on 31st March, 2002 showed that the\nrepresentation of SCs and STs was not above 15% and 3% respectively.\n\nSection 4\n of the Act only protected consequential seniority which was\nalready given. Promotions already effected cannot be disturbed.\n\n13. Reference may now be made to the impugned Act. The preamble of the\nAct refers to policy of reservation in promotion in favour of Government\nservants belonging to SCs and STs in terms of order dated 27th April, 1978.\n Para 7 of the said order stipulates that inter se seniority amongst\npersons promoted in accordance with the said order has to be determined in\nthe manner provided under Rule 4 or Rule 4A of the 1957 Rules. There is\nfurther reference to the judgment of this Court in \nBadappanavar\n (supra) to\nthe effect that there was no specific rule permitting seniority to be\ncounted for persons promoted against a reserved roster point. It further\nrefers to the Constitution (85th \nAmendment) Act, 2001\n permitting\nconsequential seniority in the case of promotion on the basis of\nreservation. It states that to remove any ambiguity and to clarify that\ngovernment servants belonging to SCs and STs promoted in accordance with\nthe reservation in promotion shall be entitled to seniority as it is\navailable to government servants belonging to other categories. \nSection 3\n\nof the impugned Act provides that government servants belonging to SCs and\nSTs promoted in accordance with the policy reservation in promotion shall\nbe entitled to consequential seniority on the basis of length of service in\na cadre. Proviso to the said section to the effect that inter se seniority\nof government servants belonging to SCs/STs and those belonging to\nunreserved category promoted at the same time by a common order shall be on\nthe basis of inter se seniority in the lower cadre. \nSection 4\n provides for\nprotection of consequential seniority already accorded from 27th April,\n1978. Since \nSections 3\n and \n4\n are the key sections, the same are reproduced\nbelow :\n\n“3. Determination of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the\nbasis of Reservation.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law\nfor the time being in force, the Government Servants belonging to the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes promoted in accordance with the\npolicy of reservation in promotion provided for in the Reservation Order\nshall be entitled to consequential seniority. Seniority shall be determined\non the basis of the length of service in a cadre.\n\nProvided that the seniority inter-se of the Government Servants belonging\nto the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as well as those belonging\nto the unreserved category, promoted to a cadre, at the same time by a\ncommon 5 order, shall be determined on the basis of their seniority inter-\nse, in the lower cadre.\n\nProvided further that where the posts in a cadre, according to the rules of\nrecruitment applicable to them are required to be filled by promotion from\ntwo or more lower cadres,-\n\n(i) The number of vacancies available in the promotional (higher) cadre for\neach of the lower cadres according to the rules of recruitment applicable\nto it shall be calculated; and\n\n(ii) The roster shall be applied separately to the number of vacancies so\ncalculated in respect of each of those lower cadres;\n\nProvided also that the serial numbers of the roster points specified in the\nReservation Order are intended only to facilitate calculation of the number\nof vacancies reserved for promotion at a time and such roster points are\nnot intended to determine inter-se seniority of the Government Servants\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes vis-a-vis the\nGovernment Servants belonging to the unreserved category promoted at the\nsame time and such inter-se seniority shall be determined by their\nseniority inter-se in the cadre from which they are promoted, as\nillustrated in the Schedule appended to this Act.\n\n4. Protection of consequential seniority already accorded from 27th April,\n1978, onwards.- Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other\nlaw for the time being in force, the consequential seniority already\naccorded to the Government servants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and\nthe Scheduled Tribes who were promoted in accordance with the policy of\nreservation in promotion provided for in the Reservation Order with effect\nfrom the Twenty Seventh Day of April, Nineteen Hundred and Seventy Eight\nshall be valid and shall be protected and shall not be disturbed. “\n\n14. Question for consideration is whether the impugned Act is consistent\nwith \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The said question has been\ngone into by this Court inter alia in identical circumstances in \nSuraj Bhan\nMeena v. State of Rajasthan\n[12] and \nUttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited\n\n(supra) to which we will make a reference at appropriate place.\n\n15. We proceed to deal with the contention that High Court judgment\nproceeds on incorrect understanding of the law \nlaid down in\n \nM. Nagaraj\n\n(supra).\n \nWhile no doubt in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra), 85th Amendment was upheld\nwith the observation that enabling the State to do away with the ‘catch up’\nrule, a judicially evolved concept to control the effect of reservations,\nwas valid but the exercise of power to do away with the said rule and\nproviding consequential seniority in favour of roster point promotees of\nreserved category was subject to the limitation of determining the three\nfactors of ‘backwardness’, ‘inadequacy of representation’ and ‘overall\nefficiency’. The High Court brushed aside the said mandatory requirement\nby simply observing that \nSection 3\n provided for an inbuilt mechanism as the\nextent of mechanism was limited to 15% and 3% respectively for the SCs and\nSTs which dispensed with any requirement of determining inadequacy of\nrepresentation or backwardness. High Court further dispensed with the\nrequirement of determining overall efficiency by observing that there was\nno pleading that overall efficiency would be hampered by promoting persons\nbelonging to SCs and STs.\n \nThis reasoning in the judgment of the High\nCourt, it is submitted, is contrary to the mandate of law as recognized in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) and the view similar to the impugned judgment has been\nrepeatedly disapproved in decisions of this Court.\n\n16. We find considerable force in the submission. The issue is no longer\nres integra and it will be suffice to refer to the law clearly \nlaid down by\n\nthis Court in this regard.\n\n17. \nIn \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra), this Court considered constitutional validity\nof 77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th Amendments. In doing so, the Court was\nconcerned with the question whether the amendment infringed the basic\nstructure of the Constitution. It was held that equality is part of the\nbasic structure but in the present context, right to equality is not\nviolated by an enabling provision if exercise of power so justifies. In\nthis regard, following observations are worthwhile to note :\n\n“31. At the outset, it may be noted that equality, rule of law, judicial\nreview and separation of powers are distinct concepts. They have to be\ntreated separately, though they are intimately connected. There can be no\nrule of law if there is no equality before the law; and rule of law and\nequality before the law would be empty words if their violation was not a\nmatter of judicial scrutiny or judicial review and judicial relief and all\nthese features would lose their significance if judicial, executive and\nlegislative functions were united in only one authority, whose dictates had\nthe force of law. The rule of law and equality before the law are designed\nto secure among other things, justice both social and economic ……\n …… ……\n\n32. In Minerva Mills [(1980) 3 SCC 625] Chandrachud, C.J., speaking for the\nmajority, observed that \nArticles 14\n and \n19\n do not confer any fanciful\nrights. They confer rights which are elementary for the proper and\neffective functioning of democracy. They are universally regarded by the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. If \nArticles 14\n and \n19\n are put out of\noperation, \nArticle 32\n will be rendered nugatory …..\n\n…… …… ……\n\n33. From these observations, which are binding on us, the principle which\nemerges is that “equality” is the essence of democracy and, accordingly a\nbasic feature of the Constitution. …… ……\n ……\n\n34. However, there is a difference between formal equality and egalitarian\nequality which will be discussed later on.\n\nxxxx\n\n42. ….. ….There can be no justice without equality. \nArticle 14\n guarantees\nthe fundamental right to equality before the law on all persons. Great\nsocial injustice resulted from treating sections of the Hindu community as\n“untouchable” and, therefore, \nArticle 17\n abolished untouchability and\n\nArticle 25\n permitted the State to make any law providing for throwing open\nall public Hindu religious temples to untouchables. Therefore, provisions\nof Part III also provide for political and social justice.\n\n18. Considering the right of equality in the context of\nreservation/affirmative action it was observed :\n\n“43. … … … Therefore, the concept of “equality of opportunity” in public\nemployment concerns an individual, whether that individual belongs to the\ngeneral category or Backward Class. The conflicting claim of individual\nright under \nArticle 16(1)\n and the preferential treatment given to a\nBackward Class has to be balanced. Both the claims have a particular object\nto be achieved. The question is of optimisation of these conflicting\ninterests and claims.”\n\n19. Thereafter, concepts of ‘equity’, ‘justice’ and ‘merit’ in public\nemployment were referred to and it was held that application of these\nconcepts in public employment depends upon quantifiable data in each case.\nIt was observed:\n\n“44. … … …Backward Classes seek justice. General class in public employment\nseeks equity. The difficulty comes in when the third variable comes in,\nnamely, efficiency in service. In the issue of reservation, we are being\nasked to find a stable equilibrium between justice to the backwards, equity\nfor the forwards and efficiency for the entire system. Equity and justice\nin the above context are hard concepts. However, if you add efficiency to\nequity and justice, the problem arises in the context of the reservation.\nThis problem has to be examined, therefore, on the facts of each case.\nTherefore, \nArticle 16(4)\n has to be construed in the light of \nArticle 335\n of\nthe Constitution. Inadequacy in representation and backwardness of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are circumstances which enable the\nState Government to act under \nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution. However,\nas held by this Court the limitations on the discretion of the Government\nin the matter of reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n as well as \nArticle 16(4-A)\n\ncome in the form of \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution.\n\n45. … … …The basic presumption, however, remains that it is the State who\nis in the best position to define and measure merit in whatever ways it\nconsider it to be relevant to public employment because ultimately it has\nto bear the costs arising from errors in defining and measuring merit.\n\nSimilarly, the concept of “extent of reservation” is not an absolute\nconcept and like merit it is context-specific.\n\n46. … … …Therefore, “vesting of the power” by an enabling provision may be\nconstitutionally valid and yet “exercise of the power” by the State in a\ngiven case may be arbitrary, particularly, if the State fails to identify\nand measure backwardness and inadequacy keeping in mind the efficiency of\nservice as required under Article 335.”\n\n20. The above discussion led this Court to hold that conferment of\nenabling power on State under \nArticle 16(4A)\n did not by itself violate the\nbasic feature of equality. If the affirmative action stipulated under\n\nArticle 16(4A)\n could be balanced with the need for adequate representation\nfor justice to the backwards while upholding equity for the forwards and\nefficiency for the entire system with the further observation that the\ncontent of a right is defined by the Courts and even while the amendment as\nsuch could be upheld, validity of an individual enactment was required to\nbe gone into. If the State wished to exercise its discretion under \nArticle\n16(4A)\n, it was to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the\nclass and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment\nin addition to compliance with \nArticle 335.\n It was made clear that even if\nthe State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will have to\nsee that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to\nbreach the ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer or extend\nthe reservation indefinitely.\n\n21. It may also be worthwhile to note further observations of this Court\nin \nthe said judgment\n :\n\n“49. Reservation is necessary for transcending caste and not for\nperpetuating it. Reservation has to be used in a limited sense otherwise it\nwill perpetuate casteism in the country. Reservation is underwritten by a\nspecial justification.\n\n xxxx\n\n59. Giving the judgment of the Court in Indra Sawhney [(1992) Supp. (3) SCC\n217] Jeevan Reddy, J. stated that \nArticle 16(4)\n speaks of adequate\nrepresentation not proportionate representation although proportion of\npopulation of Backward Classes to the total population would certainly be\nrelevant ………… …… ……\n xxxx\n\n102. …. ….. ….. Therefore, in every case where the State decides\nto provide for reservation there must exist two circumstances, namely,\n“backwardness” and “inadequacy of representation”. As stated above, equity,\njustice and efficiency are variable factors. These factors are context-\n\nspecific. There is no fixed yardstick to identify and measure these three\nfactors, it will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. These\nare the limitations on the mode of the exercise of power by the State. None\nof these limitations have been removed by the impugned amendments. If the\nState concerned fails to identify and measure backwardness, inadequacy and\noverall administrative efficiency then in that event the provision for\nreservation would be invalid …… …… ……\n\n xxxxx\n\n104. ….. ….. As stated above, be it reservation or evaluation,\nexcessiveness in either would result in violation of the constitutional\nmandate. This exercise, however, will depend on the facts of each case. In\nour view, the field of exercise of the amending power is retained by the\nimpugned amendments, as the impugned amendments have introduced merely\nenabling provisions because, as stated above, merit, efficiency,\nbackwardness and inadequacy cannot be identified and measured in vacuum.\nMoreover, \nArticle 16(4-A)\n and \nArticle 16(4-B)\n fall in the pattern of\n\nArticle 16(4)\n and as long as the parameters mentioned in those articles are\ncomplied with by the States, the provision of reservation cannot be\nfaulted. \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n are classifications within the\nprinciple of equality under \nArticle 16(4).\n\n xxxxx\n\n106. …… …… According to the Constitutional Law of India, by H.M. Seervai,\n4th Edn., p. 546, equality is not violated by mere conferment of\ndiscretionary power. It is violated by arbitrary exercise by those on whom\nit is conferred. This is the theory of “guided power”. This theory is based\non the assumption that in the event of arbitrary exercise by those on whom\nthe power is conferred, would be corrected by the courts …... …..\n……\n\n107. ….. …… If the State has quantifiable data to show backwardness and\ninadequacy then the State can make reservations in promotions keeping in\nmind maintenance of efficiency which is held to be a constitutional\nlimitation on the discretion of the State in making reservation as\nindicated by \nArticle 335.\n As stated above, the concepts of efficiency,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation are required to be identified\nand measured …… …… ……\n\n108. …… …… Moreover, \nArticle 335\n is to be read with \nArticle 46\n which\nprovides that the State shall promote with special care the educational and\neconomic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and in particular,\nof the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from\nsocial injustice. Therefore, where the State finds compelling interests of\nbackwardness and inadequacy, it may relax the qualifying marks for SCs/STs.\nThese compelling interests however have to be identified by weighty and\ncomparable data.\n\nxxxxx\n\n117. ….. …… Therefore, in each case the Court has got to be\nsatisfied that the State has exercised its opinion in making reservations\nin promotions for SCs and STs and for which the State concerned will have\nto place before the Court the requisite quantifiable data in each case and\nsatisfy the Court that such reservations became necessary on account of\ninadequacy of representation of SCs/STs in a particular class or classes of\nposts without affecting general efficiency of service as mandated under\n\nArticle 335\n of the Constitution.\n\n118. The constitutional principle of equality is inherent in the rule of\nlaw. However, its reach is limited because its primary concern is not with\nthe content of the law but with its enforcement and application. The rule\nof law is satisfied when laws are applied or enforced equally, that is,\neven-handedly, free of bias and without irrational distinction. The concept\nof equality allows differential treatment but it prevents distinctions that\nare not properly justified. Justification needs each case to be decided on\ncase-to-case basis.\n\nxxxx\n\n120. At this stage, one aspect needs to be mentioned. Social justice is\nconcerned with the distribution of benefits and burdens. The basis of\ndistribution is the area of conflict between rights, needs and means. These\nthree criteria can be put under two concepts of equality, namely, “formal\nequality” and “proportional equality”. Formal equality means that law\ntreats everyone equal. Concept of egalitarian equality is the concept of\nproportional equality and it expects the States to take affirmative action\nin favour of disadvantaged sections of society within the framework of\ndemocratic polity. In Indra Sawhney all the Judges except Pandian, J. held\nthat the “means test” should be adopted to exclude the creamy layer from\nthe protected group earmarked for reservation. In Indra Sawhney this Court\nhas, therefore, accepted caste as a determinant of backwardness and yet it\nhas struck a balance with the principle of secularism which is the basic\nfeature of the Constitution by bringing in the concept of creamy layer.\nViews have often been expressed in this Court that caste should not be the\ndeterminant of backwardness and that the economic criteria alone should be\nthe determinant of backwardness. As stated above, we are bound by the\ndecision in Indra Sawhney. The question as to the “determinant” of\nbackwardness cannot be gone into by us in view of the binding decision. In\naddition to the above requirements this Court in Indra Sawhney has evolved\nnumerical benchmarks like ceiling limit of 50% based on post-specific\nroster coupled with the concept of replacement to provide immunity against\nthe charge of discrimination.\n\nxxxx\n\n122. We reiterate that the ceiling limit of 50%, the concept of creamy\nlayer and the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\nrepresentation and overall administrative efficiency are all constitutional\nrequirements without which the structure of equality of opportunity in\n\nArticle 16\n would collapse.”\n\n22. Question of application of principles \nlaid down in\n \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra)\nfor judging the exercise of enabling power of granting consequential\nseniority and promotion was raised in \nSuraj Bhan Meena\n (supra). Therein\nchallenge was to the validity of notification dated 25th August, 2008\nissued by the State Government of Rajasthan under proviso to \nArticle 309\n of\nthe Constitution, amending the service rules in the State of Rajasthan\nw.e.f. 28th December, 2002. The notification purported to give\nconsequential seniority to candidates belonging to SCs and STs who got\nroster point promotions.\n \nThe challenge to the notification was that\nwithout quantifying figures of SCs and STs or showing compelling reasons\nsuch as ‘backwardness’, ‘inadequacy of representation’ and ‘overall\nadministrative efficiency’ as \nlaid down in\n \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) the grant of\nconsequential seniority was not permissible. The High Court quashed the\nnotification providing for consequential seniority on the ground that no\nexercise had been undertaken in terms of \nArticle 16(4A)\n to acquire\nquantifiable data regarding inadequacy of representation to SCs and STs in\npublic service and to assess whether such reservation was necessary. This\nwas upheld by this Court as under :\n\n“66. The position after the decision in \nM. Nagaraj\n case is that reservation\nof posts in promotion is dependent on the inadequacy of representation of\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes\nand subject to the condition of ascertaining as to whether such reservation\nwas at all required.\n\n67. The view of the High Court is based on the decision in \nM. Nagaraj\n case\nas no exercise was undertaken in terms of \nArticle 16(4-A)\n to acquire\nquantifiable data regarding the inadequacy of representation of the\nScheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities in public services. The\nRajasthan High Court has rightly quashed the Notifications dated 28-12-2002\nand 25-4-2008 issued by the State of Rajasthan providing for consequential\nseniority and promotion to the members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled\nTribe communities and the same does not call for any interference.”\n\n23. Again in \nUttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited\n (supra), validity\nof Rule 8A of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority Rules, 1991, inserted\nby way of an amendment in 2007, was put in issue.\n \nWhile a Division Bench\nof Lucknow Bench in \nPrem Kumar Singh v. State of U.P.\n[13] struck down the\nsaid rule, another Division Bench at Allahabad in \nMukund Kumar Srivastava\nv. State of U.P.\n[14] took a contrary view. This Court dismissed the appeal\nfiled by the U.P. Power Corporation Limited and upheld the view of the\nLucknow Bench.\n \nReference was made to observations in para 819 in \nIndra\nSawhney v. UOI\n[15] to the effect that reservation under \nArticle 16(4)\n of\nthe Constitution could only be at the stage of entry into the State service\nand not in promotion. Reservation in promotion is bound to generate acute\nheartburning and lead to inefficiency in administration. The members of\nopen category would think that whatever be their record or performance,\nmembers of reserved category will steal a march over them irrespective of\ntheir performance and competence. Once persons coming from different\nsources join a category or class, they must be treated alike for promotion\nand no distinction was permissible on the basis of ‘birth-mark’.\nReservation in promotion will be contrary to the mandate of \nArticle 335\n,\nviz., maintenance of efficiency in administration and put premium on\nefficiency. Members of reserved category will not work hard since they do\nnot have to compete with their colleagues and because of assured promotion,\nwhich will be against the goal of excellence under \nArticle 51-A (j).\n\nReference was also made to para 831 in \nthe said judgment\n to the effect that\nextending concessions and relaxations in the matter of promotion to members\nof reserved category could affect efficiency of administration. Reference\nwas then made to the decisions of this Court holding that roster only\nensured percentage of reservation in promotion but could not affect\nseniority.[16]\n\n24. Reference was then made to the Constitution amendment enabling\nreservation in promotions and consequential seniority which was upheld in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n (supra). The said judgment was summarized as follows:\n\n“ 81. From the aforesaid decision in \nM. Nagaraj\n case and the paragraphs we\nhave quoted hereinabove, the following principles can be carved out:\n\n(i) Vesting of the power by an enabling provision may be constitutionally\nvalid and yet “exercise of power” by the State in a given case may be\narbitrary, particularly, if the State fails to identify and measure the\nbackwardness and inadequacy keeping in mind the efficiency of service as\nrequired under \nArticle 335.\n\n(ii) \nArticle 16(4)\n which protects the interests of certain sections of the\nsociety has to be balanced against \nArticle 16(1)\n which protects the\ninterests of every citizen of the entire society. They should be harmonised\nbecause they are restatements of the principle of equality under Article\n\n14.\n\n(iii) Each post gets marked for the particular category of candidates to be\nappointed against it and any subsequent vacancy has to be filled by that\ncategory candidate.\n\n(iv) The appropriate Government has to apply the cadre strength as a unit\nin the operation of the roster in order to ascertain whether a given\nclass/group is adequately represented in the service. The cadre strength as\na unit also ensures that the upper ceiling limit of 50% is not violated.\nFurther, roster has to be post-specific and not vacancy based.\n\n(v) The State has to form its opinion on the quantifiable data regarding\nadequacy of representation. Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n is an enabling\nprovision. It gives freedom to the State to provide for reservation in\nmatters of promotion. Clause (4-A) of \nArticle 16\n applies only to SCs and\nSTs. The said clause is carved out of \nArticle 16(4-A).\n Therefore, clause (4-\nA) will be governed by the two compelling reasons—“backwardness” and\n“inadequacy of representation”, as mentioned in \nArticle 16(4).\n If the said\ntwo reasons do not exist, then the enabling provision cannot be enforced.\n\n(vi) If the ceiling limit on the carry over of unfilled vacancies is\nremoved, the other alternative time factor comes in and in that event, the\ntimescale has to be imposed in the interest of efficiency in administration\nas mandated by \nArticle 335.\n If the timescale is not kept, then posts will\ncontinue to remain vacant for years which would be detrimental to the\nadministration. Therefore, in each case, the appropriate Government will\nnow have to introduce the duration depending upon the fact situation.\n\n(vii) If the appropriate Government enacts a law providing for reservation\nwithout keeping in mind the parameters in \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 335\n,\nthen this Court will certainly set aside and strike down such legislation.\n\n(viii) The constitutional limitation under \nArticle 335\n is relaxed and not\nobliterated. As stated above, be it reservation or evaluation,\nexcessiveness in either would result in violation of the constitutional\nmandate. This exercise, however, will depend on the facts of each case.\n\n(ix) The concepts of efficiency, backwardness and inadequacy of\nrepresentation are required to be identified and measured. That exercise\ndepends on the availability of data. That exercise depends on numerous\nfactors. It is for this reason that the enabling provisions are required to\nbe made because each competing claim seeks to achieve certain goals. How\nbest one should optimise these conflicting claims can only be done by the\nadministration in the context of local prevailing conditions in public\nemployment.\n\n(x) \nArticle 16(4)\n, therefore, creates a field which enables a State to\nprovide for reservation provided there exists backwardness of a class and\ninadequacy of representation in employment. These are compelling reasons.\nThey do not exist in \nArticle 16(1).\n It is only when these reasons are\nsatisfied that a State gets the power to provide for reservation in the\nmatter of employment.”\n\n25. Referring to the “Social Justice Committee Report” relied upon by the\nU.P. Power Corporation, it was observed that the said report was in respect\nof population and vacancies and not in respect of the concepts evolved in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n (supra). Therefore, exercise in the light of judgment in M.\nNagaraj was a categorical imperative. The contention that no such exercise\nwas necessary could not be accepted. Accordingly, this Court upheld the\nview that grant of consequential seniority in promotion to the persons\nbelonging to SCs and STs who were granted promotion against roster points\ncould not be sustained. Reference may be made to the following\nobservations :\n\n“85. As has been indicated hereinbefore, it has been vehemently argued by\nthe learned Senior Counsel for the State and the learned Senior Counsel for\nthe Corporation that once the principle of reservation was made applicable\nto the spectrum of promotion, no fresh exercise is necessary. It is also\nurged that the efficiency in service is not jeopardised. Reference has been\nmade to the Social Justice Committee Report and the chart. We need not\nproduce the same as the said exercise was done regard being had to the\npopulation and vacancies and not to the concepts that have been evolved in\nM. Nagaraj. It is one thing to think that there are statutory rules or\nexecutive instructions to grant promotion but it cannot be forgotten that\nthey were all subject to the pronouncement by this Court in Virpal Singh\nChauhan and Ajit Singh.\n\n86. We are of the firm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the\njudgment of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj is a categorical\nimperative. The stand that the constitutional amendments have facilitated\nthe reservation in promotion with consequential seniority and have given\nthe stamp of approval to the Act and the Rules cannot withstand close\nscrutiny inasmuch as the Constitution Bench has clearly opined that\n\nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n are enabling provisions and the State can make\nprovisions for the same on certain basis or foundation. The conditions\nprecedent have not been satisfied. No exercise has been undertaken. What\nhas been argued with vehemence is that it is not necessary as the concept\nof reservation in promotion was already in vogue. We are unable to accept\nthe said submission, for when the provisions of the Constitution are\ntreated valid with certain conditions or riders, it becomes incumbent on\nthe part of the State to appreciate and apply the test so that its\namendments can be tested and withstand the scrutiny on parameters laid down\ntherein.\n\n87. In the ultimate analysis, we conclude and hold that \nSection 3(7)\n of the\n1994 Act and Rule 8-A of the 2007 Rules are ultra vires as they run counter\nto the dictum in M. Nagaraj. Any promotion that has been given on the\ndictum of Indra Sawhney and without the aid or assistance of \nSection 3(7)\n\nand Rule 8-A shall remain undisturbed.”\n\n26. \nIn \nCentral Bank of India v. SC/ST Employees Welfare Association\n[17],\nquestion was whether in absence of a rule of reservation for promotion such\nreservation was permissible merely because the banks were following\nreservation policy of the Government of India. The Madras High Court after\nconsidering the statistics found that there was no adequate representation\nof SCs and STs in higher scales. It directed that such representation be\ngranted. Plea of the Bank that such reservation will affect efficiency in\nthe administration was rejected. This Court held that in absence of any\nspecific provision for reservation in promotion, the Court could not issue\na direction for reservation. It was observed :\n\n“32. We have already noticed above that in matters of promotion within\nGroup A posts, which carry an ultimate salary of Rs 5700 per month, there\nwas no provision for any reservation. On a conjoint reading of these two\nOffice Memorandums dated 1-11-1990 and 13-8-1997, in the absence of any\nother provision or rule evidencing such a reservation in the matter of\npromotions, it cannot be said that there was reservation in promotion\nwithin Group A posts up to the ultimate salary of Rs 5700 per month. The\nHigh Court in the impugned judgment has gone by the lofty ideals enshrined\nin \nArticles 15\n and \n16\n of the Constitution as well as the fact that in these\nBanks there is no adequate representation of SC/ST category of officers in\nGroup IV and above. That may be so. It can only provide justification for\nmaking a provision of this nature. However, in the absence of such a\nprovision, same cannot be read by overstretching the language of the Office\nMemorandum dated 13-8-1997. It is for the State to take stock of the ground\nrealities and take a decision as to whether it is necessary to make\nprovision for reservation in promotions to the aforesaid post as well.”\n\n27. \nIn \nS. Panneer Selvam v. State of Tamil Nadu\n[18], question before the\nCourt was whether in absence of any policy decision by the State for giving\nconsequential seniority to candidates promoted on the basis of reservation\nprior to a senior general category candidate, claim for consequential\nseniority could be accepted. Answering the question in the negative, it\nwas held that in absence of provision for consequential seniority, ‘catch\nup’ rule will be applicable and the roster point promotees cannot claim\nsuch consequential seniority. The senior general candidates will regain\ntheir seniority on being promoted. Observations relevant in this regard\nare as follows :\n\n“34. If we look at the above comparative table of the service particulars\nof the appellants and the respondents, it is seen that the contesting\nrespondents U. Palaniappan joined the service almost seven years after the\nappellants, his seniority is automatically accelerated at an unprecedented\nrate and as on 1-4-2004 his seniority rank as ADE is 150 and seniority of\nV. Appadurai is 120. The appellants who are qualified and senior than the\ncontesting respondents are placed much below in rank in comparison to the\nperson belonging to the reserved class promotees who were promoted\nfollowing the rule of reservation. It is to be noted that the private\nrespondents in the present case have been promoted temporarily under Rule\n39(a) and Rule 10(a)(i) of the General Rules with the condition that their\ninclusion in the promotional order shall not confer on them any right\nwhatsoever in the service. Determination of seniority is a vital aspect in\nthe service career of an employee and his future promotion is dependent on\nthis. Therefore, determination of seniority must be based on some\nprinciples which are just and fair. In the absence of any policy decision\ntaken or rules framed by the State of Tamil Nadu regarding Tamil Nadu\nHighways Engineering Service, accelerated promotion given to the\nrespondents following rule of reservation in terms of Rule 12 will not give\nthem consequential accelerated seniority.\n\nxxxx\n\n36. In the absence of any provision for consequential seniority in the\nrules, the “catch-up rule” will be applicable and the roster-point reserved\ncategory promotees cannot count their seniority in the promoted category\nfrom the date of their promotion and the senior general candidates if later\nreach the promotional level, general candidates will regain their\nseniority. The Division Bench appears to have proceeded on an erroneous\nfooting that \nArticle 16(4-A)\n of the Constitution of India automatically\ngives the consequential seniority in addition to accelerated promotion to\nthe roster-point promotees and the judgment of the Division Bench cannot be\nsustained.”\n\n26. It is clear from the above discussion that exercise for determining\n‘inadequacy of representation’, ‘backwardness’ and ‘overall efficiency’, is\na must for exercise of power under \nArticle 16(4A).\n Mere fact that there is\nno proportionate representation in promotional posts for the population of\nSCs and STs is not by itself enough to grant consequential seniority to\npromotees who are otherwise junior and thereby denying seniority to those\nwho are given promotion later on account of reservation policy. It is for\nthe State to place material on record that there was compelling necessity\nfor exercise of such power and decision of the State was based on material\nincluding the study that overall efficiency is not compromised. In the\npresent case, no such exercise has been undertaken. The High Court\nerroneously observed that it was for the petitioners to plead and prove\nthat the overall efficiency was adversely affected by giving consequential\nseniority to junior persons who got promotion on account of reservation.\n\nPlea that persons promoted at the same time were allowed to retain their\nseniority in the lower cadre is untenable and ignores the fact that a\nsenior person may be promoted later and not at same time on account of\nroster point reservation. Depriving him of his seniority affects his\nfurther chances of promotion. Further plea that seniority was not a\nfundamental right is equally without any merit in the present context. In\nabsence of exercise under \nArticle 16(4A)\n, it is the ‘catch up’ rule which\nis fully applies. It is not necessary to go into the question whether the\nconcerned Corporation had adopted the rule of consequential seniority.\n\n27. In view of the above, we allow these appeals, set aside the impugned\njudgment and declare the provisions of the impugned Act to the extent of\ndoing away with the ‘catch up’ rule and providing for consequential\nseniority under \nSections 3\n and \n4\n to persons belonging to SCs and STs on\npromotion against roster points to be ultra vires \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution. The judgment will not affect those who have already retired\nand will not affect financial benefits already taken. Consequential\npromotions granted to serving employees, based on consequential seniority\nbenefit, will be treated as ad hoc and liable to be reviewed. Seniority\nlist may be now revised in the light of this judgment within three months\nfrom today. Further consequential action may be taken accordingly within\nnext three months.\n\n …………..…………………………….J.\n [ ADARSH KUMAR GOEL ]\n\n .….……………………..……………..J.\n [ UDAY UMESH LALIT ]\n\nNEW DELHI\nFEBRUARY 09, 2017\n\n-----------------------\n\n[1]\n\n \n[2] (2006) 8 \nSCC 212\n\n[3]\n\n [4] Para 124 of ‘M.

A roster of 33 points was issued applicable to each cadre of posts\nunder each appointing authority. Prior to 1st April, 1992, there was no\ncarry forward system of the vacancies. It was introduced on 1st April,\n1992. In the stream of graduate Engineers, the reservation in promotion\nwas available upto and inclusive of third level, i.e., Executive Engineers\nupto 1999 and on the date of filing of the petition (in 2002), it was\navailable upto second level, i.e. Assistant Executive Engineer. In\nDiploma Engineers, it was available upto third level, i.e. Assistant\nExecutive Engineer – Division II. According to the appellants, Assistant\nEngineers of SC/ST category recruited in the year 1987 were promoted to the\ncadre of Assistant Executive Engineers while in general merit, Assistant\nEngineers recruited in 1976 were considered for promotion to the said\ncadre. The representation of the SC/ST group was as follows:"

There is no fixed\nyardstick to identify and measure the above three factors. If the State\nfails to identify and measure the above three factors, the reservation can\nbe invalid. Examining whether the State had in fact measured the above\nfactors, the High Court observed that Order dated 27th April, 1978 was\nissued by the State of Karnataka after considering the statistics available\nabout the representation of SCs and STs in promotional vacancies. On 3rd\nFebruary, 1999, the policy was modified to limit reservation in promotion\nin cadre upto and inclusive of the lowest category of Group-A posts in\nwhich there is no element of recruitment beyond 66? %. The said order was\nfurther amended on 13th April, 1999 to the effect that reservation in the\npromotion for SCs and STs will continue to operate till their\nrepresentation reached 15% or 3% respectively and promotion of SCs and STs\nand against backlog was to continue as per order dated 24th June, 1997 till\nthe said percentage was so reached in the total working strength.
