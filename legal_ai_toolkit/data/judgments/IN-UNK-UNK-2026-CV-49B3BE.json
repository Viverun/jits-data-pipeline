Meera Devi raised a dispute before the\n\nLabour Court with a prayer for regularization of her service from\n\nthe date of her initial appointment. The claim of Meera Devi was\n\nallowed by the Labour court and the writ petition preferred against\n\nthe same being S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.4320/2012 was also\n\ndismissed. It has been submitted that in pursuance to the orders\n\npassed by this Court, the services of Meera Devi have been\n\nregularized from the date of her initial appointment and therefore,\n\nthe petitioners being similarly situated persons have a right to\n\nclaim parity and should be granted the same benefits as granted\n\nto Meera Devi. Alternatively, it has been submitted that initial\n\ndate of appointment should be considered at least for the\n\npurposes of calculation of gratuity and pension benefits as the\n\nqualifying service as defined under Rule 12 of the Rajasthan Civil\n\nServices (Pension) Rules, 1996 (for short hereinafter referred to\n\nas, 'the Rules of 1996') and \nSection 2\n of the Payment of Gratuity\n\nAct, 1972 (for short hereinafter referred to as, 'the Act of 1972')\n\nhas been completed by the petitioners.\n\n Counsel for the petitioners submitted that as the order\n\npassed in Meera Devi's case has become final for all purposes and\n\nhas been implemented and executed by the Department, the\n\nsame is definitely applicable to the present petitioners too and\n\nthey also deserve to be granted the same benefits. It has further\n\nbeen submitted that although the present petitioners have raised\n\ntheir claims belatedly, but the said delay cannot come in the way\n\nof granting relief to the petitioners as it has been held in the\n\ncatena of judgments that if a relief has been granted to a similarly\n\n (D.B.

It has been submitted by the respondents that the services\n\n (D.B. SAW/723/2022 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)\n\n (Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:39 AM)\n\n (13 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]\n\nof the petitioners were regularized somewhere between the year\n\n1991-1994 to which the petitioners never raised any objection and\n\nmany of them have even retired. The fact itself is sufficient to\n\nprove that the petitioners were never aggrieved of the date of\n\nregularization and therefore, they cannot be permitted to\n\nchallenge the same after a period of more than 25 years. Counsel\n\nfurther submitted that it is true that Meera Devi was granted the\n\nsaid relief but it was in pursuance to the directions issued by this\n\nCourt. Meera Devi had raised her grievance soon after the\n\nregularization of her services and therefore the petitioners who\n\nhad never challenged their orders of regularization at the relevant\n\npoint of time cannot challenge the same now. So far as the\n\ncalculation of the pension and gratuity benefits from the date of\n\ninitial appointment is concerned counsel for the respondents has\n\nsubmitted that the same also being the consequential relief cannot\n\nbe granted.\n\n Counsel for the respondents relied upon the following\n\njudgments:\n\n \n1. \nNew Delhi Municipal Council vs. Pan Singh and Ors.\n; (2007)\n 9 SCC 278\n\n \n2. \nUnion of India and Ors. vs. M.K.

Please refer the same for further orders)\n\n (Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:39 AM)\n\n (14 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]\n\n Heard the parties and perused the material available on\n\nrecord.\n\n A bare perusal of the grounds raised in the petitions makes it\n\nclear that the present petitions have been filed by the petitioners\n\non the sole ground that as Meera Devi, similarly situated person,\n\nhas been granted regularization w.e.f the date of her initial\n\nappointment the same may be granted to them also. It is clear on\n\nrecord that services of the petitioners were regularized way back\n\nbetween years 1991-94, and no such grievance was ever raised by\n\nthe petitioners even till the date of their retirement (in case where\n\nthe petitioner had retired). Only when orders for pension in the\n\ncase of Meera Devi, calculating the same on the basis of initial\n\ndate of appointment were issued, the present petitioners too\n\ndecided to raise their claim for first time in the year 2017 vide a\n\nnotice which was served on the respondent-authorities.\n\n \nIn the case of \nNew Delhi Municipal Council Vs. Pan\n\nSingh & Ors.\n; (2007) 9 Supreme Court Cases 278, the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has held that a person, who did not choose to\n\nchallenge a specific order at the relevant point of time and\n\nchallenged the same only after the relief was granted to a similarly\n\nsituated employee, cannot be granted the same benefit. The\n\nHon'ble Apex Court held as under:\n\n \"16. There is another aspect of the matter which\n cannot be lost sight of. Respondents herein filed a\n Writ Petition after 17 years. They did not agitate\n their grievances for a long time. They, as noticed\n herein, did not claim parity with the 17 workmen\n at the earliest possible opportunity. They did not\n implead themselves as parties even in the\n reference made by the State before the Industrial\n Tribunal. It is not their case that after 1982, those\n employees who were employed or who were\n recruited after the cut-off date have been granted\n the said scale of pay. After such a long time,\n therefore, the Writ Petitions could not have been\n\n (D.B.

It\n is trite that the discretionary jurisdiction may not\n be exercised in favour of those who approach the\n Court after a long time. Delay and laches are\n relevant factors for exercise of equitable\n jurisdiction. See \nGovt. of W.B. v. Tarun K. Roy\n And Others\n [(\n2004) 1 SCC 347], Chairman, U.P.\n Jal Nigam & Anr. v. Jaswant Singh And Anr.\n [2006\n (12) SCALE 347] and Karnataka Power Corpn. Ltd.\n\n through its Chairman & Managing Director and\n Another v. K. Thangappan and Another [(2006) 4\n SCC 322].\"\n\n So far as the claim of the petitioners for regularization of\n\ntheir services w.e.f the date of initial appointment is concerned,\n\nthis Court is not inclined to interfere with the same because of a\n\ngross delay of 25 years being caused in raising the said claim.\n\n So far as the other judgments cited by the counsel for the\n\npetitioners in support of the submissions regarding the\n\nregularization of the petitioners are concerned, there is no dispute\n\npertaining to the ratio as laid down in the said judgments. But as\n\nthis Court is not inclined to interfere in the present matters qua\n\nthe relief of regularization on the ground of gross delay, the said\n\njudgments are not required to be dealt with in the present matter.\n\n So far as the case of petitioners who have since retired and\n\npray for calculation of the pensionary and gratuity benefits from\n\nthe date of initial appointment are concerned, the ground raised\n\nby the counsel for the petitioners is found to be tenable. Rule 12\n\nof the Rules of 1996 defines qualifying services as under:\n\n \"12. Commencement of qualifying service\n\n (a) Except for compensation gratuity, a\n Government servant's service does not qualify till\n he has completed eighteen years of age.\n\n (b) Subject to the provisions of these rules, the\n qualifying service of a Government servant shall\n commence from the date he takes over charge of\n the post to which he is first appointed, either\n substantively or in an officiating or temporary\n capacity.\"\n\n (D.B. SAW/723/2022 has been filed in this matter.
