He proved the Post-mortem\n\nreport (Ext. 12).\n\n 32. PW21 is the recording officer. He received the\n\nwritten complaint on 11.11.2017 and started Krishnaganj\n\nP.S.

PW 22 is an ASI of police who conducted\n\ninquest on the dead body of the victim in connection with\n\nU.D. Case No. 558/2017 dated 19.11.2017. He has proved\n\nthe inquest report (Ext. 2), the dead body challan (Ext.\n\n14) as well as requisition for the inquest (Ext. 15) and his\n\nsignature on the inquest was conducted by the S.D.O.\n\nKalyani (Ext. 9/1).\n\n 34. PW 23 is a Sub-Inspector of police who\n\nrecorded the dying declaration of the victim on\n\n10.11.2017. He stated that on 10.11.2017, he visited\n\n 13\n\n Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College & Hospital, Kalyani\n\nand recorded the dying declaration of the victim in\n\npresence of Krishna Rout, duty staff and Dr. Sabuj Pal of\n\nJNM Hospital, Kalyani and obtained their signatures on\n\nthe statement so recorded (Ext. 8).\n\n 35. In his cross-examination, PW23 admitted that\n\nthe contents of the statement recorded by him and his\n\nsignature thereon were in two different inks without any\n\nexplanation to this effect. Admittedly, there was no note as\n\nto who identified the victim and that PW23 did not take\n\nnecessary permission from the superintendent of the\n\nhospital or the attending doctors for recording such\n\nstatement. PW 23 also admitted that there was no note to\n\nthe effect that he disclosed his identity before the victim\n\nprior to recording her statement or that the victim was\n\nphysically capable of giving such statement. PW 23 also\n\nadmitted that he did not make any note of the location of\n\nthe victim in the hospital or the exact place where the\n\nstatement was recorded. It was also admitted that the\n\n 14\n\n statement so recorded did not contain any note that it was\n\nrecorded as per the statement of the victim and it was read\n\nover and explained to her after recording. Admittedly, the\n\nvictim was not in position to put her signature or thumb\n\nimpression. He has also stated that PW23 did not make\n\nany entry in the G.D.E. book maintained at the police\n\nstation regarding his exit and return to the Police Station,\n\nfor the purpose of recording the dying declaration of the\n\nvictim.\n\n 36.

III & IV respectively).\n\nIn course of investigation, PW 24 examined available\n\nwitnesses and recorded their statements. He also collected\n\nand seized the viscera of the victim under a seizure list\n\n(Ext. 11). On completion of investigation PW 24, he\n\n 15\n\n submitted charge sheet under \nsection 302\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code.\n\n 37. The convict stood the trial and upon\n\nconclusion of the trial, the learned trial court, by the\n\nimpugned judgment and order convicted the accused for\n\nthe offence punishable under \nSection 302\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code and sentenced him to undergo life\n\nimprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.20,000/-\n\n 38. The appellant has sought to assail the\n\njudgment and order of conviction and sentence on the\n\nground that learned Trial Court did not consider the delay\n\nin lodging the First Information Report. It has also been\n\npointed out that the impugned judgment is perverse so far\n\nas in spite of presence of several houses in the vicinity, no\n\nindependent witness has been examined or has supported\n\nthe case of prosecution, rendering its veracity highly\n\ndoubtful. The appellant has also challenged the\n\ngenuineness of the alleged dying declarations of the victim\n\n 16\n\n banking upon the contradictory accounts narrated by the\n\nvictim at different times.\n\n 39. According to the narrative set out by the\n\nprosecution, on the fateful day i.e. on 08/11/2017 at\n\nabout 11 pm, the victim was sleeping in her room. The\n\nhusband of the victim was at Pune. The brother-in-law,\n\nwife of brother-in-law and other relatives of the victim\n\nwere also sleeping in the adjoining rooms of the self-same\n\nhouse. Suddenly, the relatives of the victim heard a hue\n\nand cry. Coming out, they saw the victim in flames. The\n\nbrother-in-law of the victim (PW 2) claims to have seen the\n\nconvict, fleeing away from there. The husband and wife of\n\nthe brother-in-law of the victim have claimed that they\n\nwere reported by the victim herself that she was set ablaze\n\nby the convict.\n\n 40. The victim was first taken to Krishnaganj\n\nHospital, wherefrom she was referred to Saktinagar\n\nHospital and ultimately, she was shifted to Jawahar Lal\n\nNehru Medical College and Hospital, Kalyani on\n\n 17\n\n 09.11.2017. The wife of the brother-in-law of the victim\n\n(PW 3) has categorically stated in her deposition that she\n\nmet the victim in Krishnaganj Hospital where she reported\n\nto her that she was set on fire by the convict. However,\n\nneither the brother-in-law of the victim (PW 2) nor his wife\n\n(PW 3) reported the matter to police instantly. The hospital\n\nauthorities, received a patient with burn injuries of critical\n\nnature and referring her for better treatment, recorded her\n\nstatement which is relied by the prosecution as dying\n\ndeclaration, yet no steps appear to have been taken for\n\nreporting the matter to the police which ought to have\n\nbeen done in usual course.\n\n 41. The husband of the victim was allegedly\n\ninformed of the incidence at Pune and he is said to have\n\nreturned on the day following the incident i.e. on\n\n09.11.2017. Upon return, he met his wife at JNM\n\nHospital, Kalyani where he was reported by his victim wife\n\nthat on the date of incidence, the convict, Samaresh\n\n 18\n\n entered into the room of his wife, assaulted her, poured\n\nkerosene oil and set her on fire.\n\n 42. From the story set up by the prosecution, it is\n\nevident that the victim died of burn injuries and that the\n\ninjuries so inflicted were the outcome of the overtact\n\nperpetrated by the convict Samaresh. For the aforesaid\n\nreasons, the said Samaresh was put to trial for causing\n\ndeath of the victim and was ultimately, convicted for the\n\noffences punishable under \nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal\n\nCode, 1860.\n\n 43. So far as the death of the victim is concerned,\n\nit is not challenged from any corner. There are ample\n\nevidences that the victim was found on fire on the fateful\n\nnight. She sustained burn injuries in the incidence and\n\nwas taken to Krishnaganj Primary Health Centre for her\n\ntreatment. She was later moved to Saktinagar Hospital\n\nand owing to her precarious condition; she had to be\n\nmoved to Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College & Hospital\n\nfor better treatment. In course of her treatment, she\n\n 19\n\n succumbed to the injuries so inflicted in the incidence.\n\nThe oral evidence of PW 1, PW 2, PW 20 and other\n\nwitnesses together with the testimony of Ext.-12 (Post-\n\nmortem Report) and Ext. 2 (inquest report) goes to prove\n\nthat the victim died at JNM Hospital on 19.11.2017.\n\nExhibit 12 is explicit that the death was due to septic\n\nabsorption from infected ulcer resulting from burn injuries\n\nwhich were ante-mortem.\n\n 44. As regards the cause of injuries so inflicted, it\n\nis the case of the prosecution, that convict entered into the\n\nroom of the victim, assaulted her, poured kerosene oil and\n\nset her on fire.\n\n 45. PW 2 is the only person, who has claimed that\n\nhe saw the convict Samaresh fleeing away from the scene\n\nof occurrence. According to his version, on 08.11.2017 at\n\nabout 11 pm, while he was sleeping in his room with his\n\nwife (PW 3) and child, he heard hue and cry and coming\n\nout of his room, he saw the victim in flames. He also saw\n\nthe accused Samaresh fleeing away He tried to douse the\n\n 20\n\n fire by pouring water and brought the victim to the\n\nhospital. PW 3 the wife of PW 2 also came out of her room\n\nhearing the screams. She, though, did not claim to have\n\nseen the accused at that time, however, she stated to have\n\nbeen reported by the victim in the Primary Health Centre\n\nitself that she was set on fire by accused Samaresh.\n\n 46. Neither PW 2 nor PW 3 reported the incident to\n\nthe police. It appears that they just waited for the arrival\n\nof the husband of the victim and did not take any steps to\n\ninform the police about the incidence. It seems quite\n\nastounding that the hospital received a patient with\n\nserious burn injuries and that too with the history of\n\nculpability by someone and yet no steps were taken to\n\ninform the police. Not only that, the de facto complainant\n\ni.e. the husband of the victim who was allegedly at Pune\n\non the date and time of incidence came back on the\n\nfollowing day being informed about the occurrence. He met\n\nhis wife in JNM Hospital on the following day where she\n\nreported her that she was set ablaze by accused\n\n 21\n\n Samaresh. Nevertheless, no police complaint was lodged\n\nby the husband of the victim (PW 1) on the day he was\n\nreported i.e. 09.11.2017. There is also no explanation as\n\nto why the police report was not made on the following day\n\nas well i.e. on 10.11.2017 and the entire day of\n\n11.11.2017 until 16.25 hrs.\n\n 47. The police complaint appears to have been\n\nlodged after two days i.e. on 11.11.2017 at 16.25 hrs. No\n\nexplanation, whatsoever, appears to have been advanced\n\non the part of the prosecution as to the delay in lodging\n\nthe First Information Report. Such an inordinate delay in\n\nlodging the First Information Report casts serious doubts.\n\n 48. According to the testimony of PW1, he\n\nreturned from Pune on the day following the occurrence.\n\nHe alleged that on return, he handed over the air tickets to\n\nthe investigating officer to substantiate his bona fide\n\nabsence on the date and time of incident. However, no\n\nsuch document has been brought forth by the\n\nprosecution. Neither the said air tickets appear to have\n\n 22\n\n been seized by the investigating officer nor has the same\n\nbeen proved on the part of the prosecution.\n\n 49. For prosecuting the appellant, the prosecution\n\nhas relied upon the evidence of PW 2 who alleged to have\n\nseen him fleeing away from the place of occurrence just\n\nafter the incident. However, the testimony of PW 2 has not\n\nbeen corroborated by any independent witness. Evidence\n\nis forthcoming that there are so many houses around that\n\nof the victim and there was a hue and cry which drew PW2\n\nand PW3 but no one from the locality came forward to\n\nsupport the version of PW2.\n\n 50. In order to bring home the charges levelled\n\nagainst the appellant, the prosecution has also banked\n\nupon the dying declarations given by the victim. In the\n\ninstant case, the victim is said to have given three different\n\nstatements at different point of time which are sought to\n\nbe utilized as dying declarations of the victim. The first\n\ndying declaration was recorded by Dr. Ramprasad Mallick\n\n(PW5), the Medical Officer of Krishnaganj BPHC (Ext. 6).\n\n 23\n\n The testimony of PW5 as well as Exhibit 6 goes to show\n\nthat the victim was not in a position to talk and she\n\nanswered the leading questions put to her by nodding. In\n\nsuch statement, the victim stated that she poured\n\nkerosene oil on her body and put on fire herself. The\n\nincident happened at her house on 08.11.2017 at 10 pm.\n\nShe, however, kept silent when asked about the reason.\n\nExhibit 6 also goes to show that the victim was brought to\n\nKrishnaganj Block Primary Health Centre on 09.11.2017\n\nat 12.10 a.m. and at that time, she was not able to speak.\n\nThis belies the statement of PW3 that the victim reported\n\nher in the said Krishnaganj BPHC that she was set on fire\n\nby the appellant.\n\n 51. The second dying declaration (Exhibit 7/1) was\n\nrecorded by Dr. Nobarun Banerjee (PW6) of Nadia District\n\nHospital. The victim was admitted in the said hospital at\n\n1.30 a.m. on 09.11.2017 and she was examined by PW6 at\n\n01.40 a.m. The victim made a statement before PW6 to the\n\neffect that she was beaten by Samaresh Biswas and he set\n\n 24\n\n fire upon her body. Then he put out the fire himself after\n\nwhich the victim set fire upon herself and brought herself\n\nto the present condition. At the time of such examination\n\nof the victim, PW6 found the patient sustained 70% total\n\nbody surface area mixed burn.\n\n 52. The third dying declaration was recorded by SI\n\nof police Prosenjit Ghosal (PW23) on 10.11.2017 at\n\n01.45.am at JNM Hospital in presence of on duty staff\n\nKrishna Rahul (PW8) and on-duty medical officer Dr.\n\nSabuj Pal (PW7). In such statement, the victim stated that\n\nher neighbor, Samaresh used to love her but she did not\n\npay any heed. For this reason, she called the said\n\nSamaresh over phone to her house for compromise talks.\n\nThere she was assaulted by Samaresh. In order to terrify\n\nhim, the victim herself poured kerosene on her body.\n\nSamaresh was not scared and put her on fire. She used to\n\nbe loved by her husband.\n\n 53. It has been contended on the part of the\n\nappellant that there are material-contradictions in the\n\n 25\n\n three dying declarations and such statements on the part\n\nof the victim cast serious doubts over the veracity of the\n\nprosecution story and cannot be relied upon to secure\n\nconviction. The impugned judgment of conviction is\n\ntherefore perverse.\n\n 54. In at least two of the dying declarations, the\n\nvictim appears to have stated that she herself poured\n\nkerosene on her person and self immolated herself. In two\n\nof her such statements, she appears to have stated that\n\nshe was assaulted by the appellant. However, the story of\n\nalleged assault is not corroborated by the medical\n\nevidence.\n\n 55. Moreover, the victim herself called the\n\nappellant to her residence at considerable late hours of\n\nevening for a settlement. This shows some kind of\n\nrelationship between the victim and the appellant.\n\n 56. \nIn this context, the appellant has relied upon\n\nthe decision reported in (2009) 1 SCC (Cri)287\n\n 26\n\n (\nMehiboobsab Abbasbai Nadaf vs State of Karnataka\n). In\n\nthe aforesaid case, it was observed that,\n\n \"7. Conviction can indisputably be based on a\n\n dying declaration. But, before it can be acted\n\n upon, the same must be held to have been\n\n rendered voluntarily and truthfully.\n\n Consistency in the dying declaration is the\n\n relevant factor for placing full reliance\n\n thereupon. In this case, the deceased herself\n\n had taken contradictory and inconsistent\n\n stand in different dying declarations. They,\n\n therefore, should not be accepted on their face\n\n value. Caution, in this behalf, is required to be\n\n applied.\"\n\n \n57. Appellant also relied upon the judgment in the\n\ncase of \nKashi Vishwanath vs State of Karnataka\n\n(2013)3 SCC (Cri) 257. The facts of the case are very\n\nidentical to the case at hand. The reliability of the three\n\ndying declarations in the afore-cited case was negated by\n\n 27\n\n the Hon'ble Apex Court on two counts. First, there were\n\nmaterial-contradictions in the statements so recorded and\n\nsecondly, the same was recorded in a language which the\n\nvictim did not speak. The Hon'ble Court also took into\n\naccount the possibility of the victim being influenced by\n\nsomebody in making the dying declarations. So is the case\n\nin the present case. The victim gave her first statement by\n\nnodding which was taken down in English. The second\n\ndying declaration was recorded on the same day i.e.\n\n09.11.2017. Whereas, the third dying declaration was\n\nrecorded on the following day when her husband had\n\narrived and met her. Such inconsistencies in the three\n\nstatements create reasonable doubts regarding its\n\nreliability and a conviction based on such inconsistent\n\ndying declarations does not seem to be safe.\n\n 58. The appellant has also taken a stand that in\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the case, intention to kill\n\nwas not explicit. The appellant tried to drench the fire and\n\nin doing so sustained burn injuries himself. Therefore, the\n\n 28\n\n conviction under \nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code was\n\nnot justified. He could have been guilty of abetment of\n\nsuicide punishable under \nSection 306\n of the Indian Penal\n\nCode since the first dying declaration discloses that the\n\nvictim herself put her on fire with a view to scaring the\n\nappellant. In the event of other two dying declarations\n\nbeing considered, a case punishable under \nSection 302\n\nwas not made out. Rather, at the best, a case punishable\n\nunder \nSection 304\n Part II of the \nIndian Penal Code\n. It has\n\nalso been contended that the learned Trial Court could\n\nhave legally convicted the appellant under \nSection 306\n of\n\nthe Indian Penal Code instead of \nsection 302\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code even if no charge was framed therein. \nIn this\n\nregard, the appellant has relied on the decision of Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of \nDalbir Singh v State of UP\n\n(2004) 5 SCC 334, wherein it was held that,\n\n \"17. There are a catena of decisions of this\n\n Court on the same lines and it is not necessary\n\n to burden this judgment by making reference to\n\n 29\n\n each one of them. Therefore, in view of \nSection\n\n464\n CrPC, it is possible for the appellate or\n\nrevisional court to convict an accused for an\n\noffence for which no charge was framed unless\n\nthe court is of the opinion that a failure of\n\njustice would in fact occasion. In order to judge\n\nwhether a failure of justice has been\n\noccasioned, it will be relevant to examine\n\nwhether the accused was aware of the basic\n\ningredients of the offence for which he is being\n\nconvicted and whether the main facts sought\n\nto be established against him were explained\n\nto him clearly and whether he got a fair\n\nchance to defend himself. We are, therefore, of\n\nthe opinion that Sangaraboina Sreenu [(1997)\n\n5 SCC 348 : 1997 SCC (Cri) 690] was not\n\ncorrectly decided as it purports to lay down as\n\na principle of law that where the accused is\n\ncharged under \nSection 302\n IPC, he cannot be\n\n 30\n\n convicted for the offence under \nSection 306\n\n IPC.\"\n\n 59. In support of his contention, learned Advocate\n\nfor the appellant also relied upon the judgment reported in\n\n(2009)8 SCC 796 Maniben v State of Gujrat. In the\n\naforesaid judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased\n\nto hold that,\n\n \"20. There is also evidence on record to prove\n\n and establish that the action of the appellant to\n\n throw the burning tonsil was preceded by a\n\n quarrel between the deceased and the\n\n appellant. From the aforesaid evidence on\n\n record it cannot be said that the appellant had\n\n the intention that such action on her part\n\n would cause the death or such bodily injury to\n\n the deceased, which was sufficient in the\n\n ordinary course of nature to cause the death of\n\n the deceased. Therefore, in our considered\n\n opinion, the case cannot be said to be covered\n\n 31\n\n under clause (4) of \nSection 300\n IPC. We are,\n\n however, of the considered opinion that the case\n\n of the appellant is covered under \nSection 304\n\n Part II \nIPC\n.\"\n\n 60. Eliciting the similar point, the appellant also\n\nrelied upon a decision reported in (2005) 10 SCC 737\n\nSree Vijaykumar & Anr. V State, by Inspector of Police.\n\nIn the said case also, the accused were tried and convicted\n\nfor the offence punishable under \nSection 302\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code. However, in appeal, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt observed that in absence of clear intentions, the\n\ncase came under \nSection 304\n Part II of the said Code, in\n\nthe following terms, that's to say:\n\n \"17. The next question is what are the\n\n conclusions to be drawn as regards the offences\n\n committed by the two appellants, going by the\n\n version in the dying declaration coupled with\n\n the evidence of PW 1 to the extent it is in\n\n conformity with the dying declaration. Accused\n\n 32\n\n 1 hit the deceased on his head with a bottle.\n\nAssuming that some liquid spread over the\n\nbody, there is no satisfactory evidence to\n\nestablish that it was petrol or kerosene or such\n\nother highly inflammable liquid. This aspect we\n\nhave already adverted to. If the idea of A-1 was\n\nto pour some inflammable liquid on the body of\n\nthe deceased, in all probability, he would not\n\nhave resorted to the odd way of hitting the\n\nbottle containing the offensive liquid on his\n\nhead. In the dying declaration there is no\n\nreference to the fact that any inflammable\n\nliquid spilled over from the bottle. Even if some\n\nliquid came out of the bottle as per the version\n\nof PW 1, it cannot be taken for granted that it\n\nwas inflammable liquid. Coming to the act of\n\nthe second accused in throwing a burning\n\nkerosene lamp soon after the attack of A-1 with\n\nbottle, we are inclined to think that it was a\n\nrandom act resorted to by the second accused\n\n 33\n\n on the spur of the moment, apparently to cause\n\nharm to the deceased. It was not a pre-planned\n\nact done with the definite intention of causing\n\ndeath. It is not the case of the prosecution that\n\nA-2 went close to the deceased and lit up his\n\nclothes with the kerosene lamp. Hurling a small\n\nburning lamp towards a person may not\n\ndefinitely cause fire to the clothes. No doubt it\n\nwas a dangerous act and it was likely to cause\n\nfire. But in view of the fact that the candle-like\n\nlamp comes into contact with the clothes of the\n\ntargeted person for a split second, it may or\n\nmay not be in a position to ignite the fire. A\n\nperson throwing the kerosene lamp in that\n\nfashion cannot at any rate be imputed with the\n\nintention to cause the death or causing such\n\nbodily injury as is likely to cause death. He can\n\nonly be imputed with the knowledge that by\n\nsuch a dangerous act, he was likely to cause\n\ndeath. The overt act of Accused 2 in throwing\n\n 34\n\n the burning kerosene lamp at the deceased\n\nwould, in our view, give rise to the offence of\n\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder\n\npunishable under Part II of \nSection 304\n. The\n\ndiscussion supra also leads to the inference\n\nthat the appellants would not have shared the\n\ncommon intention though the common intention\n\ncould spring up at the spot. One accused hitting\n\nthe deceased with a bottle on his head which\n\ndid not cause even a visible injury and the other\n\naccused throwing a burning kerosene lamp from\n\na distance cannot be said to be acts done in\n\nfurtherance of common intention to cause the\n\ndeath of Rajeswaran. These are random acts\n\ndone without meeting of minds. They can only\n\nbe held guilty for the individual overt acts. A-2\n\nis, therefore, liable to be convicted under\n\nSection 304\n (Part II). Accordingly, he is\n\nconvicted and sentenced to undergo\n\nimprisonment for seven years and to pay a fine\n\n 35\n\n of Rs 500. In default of payment of fine, he\n\n shall undergo imprisonment for a further period\n\n of three months. His conviction and sentence\n\n under \nSection 302\n IPC is set aside.\"\n\n 61. The appellant has challenged the very\n\nconviction in a case based on the testimony of three\n\ncontradictory dying declarations. In the alternative, it has\n\nbeen contended that if the dying declarations are taken to\n\nbe true and reliable, at the best, the appellant could have\n\nbeen convicted under \nSection 306\n or 304 Part II of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\n.\n\n 62. On the contrary, learned Advocate for the state\n\nhas submitted that the conviction of the appellant for the\n\noffence punishable under \nSection 302\n of the Indian Penal\n\nCode is well founded based on reliable dying declarations\n\nand deserves no interference. \nIn support of his contention,\n\nlearned Advocate has relied upon the decision in \nLaxman\n\nv State of Maharashtra\n reported in 2002 C Cr. L R\n\n(SC)1022 corresponding to (2002) 6 SCC 710. In the\n\n 36\n\n aforesaid decision, it was \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt that,\n\n \"3. The juristic theory regarding...................\n\n What is essentially required is that the person\n\n who records a dying declaration must be\n\n satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of\n\n mind. Where it is proved by the testimony of the\n\n Magistrate that the declarant was fit to make\n\n the statement even without examination by the\n\n doctor the declaration can be acted upon\n\n provided the court ultimately holds the same to\n\n be voluntary and truthful. A certification by the\n\n doctor is essentially a rule of caution and\n\n therefore the voluntary and truthful nature of\n\n the declaration can be established otherwise.\"\n\n 63. Although, recording of dying declaration by a\n\npolice officer has not been challenged by the appellants in\n\nthe present appeal but learned Advocate for the State, in\n\nhis wisdom, has opted to rely upon a decision reported in\n\n 37\n\n (2000) 7 SCC 254 Gulam Hussain v State of Delhi. In\n\nthe said case, statement recorded by an ASI of Police even\n\nbefore the investigation actually started was held to be a\n\ndying declaration.\n\n 64. So far as the present case is concerned, we\n\nhave concluded on the basis of evidence on record that the\n\nvictim died of burn injuries. The cause of the injuries so\n\ninflicted, according to the First Information Report, is said\n\nto be an altercation between the victim and the appellant.\n\n 65. PW 2 claimed to have seen the appellant\n\nfleeing away from the scene just after the occurrence. No\n\nindependent witness has come forward to support the\n\nstatement of PW 2, though, there is evidence on record\n\nthat there were several houses in the locality. PW 3 claims\n\nto have been reported by the victim herself that she was\n\nset on fire by the appellant, at a time when, according to\n\nthe doctor, the victim was not in a position to speak and\n\ngave her statement by nodding. The circumstances raises\n\n 38\n\n serious doubts with regard to the case implicating the\n\nappellant.\n\n 66. We have already considered hereinbefore, that\n\nin her statements which have been considered by the\n\nprosecution as well as the learned Trial Court as dying\n\ndeclarations (Exhibits 6, 7 and 8), the victim appears to\n\nhave made undulating statements. She herself claimed to\n\nhave called the appellant for a settlement. In, at least, two\n\nof the statements so recorded, she claimed that she herself\n\npoured kerosene on her person. In her first and second\n\nstatements, she stated her self-immolation. The story of\n\nassault by the appellant is not supported by any medical\n\nevidence. In one of such statements, the victim has stated\n\nin unambiguous terms that the appellant put her on fire\n\nand then doused it and, thereafter, she herself put her on\n\nfire. In the wake of such swindling statements by the\n\nvictim, the dying declaration does not stir much reliability\n\nabout its veracity, sufficient enough, to secure conviction\n\n 39\n\n of the appellant for an offence like 302 of the \nIndian Penal\n\nCode\n.\n\n 67. It is well settled that in order to achieve a\n\nconviction, the evidence must point to one and only\n\nproposition and that in every probability, it points to the\n\nguilt of the accused. It is also settled principle that where\n\nthere can be two or more propositions possible, the one\n\nwhich is in favor of the accused should be accepted and\n\nthe accused should be extended with the benefit of doubt.\n\n 68. The present case falls in the second category.\n\nThere appears to be serious doubts with regard to veracity\n\nof the story set out by the prosecution and the evidence\n\nadduced to bring home the story so set forth. The\n\nappellant deserves the benefit of doubts. For the aforesaid\n\nreasons, the impugned judgment of conviction dated\n\n24.02.2018 and order of sentence dated 26.02.2018 are\n\nliable to be set aside.\n\n 69. Accordingly, the appeal being CRA (DB) 199 of\n\n2020 is allowed. The appellants shall be released from\n\n 40\n\n custody, if not wanted in any other case, upon execution\n\nof a bond to the satisfaction of the Trial Court which shall\n\nremain in force for a period of six months in terms of\n\nSection 437A\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n 70. Lower Court Records along with a copy of this\n\njudgment be sent down at once to the learned Trial Court\n\nfor necessary action.\n\n 71. Photostat certified copy of this order, if\n\napplied for, be given to the parties on priority basis upon\n\ncompliance of all formalities.\n\n [MD. SHABBAR RASHIDI, J.]\n\n 72. I agree.\n\n [DEBANGSU BASAK, J.]\n\n 41",
