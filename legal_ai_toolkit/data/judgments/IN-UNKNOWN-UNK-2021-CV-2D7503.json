Police Officer, vide letter dated 20.06.2018, denied the information on\nthe ground that the information asked seems to be inconsequential and does not seem to be serve\nany larger public interest. Dissatisfied with the reply of the CPIO, the Appellant approached the\nFAA. The FAA and Supdt. of Police, vide order dated 31.08.2018, concurred with the reply of\nthe FAA. Thereafter, the Appellant filed a Second Appeal before the Commission with a request\nto provide the information and to impose penalty on the erring Respondent.\n\nHEARING:\n\nFacts emerging during the hearing:\n\nThe following were present:\n\nAppellant: Mr. Jatin Dhankhar through AC;\n\nRespondent: Mr. Rajnikant Awadhiya, SDPO through AC;\n\nThe Appellant reiterated the contents of the RTI application and submitted that the information\nsought relating to Reservation Roaster (Direct Recruitment / Promotion, etc.) was wrongly\ndenied by the CPIO / FAA. While reiterating the contents of the Second Appeal, the Appellant\nsubmitted that the Road Transport Department of UT, Administration of Daman and Diu and\nState Bank of India, has uploaded the Reservation Roster on their website and hence, the\ninformation sought should be suo-motu disclosed in the public domain being public document, in\ncompliance with the provisions of\nSection 4\nof the RTI Act, 2005. In its reply, the Respondent\npresent during the hearing, informed the Commission that a suitable reply has been furnished to\nthe Appellant by the CPIO / FAA.\n\nOn being queried by the Commission as to why the information sought of public nature i.e.\nReservation Roster (Direct Recruitment / Promotion, etc.) for different posts were denied to the\nAppellant, no cogent reply was offered by the Respondent who further apportioned the blame on\nhis predecessor for replying the RTI application in a casual manner.\n\nThe Commission observed that a voluntary disclosure of all information such as Reservation\nRoster for different posts, etc. that ought to be displayed in the public domain should be the rule\nand members of public who having to seek information should be an exception. An open\ngovernment, which is the cherished objective of the\nRTI Act\n, can be realised only if all public\noffices comply with proactive disclosure norms.\nSection 4(2)\nof the RTI Act mandates every\npublic authority to provide as much information suo-motu to the public at regular intervals\nthrough various means of communications, including the Internet, so that the public need not\nresort to the use of\nRTI Act\n. Thus, information relating to Reservation Roster (Direct\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nRecruitment / Promotion, etc.) for different posts should be disclosed suo motu in the public\ndomain for the ease and convenience of the public at large.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of\nCBSE and Anr. Vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay\nand Ors\n2011 (8) SCC 497 held as under:\n\n\"37. The right to information is a cherished right. Information and right to information\nare intended to be formidable tools in the hands of responsible citizens to fight corruption\nand to bring in transparency and accountability. The provisions of\nRTI Act\nshould be\nenforced strictly and all efforts should be made to bring to light the necessary\ninformation under Clause (b) of\nSection 4(1)\nof the Act which relates to securing\ntransparency and accountability in the working of public authorities and in discouraging\ncorruption.\"\n\nThe Commission also observes the Hon'ble Delhi High Court ruling in WP (C) 12714/2009\nDelhi Development Authority v. Central Information Commission and Another (delivered on:\n\n21.05.2010), wherein it was held as under:\n\n\"16. It also provides that the information should be easily accessible and to the extent\npossible should be in electronic format with the Central Public Information Officer or the\nState Public Information Officer, as the case may be. The word disseminate has also been\ndefined in the explanation to mean - making the information known or communicating the\ninformation to the public through notice boards, newspapers, public announcements,\nmedia broadcasts, the internet, etc. It is, therefore, clear from a plain reading of\nSection\nof the RTI Act that the information, which a public authority is obliged to publish under\nthe said section should be made available to the public and specifically through the\ninternet. There is no denying that the petitioner is duty bound by virtue of the provisions\nof\nSection 4\nof the RTI Act to publish the information indicated in\nSection 4(1)(b)\nand\n\n4(1)(c)\non its website so that the public have minimum resort to the use of the\nRTI Act\nto\nobtain the information.\"\n\nFurthermore, High Court of Delhi in the decision of\nGeneral Manager Finance Air India Ltd &\nAnr v. Virender Singh, LPA No.\n205/2012, Decided On: 16.07.2012 had held as under:\n\n\"8.\nThe RTI Act\n, as per its preamble was enacted to enable the citizens to secure access\nto information under the control of public authorities, in order to promote transparency\nand accountability in the working of every public authority. An informed citizenry and\ntransparency of information have been spelled out as vital to democracy and to contain\ncorruption and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities accountable to the\ngoverned. The said legislation is undoubtedly one of the most significant enactments of\nindependent India and a landmark in governance. The spirit of the legislation is further\nevident from various provisions thereof which require public authorities to:\n\nA. Publish inter alia:\n\ni) the procedure followed in the decision making process;\n\nii) the norms for the discharge of its functions;\n\niii) rules, regulations, instructions manuals and records used by its employees in\ndischarging of its functions;\n\nPage 3 of 6\n\niv) the manner and execution of subsidy programmes including the amounts\nallocated and the details of beneficiaries of such programmes;\n\nv) the particulars of recipients of concessions, permits or authorizations granted.\n\n[see\nSection 4(1) (b)\n, (iii), (iv), (v); (xii) & (xiii)].\n\nB. Suo moto provide to the public at regular intervals as much information as\npossible [see\nSection 4(2)\n].\"\n\nFurthermore, the Commission observed that the issues raised in the RTI application pertained to\nthe larger public interest and hence the same should be answered in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Act. The Commission therefore referred to the decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in the matter of\nBihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed Hussain Abbas\nRizwi\n: (2012) 13 SCC 61 while explaining the term \"Public Interest\" held:\n\n\"22. The expression \"public interest\" has to be understood in its true connotation so as to\ngive complete meaning to the relevant provisions of the Act. The expression \"public\ninterest\" must be viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions so as to justify denial of\na statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its common parlance, the expression \"public\ninterest\", like \"public purpose\", is not capable of any precise definition. It does not have\na rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the statute in which it occurs, the\nconcept varying with time and state of society and its needs (\nState of Bihar v. Kameshwar\nSingh\n([AIR 1952 SC 252]). It also means the general welfare of the public that warrants\nrecognition and protection; something in which the public as a whole has a stake\n[Black's Law Dictionary (8th Edn.)].\"\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of\nAshok Kumar Pandey vs The State Of West Bengal\n\n(decided on 18 November, 2003Writ Petition (crl.) 199 of 2003) had made reference to the\nfollowing texts for defining the meaning of \"public interest', which is stated as under:\n\n\"Strouds Judicial Dictionary, Volume 4 (IV Edition),'Public Interest' is defined thus:\n\n\"Public Interest (1) a matter of public or general interest does not mean that which is\ninteresting as gratifying curiosity or a love of information or amusement but that in\nwhich a class of the community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest by which their\nlegal rights or liabilities are affected.\"\n\nIn Black's Law Dictionary (Sixth Edition), \"public interest\" is defined as follows :\n\nPublic Interest something in which the public, or some interest by which their legal rights\nor liabilities are affected. It does not mean anything the particular localities, which may\nbe affected by the matters in question. Interest shared by national government....\"\n\nIn\nMardia Chemical Limited v. Union of India\n(2004) 4 SCC 311, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nof India while considering the validity of\nSARFAESI Act\nand recovery of non-performing assets\nby banks and financial institutions in India, recognised the significance of Public Interest and had\nheld as under :\n\n\".............Public interest has always been considered to be above the private interest.\nInterest of an individual may, to some extent, be affected but it cannot have the potential\nof taking over the public interest having an impact in the socio-economic drive of the\ncountry...........\"\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\nEvery action of a Public Authority is expected to be carried out in Public Interest. The Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in the matter of Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi, etc vs. State of UP and\nOrs., 1990 SCR Supl. (1) 625 dated 20.09.1990 wherein it had been held as under:\n\n\"Private parties are concerned only with their personal interest whereas the State\nwhile exercising its powers and discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as is\nexpected of it, for public good and in public interest. The impact of every State\naction is also on public interest.\"\n\nWith regard to providing a clear and cogent response to the Appellant, the Commission referred\nto the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in\nJ P Aggarwal v. Union of India (WP (C\n) no.\n7232/2009 wherein it was held that:\n\n\" 7\"it is the PIO to whom the application is submitted and it is who is responsible for\nensuring that the information as sought is provided to the applicant within the\nstatutory requirements of the Act.\nSection 5(4)\nis simply to strengthen the authority of\nthe PIO within the department; if the PIO finds a default by those from whom he has\nsought information. The PIO is expected to recommend a remedial action to be taken\".\n\nThe RTI Act\nmakes the PIO the pivot for enforcing the implementation of the Act.\"\n\nThe Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the case of\nShri Vivek Mittal v. B.P. Srivastava, W.P.(C\n)\n19122/2006 dated 24.08.2009 had upheld the view of the CIC and observed\n\n\".....that a CPIO cannot escape his obligations and duties by stating that persons\nappointed under him had failed to collect documents and information.\nThe Act\nas\nframed, castes obligation upon the CPIOs and fixes responsibility in case there is\nfailure or delay in supply of information. It is the duty of the CPIOs to ensure that the\nprovisions of the Act are fully complied with and in case of default, necessary\nconsequences follow\".\n\nFurthermore, in OM No. 20/10/23/2007-IR dated 09.07.2009, while elaborating on the duties and\nresponsibilities of the FAA, it was stated that:\n\n\"3. Deciding appeals under the\nRTI Act\nis a quasi judicial function. It is, therefore,\nnecessary that the appellate authority should see that the justice is not only done but it\nshould also appear to have been done. In order to do so, the order passed by the\nappellate authority should be a speaking order giving justification for the decision\narrived at.\n\nFurthermore, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of R.K. Jain vs Union of India, LPA\nNo. 369/2018, dated 29.08.2018, held as under:\n\n\"9................................ That apart, the CPIO being custodian of the information or\nthe documents sought for, is primarily responsible under the scheme of the\nRTI Act\nto\nsupply the information and in case of default or dereliction on his part, the penal\naction is to be invoked against him only.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\nDECISION:\n\nKeeping in view the facts of the case and the submissions made by both the parties and in the\nlight of the decisions of the Superior Courts referred above, it was noted that although the CPIO /\nFAA had technically replied to the RTI application / Appeal of the Appellant but it did not\naddress the substantive queries raised by him. It should be noted that the preamble of the\nRTI\nAct, 2005\nlaid emphasis on greater and effective access to information and providing an effective\nframework for effectuating the right of information recognized under\nArticle 19\nof the\nConstitution of India. The spirit of the Act is laid down the emphasis on progressive,\nparticipatory and meaningful flow of information and maximum disclosures and minimum\nexemptions consistent with the constitutional provisions. Thus, the Respondent failed to capture\nthe spirit of the\nRTI Act, 2005\nand provided evasive and ambiguous replies against the spirit of\nthe Act. The Commission therefore directs the FAA to re-examine the RTI application and in the\nlight of aforesaid judgments for suo moto disclosures under\nSection 4 (1) (b)\nof the RTI Act,\n2005 provide clear, cogent and precise reply to the Appellant within a period of 30 days from the\ndate of receipt of this order respecting the spirit of the Act.\nThe Commission further directs the FAA to disclose all the details in respect of the Reservation\nRoster (Direct Recruitment / Promotion) for different posts on its website in the larger public\ninterest within the above stipulated time frame.\n\nThe Appeal stands disposed with the above direction.\n\n(Uday Mahurkar) (उिय माहूरकर)\n(Information Commissioner) (सूचना आयुक्त)\nAuthenticated true copy\n(अभिप्रमाणित सत्यापित प्रतत)\n\n(R.
