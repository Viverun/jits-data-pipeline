Jagdish was driving tractor nearby\n her. After sometime Jagdish came to her and caught hold her hands. Jagdish\n dragged her to nearby field. Jagdish committed rape on her.

Jagdish was arrested on 1.6.2023. He is in custody ever\n since. On completion of investigation final report was submitted.

Learned counsel also\n submits that all the material witnesses have been examined, therefore, there\n is no likelihood of tampering with remaining evidence by applicant. Learned\n counsel further submits that appellant is aged 35 years. He is a labourer by\n profession. There is no likelihood of his absconsion leaving behind his\n family, home and job. No criminal antecedents is alleged against the\n applicant. Trial would take time to conclude. On these grounds, learned\n counsel prays that learned Special Judge has committed an error in rejecting\n the application for bail, therefore, the impugned order be set aside and\n appellant may be extended the benefit of bail.\n\n Per contra, learned counsel for the State opposes the appeal on the\n ground of gravity of alleged offence and prays for its rejection.\n\n Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: BHUNESHWAR\n\nDATT\n\nSigning time: 01-10-2024\n\n18:37:44\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-IND:28700\n\n 4 CRA-10939-2024\n Considering the arguments advanced by both the parties and overall\n circumstances of the case, while setting aside the order dated 12.9.2024\n passed by the Trial Court, this Court is inclined to release the appellant on\n bail.
