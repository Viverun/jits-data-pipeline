Ankit caught hold\n of her, pressed her and bite her. She sustained injury on cheek and breast.\n Hearing her shouts, her neighbours Puspa and Batobai came to her house.\n Thereafter, Ankit fled away. On such allegations, PS Guna registered FIR at\n Crime No.425 of 2024 for offence punishable under \nSections 354\n, \n324\n, \n458\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: MAHENDRA\n\nBARIK\n\nSigning time: 14-08-2024\n\n10:22:49 PM\n\n 2 MCRC-29540-2024\n of \nIPC\n against Ankit (applicant).

Thereafter, supplementary statement of\n victim was recorded on 15-05-2024, wherein she alleged that Ankit has\n committed rape on her. Earlier, she could not state due to fear of social\n disrepute. Prosecution for offence punishable under \nSections 376\n and \n506\n of\n IPC was added. Applicant is apprehending arrest in the matter. His\n application for anticipatory bail under \nSection 438\n of CrPC stands rejected\n vide order dated 01-07-2024 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Guna.\n\n Learned Counsel for the applicant, in addition to the grounds\n mentioned in the application, submitted that applicant has been falsely\n implicated in this matter. No offence, as alleged is committed by the\n applicant. The allegations of rape are levelled against the applicant after he\n was extended the benefit of bail.

He is labourer by profession. He has not misused the liberty\n extended vide earlier bail order. No criminal antecedent is reported against\n him.
