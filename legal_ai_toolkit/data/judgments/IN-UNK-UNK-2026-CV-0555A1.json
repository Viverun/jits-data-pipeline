No.89/2010 on the file of II Additional\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Ramanagara District, sitting\n\nat Kanakapura. By the impugned judgment and order, the\n\ntrial Court has convicted the appellant for the offences\n\nunder \nSections 302\n and \n398\n of the Indian Penal Code,\n\n1860 and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life\n\nand fine of Rs.50,000/- and in default of payment of fine,\n\nto undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year\n\nfor the offence punishable under \nSection 302\n of IPC and\n\nfurther, the appellant sentenced to rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor seven years for the offence punishable under \nSection\n\n398\n of IPC.\n\n -3-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n 2. The brief facts of the prosecution case are that, on\n\n5.12.2009 at 2.00 p.m. near Neelagiri plantation Forest\n\narea, besides Banagiridoddi Village, accused in order to\n\nrob the gold ornaments of victim Smt. Chikkakempamma\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the deceased) who was grazing\n\ncattle, assaulted on her head and also on forehead with\n\niron chopper, committed murder and thereafter took away\n\nthe gold ornaments i.e., 14 gold gundus, 4 gold lakshmi\n\nkasu, 1 pair of gold earrings and one pair of gold ear\n\nstuds.\n\n 3. Based on the complaint, F.I.R. in Crime\n\nNo.137/2009 was registered against unknown person\n\nunder \nSection 302\n of IPC. A spot mahazar was conducted\n\nand blue colour chappal, wooden club, sample mud and\n\nblood stained mud were seized from the spot. The dead\n\nbody was sent for post-mortem examination. During\n\ninquest mahazar, injuries viz, from middle of the forehead\n\nto left eye, injury on left ear and injury on head were\n\nnoticed. The Doctor conducted post-mortem examination\n\n -4-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nand it was opined that, the deceased died due to cardio\n\nrespiratory arrest as a result of severe head injury.\n\n 4. On 01.04.2010, the accused surrendered before\n\nthe Investigating Officer and gave his voluntary statement\n\nas per Ex.P.10 and at his instance, the Investigating\n\nOfficer seized two lakshmi kasu, two gundu and a pair of\n\nearring from Pawn Shop of Shivaraju (PW-19) and his\n\nsister Girija under mahazars-Exs.P.11 & P.12. Based on\n\nthis material, a charge-sheet was laid against the accused\n\nunder \nSections 302\n and \n398\n of IPC before the\n\nJurisdictional Magistrate. The matter was committed to the\n\nCourt of Sessions and the learned Sessions Judge framed\n\ncharge against the accused for the offence punishable\n\nunder \nSections 302\n and \n398\n of IPC, the accused pleaded\n\nnot guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n 5. In order to prove its case, the prosecution\n\nexamined in all 26 witnesses as P.Ws.1 to 26, got marked\n\ndocuments as per Exs.P1 to P.14 and material objects as\n\nper M.Os.1 to 12. After completion of the evidence, the\n\n -5-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nstatement of the accused under \nSection 313\n of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, 1973, was recorded. The case of the\n\naccused was of total denial and the accused did not\n\nadduce any defence evidence.\n\n 6. Based on the above evidence, the trial Court\n\nframed the following points for consideration:\n\n 1. Has prosecution proved beyond all\n reasonable doubt that accused being the person\n with an intention to rob the gold ornaments\n worn by Smt. Chikkakempamma murdered her\n and thereby committed an offence punishable\n u/s 302 of \nI.P.C\n?\n\n 2. Has prosecution further proved that in\n furtherance of the same accused armed with\n deadly weapon, robbed gold ornaments and\n thereby committed the offence punishable\n u/s\n 398\n of I.P.C.?\n\n 3. What order?\n\n 7. Considering both oral and documentary evidence\n\non record, the trial Court convicted the accused and held\n\n -6-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nthat, the prosecution proved beyond all reasonable doubt\n\nthat, on 5.12.2009 at 2.00 p.m., near Neelagiri plantation,\n\nthe accused committed murder of deceased and robbed\n\nher gold ornaments. Hence, the trial Court convicted the\n\naccused for the aforesaid offences. Aggrieved by the\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence, the accused\n\nhas preferred this appeal.\n\n 8. We have heard Sri A.N. Radha Krishna, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellant/accused,\n\nSri Vijayakumar Majage, learned State Public Prosecutor-\n\nII, for the respondent-State and have examined the\n\nrecords.\n\n 9. Learned counsel for the appellant/accused\n\ncontends that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove\n\nits case. The solitary circumstances relied on the\n\nprosecution is the recovery of the gold ornaments, but the\n\nrecovery is not proved. The material objects are not\n\nproduced before the Court and the same are not identified\n\nby any of the relatives of the deceased. As a result, no\n\n -7-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nmaterial whatsoever was available to connect the accused\n\nto the alleged offences. It is contended that, the extra\n\njudicial confession attributed to the accused is also not\n\nproved. The evidence of PW-8 suggests that himself and\n\naccused were not in a fiduciary relationship. Therefore,\n\nsuch a confession would not have been made by the\n\naccused before him. Barring the above evidence, no other\n\nmaterial is available on record to establish the guilt of the\n\naccused. Thus, he seeks to allow the appeal by acquitting\n\nthe appellant of the above charges.\n\n 10. Learned State Public Prosecutor-II has argued in\n\nsupport of the impugned conviction contending that the\n\nprosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe circumstance of recovery of gold ornaments is proved\n\nby the evidence of PW-22 and these ornaments are duly\n\nidentified by husband and son of the deceased. This\n\nrecovery directly connects the accused to the alleged\n\noffence and establishes that the deceased was murdered.\n\nFurther, the extra judicial confession made by accused to\n\n -8-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nPW-8 clearly makes out the ingredients of the offence of\n\nmurder. Therefore, there is no reason to interfere with the\n\nwell reasoned judgment.\n\n 11. We have bestowed our careful attention on the\n\nsubmissions made at the Bar and have carefully examined\n\nthe records. After hearing the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the parties and on examining the material on record,\n\nwe find serious flaws in the case of the prosecution.\n\n 12. The prosecution has rested its case entirely on\n\ntwo circumstances. The first circumstance relied on by the\n\nprosecution is the recovery of gold ornaments said to be\n\nbelonging to the deceased-Chikkakempamma. The second\n\ncircumstance relied was extra-judicial confession.\n\n 13. In the background of above circumstances, let\n\nus examine the prosecution evidence:\n\n a. PW-1 Basavaraju is the complainant and son of\n\nthe deceased. He has deposed that on 5.12.2009 between\n\n1.30 and 2.30 p.m., when his mother had been to\n\n -9-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nBannagiri Forest for grazing the cattles, he came to know\n\nthat, his mother was murdered in the forest and on\n\ninformation, he reached to the spot, where he noticed\n\ninjuries on forehead and neck of his mother, caused by\n\ndeadly weapon. He noticed that gold ornaments which\n\nwere worn by the deceased were missing. Further, he\n\ndeposed that he has seen the blood stained clothes and\n\nthereafter, lodged the complaint as per Ex.P.1. He further\n\ndeposed that on 30.4.2010, he saw the accused in the\n\ncustody of the Police and came to know that accused\n\ncommitted murder of his mother for robbing her gold\n\nornaments and he has identified the accused before the\n\nCourt. He identified the ornaments shown to him in the\n\nphoto-Ex.P.3, to be his mother's jewelry.\n\n b. PW-2 Ramakrishna is an inquest mahazar witness\n\nand a friend of PW-1. He has deposed that on 6.12.2009,\n\nhe had seen the dead body of the deceased at\n\nGovernment Hospital, Kanakapura, where inquest mahazar\n\nwas conducted and he noticed visible injuries on the dead\n\n - 10 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nbody. The Police also seized clothes of the deceased in his\n\npresence as per M.Os.1 to 4.\n\n c. PW-3 Basavegouda is the husband of the\n\ndeceased. His evidence is similar to that of PW-1. He also\n\ndeposed that he had been to spot, where the Police\n\nconducted mahazar and later, dead body of the deceased\n\nwas shifted to the Government Hospital, Kanakapura. He\n\nfurther deposed that after four months of the incident, the\n\nPolice summoned him to the Police Station, where he\n\nidentified the gold ornaments depicted in photo-Ex.P.3, as\n\nthat of his wife and he came to know that, accused\n\ncommitted murder of his wife.\n\n d. PW-4 Rudrappa is the brother of the deceased.\n\nHe reiterates the evidence of PW-3.\n\n e. PW-5 B.P.Lingesh is a witness to inquest mahazar.\n\nHe has deposed that around five years ago, PW1-\n\nBasavaraju had telephoned him, intimating the death of\n\nhis mother, dead body was found in and around 2km.\n\naway from Kadushivanahalli forest area, body was brought\n\n - 11 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nto Kanakapura Hospital, where inquest was conducted, he\n\nsaw the visible injuries over the head and her left ear was\n\npartly cut and came to know that someone has killed her\n\nwith chopper.\n\n f. PW-6 Desigouda is a witness to inquest mahazar.\n\nHe reiterates the evidence of PW-5. He further deposed\n\nthat the Police along with accused and his sister Girija\n\ncame and took him to Pawn Broker shop situated at\n\nBannergatta Road, where Girija had pledged gold\n\nornaments and Police seized those articles under seizure\n\npanchanama-Exs.P.5 and P.6.\n\n g. PW-7 Lokesha is an inquest mahazar witness. He\n\nhas deposed that on 5.12.2009, he has seen the dead\n\nbody of the deceased at Banagiridoddi Neelagiri Plantation,\n\nthere was grievous injury on her head and forehead, so\n\nalso on ear with chopper and the Police conducted\n\npanchanama as per Ex.P.4 and recovered Hawai Slippers.\n\nHe also deposed that accused produced chopper and waist\n\n - 12 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nthread and Police seized the same and he has identified\n\nthe same as M.Os.2 and 3.\n\n h. PW-8 K.C. Shivaramegowda is an extra judicial\n\nconfession witness. In his evidence, he has deposed that\n\nhe is running one Photo Studio in the name and style of\n\nSpandana at Kodihalli. Accused is from Kadushivanahalli.\n\nChikkakempamma is murdered by accused. He has\n\ndeposed that he had gone to Majestic, Bengaluru, to\n\npurchase material around two months after the death of\n\ndeceased, there he met accused and the accused told him\n\nthat he is going to surrender before the Police as he has\n\nmurdered deceased, so that villagers need not give trouble\n\nto his parents and learnt that for the sake of amount, he\n\nhas murdered deceased with chopper and took away gold\n\nbeads, gold lakshmi kasu and earring. He also deposed\n\nthat accused told him that he has hidden macchu in his\n\nhouse and has pledged the gold ornaments with Pawn\n\nBroker. Further, he has brought the said fact to the notice\n\nof the Police and thereafter, the Police took him to\n\n - 13 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nBannergatta road, where they conducted mahazar as per\n\nExs.P.5 and P.6 by seizing gundus and kasu along with\n\nnose stud. His evidence corroborates the evidence of\n\nPW-6 with regard to conducting seizure panchanama.\n\n j. PW-9 Nagesha is also an inquest witness. He has\n\ndeposed regarding conducting of inquest panchanama on\n\nthe dead body of deceased.\n\n k. PW-10 Muttaramegowda has deposed that on\n\n5.12.2009 between 12.00 noon and 1.00 p.m., when he\n\nhad slept, one lady woke him up and told that wife of\n\nBasavegowda is murdered, he reached Neelagiri grove\n\nForest area, where he noticed that someone had murdered\n\nher and later came to know that Durga was the person,\n\nwho killed her. He has deposed regarding conducting of\n\nmahazar by the Police and accused himself stating that he\n\nmurdered deceased for robbing the articles which are\n\nshown in Ex.P.3-photo.\n\n l. PW-11 Puttamadegowda is a witness to spot\n\npanchanama conducted by the Police as per Ex.P.4, where\n\n - 14 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nPolice seized slippers, club along with blood stained mud,\n\nsample mud and green saree.\n\n m. PW-12 Shivamadegowda is also an inquest\n\nmahazar witness. He has deposed that about 5-6 years\n\nago, when deceased had been to forest area for grazing\n\ncattles, someone murdered her.

PW-13-Devamma, PW-14-Lakshmamma, PW-15-\n\nBasamma, PW-16-Siddaraju and PW-17-Shivaraju are the\n\nhearsay witnesses to the incident.\n\n o.

Hence,\n\nhe issued receipt for the same. After one year, Police\n\ncame to his shop and seized the ornaments mentioned in\n\nthe photo and conducted mahazar as per Ex.P.5.\n\n q. PW-20 Dr. Vivek Dorai conducted post-mortem\n\nexamination on the dead body of deceased as per Ex.P.7\n\nand opined that the death was due to cardio respiratory\n\narrest as a result of severe head injury.\n\n r. PW-21 - Girija is the sister of accused. She is also\n\na witness to seizure mahazar as per Ex.P.5. She has\n\nturned hostile to the case of the prosecution.\n\n s. PW-22 - Manjunatha, Investigating Officer. He\n\ndeposed that he visited the spot, conducted mahazar,\n\nseized material objects and got conducted inquest\n\nmahazar. He also deposed with respect to recording\n\nstatement of witnesses, referring the dead body for\n\nconducting post-mortem examination and also sending of\n\narticles to F.S.L. He further deposed that on 1.4.2010, on\n\nreceiving the information of whereabouts of accused, he\n\n - 16 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\narrested the accused, recorded his voluntary statement,\n\naccused took him to his house and produced the objects\n\nused in commission of offence and he seized the same.\n\nHe further deposed with regard to recovery of gold\n\nornaments pledged with Pawn Broker. After completion\n\nof the investigation, he filed charge-sheet.\n\n t. PW-23 - Premakumara, Engineer, who prepared\n\nthe sketch of the crime spot as per Ex.P.9.\n\n u. PW-24 - Gopala, Police Constable, speaks about\n\ntracing of accused, apprehending him and producing him\n\nbefore his higher Officer.\n\n v. PW-25 - Muthegowda, Sub-Inspector of Police,\n\nreceived the complaint and forwarded the same to the\n\nPolice Station through Venkatesha, Police Constable.\n\n w. PW-26 - Shivanna, Assistant Sub-Inspector of\n\nPolice, registered the First Information Report.\n\n 14. From the perusal of the evidence led by the\n\nprosecution, the prosecution has rested its case entirely on\n\n - 17 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\ntwo circumstances. The first circumstance relied on by the\n\nprosecution is recovery of gold ornaments said to be\n\nbelonging to the deceased. In this regard, the case of the\n\nprosecution is that the accused committed the murder of\n\nthe deceased with an intention to rob the gold ornaments\n\nworn by the deceased.\n\n 15. A perusal of the complaint lodged by the son of\n\nthe deceased creates a serious doubt as to whether the\n\ndeceased was wearing such ornaments on her person at\n\nthe time of the alleged incident. In the complaint-Ex-P1,\n\nthe son of the deceased has stated that at the time of\n\nincident, he was in Bengaluru and he came to know about\n\nthe incident through his father. In the complaint, PW-1\n\nhas not described about any jewelleries. Further, the\n\njewelleries in question were not produced before the Court\n\nfor identification. All the prosecution witnesses merely\n\nidentified the jewelleries appearing in photo-Ex.P.3. This\n\nomission, in our considered opinion, leads to doubt the\n\nvery substratum of the case of the prosecution that the\n\n - 18 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\ndeceased was murdered for gain. If such large items of\n\ngold were missing from the person of the deceased, it\n\nought to have been mentioned in Ex.P1-complaint, but\n\nPW-1 has not described about any missing jewelleries.\n\nThis evidence is inconsistent to the contents of Ex.P1-\n\ncomplaint.\n\n 16. The evidence adduced by the prosecution\n\nregarding recovery of jewellery is far from satisfactory. In\n\nthis regard, the prosecution has relied on the evidence of\n\nPW-8 and PW-19. According to PW-19, Girija sister of the\n\naccused, had pledged ornaments with him and on\n\n06.04.2010, the Police brought the accused to his shop\n\nand at the instance of the accused, he returned the said\n\nornaments to the Police and the same were seized under\n\nmahazar-Ex.P5. He stated that ornaments depicted on\n\nphoto-EX.P3 were the one seized under the mahazar-\n\nEx.P5. If this evidence is to be believed, the said\n\nornaments were pledged by one Girija and not by the\n\naccused. Therefore, the accused leading the Police party to\n\n - 19 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nthe shop of PW-19 and he returning those ornaments at\n\nthe instance of the accused does not arise at all. The\n\nmanner in which PW-19 has deposed before the trial Court\n\ngives a clear indication that PW-19 is a propped up witness\n\nand that he has given his evidence only to suit the case of\n\nthe prosecution. It is not the case of PW-19 that the\n\naccused had anytime come to his shop and had pledged\n\nthe said ornaments with him. If accused had not come to\n\nhis shop at any time, there was absolutely no occasion for\n\nhim to see the accused. Therefore, the very evidence of\n\nPW-19 shows that he is the witness set up by the\n\nInvestigating Officer. Furthermore, PW-19 has not\n\ndescribed the names of ornaments in his evidence.\n\nTherefore, his testimony does not inspire the confidence,\n\nas he has been dealing with jewelleries business and he is\n\nunable to describe about the ornaments pledged with him\n\nby the sister of the accused.\n\n 17. Another serious lapse which dents the case of\n\nthe prosecution is that PW-19 has not identified the gold\n\n - 20 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nornaments said to have been pledged with him. He has\n\nmerely stated in his evidence that the ornaments which\n\nwere pledged by the sister of the accused are seen in\n\nEx.P3-photo, but he has not specifically identified the\n\nornaments appearing in Ex.P3-photo.\n\n 18. The sister of the accused is examined as PW-21\n\nand she has turned hostile to the case of the prosecution.\n\nThe prosecution has not bothered to prove her statement\n\nthrough the Investigating Officer. The statement of this\n\nwitness is not marked. Thereby the recovery said to have\n\nbeen effected through PW-19 has rendered baseless and\n\ntherefore, no reliance could be placed on the said recovery\n\nevidence relied on by the prosecution.\n\n \n19. The Hon'ble Apex Court in a case of \nBOBY v.\n\nSTATE OF KERALA\n reported in 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 50,\n\nheld that, there is not only grammatical but a legal\n\ndistinction between 'may be proved' and 'must be or\n\nshould be proved', and it has been held that, the facts so\n\nestablished should be consistent only with the guilt of the\n\n - 21 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\naccused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on\n\nany other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty and\n\nchain of evidence must be so complete as not to leave any\n\nreasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the\n\ninnocence of the accused and must show that in all human\n\nprobabilities the act must have been done by the accused.\n\nIn the light of these guiding principles, we have to\n\nexamine the present case.\n\n 20. None of the prosecution witnesses have\n\nidentified the seized properties. The property itself is not\n\nproduced before the Court. Except marking of Ex.P3-\n\nphoto, the gold jewellery said to have been robbed from\n\nthe person of the deceased, said to have been recovered\n\nat the instance of the accused is not produced before the\n\ntrial Court. This is fatal to the case of the prosecution.\n\nEven though the learned State Public Prosecutor-II has\n\ntaken up a plea that the property was released to the\n\ncustody of PW-3, husband of the deceased, his evidence in\n\nthis regard is too bald and general in nature.\n\n - 22 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n \n21. Learned State Public Prosecutor-II has placed\n\nreliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\n\ncase of \nSUNDERBHAI AMBALAL DESAI v. STATE OF\n\nGUJARAT\n reported in (2002) 10 SCC 283 with reference\n\nto paragraph Nos.11 and 12 to buttress the point that in\n\nview of marking of the photo-Ex.P3, the non-production of\n\nproperties does not vitiate the identification.\n\n \n22. We have gone through \nthe said judgment\n.\n\nWherein, the Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down the\n\nguidelines in the matter of release of articles seized during\n\nthe course of the investigation. The Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nhas laid down the procedure to be followed while releasing\n\nthe properties to the persons from whose possession the\n\nsaid properties were seized during investigation. The said\n\njudgment does not dispense with the production of the\n\nreleased articles at the time of trial. On the other hand, in\n\nparagraph No.12 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nhas delineated the procedure and has specifically observed\n\nthat while releasing the articles, a bond should be taken\n\n - 23 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nfrom the complainant that said articles would be produced\n\nif required at the time of trial. Further, \nSection 457\n of\n\nCr.P.C. requires the Magistrate to prepare a detailed\n\npanchanama and also to get the photographs attested or\n\ncountersigned by the complainant, accused as well as the\n\nperson to whom the properties are handed over. These\n\ndirections are blissfully ignored by the trial Court. The\n\nphoto-Ex.P3 was neither attested nor was it captured at\n\nthe time of release of the articles to the complainant. This\n\ndocument, on the face of it, indicates that the said\n\nphotograph was a part of the charge-sheet. Therefore, the\n\nargument of the learned State Public Prosecutor-II that\n\nthe photo-Ex.P3 could replace the production of the\n\noriginal articles before the trial Court cannot be accepted.\n\nThat apart, PW-3 has not given his evidence with\n\nreference to Ex.P3. He has nowhere stated in his\n\ndeposition that the articles depicted in Ex.P3 were either\n\nworn by the deceased at the time of the incident or that\n\nthe said articles were returned to him by the trial Court.\n\nSuch factual aspects cannot be inferred or assumed by the\n\n - 24 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nCourt. In the absence of identification of the seized jewels,\n\nthe same cannot be correlated to the accused or deceased.\n\nTherefore, the non-production of the alleged robbed jewels\n\nand the failure of the prosecution to get the said articles\n\nidentified through the prosecution witnesses to connect\n\nthem to the accused renders the case of the prosecution\n\nhighly vulnerable.\n\n \n23. The other judgment relied on by the learned\n\nState Public Prosecutor-II is \nK.W. GANAPATHY v. STATE\n\nOF KARNATAKA\n reported in 2002 Crl.L.J. 3867, also\n\ndoes not enure to the benefit of the prosecution to bring\n\nhome the guilt of the accused. In the said case, it is\n\nobserved that, \"the production of property which has\n\nevidentiary value during evidence is a part of a fair trial.\n\nWith the advanced technology, it is not necessary that the\n\noriginal of the property inevitably has to be preserved for\n\nthe purpose of evidence in the changed context of times.\n\nThe reception of secondary evidence is permitted in law.\"\n\nThe said judgment was rendered under \nSection 457\n of\n\n - 25 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nCr.P.C\n. It has been held therein that when there is a\n\npossibility of having a secondary evidence of said\n\nproperty, it is no longer necessary in law to insist that the\n\nproperty shall be kept intact without alteration and non-\n\nalienation. The said judgment is not applicable to the\n\nfacts of the instant case. As already discussed above,\n\nEx.P3-photo cannot be considered as secondary evidence.\n\nNo mahazar is produced by the prosecution in proof of\n\nreturn of the valuable to the complainant. As a result, the\n\nprosecution has failed to produce either the primary\n\nevidence or the secondary evidence in proof of the alleged\n\nrecovery of the gold ornaments so as to connect the said\n\nevidence to the accused.\n\n 24. There cannot be any dispute regarding the\n\nprinciple that the photograph could be marked in evidence,\n\nwhen it is established that the seized properties were\n\nreturned to the complainant under such photograph. But\n\nwhat we see from the evidence of PW-3 is that, though he\n\nhas stated that Ex.P3 depicts the photo of the ornaments,\n\n - 26 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nhe has nowhere stated in his evidence that they were worn\n\nby the deceased at the time of the incident. He does not\n\nsay that on taking photo-Ex.P3, they were returned to\n\nhim etc.\n\n 25. The charge against the accused is that he robbed\n\nthe gold ornaments from the person of the deceased. As\n\nalready discussed above, the prosecution has utterly failed\n\nto prove that the deceased was found wearing any of\n\nthose ornaments at the time of her death. At the earliest\n\ninstance, while lodging the complaint, PW-1, son of the\n\ndeceased, has nowhere stated that the deceased was\n\nwearing the ornaments when she was found dead. PW-3,\n\nhusband of the deceased, has only stated that on the date\n\nof the incident, the earrings of the victim were missing.\n\nThat apart, the prosecution has also failed to prove that\n\nthe said gold ornaments were recovered at the instance of\n\nthe accused. As already stated above, PW-19 the jeweller,\n\ndoes not state that the said ornaments were handed over\n\nto him by the accused. Therefore, viewed from any angle,\n\n - 27 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nwe find that this evidence produced by the prosecution in\n\nsupport of the alleged recovery is not sufficient to connect\n\nthe accused to the crime.\n\n 26. In view of the discrepancies noted above, in our\n\nview, the benefit of doubt is required to be extended to\n\nthe accused. Moreover, the gold ornaments which were\n\nallegedly robbed are not produced before the trial Court.\n\nNone of the witnesses have stated that the said ornaments\n\nbelonged to the deceased and therefore, the charge\n\nframed against the accused that the alleged murder had\n\ntaken place for gain and the accused had committed the\n\nrobbery of the gold ornaments found on the person of the\n\ndeceased has not been proved, as a result, the conviction\n\nof the accused for the offence punishable under \nSection\n\n398\n of IPC cannot be sustained.\n\n 27. So far as the charge of murder, there are no\n\neyewitnesses to the incident. The only circumstance relied\n\non by the prosecution in support of this charge is the\n\nevidence of PW-8, who is a photographer by profession,\n\n - 28 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\naged 65 years as on the date of recording his evidence.\n\nAccording to him, after two months of the incident, he had\n\nmet the accused at Majestic and at that time, the accused\n\nconfessed before him that he had murdered the deceased.\n\nThough the trial Court has relied on this piece of evidence\n\nas extra judicial confession, in our view, the evidence of\n\nPW-8 does not satisfy the requirement of extra judicial\n\nconfession so as to render the accused guilty for the\n\nmurder of the deceased.\n\n \n28. Regarding the appreciation of evidence in Extra-\n\nJudicial confession, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nSAHADEVAN AND ANOTHER v. STATE OF TAMIL\n\nNADU\n reported in (2012) 6 SCC 403 at paragraph No.16\n\nhas held as follows:\n\n \"16. Upon a proper analysis of the abovereferred\n judgments of this Court, it will be appropriate to\n state the principles which would make an extra-\n judicial confession an admissible piece of evidence\n capable of forming the basis of conviction of an\n accused. These precepts would guide the judicial\n\n - 29 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\nmind while dealing with the veracity of cases where\nthe prosecution heavily relies upon an extra-judicial\nconfession alleged to have been made by the\naccused:\n\n (i) The extra-judicial confession is a\n weak evidence by itself. It has to be\n examined by the court with greater\n care and caution.\n\n (ii) It should be made voluntarily and\n should be truthful.\n\n (iii) It should inspire confidence.\n\n (iv) An extra-judicial confession\n attains greater credibility and\n evidentiary value if it is supported\n by a chain of cogent circumstances\n and is further corroborated by other\n prosecution evidence.\n\n (v) For an extra-judicial confession to\n be the basis of conviction, it should not\n suffer from any material discrepancies\n and inherent improbabilities.\n\n - 30 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n (vi) Such statement essentially has to\n be proved like any other fact and in\n accordance with law.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n \n29. The Hon'ble Apex Court in paragraph No.5 of the\n\njudgment in the case of \nPAWAN KUMAR CHOURASIA v.\n\nSTATE OF BIHAR\n reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC\n\n259, wherein at paragraph No.5, it has held as follows:\n\n \"5. As far as extrajudicial confession is\n concerned, the law is well settled. Generally,\n it is a weak piece of evidence. However, a\n conviction can be sustained on the basis of\n extrajudicial confession provided that the\n confession is proved to be voluntary and\n truthful. It should be free of any inducement.\n The evidentiary value of such confession\n also depends on the person to whom it is\n made. Going by the natural course of\n human conduct, normally, a person would\n confide about a crime committed by him\n only with such a person in whom he has\n implicit faith. Normally, a person would not\n make a confession to someone who is totally a\n\n - 31 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n stranger to him. Moreover, the Court has to be\n satisfied with the reliability of the confession\n keeping in view the circumstances in which it is\n made. As a matter of rule, corroboration is not\n required. However, if an extrajudicial confession\n is corroborated by other evidence on record, it\n acquires more credibility.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 30. The judgments cited supra and the evidence of\n\nPW-8 indicate that the accused was not acquainted with\n\nPW-8. Even if his evidence is believed, it would go to\n\nshow that he met the accused by chance. There is nothing\n\nin the evidence to indicate that there was any transaction\n\nbetween PW-8 and the accused. They were neither friends\n\nnor relatives. There was a huge age difference between\n\nthem. Nothing was elicited to show that accused had\n\nimplicit faith in PW-8. He was not in a position to help the\n\naccused. Therefore, it cannot be believed that the accused\n\nwould approach PW-8 and confess the alleged crime with\n\nhim. The statement of PW-8 does not inspire confidence to\n\nhold that the accused had made such confession to PW-8.\n\n - 32 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n 31. Even otherwise, when the case of the\n\nprosecution is based on circumstantial evidence, it is not\n\nsafe to convict the accused based on a single\n\ncircumstance. The overall consideration of the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, we are of clear view that the\n\nprosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused\n\nbeyond all reasonable doubt. The evidence produced by\n\nthe appellant/accused, at the most, may give rise to a\n\nsuspicion; but the suspicion cannot take the place of proof\n\nso as to hold the accused guilty of the offences charged\n\nagainst him.\n\n \n32. Learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nCHAMAN LAL v. THE STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH\n\nreported in 2020 SCC OnLine SC 988, wherein it has\n\nheld as under:\n\n \"While deciding a criminal appeal on merits, the\n High Court is required to apply its mind to the\n entirety of the case including the evidence on\n\n - 33 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n the record before arriving at its conclusion, the\n Supreme Court reiterated.\n\n \n33. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nSTATE OF\n\nGUJARAT v. BHALCHANDRA LAXMISHANKAR DAVE\n\nreported in LL 2021 SC 58, has held as under:\n\n \"So far as the appeal against the order of\n conviction is concerned, there are no such\n restrictions and the Court of appeal has wide\n powers of appreciation of evidence and the High\n Court has to reappreciate the entire evidence on\n record being a First Appellate Court.\"\n\n 34. On reconsideration of the entire evidence on\n\nrecord, we are of the considered opinion that the evidence\n\nadduced by the prosecution is not sufficient to convict the\n\naccused for the offence of murder and robbery punishable\n\nunder \nSections 302\n and \n398\n of IPC. The trial Court\n\nwithout judicious appreciation of the evidence and\n\napplicable law has erroneously convicted and sentenced\n\nthe accused. Therefore, the impugned judgment and order\n\nare liable to be set aside.\n\n - 34 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:37891-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 5 of 2017\n\n 35. Hence, the following\n ORDER\n i. The Appeal is allowed.\n\n ii.
