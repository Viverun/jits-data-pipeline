Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No. 2347 / 2014\n\nAshok Kumar S/o Shri Mahendra Prasad, Age 31 years, Caste Koli,\nR/o H.No.553/32, Jawahar Jadugar, Ajmer.\n---- Appellant\nVersus\nSmt Jyoti W/o Shri Ashok Kumar, D/o Shri Govind Prasad, Caste\nKoli, R/o 1290/32, Rambagh, Bhagwangunj, Ajmer.\n---- Respondent\n\n_____________________________________________________\nFor Appellant(s) : Mr. Rahul Agarwal\nFor Respondent(s) : Mr. Jai Prakash Gupta\n_____________________________________________________\nHON'BLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIJAY KUMAR VYAS\nOrder on Board\nPer Hon'ble The Chief Justice\n31/01/2017\n\nThe Appellant assails order dated 19.05.2014 of the\n\nFamily Judge, Ajmer dismissing Matrimonial Case No.480/2011\n\ndeclining to grant divorce on grounds of cruelty under\nSection\n\n13(1)(ia)\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to\n\nas 'the Act').\n\nLearned Counsel for the Appellant submits that it was a\n\nmarriage by mutual choice on 08.08.2007. A girl child was born on\n\n06.01.2009 who is presently residing with the Respondent. The\n\ncruel conduct of the Respondent is apparent from her behaviour\n\non 03.04.2011 when she misbehaved with the Appellant and his\n\nmother after they returned at 10.00 pm having met their sister for\n(2 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nwhich the Appellant had also lodged a report before the Alwar\n\nGate Police and matters were pacified only after their intervention.\n\nThe Respondent permanently left the matrimonial home on\n\n21.04.2011. The divorce case was filed by the Appellant on\n\n25.08.2011. The Respondent in retaliation filed a criminal\n\ncomplaint under\nSection 498A\nIPC against the Appellant and his\n\nparents. While the latter were granted anticipatory bail the\n\nAppellant had to undergo imprisonment for approximately one\n\nweek. The trial is still pending which the Respondent actively\n\npursues.\nThe Family Judge had completely erred in appreciation of\n\nevidence and connotation of the word \"cruelty\" in a matrimonial\n\nrelationship by holding that the behaviour of the Respondent\n\nmerely constituted normal skirmish of any married life. The threat\n\nof committing suicide and deliberate consumption of phenyl are\n\nbut proof of cruelty. Merely because there may have been no\n\ndirect evidence in support of the allegations for consumption of\n\nphenyl, was not sufficient ground to disbelieve it especially when it\n\nwas pleaded and stated in his examination-in-chief but no\n\nquestion was asked in cross examination in this regard. The\n\ninstitution of a false criminal case also constitutes cruelty for\n\nwhich reliance was placed on\nK. Srinivas Rao Vs. D A Deepa\n,\n\n(2013) 5 SCC 226.\n\nThe Respondent had levelled wild allegations of the\n\nAppellant having illicit relations with an office colleague Nirmala.\n\nThis allegation per se casting a slur on the character, integrity and\n\nmorality of a married man constitutes cruelty without further\n\nmore. The Family Judge committed an error of record in holding\n(3 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nthat no name of the female colleague had been mentioned by the\n\nAppellant even though the Respondent had disclosed the name in\n\nher additional pleas. Forcing the Appellant to have his separate\n\nhearth, home and kitchen from his other family members while\n\nliving in the same house is further evidence of cruelty. The\n\nRespondent in her written statement alleges that the occurrence\n\nof 03.04.2011 was a figment of imagination while in her evidence\n\nshe admits the occurrence and wishes it away as normal ups and\n\ndowns of a married life. The Respondent in her examination-in-\n\nchief has herself deposed that relations between them soured as\n\nfar back as 2010 on account of the allegations of suspected\n\nrelations between the said Nirmala and the Appellant. The Family\n\nJudge erred in not appreciating that it is the quality of evidence\n\nand not quantity which matters. If the evidence led by the\n\nAppellant and AW-2, Pavnesh established cruelty, the fact that the\n\nAppellant may not have examined his mother and brother was\n\nirrelevant. The presumption by the Family Judge that they would\n\nhave been the best evidence is completely fallacious. The Family\n\nJudge has himself observed that there were inherent\n\ncontradictions in the evidence of the Respondent yet holds the\n\nAppellant cannot derive any advantage from the same. If the\n\nAppellant had established cruelty in behaviour, the contradictions\n\nin the evidence of the Respondent became important.\nIn support\n\nof the submission that threats to commit suicide and allegations of\n\nhaving illicit relations outside the marriage also constituted cruelty\n\nreliance was placed on\nNarendra Vs. K. Meena\n, (2016) 9 SCC 455.\n\n(4 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nLearned Counsel for the Respondent did not dispute the\n\nfact that pursuant to the criminal prosecution, the Appellant was\n\ntaken into custody but for one or two days only. The Respondent\n\nnever made any allegations of illicit relations or adulterous\n\nbehaviour against the Appellant. Her allegations that the Appellant\n\nwould have long conversations with the office colleague Nirmala\n\nmay be suggestive of possessive behaviour but cannot constitute\n\ncruelty. It was denied that the Appellant was ever pressed to live\n\nseparately from his parents. The Family Judge has rightly\n\ndisbelieved the allegations of the Respondent having consumed\n\nphenyl, vomited and refused to go for medical treatment as there\n\nwas no evidence in support of the same. The parties had married\n\nof their own choice. The marriage worked well from 2007 to 2011.\n\nThe first occurrence was on 03.04.2011. The Appellant alleges\n\nthat the Respondent left the matrimonial home on 21.04.2011 but\n\nit is his own case that on 15.04.2011 he had approached the local\n\npolice with a complaint. It is indeed surprising that he was\n\ncomplaining to the police against his own wife who was still living\n\nwith him till then, which on the contrary constitutes cruelty\n\ntowards the Respondent.\n\nIt was lastly submitted that if demands for dowry had\n\nbeen made and a criminal case under 498A\nIPC\nhad been lodged\n\nwhich is still pending trial, it cannot be said at this stage per se\n\nthat lodging of the case constituted cruelty. Whether it would\n\namount to cruelty or not would depend upon the ultimate outcome\n\nof the trial. If the Appellant and his family members are honorably\n\nacquitted, the matter would be different from a case of acquittal\n(5 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\non grounds of benefit of doubt.\n\nWe have considered the submissions on behalf of the\n\nparties, perused the materials and evidence on record.\n\nThe marriage between the Appellant and the\n\nRespondent was solemnized as per their own individual choice for\n\neach other on 08.08.2007. The evidence also reveals that there\n\nwas some opposition to it from the Respondent's mother. The\n\nrelationship and behaviour of the Appellant and the Respondent\n\nnaturally had to be different when they were courting and wooing\n\neach other as undoubtedly both of them would have been on their\n\nbest behaviour to impress the other that they were the ideal life\n\npartner. Both the Appellant and the Respondent are\n\nPostgraduates. After matrimony, the relationship and behaviour\n\nundergoes a complete metamorphosis as the parties start to live\n\nunder one roof. At this stage, as part of normal human behaviour,\n\nindividual choices and expectations start surfacing involuntarily as\n\na reflection and manifestation of the individual personality.\n\nA marriage has to worked upon to make it successful\n\nand neither spouse can take the other for granted. But it is not\n\nevery conduct in a matrimonial relationship which will constitute\n\ncruelty. There may be instances of incompatibility, need for\n\nadjustment with each other and at times there may also be need\n\nto overlook the faults of each other for an enduring long term\n\nrelationship. Differences in thinking and behaviour by itself cannot\n\nbe said to constitute cruelty. Likewise the expectation of a spouse\n\nthat the other alone must show accommodation and adjustment\n\nalso cannot constitute cruelty by itself.\n\n(6 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nCruelty finds no definition in the Act. Its meaning and\n\nconnotation cannot be decided and considered in the abstract but\n\nwill have to be deciphered in the facts of each case. Cruelty in\n\nbehaviour essentially means a conduct of a nature in personal\n\nrelations which is of such a character, magnitude and recurrence\n\nmaking it not merely difficult but impossible for one spouse to live\n\nday to day with the other. In other words, it not only creates a\n\nfear of harm physically but causes such mental stress and agony\n\nthat it shatters the personality morale and humanity of the other\n\nspouse. It has its impact on the mental state of the other spouse\n\ncreating a sense of abhorrence, fear and not simply an inability to\n\nco-exist with each other. Any marriage would have differences of\n\nopinion, thinking and behaviour. Such conduct would not by itself\n\ntantamount to cruelty. While a single instance of cruelty may be\n\nsufficient in certain situations, in others, it may be a course of\n\nconduct which creates and constitutes cruelty. It is therefore not\n\npossible to give it a precise definition.\nIn (1975) 2 SCC 326\n\n(\nN.G.Dastane (Dr.) v. S.Dastane\n), it was observed:-\n\n\"34......In many marriages each party can, if it so\nwills, discover many a cause for complaint but such\ngrievances arise mostly from temperamental\ndisharmony. Such disharmony or incompatibility is not\ncruelty and will not furnish a cause for the dissolution\nof marriage. We will therefore have regard only to\ngrave and weighty incidents and consider these to find\nwhat place they occupy on the marriage canvas......\"\n\nIn (2007) 4 SCC 511 :\nSamar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh\ndealing with\n\nthe term mental cruelty it was observed as follows:-\n\n\"98. On proper analysis and scrutiny of the judgments of\nthis Court and other Courts, we have come to the definite\nconclusion that there cannot be any comprehensive\n(7 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\ndefinition of the concept of 'mental cruelty' within which\nall kinds of cases of mental cruelty can be covered. No\ncourt in our considered view should even attempt to give\na comprehensive definition of mental cruelty.\n\n99. Human mind is extremely complex and human\nbehaviour is equally complicated. Similarly human\ningenuity has no bound, therefore, to assimilate the entire\nhuman behaviour in one definition is almost impossible.\nWhat is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in\nother case. The concept of cruelty differs from person to\nperson depending upon his upbringing, level of sensitivity,\neducational, family and cultural background, financial\nposition, social status, customs, traditions, religious\nbeliefs, human values and their value system.\n\n100. Apart from this, the concept of mental cruelty cannot\nremain static; it is bound to change with the passage of\ntime, impact of modern culture through print and\nelectronic media and value system etc. etc. What may be\nmental cruelty now may not remain a mental cruelty after\na passage of time or vice versa. There can never be any\nstrait-jacket formula or fixed parameters for determining\nmental cruelty in matrimonial matters. The prudent and\nappropriate way to adjudicate the case would be to\nevaluate it on its peculiar facts and circumstances while\ntaking aforementioned factors in consideration.\n\n101. No uniform standard can ever be laid down for\nguidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some\ninstances of human behaviour which may be relevant in\ndealing with the cases of 'mental cruelty'. The instances\nindicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only\nillustrative and not exhaustive.\n\n(i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of the\nparties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as would\nnot make possible for the parties to live with each other\ncould come within the broad parameters of mental cruelty.\n\n(ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial\nlife of the parties, it becomes abundantly clear that\nsituation is such that the wronged party cannot\nreasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and\ncontinue to live with other party.\n\n(iii) Mere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount to\ncruelty, frequent rudeness of language, petulance of\nmanner, indifference and neglect may reach such a degree\nthat it makes the married life for the other spouse\nabsolutely intolerable.\n\n(iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep\nanguish, disappointment, frustration in one spouse caused\nby the conduct of other for a long time may lead to\n(8 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nmental cruelty.\n\n(v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating\ntreatment calculated to torture, discommode or render\nmiserable life of the spouse.\n\n(vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of one\nspouse actually affecting physical and mental health of the\nother spouse. The treatment complained of and the\nresultant danger or apprehension must be very grave,\nsubstantial and weighty.\n\n(vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect,\nindifference or total departure from the normal standard\nof conjugal kindness causing injury to mental health or\nderiving sadistic pleasure can also amount to mental\ncruelty.\n\n(viii) The conduct must be much more than jealousy,\nselfishness, possessiveness, which causes unhappiness\nand dissatisfaction and emotional upset may not be a\nground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental\ncruelty.\n\n(ix) Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear\nof the married life which happens in day to day life would\nnot be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of\nmental cruelty.\n\n(x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole and a\nfew isolated instances over a period of years will not\namount to cruelty. The ill-conduct must be persistent for a\nfairly lengthy period, where the relationship has\ndeteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and\nbehaviour of a spouse, the wronged party finds it\nextremely difficult to live with the other party any longer,\nmay amount to mental cruelty.\n\n(xi) If a husband submits himself for an operation of\nsterilization without medical reasons and without the\nconsent or knowledge of his wife and similarly if the wife\nundergoes vasectomy or abortion without medical reason\nor without the consent or knowledge of her husband, such\nan act of the spouse may lead to mental cruelty.\n\n(xii) Unilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse for\nconsiderable period without there being any physical\nincapacity or valid reason may amount to mental cruelty.\n\n(xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband or wife after\nmarriage not to have child from the marriage may amount\nto cruelty.\n\n(xiv) Where there has been a long period of continuous\nseparation, it may fairly be concluded that the\nmatrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes\na fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to\nsever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the\nsanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant\nregard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In\nsuch like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty.\"\n\n(9 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nThe Appellant alleged that the everyday behaviour of\n\nthe Respondent was cruel with a tendency to pick up fights for no\n\nrhyme or reason. She leveled unsubstantiated allegations of\n\nextramarital affair against the Appellant. It is difficult to accept it\n\nas simply possessive behaviour. The impact of the allegation and\n\nits manner made has to be considered not from others point of\n\nview but as understood by the aggrieved spouse dependent on the\n\nkind of society and strata that they belonged to. In a normal\n\nIndian society if one spouse were to allege that the other spouse\n\nappeared unnecessarily close another member of the opposite\n\nsex, it naturally has connotations of infidelity in the marriage. On\n\none occasion the Respondent had attempted to cut her veins and\n\ncommit suicide which caused gross fear and apprehension in the\n\nmind of the Appellant. She would threaten to implicate him and\n\nhis family in false cases and ruin their lives. The Respondent\n\nwould pressurise him to separate in hearth and home from his\n\nfamily. The allegation of misbehaviour on 03.04.2011 at about\n\n10.00 pm was made compelling the Appellant to approach the\n\nAlwar Gate Police when matters were pacified. The Respondent on\n\none occasion after abusing and threatening to commit suicide,\n\nconsumed phenyl and her life was saved by forcing her to vomit.\n\nIn his evidence in chief, the Appellant deposed that she\n\nwould invariably threaten to involve them in a dowry case as also\n\nthe phenyl incident. While returning from the Ganesh Temple, she\n\ntried to jump off a motorcycle. She would vent her anger at the\n\nminor child. On 03.04.2011 she had banged her head on the wall\n(10 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nat 10.00 pm and because of the commotion people of the locality\n\nassembled which finds corroboration from the evidence of AW-2,\n\nPavnesh. The Respondent then left the matrimonial home with\n\nPintu, the son of the uncle of the Appellant. In cross examination,\n\nthe Respondent did not ask any questions with regard to the\n\nphenyl incident, her banging her head on the wall, threats to\n\ncommit suicide and implicate them in false cases much less give\n\nany suggestion that the Appellant was deposing falsely.\n\nThe Respondent in her examination-in-chief\n\nacknowledged that it was a marriage by individual preference for\n\neach other and that relations between them did see normal\n\nskirmishes after the marriage. The birth of the daughter on\n\n06.01.2009 and the function in respect of the same on 09.02.2009\n\nwas not disputed. Relations between them got soured the same\n\nday but they continued to live as man and wife. According to the\n\nRespondent the relationship really got soured in 2010 when the\n\nAppellant's office colleague started to frequently call him. Despite\n\nher allegation that she would be beaten up, neither in her\n\npleadings nor evidence was there any material with regard to any\n\nspecific date of occurrence or manner of assault and by whom it\n\nwas except omnibus statements. She acknowledges that she did\n\nnot complain to anyone or lodge a police case when the\n\nAppellant's younger brother Pappu had allegedly beaten her.\n\nReiterating that she was desirous to revive the matrimonial\n\nrelationship she acknowledged that the function of 09.02.2009\n\nwas organized by the Appellant and his family members when her\n\nfather had chided the Appellant that he should have been hosting\n(11 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nthe function with his own money rather than that of his parents.\n\nIf the parties were married in 2007 on account of love\n\nfor each other, it is difficult to understand and appreciate how\n\ndemands for dowry surfaced four years later suddenly and that\n\ntoo after the Appellant lodged the divorce case. There is no\n\nmaterial on record with regard to any event or occurrence\n\nconcerning dowry prior to the same except omnibus allegations. If\n\nthe allegations were true the Respondent could undoubtedly have\n\nled the evidence of her own family members in support of the\n\nsame. In cross examination she acknowledged in general terms\n\nthat the mother of the Appellant assaulted her only on 03.04.2011\n\nbut without any further details of the same.\n\nThe question that arises for our consideration is if the\n\nconduct of the Respondent will constitute the daily skirmish of a\n\nmarried life with differences of opinion and individuality requiring\n\ncompromise and adjustment between the spouses or does it go\n\nbeyond the realm of the same to constitute cruelty as defined by\n\njudicial precedents in a matrimonial relationship. There can be no\n\ntwo opinions that for a spouse to cast aspersions of infidelity on\n\nthe other spouse and a slur on his integrity suggesting he was\n\nhaving an extramarital affairs outside the marriage will\n\nundoubtedly constitute cruelty. Similarly to threaten suicide, cut\n\nher own vein, consume phenyl and ask the Appellant to separate\n\nin hearth and home from his parents will undoubtedly constitute\n\ncruelty. The act of banging her head on the wall at night leading to\n\nthe neighbours assembling are all but evidence of cruelty. It is the\n\ncumulative effect of the behaviour which will form the test and not\n(12 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nas isolated incidents. We have therefore no hesitation in holding\n\nthat the conduct of the Respondent undoubtedly constituted\n\ncruelty as it had the effect of tarnishing not only the Appellant's\n\nown self esteem, devotion to the family but also could have ruined\n\nhis reputation in public.\n\nWe regret our inability to concur with the submission\n\nthat so long as the criminal trial is pending and the matter is\n\nsubjudice, it would not constitute cruelty. The manner and time\n\nwhen the allegations came to be made combined with the parents\n\nof the Appellant having to take anticipatory bail and the Appellant\n\nhaving had to undergo custody do constitute acts of cruelty.\n\nIn\nK. Srinivas Rao\n(supra), relied upon by the\n\nAppellant, the following observations are considered relevant in\n\nthe facts of the present case:-\n\n\"14. in Vijay kumar Bhate disgusting accusations\nof unchastity and indecent familiarity with a neighbour\nwere made in the written statement. This Court held\nthat the allegations are of such quality, magnitude and\nconsequence as to cause mental pain, agony and\nsuffering amounting to the reformulated concept of\ncruelty in matrimonial law causing profound and\nlasting disruption and driving the wife to feel deeply\nhurt and reasonably apprehend that it would be\ndangerous to live with her husband.\n\n16. Thus, to the instances illustrative of mental cruelty\nnoted in Samar Ghosh, we could add a few more.\nMaking unfounded indecent defamatory allegations\nagainst the spouse or his or her relatives in the\npleadings, filing of complaints or issuing notices or\nnews item which may have adverse impact on the\nbusiness prospect or the job of the spouse and filing\nrepeated false complaints and cases in the court\nagainst the spouse would, in the facts of a case,\namount to causing mental cruelty to the other spouse.\n\n(13 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nIn\nNarendra Vs. K. Meena\n(supra), allowing the appeal\n\nit was held that threats of suicide by the wife would definitely\n\nconstitute cruelty ruining the sanity, peace of mind, career of the\n\nother spouse with its attendant legal consequences causing\n\ntremendous stress which itself was distressing.\n\nLikewise any pressure to live separate in her hearth\n\nand home from the family upon the husband would also constitute\n\ncruelty. Similarly, the allegations of an extramarital affair\n\nunsubstantiated pertaining to one's character was torturous and\n\ndid constitute cruelty.\n\nThe Family Judge grossly erred in appreciation of\n\nevidence and without proper analysis of the case put forth by the\n\nAppellant posed to himself a wrong question with regard to\n\nwithholding of best evidence by failure to lead evidence of the\n\nmother and brother of the Appellant to arrive at a faulty\n\nconclusion of unsubstantiated allegations. The conclusion that the\n\ncontradictions in the evidence of the Respondent were\n\ninconsequential is clearly unsustainable in the facts and\n\ncircumstance of the case. The finding that the behaviour of the\n\nRespondent constituted only normal skirmish and ups and downs\n\nof a married life is also clearly unsustainable in law.\n\nThe application under\nSection 24\nof the Act filed during\n\nthe pendency of the appeal looses its relevance now without\n\nprejudice to the rights of the Respondent in accordance with law.\n\n(14 of 14)\n[CMA-2347/2014]\n\nResultantly, the order under appeal dated 19.05.2014\n\nis set aside and the appeal is allowed.\n\n(VIJAY KUMAR VYAS)J.

LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT SUBMITS THAT IT WAS A  MARRIAGE BY MUTUAL CHOICE ON 08.08.2007. A GIRL CHILD WAS BORN ON  06.01.2009 WHO IS PRESENTLY RESIDING WITH THE RESPONDENT.
