The question involved is whether the respondent­employees are\n\nentitled to pension on completion of 15 years of service as per the\n\nState Bank of India Voluntary Retirement Scheme (for short, “the VRS\n\nframed in 2000”).\n\n2. The matter has been referred to larger Bench due to conflict of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nopinion between the Judges as to the admissibility of pension under\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nNARENDRA PRASAD\n\nDate: 2020.03.02\n\n16:52:03 IST\n\nReason:\n\nthe VRS.\n3. After obtaining approval of the Government of India, the Indian\n\nBank Association (IBA) evolved a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The\n\nCentral Board of Directors of the State Bank of India (in short ‘the\n\nSBI’) adopted and approved the scheme in its meeting held on\n\n27.12.2000 for implementing the VRS for the employees of the bank\n\nby retiring them on completion of 15 years of service with the benefit\n\nprovided in the scheme. The scheme had been drawn up, keeping in\n\nview the guidelines issued by the IBA. “Memorandum” dated\n\n26.12.2000 was submitted by the Deputy Managing Director and the\n\nCorporate Development Officer for according approval to the proposals\n\ncontained in the Memorandum as also for adopting the scheme as\n\nAnnexure ‘B’ to the Memorandum.\n\n4. The basis of Memorandum dated 26.12.2000, was the advice by\n\nIBA vide letter dated 31.8.2000 in which it was pointed out that they\n\ndeliberated with the Government of India, Ministry of Finance\n\n(Banking Division), at its meeting with the Finance Minister, with\n\nChief Executives of public sector banks on 13.6.2000. The human\n\nresource and manpower planning in public sector banks were\n\nreviewed, and a Committee was constituted to examine the issues\n\nconcerned to public sector banks and to suggest suitable remedial\n\nmeasures. The Committee considered the economic reforms set in\nmotion in the year 1990, the high establishment cost and low\n\nproductivity in public sector banks. It was felt that the banks convert\n\ntheir human resource into assets compatible with the business\n\nstrategies through a variety of measures. The data available indicated\n\nthat 43% of the employees in public sector banks were in the 46 + age\n\ngroup, and only 12% were in the 25­35 age group. It was felt that this\n\npattern has severe implications for the banks regarding mobility,\n\ntraining, development of skills, and succession plans for higher­level\n\npositions. The workforce was in excess. In order to remedy the\n\nsituation, the Committee placed before the Government two schemes,\n\nviz., Sabbatical Leave, and a Voluntary Retirement Scheme. The IBA\n\nvide letter dated 13.7.2000 sought no objection from the Government\n\nfor circulating the schemes to the banks for consideration and\n\nadoption by their Boards. The Government conveyed on 29.8.2000\n\nthat it did not have any objection for adopting and implementing the\n\nscheme by the respective Board of Directors. It advised that the banks\n\nmay adopt these schemes for sabbatical leave and voluntary\n\nretirement based on the essential features of the schemes given in the\n\nannexure to the letter. The scheme provided eligibility for all\n\npermanent employees with 15 years of service. It provided for amount\n\nof ex gratia and other benefits accepted by the Government of India\n\nwhich were to be provided (i) gratuity as per the\nGratuity Act\n/service\ngratuity, as the case may be; (ii) pension (including commuted value of\n\npension)/bank’s contribution towards provident fund; and (iii) leave\n\nencashment as per rules.\n\n5. After the Central Board of SBI approved the proposals contained\n\nin the memorandum on 27.12.2000, a circular was issued on\n\n29.12.2000 in which it was mentioned that the IBA advised that as the\n\nCommittee constituted by the Finance Ministry recommended\n\nintroduction of a VRS in order to rationalise the manpower, the\n\nGovernment of India has no objection for adopting and implementing\n\nthe VRS. It was clearly stated in the Circular dated 29.12.2000 that\n\nthe Central Board of Directors accorded approval for adopting and\n\nimplementing the SBI voluntary Retirement Scheme drawn up,\n\n“keeping in view the guidelines issued by the IBA.\" Copy of the scheme\n\nwas placed as Annexure B. The scheme was open from 15.1.2001 till\n\n31.1.2001. Specimen applications and other related forms inter alia for\n\npension were also circulated, which formed part of the circular. The\n\ncircular also made it clear that gratuity, provident fund contribution\n\nas per the Provident Fund Rules, pension in terms of the SBI\n\nEmployees’ Pension Fund Rules, leave encashment to be provided\n\nbeside the amount of ex gratia.\n6. The heart and soul of the scheme were that benefits to be given\n\non completion of 15 years of service. The eligibility for benefits was\n\nprovided to those who had completed 15 years of service as on\n\n31.12.2000.\n\n7. The SBI submitted that it reserved a right under the scheme to\n\nmodify, amend or cancel it or any of the clauses and to give effect to it\n\nfrom any date deemed fit. The Deputy Managing Director­cum­CDO\n\nwas the competent authority for the purpose. As specific queries were\n\nraised, a clarification was issued by the Deputy Managing Director on\n\n15.1.2001, in which about a query whether an employee on\n\ncompleting 15 years of pensionable service as on the relevant date of\n\nretirement, would be entitled to pensionary benefits, in response, para\n\n6(c) of the scheme was reiterated, and it was also mentioned that as\n\nper the existing rules, employees who had not completed 20 years of\n\npensionable service, were not eligible for pension.\n\n8. The clarification issued by the Deputy General Manager was not\n\nin the form of modification or amendment of the scheme. The Deputy\n\nGeneral Manager in clarification quoted the provisions and simply\n\nstated the position of a rule that the pensionable service was 20 years.\n\nThe communication was clarificatory and did not have the effect of\n\nmodifying the SBI VRS scheme as approved and adopted.\n9.(a) Radhey Shyam Pandey questioned the refusal of the bank to pay\n\npension, vide communication dated 26.9.2006 in the writ application\n\nfiled in the High Court at Allahabad. He retired on 31.3.2001 under\n\nthe SBI VRS. On 18.3.2001, the bank accepted the offer of the\n\nemployee to retire him voluntarily. He was aged 59 years three months\n\nand had nine months service still to go before attaining the age of\n\nsuperannuation. On 31.3.2001, when the VRS became effective, he\n\nhad put in 19 years, nine months, and 18 days of pensionable service.\n\nHe had to retire on completion of 60 years, and would have put in a\n\nlittle more than 20 years of pensionable service.\n\n(b) The High Court held that the case of the employee fell under the\n\nSecond Part of Rule 22(i)(a). He was in service of the bank on and after\n\n11.11.1993 and completed ten years of pensionable service, and\n\nfurther, he attained the age of 58 years before the date he retired. The\n\nHigh Court opined that the clarification was not part of the VRS\n\nscheme. The employee retired outside rule as per the contractual\n\nretirement scheme. The contract had to prevail. In Pension Fund\n\nRules, Clause (a) in Rule 22(i) was inserted to give the employees the\n\nbenefit of pension after ten years of pensionable service even if they\n\nhad joined late. The High Court found that the matter was covered by\n\nRule 22(i)(a). The admissible benefit cannot be denied. If a contracting\nparty is entitled to take benefit of a permissible clause, then it cannot\n\nbe denied to him.\n\n(c) In the Chairman, State Bank of India & Ors. v. Mihir Kumar Nandi\n\n& Anr. (C.A. Nos. 5035­5037/2012), a Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt of Calcutta dismissing the intra­court appeal, affirmed the order\n\nof the learned Single Judge and directed to make the payment of\n\npension. The employee was appointed on 21.5.1988. He opted for VRS\n\non 15.1.2001. The acceptance was conveyed on 17.3.2001 by which\n\nhe was informed that he would be relieved of his duties on 31.3.2001.\n\nVide letter dated 2.8.2001, the employee was granted a pension at the\n\nrate of Rs.1024 per month. However, vide communication dated\n\n30.8.2001, the pension payment order, together with payment of\n\ncommuted value, was stopped in view of the amendment of Rule 22 of\n\nthe Pension Fund Rules. Though the amendments in Pension Fund\n\nRules were made effective with effect from 31.3.2001, and the age of\n\nretirement had been raised from 58 years to 60 years, w.e.f.\n\n22.5.1998, this had necessitated increase in age for admission to\n\nPension Fund to 58 years specified in Rule 22(i)(a) of the Rules so that\n\nthe employees who have retired/are retiring on attaining the age of 60\n\nyears after completing ten years of pensionable service on or after\n\n22.5.1998 are eligible for pension.\n(d) The Central Board of the SBI in its meeting held on 30.1.2001\n\naccorded approval to the amendment in Rules 8 and 22(i)(a) of the\n\nRules as set out in Annexure 1. The Trustees of the SBI Employees’\n\nPension Fund in their meeting on 30.10.2001 adopted the amended\n\nrules. Consequently, a Circular was issued on 8.11.2001. The\n\namendment was given effect from 31.3.2001, the date on which it was\n\nnotified, though it was adopted by the Trustees of the SBI Trust\n\nPension Fund in October 2001.\n\n(e) A Division Bench of the High Court held respondent­employee,\n\nas per rules on 17.3.2001, the date on which his offer was accepted,\n\nwas eligible to get the pension. On 31.3.2001, the amended rules were\n\npublished, which took away the existing right to get the pension. In\n\nVRS Scheme, it was mentioned that the pension would be payable in\n\naccordance with the rules as on 31.3.2001. The employee had no\n\nmeans of knowing about the future amendment of the Pension Rules,\n\nwhich would be detrimental to his interest. If he had known the fact,\n\nthen he would not have opted for the scheme. The silence maintained\n\nby the employer in such a situation amounted to a fraud on its part.\n\nThe High Court relied upon\nsection 17\nof the Contract Act and\n\nIllustration (d) to\nsection 19\nof the Contract Act. The High Court\n\nfurther held that it was the duty of the employer to disclose that there\n\nwould be a future amendment on the last date of their service by\nwhich their right to pension would be taken away. The same cannot\n\nbut be said to be unfair and arbitrary. Thus, the High Court held that\n\naction is violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. The\n\nemployee is entitled to the relief of pension along with interest.\n\n10. Ramesh Prasad Nigam (supra) had joined the services in 1984 in\n\nthe clerical cadre and was confirmed on 2.3.1985. He had applied for\n\nVRS, having completed 15 years of service and 57 years of age. The\n\nclarification was internal circulation. It was not within the knowledge\n\nof employees; as such, he was entitled to the pension.\n\n11. (a) In C.A. Nos.2287­88/2010, M.P. Hallan joined the services of\n\nthe bank on 18.5.1981 as a clerk. The acceptance under VRS was\n\ncommunicated on 17.3.2001. On 27.3.2001, he applied to withdraw\n\nhis request made under VRS as retirement was w.e.f. 31.3.2001. The\n\nBank declined application on 18.4.2001 on the ground that the last\n\ndate of withdrawal of the application was 15.2.2001. The employee\n\nclaimed pension under Pension Fund Rules in terms of SBI\n\nEmployees’ Pension Fund Rules (hereinafter referred to as ‘Pension\n\nRules’). By writing a letter on 12.4.2001, the claim of the employee for\n\nwithdrawal of application for voluntary retirement, pension, and leave\n\nencashment was again declined on 4.7.2001. Thereafter, he filed a writ\n\npetition in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana.\n(b) The High Court rejected the claim concerning the withdrawal\n\nfrom VRS. As the last date for withdrawal was over, and acceptance\n\nhad been communicated, however, considering Rule 22 of the Pension\n\nRules, the High Court opined that as the employee completed more\n\nthan 19 years and ten months of service on 31.3.2001, therefore, the\n\nfirst part of clause one of Rule 22 is not applicable. Further, the third\n\npart of clause (a) is not applicable as he has completed ten years of\n\nservice but not attained the age of 60 years. The case of the employee\n\nwas covered under the second part of clause (a) of Rule 22, which\n\nenabled the member to get a pension if an employee in the service of\n\nthe bank on or after 1.11.1993, and completed ten years pensionable\n\nservice and attained 58 years age. The employee applied in terms of\n\nthe Pension Rules prevailing in January 2001. Alternatively, if an\n\nemployee was in service of the bank on or after 1.11.1993, having\n\ncompleted ten years of pensionable service and on attaining the age of\n\n58 years, shall be entitled to a pension. Thus, he fulfilled the\n\nrequirement of second part of clause (a) of Rule 22 as he was in\n\nservice of the bank on 1.11.1993 and completed ten years of\n\npensionable service, and the age of 58 years, therefore, in terms of\n\nRule 22, he was entitled to pension as well as leave encashment dues\n\nalong with interest at the rate of 9 percent per annum.\n12. On behalf of the bank, it was submitted that VRS 2000\n\nstipulated that the pension in terms of SBI Pension Fund Rules on the\n\nrelevant date, i.e., 31.3.2001, was to be provided. In other words, in\n\ncase the employee was entitled to a pension in terms of Pension Rules\n\nand not otherwise. A provision was added in Rule 22(1) of the Pension\n\nRules in the year 1986, accordingly, the pension was to be granted in\n\nall cases relating to voluntary retirement on completion of 20 years of\n\nservice. The employees opting for the SBI­VRS would be governed only\n\nby Rule 22(i)(c) as it falls under the category of voluntary retirement.\n\nUnder Rule 22(iii), a member who has been permitted to retire under\n\nclause 22(i)(c) shall be entitled to a proportionate pension, which is on\n\ncompletion of 20 years of pensionable service. Eligibility clause 3 has\n\nnothing to do with the admissibility of the pension. It was further\n\nsubmitted that the employees who completed ten years of pensionable\n\nservice and were 60 years of age were entitled to pension; while\n\nemployees under the VRS on completion of 15 years would not get\n\npension and for that 20 years' service was necessary, the submission\n\nof employees that it would be discriminatory is based on incorrect\n\npremise. There is no challenge to the SBI Pension Rules or SBI­VRS.\n\nThe bank provided the pensionable service period of 10 years on\n\nattaining the age of 60 years in terms of reservation policy. The bank\n\nappoints late entrants like ex­servicemen who, after serving in Armed\nForces, join the bank and are left only with about ten years of service\n\nbefore they attain the age of superannuation. It is to grant benefit to\n\nsuch a particular category of employees that a period of 10 years on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation of 60 years was provided in Rule\n\n22(i)(a).\n\n13. The appellants further submitted that 20 years' period is\n\nprovided in case of voluntary retirement to ensure that an employee\n\non whom the bank has spent a considerable amount during training,\n\nworks for a substantial period before he seeks retirement. It is a\n\nuniform policy followed by the bank.\nRegulation 28\nwas amended in\n\n2002 providing for 15 years of service. It applies to the employees who\n\nare governed by the Bank Employees' Pension Regulations, 1995.\n\nThese regulations do not apply to SBI employees as the SBI Pension\n\nRules govern them. SBI employees are entitled to Provident Fund,\n\ngratuity and pension in terms of the Rules on completion of 20 years\n\nof service. Thus, there cannot be any comparison of SBI employees\n\nwith the employees of other nationalised banks. The clarification dated\n\n11.01.2000 has also been relied on by the bank. Now more than 19\n\nyears have passed and to grant a pension to all those who have\n\nretired, w.e.f. 1.4.2001 would cast a huge financial liability on the\n\nbank.\n14. It was submitted on behalf of the employees that the decision\n\nrendered by the High Court is appropriate. No case for interference is\n\nmade out in appeals. The very essence of the VRS was the\n\nadmissibility of pension on completion of 15 years of service and other\n\nbenefits. Once the scheme was adopted and approved by the Central\n\nBoard of SBI, the clarification could not have been made to the\n\ndetriment of employees. The clarification did not have effect of the\n\namendment, modification, or cancellation of the VRS scheme as\n\napproved and adopted by Board. The amendment in the Pension\n\nRegulations of 1995 was carried out by other public sector banks with\n\nretrospective effect in 2002, though the scheme was floated and\n\nimplemented in the year 2000­2001. However, the benefits were\n\nextended on the strength of the VRS scheme even before amending the\n\nRegulations of 1995. The SBI adopted the Scheme in toto and Pension\n\nRule 22 providing eligibility of 20 years applies only to those cases\n\nwhere employees seek retirement in the ordinary course of completion\n\nof 10 years or 20 years, as the case may be. The VRS was taken in the\n\nspecific scheme providing eligibility and benefits on completion of 15\n\nyears of service, and that constituted a concluded contract. It was not\n\nopen to the bank to alter the terms. In case the bank's submission is\n\naccepted, it would lead to a situation that employees who have already\n\nreached the age of superannuation, would have been entitled to take\nVRS. The bank has misled the employees, and the action could not be\n\nsaid to be fair. Once an offer was accepted and after that to amend the\n\nrules or not to amend the rules till 31.3.2000 depended on exercise of\n\npower by SBI which may have the effect to deprive the pension when\n\nthe option was not available even to withdraw the offer as it was the\n\nlast day of the employment. Rule 22 was amended, that too with\n\nretrospective effect. Thus, the employees who joined service after\n\nretirement from other services, have completed the age of 58 years and\n\nwere in employment as on 1.11.1993 were entitled to a pension. They\n\nhave also been deprived of the benefit of pension, which would have\n\nbeen otherwise available to them. In case pension was not to be paid,\n\nit was not a profitable bargain for them to forego pension only for ex\n\ngratia benefit. It was incumbent upon the SBI to amend the Rule, in\n\ncase it was necessary to do so. Otherwise, also, the meaning of the\n\nexpression “pension” to be paid as per rules was that proportionate\n\npension to be awarded to the employees with 15 years’ service who\n\nwere eligible for benefits granted as specified in the circular and the\n\nVRS scheme. The clarification issued on 11.1.2000 only pointed out\n\nthe provisions of the VRS scheme as well as the existing position of the\n\nrule. It could not have effect to take away the benefit in any manner\n\nwhich became available to the employees of obtaining the pension on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of permanent pensionable service. On the one\nhand, employees who served for ten years and attained the age of\n\nsuperannuation were entitled to pension and to deprive the same to a\n\npermanent employee who rendered the service for 15 years, would be\n\nper se discriminatory, unfair and arbitrary. Once the scheme was\n\nfloated and approved, the bank being State within the purview of\n\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of India, it would not be permissible for\n\nit to discriminate and act unfairly. The VRS constituted an\n\nindependent contract and was binding upon the bank. The benefits\n\ncould not have been taken away from eligible employees who accepted\n\nVRS, which was implemented by the bank for its benefit to induct new\n\nskills as well as to rationalise the workforce. Thus, appeals being\n\nbereft of merit, deserve dismissal.\n\n15. The main question is whether, under the scheme as approved\n\nand adopted by the Central Board of SBI, the pension is admissible to\n\nthe employees on completion of 15 years of permanent service.\n\nConnected question is whether employees have been denied benefit of\n\npension unfairly and arbitrarily contrary to the essential terms of the\n\nscheme.\n\n16. Firstly, it is necessary to consider the nature of the package,\n\nwhich was accepted in the resolution by the Central Board of Directors\n\nof SBI in its meeting dated 27.12.2000. As already mentioned, exercise\nwas done in order to rationalise the workforce as it was felt that banks\n\nwere overstaffed. The IBA advised the SBI regarding the issues\n\nconfronting the public sector banks. In the memorandum submitted to\n\nthe Central Board of Directors of SBI, the following facts were\n\nmentioned as to the adoption of Scheme in right earnest and\n\nrequirement of manpower planning:\n\n“The data available with IBA indicates that 43% of employees\nin Public Sector Banks are in the 46+ age group, and only 12%\nare in the 25­35 age group. This pattern has serious\nimplications for the Banks with reference to mobility, training,\ndevelopment of skills, and succession plans for higher­level\npositions. This, coupled with excess manpower wherever it\nexists, would come in the way of induction of new skills and\nproper career progression.\n\nThe Committee has recommended the introduction of a\nVoluntary Retirement Scheme that would assist the Banks in\ntheir effort to optimise their human resources and achieve a\nbalanced age and skills profile in keeping with their business\nstrategies. IBA has advised that the Government of India has\nconveyed that they have no objection to the banks' placing\nbefore their respective Boards of Director's proposals for\nadopting and implementing the Voluntary Retirement Scheme.\nIt has been advised that Banks may adopt the scheme after\nobtaining their Boards' approval and implement it in right\nearnest.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n\"a) The high establishment costs of the Bank vis­à­vis the\nforeign banks and new private sector banks have been a\nmatter of concern. The percentage of staff expenses to total\nexpenses in the Bank is 21.85 against the percentage of 7.66\nand 3.04 for foreign banks and new private sector banks,\nrespectively. Even if we compare it with other Public Sector\nBanks, our ratio is adverse.\n\nd) With the computerisation of accounting and other work at a\nlarge number of branches, manpower, which was needed for\nbalancing of books, is now rendered surplus. This indicates an\nimperative need to rationalize the manpower at these\nbranches. While we have already initiated steps for the\nproductive redeployment of staff at these branches through\nshift banking and seven­day banking, there still exists scope\nfor improvement in this area. Most of these branches are\nsituated in metropolitan and urban centers. Incidentally, the\nexperience of other banks in respect of voluntary retirement\nschemes shows that a maximum number of applications have\nbeen received from these centers.\n\nf) As against the average of 43% of employees in Public Sector\nBanks in the 46+ age group, we have 47% of the employees in\nthis age group. Of this, 1/5th are in the age group of 56 and\nabove. To put it simply, 21,824 employees will reach the age of\nsuperannuation and retire by March 2005.\n\nIn the light of the above­mentioned factors, it will be seen\nthat the manpower of the Bank will undergo major changes in\nthe ensuing years in number and deployment. Further,\nconsidering the variety of business the Bank undertakes, and\nits special role in the banking sector, over­emphasis on\nquantitative parameters would be inappropriate. An approach\npaper on Manpower Planning is placed at Annexure­‘A’.\n\nConsidering the various aspects of Manpower Planning, we\nare of the view that the Voluntary Retirement Scheme should\nbe employed as a moderate tool to right­size the manpower in\nState Bank of India.\"\n\nIn the light of aforesaid, it is clear that the VRS scheme was\n\ndevised as a tool to reduce overstaffing. The memorandum submitted\n\nto the Central Board contained the following significant aspects:\n\n“Keeping in view the above, the IBA guidelines and the\nfeedback received from other Banks, the draft ‘SBI Voluntary\nRetirement Scheme (SBIVRS)’ is prepared and placed for\napproval at Annexure­‘B.'\n\nIt is proposed to introduce SBIVRS for employees who have\nas on 31­12­2000, completed 40 years of age or 15 years of\nservice as approved by the Government of India and conveyed\nby IBA. In terms of the IBA scheme, the Banks’ Boards may\nspecify any other category as ineligible. We propose to exclude\nthe Watch and Ward staff as these positions cannot be\nreduced. We also propose to exclude highly skilled and\nqualified staff from the Scheme.\n\nSBIVRS will be voluntary in nature. The decision to seek\nretirement under the Scheme rests with the employee only.\nThe management will retain the discretion as to whether to\naccept or not the request for voluntary retirement under the\nScheme. We have to ensure that while, on the one hand, our\nBank benefits by the rightsizing of the staff strength, on the\nother, any sudden exodus of a very large number of staff does\nnot destabilise the normal operations of the Bank. Considering\nthe attractive features of the Scheme, in terms of ex­gratia\npayment, etc., a large number of applications are expected.\nHowever, the Bank will have to control the outflow according\nto its requirements. Towards this end, it will be necessary to\nretain the discretion with the management of the Bank to limit\nthe number of employees allowed to retire in each category of\nstaff to be covered under SBIVRS, and we propose to retain\nsuch discretion.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIt was proposed to introduce a VRS for employees who on\n\n31.12.2000, completed 15 years of service as approved by the\n\nGovernment of India and conveyed by IBA. So, it assumes significance\n\nthat what was approved and conveyed, in terms of the IBA scheme,\n\nthe Banks’ Boards were permitted to specify any other category as\n\nineligible. The SBI considering its requirement proposed to exclude the\n\nWatch and Ward staff as these positions could not be reduced. It was\n\nalso proposed to exclude the highly skilled and qualified staff from the\n\nscheme.\n\nFunds outlay was also proposed in the memorandum submitted\n\nto the Central Board as under:\n\n“FUNDS OUTLAY\nAs per the estimate received from Bank's actuary, an outlay of\napproximately Rs. 2100 crores would be required for the\nimplementation of SBIVRS if 10% of the employees opt for\nretirement. The break­up being as under:\n\nEx­gratia Rs. 1300.00 crores\nLeave encashment Rs. 180.00 crores\nAdditional Provision for Gratuity Rs. 140.00 crores\nAdditional Provision for Pension Rs. 480.00 crores\n\n(These estimates may undergo a change on receipt of\nclarification from Government of India as to the components of\n‘Pay’ for the purpose of Ex­gratia)”\n\nA provision was made for the pension. The bank reserved the\n\nright to modify, amend or cancel any or all the clauses. The Deputy\n\nManaging Director and CDO would be the competent authority.\n\nFollowing is the relevant clause regarding modification of the scheme:\n\n“MODIFICATION OF THE SCHEME\nBank reserves the right to modify, amend or cancel any or all\nthe clauses of the Scheme and to give effect thereto from any\ndate it may deem fit. The Dy. Managing Director and CDO\nwould be the Competent Authority for the purpose.”\n\nThe effective date of retirement was 31.3.2001. The relevant\n\nclause is extracted hereunder:\n\n“EFFECTIVE DATE OF RETIREMENT\nWhile the SBIVRS will be open to employees from 15th January\n2001 to 31st January 2001 (both days included), the retirement\nunder SBIVRS is proposed to be given effect from 31 st March\n2001.\"\n\n17. The letter dated 31.8.2000 annexed to memorandum submitted\n\nto the Central Board of the SBI is also of utmost significance in order\n\nto understand what was accepted by the Central Board. The relevant\n\nportion of the letter dated 31.8.2000 of IBA is extracted hereunder:\n\n“Attention is invited to letter DO No. 11/1/99­IR dated\n22.05.2000, addressed to the Chief Executive of public sector\nbanks by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance\n(Banking Division), wherein banks have been advised to carry\nout detailed manpower planning in order to adopt measures to\nhave optimum human resource at various levels in keeping\nwith the business strategies and requirements of each bank.\n\nAt the meeting the Finance Minister had with Chief Executives\nof public sector banks on 13th June 2000, the human resource\nand man­power planning in public sector banks were\nreviewed, and a Committee was constituted to examine the\nissues confronting public sector banks in that regard and\nsuggest suitable remedial measures.\"\n\n“In order to remedy this situation with the urgency that\ncircumstances demand, the Committee has placed before the\nGovernment two schemes, viz., Sabbatical Leave and a\nVoluntary Retirement Scheme that would assist the banks in\ntheir effort to optimise their human resource and achieve a\nbalanced age and skills’ profile in keeping with their business\nstrategies. Salient features of the two schemes are given in the\nAnnexure.\n\nIBA, vide its letter dated 13th July 2000, has sought no\nobjection from the Government for circulating the schemes to\nthe Banks for consideration and adoption by their Boards. The\nGovernment have conveyed to us that they have no objection\nto the banks' placing the two schemes before their respective\nBoard of Directors for adopting and implementing the above\nschemes. It has been advised that the Banks may adopt these\nschemes for sabbatical and voluntary retirement based on the\nessential features of the schemes given in the Annexure, after\nobtaining their Board’s approval and implement them in right\nearnest.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n“Banks are also requested to take special note of the following:\n\n1.\nSection 10(10C)\nof the Income Tax Act read with Rule 2BA.\n\n2. As per the amendments brought in by the\nFinance Act\n2000,\nso long as the bank complies with the rules framed under\n\nSection 10(10C)\n, prior approval from the Chief Commissioner\nor Director General of Income­tax, as the case may be, is not\nrequired for VRS.\n\n3. Income­tax shall be deducted at source in respect of ex­gratia\nexceeding Rs.5.00 lakhs or such other ceiling as may be\nprescribed under the Income­tax Act.\n\n4. Only completed years of service will be reckoned for arriving at\nthe minimum eligible service. Subject to this, fraction of\nservice of six months and above will be reckoned as one year\nfor the purpose of calculating the ex­gratia.\n\n5. While exercising discretion to decline applications for VRS or\nto make exceptions in the case of employees categorised as\nineligible for VRS, the decision should not be discriminatory\namong employees who are similarly placed and the reasons\ntherefor should be recorded.\n\n6. The competent authority for accepting VRS for the various\ncategories/class of employee should be clearly laid down by\nthe Board of Directors.\n7. Banks should ensure compliance with requirements under\nlabour legislations before giving effect to the Scheme.”\n\n18. IBA’s letter dated 31.8.2000 makes clear the salient features of\n\nthe VRS scheme that all permanent employees with 15 years of service\n\nwere eligible to retire. Ineligible persons have also been specified. In\n\nunqualified terms, it was mentioned in the annexures that such\n\nemployees would be entitled to the amount of ex gratia of 60 days’\n\nsalary for each completed year of service or salary for the number of\n\nmonths service is left, whichever is less. Other benefits admissible\n\nwere gratuity, pension including the commuted value of pension,\n\nbank's contribution towards provident fund, and leave encashment as\n\nper rules. Thus, scheme was to grant pension to all such employees\n\nwho opted for VRS on completion of 15 years of service and other\n\nbenefits as specified in the scheme. The Government of India,\n\nMinistry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, (Banking\n\nDivision), that it communicated approval vide letter dated 29.8.2000\n\nto IBA, it was sent to the SBI also, the same is extracted hereunder:\n\n“F.

The agenda submitted on 27.12.2000 for consideration of the\n\nCentral Board of SBI along with resolution are extracted as under:\n\n“AGENDA NO.3\n\nMan­ Power Planning and SBI Voluntary Retirement Scheme\n(SBI VRS)\n\nSubmitted Memorandum dated the 26th December 2000 by\nthe Deputy Managing Director & Corporate Development\nOfficer, recommending that for the reasons stated therein,\napproval be accorded for the proposals contained in the\nMemorandum as also for adopting the stated approach to\nmanpower planning and introduction SBIVRS in terms of the\nprovisions contained in the Scheme at Annexure ‘B‘ of the\nMemorandum.\n\nCopies of the Memorandum were placed before the Directors\npresent at the Meeting.\n\n‘‘APPROVED”\n(SEAL)\n20. Annexure ‘B’ to the memorandum contained the VRS. The VRS\n\nwas prepared in view of the guidelines of the IBA. The amount of ex\n\ngratia and other benefits specified in the scheme under clauses 5/ 6 of\n\nthe scheme are extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. Amount of Ex­gratia:\n\nThe staff members whose request for retirement under SBIVRS\nhas been accepted by Competent Authority will be paid an\namount of ex­gratia of 60 days‘ salary (pay plus stagnation\nincrements plus dearness allowance) for each completed year\nof service (for this purpose fraction of service of six months\nand above will be taken as one year and accordingly service of\nless than six months will not be counted) or salary for the\nnumber of months service is left, whichever is less.

For\nthe purpose of calculation of ex­gratia, 60 days‘ salary\nmentioned in the Scheme is to be taken as equivalent to 2\nmonths‘ salary (with reference to salary for the month in which\nemployee is relieved from service on Voluntary Retirement.\n\nIncome Tax shall be deducted at source in respect of ex­gratia\nexceeding Rs. 5.00 lakhs or such other ceiling as may be\nprescribed under the\nIncome Tax Act\non the relevant date.“\n\nThe benefits were as under:\n\n“6.

No\ninterest, however, will be paid for the amount so withheld. All\nother outstanding loans/advances will have to be repaid before\ndate of retirement under SBIVRS, failing which the amount of\nex­gratia and other terminal benefits payable to the employee\nwill be appropriated towards the outstanding loans/advances;\n\nand the balance only will be payable to the employee.”\n\n21. Most significantly, the scheme of the IBA, accepted by the Board\n\non 27.12.2000, was for providing pension on completion of 15 years of\n\nservice. The pension specified in clause 6 of scheme was to be worked\n\nout in terms of the Pension Fund Rules including the commuted value\n\nof the pension. It was not mentioned in the VRS adopted by the SBI\n\nthat the person on completion of 15 years would not be entitled to the\n\nbenefit of pension. On the other hand, proposal of IBA, as approved by\n\nthe Government of India, was accepted in toto by SBI. When gauged in\n\nterms of the proposals of the IBA, the essential feature was that an\n\nemployee was entitled to get pension on completion of 15 years of\n\nservice. The meaning of the expression \"pension” in terms of the rules\n\nwould be proportionate pension on completion of 15 years of service as\n\nper the terms of calculation provided in Rule 23 of the Pension Rules.\n\nVRS is an independent contract and the background in which it was\n\nfloated, pension on completion of 15 years of service was an essential\npart of the scheme of VRS 2000, as approved by the Government and\n\nfloated by the IBA and adopted by all the Banks, and Pension Rules\n\nwere to be amended accordingly.\n\n22. The Government of India suggested to the IBA to amend\n\nRegulation 29\nof the Regulations of 1995 so that the employees do not\n\nlose the benefit of pension, the IBA may work out modalities and\n\nsuggest amendments, if any, required to be made in the Pension\n\nRegulations to ensure that the employees get the benefit of pension.\n\nThe letter dated 5.9.2000 of Government of India is extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\n“F. No. 4/8/4/2000­IR\nGovernment of India,\nMinistry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs\n(Banking Division)\nNew Delhi, 5­9­2000\n\nTo\nThe Personnel Advisor,\nIndian Banks’ Association,\nMumbai\nSub.: Amendment to\nRegulation 29\nof the Pension Regulations.\nSir,\nI am directed to refer to this Division's Letter No. 11/1/99 IR\ndated 29­8­2000, conveying the Government's no objection for\ncirculation of Voluntary Retirement Scheme in public sector\nbanks. The Scheme, inter alia, provides that employees with\n15 years of service or 40 years of age shall be eligible to take\nvoluntary retirement under the Scheme. As per the provisions\ncontained in\nRegulation 29\nof the Pension Regulations, an\nemployee can take voluntary retirement after 20 years of\nqualifying service and thereafter becomes eligible for pension.\n\nThus, employees having rendered 15 years of service or\ncompleting 40 years of age but not having completed 20 years\nof service shall not be eligible for pensionary benefits on taking\nvoluntary retirement under the Scheme.\n\nIn order to ensure that such employees do not lose the benefit\nof pension, IBA may work out modalities and suggest\namendments, if any, required to be made in the Pension\nRegulations to ensure that these employees also get the benefit\nof pension.\n\nYours faithfully,\nsd/­\n(U.P. Singh)\nDirector (IR)”\n\n23. SBI issued a circular on 10.1.2001 with respect to the\n\nwithdrawal of the application submitted under the scheme. It was\n\ndecided that the employee could withdraw the application on or before\n\n15.2.2001 by making a written request.\n\n24. Clarification was issued on 15.1.2001 to a query raised, whether\n\nor not the employees on completing 15 years of pensionable service\n\nwould be entitled to pensionary benefits. Following is a relevant\n\nportion:\n\n“3. Whether or not the employees, completing 15 years of\npensionable service as on relevant date (date of retirement\nunder SBIVRS), will be entitled for pension benefits?\n\nIn this connection, we invite a reference to para 6(c) of the\nScheme forwarded under the cover of Staff Circular letter No.\nCDO/81 dated 30/12/2000. The payment of pension to the\nemployee retiring under SBIVRS would be governed by State\nBank of India Employees Pension Fund Rules on the relevant\ndate (including commuted value of pension). However, as per\nexisting rules, employees who have not completed 20 years of\nPensionable Service are not eligible for pension.”\n\nIt is clear from answer that the staff circular dated 30.12.2000\n\nwas reiterated. Payment of pension to an employee retiring under VRS\n\nwould be governed by rules on the relevant date, i.e., 31.3.2001. At\nthe same time, the position of the existing rule was indicated that\n\nthose employees who had not completed 20 years of pensionable\n\nservice were not eligible for a pension. It was not clarified what was\n\nthe meaning and purport of para 6(c) of the scheme. It was not\n\nmentioned that an employee would not be entitled to pension on 15\n\nyears of service as per the scheme approved by the Government of\n\nIndia and floated by the IBA and adopted by the Central Board of SBI.\n\nThe above clarification being in form of opinion, could not be said to\n\nhave caused a modification, amendment, or cancellation of any of the\n\nclauses of VRS or resolution passed by the Board, nor it was so stated.\n\nIt was necessary to state that on completion of 15 years of service,\n\nemployees would not be paid pension. The existing rule position was\n\nknown to everybody, whereas the scheme was framed for providing\n\npension on completion of 15 years of service.\n\n25. Rule 22 of the Pension Rules of SBI as it existed up to 9.3.2001\n\nand amended are extracted hereunder:\n\nExisting Rule\n\n“22(i) A member shall be entitled to a pension under these\nrules on retiring from the Bank’s service­\n\n(a) After having completed 20 years' pensionable service provided\nthat he has attained the age of 50 years or if he is in the\nservice of the Bank on or after 01.11.93, after having\ncompleted ten years pensionable service provided that he has\nattained the age of 58 years.\n\n(b) After having completed twenty years' irrespective of the age he\nshall have attained if he shall satisfy the authority competent\nto sanction his retirement by approved medical certificate or\notherwise that he is incapacitated for further active service;\n\n(c) After having completed twenty years pensionable service,\nirrespective of the age he shall have attained at his request in\nwriting;\n\n(d) After twenty­five years' pensionable service.“\n\nAmended Rule\n\n“22(i) A member shall be entitled to a pension under these\nrules on retiring from the Bank’s service­\n\n(a) After having completed twenty years' pensionable service\nprovided that he has attained the age of fifty years or if he is in\nthe service of the Bank on or after 01.11.93, after having\ncompleted 10 years, pensionable service provided that he has\nattained the age of fifty­eight years or if he is in the service of\nthe bank on or after 22.05.1998. After having completed ten\nyears, pensionable service provided that he has attained the\nage of sixty years.\n\n(b) After having completed twenty years' pensionable service,\nirrespective of the age he shall have attained if he shall satisfy\nthe authority competent to sanction his retirement by\napproved medical certificate or otherwise that he is\nincapacitated for further active service;\n\n(c) After having completed twenty years pensionable service,\nirrespective of the age he shall have attained at his request in\nwriting;\n\n(d) After twenty­five years' pensionable service.\"\n\n26. It is clear from Rule 22 that pension is admissible to an\n\nemployee thus:\n\n1) After having completed 20 years’ pensionable service provided\n\nthat he has attained the age of 50 years; or\n\n2) If he is in the service of the Bank on or after 01.11.1993, after\n\nhaving completed 10 years pensionable service provided that he\n\nhas attained the age of 50 years; or\n\n3) If he is in the service of the Bank on or after 22.05.1998, after\n\nhaving completed 10 years pensionable service provided that he\n\nhas attained the age of 60 years.\n27. Rule 22(1)(c) was incorporated in the Pension Fund Rules w.e.f.\n\n20.9.1986 when the bank decided inter alia to introduce VRS on\n\ncompletion of 20 years of service. The unamended rule 22(i)(a)\n\nprovided the normal age of retirement to be 58 years. Thereafter, as\n\nper the guidelines issued by the Government on 22.5.1998, the age of\n\nretirement was increased from 58 to 60 years. Accordingly, Rule 22(i)\n\n(a) was proposed to be amended on 30.1.2001, and instead of 58\n\nyears, the age of retirement of 60 years was to be incorporated. On\n\n28.5.1998, the Executive Committee of the Central Board of SBI\n\npending amendment to the related service rules adopted the age of\n\nretirement as 60 years. The amendment was notified on 31.3.2001\n\nand approved by the Trustees of the SBI Employees’ Pension Fund on\n\n30.10.2001.\n\n28. Similar scheme of VRS concerning nationalised banks was\n\nimplemented according to the decision of the Government of India. In\n\nPunjab & Sind Bank, it was to remain open from 1.12.2000 to\n\n31.12.2000; Punjab National Bank: 1.11.2000 to 30.11.2000; Bank of\n\nIndia: 15.11.2000 to 14.12.2000; Union Bank of India: 1.12.2000 to\n\n31.12.2000; United Bank of India: 1.1.2001 to 31.1.2001. In SBI, the\n\nsaid scheme was adopted by the Central Board on 27.12.2000.\n29. The State Bank of India was constituted under the SBI Act,\n\n1955. The nationalised banks were taken over in terms of the\nBanking\n\nCompanies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970\n.\n\nUnder the Act\nof 1970, the Punjab National Bank (Employees) Pension\n\nRegulations, 1995, were framed.\nRegulation 28\n, provided pension on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation, and\nRegulation 29\nprovided\n\npension on voluntary retirement on completion of 20 years of\n\nqualifying service.\nRegulation 29(5)\n, applicable to the banks mentioned\n\nabove, provided that the qualifying service of an employee retiring\n\nvoluntarily under the Regulation shall be increased by a period not\n\nexceeding five years, subject to the condition that the total qualifying\n\nservice rendered by such employee shall not exceed 33 years.\n\n30. The VRS 2000 came up for consideration before this Court in\n\nBank of India & Ors. v. O.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (2003) 2 SCC 721 in\n\nthe context of\nRegulation 29(5)\nof Regulations, 1995. The Court held\n\nthat the scheme is contractual and provided for pensionary benefits on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of service. The decision was followed in HEC\n\nVoluntary Retd.\n\nEmployees Welfare Society v. Heavy Engineering\n\nCorporation Ltd.\n, (2006) 3 SCC 708.\n\n31. Due to introduction of Scheme,\nRegulation 28\nof Regulations of\n\n1995 was proposed to be amended. It was amended in the year 2002\nwith a retrospective effect from 1.9.2000. By way of amendment, a\n\nproviso has been inserted in\nRegulation 28\nthus:\n\n“28. Superannuation pension.—Superannuation pension shall\nbe granted to an employee who has retired on his attaining the\nage of superannuation specified in the Service Regulations or\nSettlements.”\n\n“Provided that pension shall also be granted to an employee\nwho opts to retire before attaining the age of superannuation,\nbut after having served for a minimum period of 15 years in\nterms of any scheme that may be framed for the purpose by\nthe Bank’s Board with the concurrence of the Government.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n32. The employees who opted for VRS on completion of 15 years of\n\nservice within the specified period in 2000/2001, were given the\n\nbenefit of pension. The Regulations came to be amended in 2002 with\n\nthe retrospective effect. However, the benefit under\nRegulation 29(5)\n\nwas not extended to the optees/employees who completed 20 years of\n\nservice by adding 5 years of qualifying service. Regulations 29(1) and\n\n29(5) applicable to the said banks are extracted hereunder:\n\n“29. Pension on voluntary retirement.—(1) On or after the 1st\nday of November 1993 at any time, after an employee has\ncompleted twenty years of qualifying service he may, by giving\nnotice of not less than three months in writing to the\nappointing authority retire from service:\n\nProvided that this sub­regulation shall not apply to an\nemployee who is on deputation or on study leave abroad\nunless after having been transferred or having returned to\nIndia he has resumed charge of the post in India and has\nserved for a period of not less than one year:\n\nProvided further that this sub­regulation shall not apply to\nan employee who seeks retirement from service for being\nabsorbed permanently in an autonomous body or a public\nsector undertaking or company or institution or body, whether\nincorporated or not to which he is on deputation at the time of\nseeking voluntary retirement:\nProvided that this sub­regulation shall not apply to an\nemployee who is deemed to have retired in accordance with\nclause (1) of\nRegulation 2\n.\n\nxxx\n(5) The qualifying service of an employee retiring voluntarily\nunder this Regulation shall be increased by a period not\nexceeding five years, subject to the condition that the total\nqualifying service rendered by such employee shall not in any\ncase exceed thirty­three years and it does not take him beyond\nthe date of superannuation.”\n\n33. The scheme in question came up for consideration in\nO.P.\n\nSwarnakar & Ors.\n(supra), in which SBI was one of appellants in C.A.\n\nNos.3561­65/2002, the appeals were decided by this Court by a\n\ncommon judgment. It noted that reference to pension as per rules was\n\nmade for computation of pension, and the employees who had\n\ncompleted 15 years of service were to be extended the benefit of VRS\n\n2000 along with pension and other benefits. IBA wrote a letter dated\n\n11.12.2000 to all public sector banks for amending Pension\n\nRegulations, 1995. The IBA mentioned that pension was to be paid to\n\nthe employees as per VRS 2000. They would be eligible for pro­rata\n\npension; as such,\nRegulation 28\nbe amended. The employees who\n\napplied for voluntary retirement after having rendered 15 years’\n\nservice, under a special/ad hoc scheme formulated with the specific\n\napproval of the Government and the Board of Directors would be\n\neligible for pro­rata pension for the period of service rendered as if they\n\nwere to retire on attaining the age of superannuation on that date. The\n\nletter made it clear that the Government of India approved the pension\nto be given on completion of 15 years of service. The scheme was for\n\nextending the benefit of pension to the employees retiring on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of permanent service, and the Government of\n\nIndia also desired that the IBA advised banks to make necessary\n\namendments to their pension regulations, as mentioned in the\n\nAnnexure. Thus, the essence of the VRS scheme was the benefit of\n\npro­rata pension as per the rules on completion of 15 years of\n\npensionable service.\n\n34. It is apparent that the very fulcrum of the scheme was a felt\n\nneed for inducting new workforce, with adequate knowledge of new\n\nskills such as modern technology, foreign exchange, venture capital, e­\n\ncommerce, money management, etc. as pointed out by the Ministry of\n\nFinance in its letter dated 22.5.2000. The banks were overstaffed and\n\nfor effective management and manpower planning, the desirability of\n\nintroducing VRS was felt in order to rationalise the workforce and\n\nskill. Hence a Committee was constituted by the Central Government.\n\nIn pursuance of report of the Committee, a policy decision was taken\n\nto frame the VRS. The scheme applied to employees who, on the date\n\nof the application, completed 15 years of service. The employees\n\nspecified therein were otherwise not eligible to seek voluntary\n\nretirement on completion of 15 years under the rules/regulations.\n\nUnder the scheme floated by the other banks, identical reliefs were\nadmissible, as in SBI VRS. The Scheme of Punjab National Bank is\n\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“7. x x x “Amount of ex gratia\nAn employee seeking voluntary retirement under the\nScheme will be entitled to the ex gratia amount mentioned\nbelow in para (a) or (b), whichever is less:\n\n(a) 60 days’ salary (pay plus stagnation increments plus\nspecial pay plus dearness relief) for each completed year of\nservice;\n\nOR\n\n(b) salary for the number of months of service left;\n\nOther benefits\nAn employee seeking voluntary retirement under the\nScheme will be eligible for the following benefits in addition to\nthe ex gratia amount mentioned in para 6 above of this\nScheme:\n\n(i) Gratuity as per the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nor\ngratuity payable under the Service Rules, as the case may be,\nas per existing rules.\n\n(ii)(a) Pension (including commuted value of pension) as per\nPNB (Employees) Pension Regulations, 1995.\n\nOR\n\n(b) Bank’s contribution towards PF as per existing rules.\n\n(iii) Leave encashment as per existing rules.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n35. The eligibility criteria in all the schemes, including SBI VRS,\n\nclearly provided that employees who completed 15 years of service and\n\nparticular age shall be eligible to apply. The benefits to which they\n\nwere entitled, were culled out. In other banks, the pension was as per\n\nPension Regulation, 1995. Thus, on eligibility of an employee,\n\nadmissibility of the available reliefs in Scheme followed i.e., the\n\namount of ex gratia and other benefits, including pension, were to be\n\npaid as provided in the scheme. Otherwise, there was no purpose of\n\nretiring an employee with 15 years of service as they were not eligible\nfor retirement as per the rules before completion of 20 years of service\n\nin all nationalised banks as well as SBI. A reference to the\n\nadmissibility of the pension as per rules/ regulations was made in all\n\nthe VRS to mean that proportionate pension shall be admissible as\n\nprovided in rules, this Court has noted it in\nO.P. Swarnakar\n(supra),\n\nthus:\n\n“49. An offer indisputably can be made to a group of persons\ncollectively which is capable of being accepted individually, but\nthe question which has to be posed and answered is as to\nwhether having regard to the service jurisprudence; the\nprinciples of the\nIndian Contract Act\nwould be applicable in\nthe instant case. It is the specific case of the “banks” that the\nSchemes had been floated by way of contract. It does not have\nany statutory flavour. Reference to the Pension Scheme framed\nunder the Regulations was made for computation of the\npension.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n36. Significantly in\nO.P. Swarnakar\n(supra), this Court observed that\n\nemployees must have proceeded to apply for VRS on the basis even\n\nthough they have merely completed 15 years of service, which was not\n\na qualifying service, under the Pension Regulations of Bank, they\n\nwould be entitled to benefits in terms of the VRS scheme. The Court\n\nobserved thus:\n\n“89. Furthermore, a large number of employees have\nwithdrawn their offer only when a proviso was sought to be\nadded to\nRegulation 28\naforementioned. In terms of the\nScheme the employees, who expected to get benefits of sub­\nregulation (4) of\nRegulation 29\nwould be deprived therefrom. It\nis not in this dispute that the qualifying period for receiving\npension was 20 years. Only upon completion of 20 years, in\nterms of the statutory regulation contained in\nRegulation 29\n,\nan employee could opt for voluntary retirement, and in terms\nthereof, he would be entitled to the benefits specified therein.\nThe said Regulations had specifically been mentioned for the\npurpose of computation, which would include invocation of\nsub­regulation (4) of\nRegulation 29\n, providing for relaxation of\n5 years towards the qualifying period. The employees must\nhave proceeded on the basis that despite the fact that they\nhave merely rendered 15 years of service, which was not a\nqualifying service under the Regulations, they would be\nentitled to the pensionary benefits in terms of the Scheme. By\nintroducing the proviso to\nRegulation 28\npension was sought\nto be made pro rata in place of full pension.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n37.\nIn\nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n(supra), it was held that the scheme\n\nwas not a part of statutory regulations. It was in the realm of contract.\n\nThat being so, the Central Government did not need to place the same\n\nbefore Parliament; and secondly, if the same was a regulation, the\n\nlaying­down rule is merely directory and not mandatory.\n\nThis Court\n\nrelied upon the decisions in\nJan Mohd. Noor Mohd. Bagban v. State of\n\nGujarat\n,\nAIR 1966 SC 385 and Atlas Cycle Industries Ltd. v. State of\n\nHaryana\n; 1979 (2) SCC 196 and held that the scheme could not be\n\nsaid to be bad in law, thus:\n\n“124. Firstly, the Scheme is not a part of the statutory\nregulation. It was in the realm of contract. That being, so it\nwas not necessary for the Central Government to place the\nsame before Parliament.\n\n125. Secondly, even if the same was a regulation, the laying­\ndown rule is merely a directory one and not mandatory.\n\n126.\nIn\nJan Mohd.\ncase, AIR 1966 SC 385, the law is stated in\nthe following terms: (AIR pp. 394­95, para 18)\n\n“18. Finally, the validity of the rules framed under\nBombay\nAct\n22 of 1939 was canvassed. By\nSection 26(1)\nof the Bombay\nAct, the State Government was authorised to make rules for\nthe purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act. It was\nprovided by sub­section (5) that the rules made under\nSection\nshall be laid before each of the Houses of the Provincial\nLegislature at the session thereof next following and shall be\nliable to be modified or rescinded by a resolution in which both\nHouses concur, and such rules shall, after notification in the\nOfficial Gazette, be deemed to have been modified or rescinded\naccordingly. It was urged by the petitioner that the rules\nframed under\nBombay Act\n22 of 1939 were not placed before\nthe Legislative Assembly or the Legislative Council at the first\nsession, and therefore they had no legal validity. The rules\nunder Act 22 of 1939 were framed by the Provincial\nGovernment of Bombay in 1941. At that time, there was no\nLegislature in session, the Legislature having been suspended\nduring the emergency arising out of World War II. The session\nof the Bombay Legislative Assembly was convened for the first\ntime after 1941 on 20­5­1946, and that session was prorogued\non 24­5­1946. The second session of the Bombay Legislative\nAssembly was convened on 15­7­1946, and that of the\nBombay Legislative Council on 3­9­1946 and the rules were\nplaced on the Assembly Table in the second session before the\nLegislative Assembly on 2­9­1946 and before the Legislative\nCouncil on 13­9­1946.\nSection 26(5)\nof Bombay Act 22 of 1939\ndoes not prescribe that the rules acquired validity only from\nthe date on which they were placed before the Houses of\nLegislature. The rules are valid from the date on which they\nare made under\nSection 26(1)\n. It is true that the Legislature\nhas prescribed that the rules shall be placed before the Houses\nof Legislature, but failure to place the rules before the Houses\nof Legislature does not affect the validity of the rules, merely\nbecause they have not been placed before the Houses of the\nLegislature. Granting that the provisions of sub­section (5) of\n\nSection 26\nby reason of the failure to place the rules before the\nHouses of Legislature were violated, we are of the view that\nsub­section (5) of\nSection 26\nhaving regard to the purposes for\nwhich it is made, and in the context in which it occurs, cannot\nbe regarded as mandatory. The rules have been in operation\nsince the year 1941, and by virtue of\nSection 64\nof Gujarat Act\n20 of 1964, they continue to remain in operation.\"\n\n127.\nIn\nAtlas Cycle Industries\n' case, (1979) 2 SCC 196, the\nsame view has been reiterated.\n\n128. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the Scheme in\nquestion cannot be said to be bad in law.”\n\n38. The Court concerning the provision of withdrawal held that the\n\nrelevant clause of the scheme created an enforceable right in case the\n\nState Bank failed to adhere to its preferred policy.\n39. In our opinion, the reference in the SBI VRS to the admissible\n\nbenefits, like pension shall be as per the pension rules, was for the\n\npurpose of computation of pension. It is apparent from a reading of\n\nthe scheme that proportionate pension was admissible to employees\n\nas noted in para 49 of\nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n(supra). A similar\n\nexpression was used in the schemes of nationalised banks also. This\n\nCourt has noted expression in the scheme that pension as per rules to\n\nmean for computation of pension. The formula for computation for a\n\npension is provided in Rule 23 of the SBI Pension Rules.\n\n40. It is of utmost significance that the Central Board in its meeting\n\ndated 27.12.2000 accorded approval “for the proposals contained in\n\nthe Memorandum.” A bare perusal of the memorandum makes it clear\n\nthat the letter of IBA dated 31.8.2000 was enclosed as part of the\n\nmemorandum submitted to the Central Board. In the memorandum, it\n\nwas mentioned \"that the Government of India conveyed that they had\n\nno objection to the banks' placing before their respective Boards of\n\nDirector's proposals for adopting and implementing the Voluntary\n\nRetirement Scheme. It advised that Banks may ‘adopt’ the scheme\n\nafter obtaining their Boards' approval and implement it in ‘right\n\nearnest’.\" The memorandum also contained that the employees who\n\ncompleted 15 years of service were to be the beneficiaries of VRS as\n\napproved by the Government of India and conveyed by the IBA. The\napproval by Government of India and scheme, conveyed by IBA, was to\n\nprovide for the benefit of pension on completion of 15 years of service.\n\nThe same was an essential condition of the scheme. The Annexure,\n\nwhich was part of the memorandum, provided inter alia the benefit of\n\npension, including the commuted value of pension without any rider of\n\ncompletion of 20 years period of service. Once SBI accepted the\n\nproposals contained in the memorandum, when we gauge the scheme\n\nin the light of the subject matter of the memorandum which was\n\nunconditionally approved, it became clear and beyond the pale of\n\ndoubt that in VRS (Annexure B) inasmuch as the expression to\n\nprovide the benefit of pension as per rules was only for providing the\n\nproportionate pensionary benefit of the qualifying service on and above\n\n15 years, rendered by an employee.\n\n41. The IBA advised the banks for amending the rules. The\n\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Finance, also issued a letter dated\n\n5.9.2001 to the Bank to amend the rules. There was a proposal to\n\namend the rules. After the scheme was implemented in 2000, the\n\nnationalised banks, including the Punjab National Bank, amended\n\ntheir rules in 2002 with retrospective effect. However, the fact remains\n\nthe VRS schemes were implemented by banks governed by the\n\nBanking Companies Act, 1970\n, by making payment of pension though\n\nRegulation 28\nof Regulation of 1995 provided for 20 years of qualifying\nservice at the relevant time. Once a particular scheme of VRS, based\n\non the recommendations of Committee formed by Government of\n\nIndia, was formulated and floated by IBA. In all fairness, it was\n\nrequired to be implemented in right earnest in that form in which it\n\nwas approved and adopted by the Board of Directors of SBI on\n\n27.12.2000. In case the Board of Directors were of the opinion that the\n\nscheme was not acceptable to them, they could have rejected it or\n\ncould have stated they reject the proposal for paying pension on\n\ncompletion of 15 years of service which was the essence of a scheme\n\nformed to reduce workforce of Bank and for achieving other objectives.\n\nNonetheless, on the contrary, resolution dated 27.12.2000 indicates\n\nthat the proposals of IBA/Government was approved unconditionally.\n\nThus, in case it was so necessary to amend the pension rules as done\n\nby other banks, it was incumbent upon the State Bank of India to\n\namend its rules either after implementation of the scheme as was done\n\nby other banks or before giving effect to VRS.\n\n42. It is also significant to mention that SBI accepted the scheme as\n\napproved by the Government and floated by IBA. In case SBI had\n\ndeclined to accept or wanted to modify, it was necessary for it to take\n\napproval of Government of India as to its scheme. As per\nsection 49\n,\n\nthe Central Government has the power to make rules.\nSection 50\ndeals\n\nwith the power of Central Government to make regulations.\nSection\n50(1)\nprovides that the Central Board, after consultation with the\n\nReserve Bank of India and with the previous sanction of the Central\n\nGovernment, can make Regulations. Under\nSection 50(2)(o)\n, the\n\nRegulations can be made by the Central Board with the previous\n\nsanction of the Central Government with respect to superannuation\n\npension and other funds for the benefit of the employees of the State\n\nBank.\nSection 50(2)(o)\nreads:\n\n“50. Power of Central Board to make regulations.—(1) The\nCentral Board may, after consultation with the Reserve Bank and\nwith the previous sanction of the Central Government [by\nnotification in the Official Gazette,] make regulations, not\ninconsistent with this Act and the rules made thereunder, to\nprovide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the\npurpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act.\n\n(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the\nforegoing power, such regulations may provide for—\nxxx\n\n(o) the establishment and maintenance of superannuation\npension, provident or other funds for the benefit of the employees\nof the State Bank or of the State Bank or of the dependents of\nsuch employees or for the purposes of the State Bank, and the\ngranting of superannuation allowances, annuities and pensions\npayable out of any such fund;]”\n\n43. Thus, it is apparent that the Central Board of SBI could not have\n\nframed a scheme different than the one approved by the Central\n\nGovernment on its own, nor could have implemented it without\n\napproval of the Central Government. In case it wanted to modify or\n\namend the scheme, as approved by the Government of India, it was\n\nincumbent upon it to send its modified scheme to the Central\nGovernment for approval. No scheme for VRS could have been framed\n\nwithout approval of the Government of India. In fact, the Central\n\nBoard accepted the proposal of IBA, as approved by the Government of\n\nIndia. In case SBI’s stand is accepted, its scheme would have been\n\nvalid as no modification could have been made without approval of the\n\nGovernment of India. In fact, no such modification was made, as held\n\nabove.\n\n44. Once it approved the Scheme SBI being an instrumentality of\n\nState under\nArticle 12\n, is bound by the principle of fairness and\n\nrepresentation made that it accepted the contents of memorandum\n\nand the scheme floated by IBA and invited the applications based on\n\napproving the memorandum which contained proposal of pension on\n\nrendering 15 years of permanent pensionable service, it could not later\n\non wriggle out of its obligation taking a rigmarole by claiming shelter\n\nof the Rules or by not amending the Rules or by issuing a clarification\n\nwhich was fanciful, irrational and contrary to the spirit of the\n\nresolution of the Board. It would amount to an unfair and\n\nunreasonable action to deprive the employees of the benefit of pension\n\nbecause of the decision taken by the Central Board of Directors.\n\n45. SBI is bound by resolution of Central Board of Directors.\n\nThe Scheme was with the approval of the Government of India and\naccepted, implemented by all the banks in true spirit except by SBI. It\n\ncannot be permitted to act unfairly by virtue of having superior\n\nbargaining power by issuing vague clarification to the detriment of the\n\neconomic interest of the employees. Clarification did not have the\n\neffect of re­writing or superseding the resolution of the Central Board\n\nnor effect of making modifications in the resolution passed by the\n\nCentral Board of the SBI.\n\n46. The VRS scheme was not floated by the SBI on its own volition.\n\nIt was pursuant to an exercise that was undertaken by the IBA in view\n\nof the recent developments of modern technology considering the age\n\ngroup of the employees in the bank, the need to have a new skill, and\n\nto rationalise the manpower; a decision was taken. It was decided at\n\nthe Government level to provide pension after completion of 15 years\n\nof service as a special measure, the banks were bound to implement it\n\nin that manner or not at all. The Central Board of Directors of the SBI\n\naccepted the VRS proposal of Government and IBA without any\n\nreservation of not providing pension along with other benefits, as\n\nmandated in the VRS scheme. The action of the instrumentality of the\n\nState cannot be violative of\nArticle 14.\nIt cannot be permitted to act\n\narbitrarily.\nArticles 15\nand\nprovide for equality and provide for an\n\numbrella against discrimination.\n47. Though the Deputy General Manager was authorised by the\n\nCentral Board of Directors to amend, modify or cancel the VRS. The\n\nRules were amended by other banks later in 2002. It was not stated in\n\nanswer to the query that under the VRS scheme, a person who has\n\nrendered 15 years of qualifying service would not be entitled to a\n\npension. Nor it was so stated in resolution dated 27.12.2000 of the\n\nCentral Board of SBI. That apart, Deputy General Manager tried to\n\ninterpret VRS scheme in isolation without considering what was\n\napproved by the Board. Not only the scheme but also the\n\nmemorandum have to be read together to understand resolution of\n\nBoard. Once the memorandum containing the IBAs proposal of\n\nproviding pension was approved in absolute terms, the clarification\n\ncould not be of any value to dilute the otherwise clear and\n\nunambiguous resolution of the Board of Directors. The Deputy\n\nGeneral Manager did not have any such wide and arbitrary power to\n\ndefeat the claim of the employees for pension on completion of 15\n\nyears of permanent service, which was their right. The action of\n\nD.G.M. could not be said to be in accordance with the resolution. The\n\npension was the essence of the scheme, depriving it could not be said\n\nto be authorised, such action can only be termed as unfair and\n\nunreasonable and patently violative of\nArticles 14\n, 16\n, and\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n48. Yet another aspect which cannot be lost sight is that the bank\n\nmentioned in the scheme that the benefit would be admissible as per\n\nthe rule which prevails on the appointed day, i.e., 31.3.2001. Thus, it\n\nis apparent that when VRS scheme was floated, it was in\n\ncontemplation of amendment of rules which was suggested by the IBA\n\nand the Government of India in its communication dated 5.9.2001 so\n\nthat employees were not deprived of the benefit of pension.\n\n49. The question arises in case the bank accepts the proposal of\n\nVRS, and does not alter its rules, can employees be deprived of the\n\nbenefit of pension in such an unconscionable manner over an event on\n\nwhich they had no control. It would be nothing, but an outcome of\n\nunfair and arbitrary act in case the SBI never intended to act upon the\n\nscheme it ought not to have accepted it, and once it approved VRS, it\n\nwas incumbent upon it to amend its rule, if necessary, as was done by\n\nother banks in 2002 after scheme worked out in the year 2000. Even\n\notherwise once it accepted the proposal of the Government of India, it\n\nwould be violative of provisions of\nArticles 14\nand\nto permit it to\n\nwriggle out of its obligation under the guise that the bank did not\n\namend its rules or pension was not admissible as per existing rules,\n\nmainly when the scheme provided for eligibility for pension on\n\ncompletion of 15 years, that formed independent contract. If the bank\nis permitted to get rid of the scheme due to Rule position, then the\n\nscheme itself would become void and unenforceable. Bank cannot act\n\nin a fanciful manner, particularly with respect to retirement under\n\nVRS which was contractual and deny benefit of pension, a right\n\naccrued to the employees for receiving the pension in view of the\n\nmemorandum and the resolution passed by the Central Board of\n\nDirectors adopting memorandum and the SBI­VRS.\n\n50. (a). The rights under contract cannot be taken away, and they\n\nbecome enforceable by a court of law. Bank cannot be permitted to\n\nmake a representation and later on wriggle out of its obligation. It is\n\nnot permissible to make a “misrepresentation”. Under\nsection 19\nof\n\nthe Contract Act, when consent is obtained by coercion, fraud, or\n\n‘misrepresentation,' the agreement is voidable at the option of the\n\naggrieved party.\nIn\nCentral Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. &\n\nAnr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr.\n, (1986) 3 SCC 156, this Court\n\nconsidered the contract of employment between the Central Inland\n\nWater Transport Corporation and its employees and also the rules. In\n\nthat context, observed thus:\n\n“75. Under\nSection 19\nof the Indian Contract Act, when\nconsent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or\nmisrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the\noption of the party whose consent was so caused. It is not the\ncase of either of the contesting respondents that there was any\ncoercion brought to bear upon him or that any fraud or\nmisrepresentation had been practiced upon him. Under\n\nSection 19\n­A, when consent to an agreement is caused by\nundue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the\noption of the party whose consent was so caused and the court\nmay set aside any such contract either absolutely or if the\nparty who was entitled to avoid it has received any benefit\nthereunder, upon such terms and conditions as to the court\nmay seem just. Sub­section (1) of\nSection 16\ndefines \"Undue\ninfluence\" as follows:\n\n“16. ‘Undue influence’ defined.—(1) A contract is said to be\ninduced by ‘undue influence’ where the relations subsisting\nbetween the parties are such that one of the parties is in a\nposition to dominate the will of the other and uses that\nposition to obtain an unfair advantage over the other.”\nThe material provisions of sub­section (2) of\nSection 16\nare as\nfollows:\n\n“(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of\nthe foregoing principle, a person is deemed to be in a position\nto dominate the will of another—\n\n(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the\nother ....”\nWe need not trouble ourselves with the other sections of the\n\nIndian Contract Act\nexcept\nSections 23\nand\n.\nSection 23\n\nstates that the consideration or object of an agreement is\nlawful unless inter alia the court regards it as opposed to\npublic policy. This section further provides that every\nagreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is\nvoid. Under\nSection 24\n, if any part of a single consideration for\none or more objects, or anyone or any part of any one of\nseveral considerations for a single object is unlawful, the\nagreement is void. The agreement is, however, not always void\nin its entirety for it is well settled that if several distinct\npromises are made for one and the same lawful consideration,\nand one or more of them be such as the law will not enforce,\nthat will not of itself prevent the rest from being enforceable.\n\nThe general rule was stated by Willes, J., in Pickering v.\nIlfracombe Ry. Co. (1868) LR 3 CP 235 (at p. 250) as follows:\n\n\"The general rule is that, where you cannot sever the illegal\nfrom the legal part of a covenant, the contract is altogether\nvoid; but where you can sever them, whether the illegality be\ncreated by statute or by the common law, you may reject the\nbad part and retain the good.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n(b).\nIn\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra), this Court considered the concept\n\nof unconscionable bargain and as to actions showing no regard for\n\nconscience; irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable, observed\n\nthus:\n“76. Under which head would an unconscionable bargain fall?\nIf it falls under the head of undue influence, it would be\nvoidable but if it falls under the head of being opposed to\npublic policy, it would be void. No case of the type before us\nappears to have fallen for decision under the law of contracts\nbefore any court in India nor has any case on all fours of a\ncourt in any other country been pointed out to us. The word\n“unconscionable” is defined in the Shorter Oxford English\nDictionary, Third Edition, Volume II, page 2288, when used\nwith reference to actions, etc. as \"showing no regard for\nconscience; irreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.\" An\nunconscionable bargain would, therefore, be one which is\nirreconcilable with what is right or reasonable.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n(c). Chitty on Contracts was referred in\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra)\n\nabout the old ideas of freedom of contract in modern times, 25 th Edn.,\n\nVol. 1, para 4, Chitty observed:\n\n“79. In this connection, it is useful to note what Chitty has to\nsay about the old ideas of freedom of contract in modern\ntimes. The relevant passages are to be found in Chitty on\nContracts, 25th Edn., Vol. I, in paragraph 4, and are as\nfollows:\n\n\"These ideas have to a large extent lost their appeal today.\n'Freedom of contract,' it has been said, 'is a reasonable social\nideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power\nbetween contracting parties can be assumed, and no injury is\ndone to the economic interests of the community at large.'\nFreedom of contract is of little value when one party has no\nalternative between accepting a set of terms proposed by the\nother or doing without the goods or services offered. Many\ncontracts entered into by public utility undertakings and\nothers take the form of a set of terms fixed in advance by one\nparty and not open to discussion by the other. These are called\n'contracts d’adhesion’ by French lawyers. Traders frequently\ncontract, not on individually negotiated terms, but on those\ncontained in a standard form of contract settled by a trade\nassociation. And the terms of an employee’s contract of\nemployment may be determined by agreement between his\ntrade union and his employer, or by a statutory scheme of\nemployment. Such transactions are nevertheless contracts\nnotwithstanding that freedom of contract is to a great extent\nlacking.\n\nWhere freedom of contract is absent, the disadvantages\nto consumers or members of the public have, to some extent,\nbeen offset by administrative procedures for consultation, and\nby legislation. Many statutes introduce terms into contracts\nwhich the parties are forbidden to exclude, or declare that\ncertain provisions in a contract shall be void. And the courts\nhave developed a number of devices for refusing to implement\nexemption clauses imposed by the economically stronger party\non the weaker, although they have not recognized in\nthemselves any general power (except by statute) to declare\nbroadly that an exemption clause will not be enforced unless it\nis reasonable. Again, more recently, certain of the judges\nappear to have recognized the possibility of relief from\ncontractual obligations on the ground of 'inequality of\nbargaining power.'\"\n\nWhat the French call “contracts d’adhesion,\" the American call\n\"adhesion contracts\" or \"contracts of adhesion.\" An \"adhesion\ncontract\" is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary. 5th Edn., at\npage 38, as follows:\n\n“Adhesion contract.—Standardized contract form offered to\nconsumers of goods and services on essentially ‘take it or leave\nit’ basis without affording consumer realistic opportunity to\nbargain and under such conditions that consumer cannot\nobtain desired product or services except by acquiescing in\nform contract. Distinctive feature of adhesion contract is that\nweaker party has no realistic choice as to its terms. Not every\nsuch contract is unconscionable.”\n\n80. The position under the American law is stated in\nReinstatement of the Law — Second as adopted and\npromulgated by the American Law Institute, Volume II which\ndeals with the law of contracts, in\nSection 208\nat page 107, as\nfollows:\n\n“§ 208. Unconscionable Contract or Term\nIf a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the\ntime the contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the\ncontract, or may enforce the remainder of the contract without\nthe unconscionable term, or may so limit the application of\nany unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable\nresult.”\nIn the Comments given under that section, it is stated at page\n107:\n\n“Like the obligation of good faith and fair dealing (§ 205),\nthe policy against unconscionable contracts or terms applies to\na wide variety of types of conduct. The determination that a\ncontract or term is or is not unconscionable is made in the\nlight of its setting, purpose and effect. Relevant factors include\nweaknesses in the contracting process like those involved in\nmore specific rules as to contractual capacity, fraud and other\ninvalidating causes; the policy also overlaps with rules which\nrender particular bargains or terms unenforceable on grounds\nof public policy. Policing against unconscionable contracts or\nterms has sometimes been accomplished by adverse\nconstruction of language, by manipulation of the rules of offer\nand acceptance or by determinations that the clause is contrary\nto public policy or to the dominant purpose of the contract.\nUniform Commercial Code § 2­302 Comment 1 .... A bargain is\nnot unconscionable merely because the parties to it are\nunequal in bargaining position, nor even because the\ninequality results in an allocation of risks to the weaker party.\nBut gross inequality of bargaining power, together with terms\nunreasonably favourable to the stronger party , may confirm\nindications that the transaction involved elements of deception\nor compulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no\nmeaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact assent\nor appear to assent to the unfair terms.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nThere is a statute in the United States called the Universal\nCommercial Code, which applies to contracts relating to sales\nof goods. Though this statute is inapplicable to contracts not\ninvolving sales of goods, it has proved very influential in what\nis called in the United States, \"non­sales\" cases. It has many\ntimes been used either by analogy or because it was felt to\nembody a generally accepted social attitude of fairness going\nbeyond its statutory application to sales of goods. In the\nReporter's Note to said\nSection 208\n, it is stated at p. 112:\n\"It is to be emphasized that a contract of adhesion is not\nunconscionable per se, and that all unconscionable contracts\nare not contracts of adhesion. Nonetheless, the more\nstandardised the agreement and the less a party may bargain\nmeaningfully, the more susceptible the contract or a term will be\nto a claim of unconscionability.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe position has been thus summed up by John R. Peden in\n‘The Law of Unjust Contracts’ published by Butterworths in\n1982, at pages 28­29:\n\n“... Unconscionability represents the end of a cycle\ncommencing with the Aristotelian concept of justice and the\nRoman law laesio enormis, which in turn formed the basis for\nthe medieval church’s concept of a just price and\ncondemnation of usury. These philosophies permeated the\nexercise, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, of\nthe Chancery court’s discretionary powers under which it\nupset all kinds of unfair transactions. Subsequently the\nmovement towards economic individualism in the nineteenth\ncentury hardened the exercise of these powers by emphasising\nthe freedom of the parties to make their own contract. While\nthe principle of pacta sunt servanda held dominance, the\nconsensual theory still recognized exceptions where one party\nwas overborne by a fiduciary, or entered a contract under\nduress or as the result of fraud. However, these exceptions\nwere limited and had to be strictly proved.\n\nIt is suggested that the judicial and legislative trend during\nthe last 30 years in both civil and common law jurisdictions\nhas almost brought the wheel full circle. Both courts and\nparliaments have provided greater protection for weaker\nparties from harsh contracts. In several jurisdictions this\nincluded a general power to grant relief from unconscionable\ncontracts, thereby providing a launching point from which the\ncourts have the opportunity to develop a modern doctrine of\nunconscionability. American decisions on\nArticle 2.302\nof the\nUCC have already gone some distance into this new arena....”\nThe expression “laesio enormis” used in the above passage\nrefers to “laesio ultra dimidium vel enormis” which in Roman\nlaw meant the injury sustained by one of the parties to an\nonerous contract when he had been overreached by the other\nto the extent of more than one­half of the value of the subject­\nmatter, as for example, when a vendor had not received half\nthe value of property sold, or the purchaser had paid more\nthan double value. The maxim “pacta sunt servanda\" referred\nto in the above passage, means \"contracts are to be kept.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nThis Court held that due to inequality of bargaining power,\n\nunreasonable terms, unreasonable favour to the stronger party may\n\ninvolve an element of deception or compulsion, or may show that the\n\nweaker party had no meaningful choice. The Court in\nBrojo Nath\n\nGanguly\n(supra) also observed that in the sphere of the law of\n\ncontract, the test of reasonableness or fairness has emerged. Even an\n\nunreasonable clause cannot be enforced as that would be\n\nunconscionable.\n\nHere the reasonable construction in the matter is that the\n\npension is clearly admissible as per the resolution passed by the\n\nCentral Board of Directors of SBI, which is sought to be denied, it was\n\nfor SBI to amend Rules. Such an action would be unconscionable, and\n\ncourts cannot be said to be powerless in such a situation to enforce\n\nthe SBI VRS with an obligation to make payment of pension.\n(d). This Court considered the enforcement of unreasonable\n\ncontracts and enforceability thereof in\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra)\n\nthus:\n\n“83. Yet another theory which has made its emergence in\nrecent years in the sphere of the law of contracts is the test of\nreasonableness or fairness of a clause in a contract where\nthere is inequality of bargaining power. Lord Denning, MR,\nappears to have been the propounder, and perhaps the\noriginator —at least in England, of this theory. In Gillespie\nBrothers & Co. Ltd. v. Roy Bowles Transport Ltd., (1973) QB\n400, where the question was whether an indemnity clause in a\ncontract, on its true construction, relieved the indemnifier\nfrom liability arising to the indemnified from his own\nnegligence, Lord Denning said (at pages 415­416):\n\n“The time may come when this process of ‘construing’ the\ncontract can be pursued no further. The words are too clear to\npermit of it. Are the courts then powerless? Are they to permit\nthe party to enforce his unreasonable clause, even when it is so\nunreasonable, or applied so unreasonably, as to be\nunconscionable? When it gets to this point, I would say, as I\nsaid many years ago:\n\n‘there is the vigilance of the common law which, while\nallowing freedom of contract, watches to see that it is not\nabused’: John Lee & Son (Grantham) Ltd. v. Railway Executive,\n(1949) 2 All ER 581.\n\nIt will not allow a party to exempt himself from his liability at\ncommon law when it would be quite unconscionable for him to\ndo so.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn the above case, the Court of Appeal negatived the defense of\nthe indemnifier that the indemnity clause did not cover the\nnegligence of the indemnified. It was in Lloyds Bank Ltd. v.\nBundy (1974) 3 All ER 757 that Lord Denning first clearly\nenunciated his theory of \"inequality of bargaining power.\" He\nbegan his discussion on this part of the case by stating (at\npage 763) :\n\n“There are cases in our books in which the courts will set aside\na contract, or a transfer of property, when the parties have not\nmet on equal terms, when the one is so strong in bargaining\npower and the other so weak that, as a matter of common\nfairness, it is not right that the strong should be allowed to push\nthe weak to the wall. Hitherto those exceptional cases have\nbeen treated each as a separate category in itself. But I think\nthe time has come when we should seek to find a principle to\nunite them. I put on one side contracts or transactions which\nare voidable for fraud or misrepresentation or mistake. All\nthose are governed by settled principles. I go only to those\nwhere there has been inequality of bargaining power, such as\nto merit the intervention of the court.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nHe then referred to various categories of cases and ultimately\ndeduced therefrom a general principle in these words (at page\n\n765):\n\n“Gathering all together, I would suggest that through all\nthese instances there runs a single thread. They rest on\n‘inequality of bargaining power.' By virtue of it, the English law\ngives relief to one who, without independent advice, enters into\na contract on terms which are very unfair or transfers property\nfor a consideration which is grossly inadequate, when his\nbargaining power is grievously impaired by reason of his own\nneeds or desires, or by his own ignorance or infirmity, coupled\nwith undue influences or pressures brought to bear on him by\nor for the benefit of the other. When I use the word 'undue,' I\ndo not mean to suggest that the principle depends on proof of\nany wrongdoing. The one who stipulates for an unfair\nadvantage may be moved solely by his own self­interest,\nunconscious of the distress he is bringing to the other. I have\nalso avoided any reference to the will of the one being\n‘dominated’ or ‘overcome’ by the other. One who is in extreme\nneed may knowingly consent to a most improvident bargain,\nsolely to relieve the straits in which he finds himself. Again, I do\nnot mean to suggest that every transaction is saved by\nindependent advice. But the absence of it may be fatal. With\nthese explanations, I hope this principle will be found to\nreconcile the cases.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n(e). The Court clearly held that the contracts, which are the outcome\n\nof misrepresentation, cannot be enforced, and inequality of bargaining\n\npower merit the intervention of the court. In A. Schroeder Music\n\nPublishing Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay (formerly Instone) (1974) 1 WLR 1308,\n\nLord Diplock made the following observations at pp. 1315­16 thus:\n\n\"84. …. \"My Lords, the contract under consideration in this\nappeal is one whereby the respondent accepted restrictions\nupon the way in which he would exploit his earning power as a\nsongwriter for the next ten years. Because this can be\nclassified as a contract in restraint of trade the restrictions\nthat the respondent accepted fell within one of those limited\ncategories of contractual promises in respect of which the\ncourts still retain the power to relieve the promisor of his legal\nduty to fulfill them. In order to determine whether this case is\none in which that power ought to be exercised, what your\nLordships have in fact been doing has been to assess the\nrelative bargaining power of the publisher and the songwriter\nat the time the contract was made and to decide whether the\npublisher had used his superior bargaining power to exact\nfrom the songwriter promises that were unfairly onerous to\nhim. Your Lordships have not been concerned to inquire\nwhether the public have in fact been deprived of the fruit of the\nsong writer's talents by reason of the restrictions, nor to\nassess the likelihood that they would be so deprived in the\nfuture if the contract were permitted to run its full course.\nIt is, in my view, salutary to acknowledge that in refusing to\nenforce provisions of a contract whereby one party agrees for\nthe benefit of the other party to exploit or to refrain from\nexploiting his own earning power, the public policy which the\ncourt is implementing is not some 19th century economic\ntheory about the benefit to the general public of freedom of\ntrade, but the protection of those whose bargaining power is\nweak against being forced by those whose bargaining power is\nstronger to enter into bargains that are unconscionable. Under\nthe influence of Bentham and of laissez faire the courts in the\n19th century abandoned the practice of applying the public\npolicy against unconscionable bargains to contracts generally,\nas they had formerly done to any contract considered to be\nusurious; but the policy survived in its application to penalty\nclauses and to relief against forfeiture and also to the special\ncategory of contracts in restraint of trade. If one looks at the\nreasoning of 19th­century judges in cases about contracts in\nrestraint of trade one finds lip service paid to current economic\ntheories, but if one looks at what they said in the light of what\nthey did, one finds that they struck down a bargain if they\nthought it was unconscionable as between the parties to it and\nupheld it if they thought that it was not.\n\nSo I would hold that the question to be answered as respects\na contract in restraint of trade of the kind with which this\nappeal is concerned is: ‘Was the bargain fair?’ The test of\nfairness is, no doubt, whether the restrictions are both\nreasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate\ninterests of the promisee and commensurate with the benefits\nsecured to the promisor under the contract. For the purpose of\nthis test, all the provisions of the contract must be taken into\nconsideration.”\n\n(f). A term which exempts the stronger party from his ordinary\n\ncommon law liability should not be given effect except when it is\nreasonable, as observed in Levison v. Patent Steam Carpet Co. Ltd.,\n\n(1949) 2 All ER 581 at 584 relied upon in\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra)\n\nthus:\n\n“85. The observations of Lord Denning, M.R., in\nLevison v. Patent Steam Carpet Co. Ltd. are also useful\nand require to be quoted. These observations are as\nfollows (at page 79) :\n\n\"In such circumstances as here the Law Commission in\n1975 recommended that a term which exempts the stronger\nparty from his ordinary common law liability should not be\ngiven effect except when it is reasonable: see The Law\nCommission and the Scottish Law Commission Report,\nExemption Clauses, Second Report (1975) (August 5, 1975),\nLaw Com. No. 69 (H.C. 605), pp. 62, 174; and there is a Bill\nnow before Parliament, which gives effect to the test of\nreasonableness. This is a gratifying piece of law reform: but I\ndo not think we need wait for that Bill to be passed into law.\nYou never know what may happen to a Bill. Meanwhile, the\ncommon law has its own principles ready to hand. In Gillespie\nBros. &\nCo. Ltd. v. Roy Bowles Transport Ltd.\n(1973) QB 400, I\nsuggested that an exemption or limitation clause should not be\ngiven effect if it was unreasonable, or if it would be\nunreasonable to apply it in the circumstances of the case. I see\nno reason why this should not be applied today, at any rate in\ncontracts in standard forms where there is inequality of\nbargaining power.”\n\n(g). Courts have to construe the contracts according to the tenor.\nIn\n\nthis regard, in\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra), the Court considered the\n\nquestion thus:\n\n“87. In Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport\nLtd. (1980) AC 827, a case before the Unfair Contract\nTerms Act, 1977, was enacted, the House of Lords upheld\nan exemption clause in a contract on the defendants'\nprinted form containing standard conditions. The\ndecision appears to proceed on the ground that the\nparties were businessmen and did not possess unequal\nbargaining power. The House of Lords did not, in that\ncase, reject the test of reasonableness or fairness of a\nclause in a contract where the parties are not equal in\nbargaining position. On the contrary, the speeches of\nLord Wilberforce, Lord Diplock, and Lord Scarman would\nseem to show that the House of Lords in a fit case would\naccept that test. Lord Wilberforce, in his speech, after\nreferring to the Unfair Contract Terms Act, 1977, said (at\npage 843) :\n\n“\nThis Act\napplies to consumer contracts and those based\non standard terms and enables exception clauses to be applied\nwith regard to what is just and reasonable. It is significant that\nParliament refrained from legislating over the whole field of\ncontract. After this Act, in commercial matters generally, when\nthe parties are not of unequal bargaining power, and when\nrisks are normally borne by insurance, not only is the case for\njudicial intervention undemonstrated, but there is everything\nto be said, and this seems to have been Parliament’s intention,\nfor leaving the parties free to apportion the risks as they think\nfit and for respecting their decisions.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nLord Diplock said (at page 850­51):\n\n“Since the obligations implied by law in a commercial\ncontract are those which, by judicial consensus over the years\nor by Parliament in passing a statute, have been regarded as\nobligations which a reasonable businessman would realise that\nhe was accepting when he entered into a contract of a particular\nkind, the court’s view of the reasonableness of any departure\nfrom the implied obligations which would be involved in\nconstruing the express words of an exclusion clause in one\nsense that they are capable of bearing rather than another, is\na relevant consideration in deciding what meaning the words\nwere intended by the parties to bear.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nLord Scarman, while agreeing with Lord Wilberforce, described\n(at page 853) the action out of which the appeal before the\nHouse had arisen as “a commercial dispute between parties\nwell able to look after themselves” and then added: “In such a\nsituation what the parties agreed (expressly or impliedly) is\nwhat matters, and the duty of the courts is to construe their\ncontract according to its tenor.\"\n\n88. As seen above, apart from judicial decisions, the United\nStates and the United Kingdom have statutorily recognised, at\nleast in certain areas of the law of contracts, that there can be\nunreasonableness (or lack of fairness, if one prefers that\nphrase) in a contract or a clause in a contract where there is\ninequality of bargaining power between the parties although\narising out of circumstances not within their control or as a\nresult of situations not of their creation. Other legal systems\nalso permit judicial review of a contractual transaction entered\ninto in similar circumstances. For example,\nSection 138(2)\nof\nthe German Civil Code provides that a transaction is void\n\"when a person\" exploits \"the distressed situation,\ninexperience, lack of judgmental ability, or grave weakness of\nwill of another to obtain the grant or promise of pecuniary\nadvantages ... which are obviously disproportionate to the\nperformance given in return\". The position, according to the\nFrench law, is very much the same.\"\n\n(h).\nIn\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra), it was pointed out what court\n\nshould do in such a matter thus:\n\n“89. Should then our courts not advance with the times?\nShould they still continue to cling to outmoded concepts\nand outworn ideologies? Should we not adjust our\nthinking caps to match the fashion of the day? Should all\njurisprudential development pass us by, leaving us\nfloundering in the sloughs of 19th­century theories?\nShould the strong be permitted to push the weak to the\nwall? Should they be allowed to ride roughshod over the\nweak? Should the courts sit back and watch supinely\nwhile the strong trample underfoot the rights of the\nweak? We have a Constitution for our country. Our\njudges are bound by their oath to \"uphold the\nConstitution and the laws.\" The Constitution was enacted\nto secure to all the citizens of this country social and\neconomic justice.\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution\nguarantees to all persons equality before the law and the\nequal protection of the laws. The principle deducible from\nthe above discussions on this part of the case is in\nconsonance with right and reason, intended to secure\nsocial and economic justice and conforms to the mandate\nof the great equality clause in\nArticle 14.\nThis principle is\nthat the courts will not enforce and will, when called\nupon to do so, strike down an unfair and unreasonable\ncontract, or an unfair and unreasonable clause in a\ncontract, entered into between parties who are not equal\nin bargaining power. It is difficult to give an exhaustive\nlist of all bargains of this type. No court can visualize the\ndifferent situations which can arise in the affairs of men.\nOne can only attempt to give some illustrations. For\ninstance, the above principle will apply where the\ninequality of bargaining power is the result of the great\ndisparity in the economic strength of the contracting\nparties. It will apply where the inequality is the result of\ncircumstances, whether of the creation of the parties or\nnot. It will apply to situations in which the weaker party\nis in a position in which he can obtain goods or services\nor means of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by\nthe stronger party or go without them. It will also apply\nwhere a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful\nchoice, but to give his assent to a contract or to sign on\nthe dotted line in a prescribed or standard form or to\naccept a set of rules as part of the contract, however\nunfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a clause in\nthat contract or form or rules may be. This principle,\nhowever, will not apply where the bargaining power of the\ncontracting parties is equal or almost equal. This\nprinciple may not apply where both parties are\nbusinessmen, and the contract is a commercial\ntransaction. In today’s complex world of giant\ncorporations with their vast infrastructural organizations\nand with the State through its instrumentalities and\nagencies entering into almost every branch of industry\nand commerce, there can be myriad situations which\nresult in unfair and unreasonable bargains between\nparties possessing wholly disproportionate and unequal\nbargaining power. These cases can neither be\nenumerated nor fully illustrated. The court must judge\neach case on its own facts and circumstances.”\n\n(i). The Court in\nBrojo Nath Ganguly\n(supra) held that the contract,\n\nwhich affected a large number of persons if they are unconscionable,\n\nunfair, and unreasonable, the contract is voidable. The court would\n\nnot compel each person with whom the party with superior bargaining\n\npower had contracted to go to court to adjudge the contract voidable\n\nand would result in a multiplicity of litigation. It observed:\n\n“91. Is a contract of the type mentioned above to be adjudged\nvoidable or void? If it was induced by undue influence, then\nunder\nSection 19\n­\nA of the Indian Contract Act\n, it would be\nvoidable. It is, however, rarely that contracts of the types to\nwhich the principle formulated by us above applies are\ninduced by undue influence as defined by\nSection 16(1)\nof the\nIndian Contract Act, even though at times they are between\nparties one of whom holds a real or apparent authority over\nthe other. In the vast majority of cases, however, such\ncontracts are entered into by the weaker party under pressure\nof circumstances, generally economic, which results in\ninequality of bargaining power. Such contracts will not fall\nwithin the four corners of the definition of “undue influence”\ngiven in\nSection 16(1)\n. Further, the majority of such contracts\nare in a standard or prescribed form or consist of a set of\nrules. They are not contracts between individuals containing\nterms meant for those individuals alone. Contracts in\nprescribed or standard forms or which embody a set of rules\nas part of the contract are entered into by the party with\nsuperior bargaining power with a large number of persons who\nhave far less bargaining power or no bargaining power at all.\nSuch contracts which affect a large number of persons or a\ngroup or groups of persons, if they are unconscionable, unfair,\nand unreasonable, are injurious to the public interest. To say\nthat such a contract is only voidable would be to compel each\nperson with whom the party with superior bargaining power\nhad contracted to go to court to have the contract adjudged\nvoidable. This would only result in multiplicity of litigation,\nwhich no court should encourage and would also not be in the\npublic interest. Such a contract or such a clause in a contract\nought, therefore, to be adjudged void. While the law of\ncontracts in England is mostly judge­made, the law of\ncontracts in India is enacted in a statute, namely, the\nIndian\nContract Act, 1872\n. In order that such a contract should be\nvoid, it must fall under one of the relevant sections of the\n\nIndian Contract Act\n. The only relevant provision in the\nIndian\nContract Act\n, which can apply is\nSection 23\n, when it states\nthat \"The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful,\nunless ... the court regards it as ... opposed to public policy.\"\n\n(j). The Court also considered the “public policy”. The same is not the\n\npolicy of a particular Government. It connotes some matter which\n\nconcerns the public good and the public interest. Action has to be\n\nsubservient to public policy. This Court in the context of\nContract Act\n\nand Public Policy made the following observations:\n\n“92.\nThe Indian Contract Act\ndoes not define the\nexpression \"public policy\" or \"opposed to public policy.\"\nFrom the very nature of things, the expressions \"public\npolicy,\" \"opposed to public policy,\" or \"contrary to public\npolicy\" are incapable of precise definition. Public policy,\nhowever, is not the policy of a particular government. It\nconnotes some matter which concerns the public good\nand the public interest. The concept of what is for the\npublic good or in the public interest or what would be\ninjurious or harmful to the public good or the public\ninterest has varied from time to time. As new concepts\ntake the place of old, transactions which were once\nconsidered against public policy are now being upheld by\nthe courts, and similarly, where there has been a well­\nrecognized head of public policy, the courts have not\nshirked from extending it to new transactions and\nchanged circumstances and have at times not even\nflinched from inventing a new head of public policy. There\nare two schools of thought— \"the narrow view\" school\nand \"the broad view\" school. According to the former,\ncourts cannot create new heads of public policy, whereas\nthe latter countenances judicial law­making in this area.\nThe adherents of \"the narrow view\" school would not\ninvalidate a contract on the ground of public policy\nunless that particular ground had been well­established\nby authorities. Hardly ever has the voice of the timorous\nspoken more clearly and loudly than in these words of\nLord Davey in Janson v. Driefontein Consolidated Gold\nMines Ltd.: \"Public policy is always an unsafe and\ntreacherous ground for legal decision.\" That was in the\nyear 1902. Seventy­eight years earlier, Burrough, J., in\nRichardson v. Mellish, (1824­34) All ER 258, described\npublic policy as \"a very unruly horse, and when once you\nget astride it you never know where it will carry you.\"\nThe\nMaster of the Rolls, Lord Denning, however, was not a\nman to shy away from unmanageable horses and in\nwords which conjure up before our eyes the picture of the\nyoung Alexander the Great taming Bucephalus, he said\nin\nEnderby Town Football Club Ltd. v. Football Assn. Ltd.\n\n(1971) Ch 591: \"With a good man in the saddle, the\nunruly horse can be kept in control. It can jump over\nobstacles.\" Had the timorous always held the field, not\nonly the doctrine of public policy but even the Common\nLaw or the principles of Equity would never have evolved.\n\nSir William Holdsworth in his \"History of English Law,\"\n\nVolume III, page 55, has said:\n\n\"In fact, a body of law like the common law, which has\ngrown up gradually with the growth of the nation, necessarily\nacquires some fixed principles, and if it is to maintain these\nprinciples, it must be able, on the ground of public policy or\nsome other like ground, to suppress practices which, under\never new disguises, seek to weaken or negative them.\"\n\nIt is thus clear that the principles governing public policy must\nbe and are capable, on proper occasion, of expansion or\nmodification. Practices which were considered perfectly normal\nat one time have today become obnoxious and oppressive to\npublic conscience. If there is no head of public policy which\ncovers a case, then the court must in consonance with public\nconscience and in keeping with public good and public interest\ndeclare such practice to be opposed to public policy. Above all,\nin deciding any case which may not be covered by authority,\nour courts have before them the beacon light of the Preamble\nto the Constitution. Lacking precedent, the court can always\nbe guided by that light and the principles underlying the\nFundamental Rights and the Directive Principles enshrined in\nour Constitution.\n\n93. The normal rule of Common Law has been that a party\nwho seeks to enforce an agreement which is opposed to public\npolicy will be non­suited. The case of A. Schroeder Music\nPublishing Co. Ltd. v. Macaulay (1974) 1 WLR 1308, however,\nestablishes that where a contract is vitiated as being contrary\nto public policy, the party adversely affected by it can sue to\nhave it declared void. The case may be different, where the\npurpose of the contract is illegal or immoral.\nIn\nKedar Nath\nMotani v. Prahlad Rai\n, AIR 1960 SC 213, reversing the High\nCourt and restoring the decree passed by the trial court\ndeclaring the appellants’ title to the lands in suit and directing\nthe respondents who were the appellants’ benamidars to\nrestore possession, this Court, after discussing the English\nand Indian law on the subject, said: (at page 873) :\n\n\"The correct position in law, in our opinion, is that what\none has to see is whether the illegality goes so much to the\nroot of the matter that the plaintiff cannot bring his action\nwithout relying upon the illegal transaction into which he had\nentered. If the illegality be trivial or venial, as stated by\nWilliston and the plaintiff is not required to rest his case upon\nthat illegality, then public policy demands that the defendant\nshould not be allowed to take advantage of the position. A\nstrict view, of course, must be taken of the plaintiff's conduct,\nand he should not be allowed to circumvent the illegality by\nresorting to some subterfuge or by misstating the facts. If,\nhowever, the matter is clear and the illegality is not required to\nbe pleaded or proved as part of the cause of action, and the\nplaintiff recanted before the illegal purpose was achieved, then,\nunless it be of such a gross nature as to outrage the\nconscience of the court, the plea of the defendant should not\nprevail.\"\n\nThe types of contracts to which the principle formulated by us\nabove applies are not contracts which are tainted with illegality\nbut are contracts which contain terms which are so unfair and\nunreasonable that they shock the conscience of the court.\nThey are opposed to public policy and require to be adjudged\nvoid.”\n\n51. This Court also considered the law of contract and its\n\ninterpretation in changing times in\nDelhi Transport Corporation v.\n\nD.T.C. Mazdoor Congress & Ors.\n, (1991) Supp 1 SCC 600 thus:\n“279. In paragraph 4 of Chitty on Contracts (25th edn., vol. 1)\nit is stated that \"freedom of contract is a reasonable social\nideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power\nbetween contracting parties can be assumed and no injury is\ndone to the economic interest of the community at large.\"\n\n280. In Anson’s Law of Contract at pages 6 and 7 stated the\nscope of freedom of contract in the changing circumstances\nthus:\n\n\"Today the position is seen in a very different light. Freedom\nof contract is a reasonable social ideal only to the extent that\nequality of bargaining power between contracting parties can\nbe assumed, and no injury is done to the economic interests of\nthe community at large. In the more complicated social and\nindustrial conditions of a collectivist society, it has ceased to\nhave much idealistic attraction. It is now realised that\neconomic equality often does not exist in any real sense and\nthat individual interests have to be made to subserve those of\nthe community hence there has been a fundamental change\nboth in our social outlook and in the policy of the legislature\ntowards contract and the law today interferes at numerous\npoints with the freedom of the parties to make what contract\nthey like. The relation between employers and employed, for\nexample, have been regulated by statutes designed to ensure\nthat the employee’s condition of work are safe, that he is\nproperly protected against redundancy, and that he knows his\nterms of service. The public has been protected against\neconomic pressure by such measures as the Rent Acts, the\nSupply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act, the Consumer Credit\nAct, and other similar enactments. These legislative provisions\nwill override any contrary terms which the parties may make\nfor themselves. Further, the legislature has intervened in the\nRestrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, and the Fair Trading Act,\n1973 to promote competition in industry and to safeguard the\ninterests of consumers. This intervention is specially necessary\ntoday when most contracts entered by ordinary people are not\nthe result of individual negotiation. It is not possible for a\nprivate person to settle the terms of his agreement with a\nBritish Railways Board or with a local electricity authority.”\nThe 'standard form' contract is the rule. He must either accept\nthe terms of this contract in toto or go without. Since,\nhowever, it is not feasible to deprive oneself of such necessary\nservices, the individual is compelled to accept on those terms.\nIn view of this fact, it is quite clear that freedom of contract is\nnow largely an illusion.\"\n\n52. (a). It has been emphasised in\nD.T.C.\n(supra) that the period of\n\ncontract is to be reasonable and the employee has a right to know the\nconditions of work and he is properly protected against redundancy.\n\nApproving decision in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd.\n\n& Anr. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. (1983) 3 SCC 156 Court held\n\nthus:\n\n“282.\nIn\nBrojo Nath\ncase (1986) 3 SCC 156, Madon, J.\nelaborately considered the development of law relating to\nunfair or unreasonable terms of the contract or clauses thereof\nin extenso, and it is unnecessary for me to traverse the same\ngrounds once over. The learned Judge also considered the\narbitrary, unfair, and unbridled power on the anvil of\ndistributive justice or justness or fairness of the procedure\nenvisaged therein. The relevant case law in that regard was\ndealt with in extenso in the light of the development of law in\nthe Supreme Court of United States of America and the House\nof Lords in England and in the continental countries. To avoid\nneedless burden on the judgment, I do not repeat the same\nreasoning. I entirely agree with the reasoning, and the\nconclusions reached therein on all these aspects.\"\n\n(b). This Court in\nD.T.C.\n(supra) with respect to the alteration of\n\nGovernment contracts and the right of the State to impose\n\nunconstitutional conditions, observed:\n\n“283. The problem also could be broached from the angle\nwhether the State can impose unconstitutional conditions as\npart of the contract or statute or rule etc. In (1959­60) 73\nHarvard Law Review, in the Note under the caption\n‘Unconstitutional Condition’ at pages 1595­96 it is postulated\nthat the State is devoid of power to impose unconstitutional\nconditions in the contract that the power to withhold largesse\nhas been asserted by the State in four areas i.e. (1) regulating\nthe right to engage in certain activities; (2) administration of\ngovernment welfare programme; (3) government employment;\nand (4) procurement of contracts. It was further adumbrated\nat pages 1602­03 thus:\n\n\"The sovereign's constitutional authority to choose those with\nwhom it will contract for goods and services is, in effect, a\npower to withhold the benefits to be derived from economic\ndealings with the government. As government activity in the\neconomic sphere increases, the contracting power enables the\ngovernment to control many hitherto unregulated activities of\ncontracting parties through the imposition of conditions. Thus,\nregarding the government, as a private entrepreneur, threatens\nto impair constitutional rights. The government, unlike a\nprivate individual, is limited in its ability to contract by the\nConstitution. The federal contracting power is based upon the\nConstitution's authorisation of these acts 'necessary and\nproper' to the carrying out of the functions which it allocates to\nthe national government. Unless the objectives sought by\nterms and conditions in government contracts requiring the\nsurrender of rights are constitutionally authorised, the\nconditions must fall as ultra vires exercise of power.”\n\nAgain at page 1603, it is further emphasised thus:\n“When conditions limit the economic benefits to be derived\nfrom dealings with the government to those who forego the\nexercise of constitutional rights, the exclusion of those\nretaining their rights from participation in the enjoyment of\nthese benefits may be violative of the prohibition, implicit in\nthe due process clause of Fifth Amendment and explicit in the\nequal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment against\nunreasonable discrimination in the governmental bestow of\nadvantages. Finally, disabling those exercising certain rights\nfrom participating in the advantages to be derived from\ncontractual relations with the government may be a form of\npenalty lacking in due process. To avoid invalidation for any of\nthe above reasons, it must be shown that the conditions\nimposed are necessary to secure the legitimate objectives of\nthe contract, ensure its effective use, or protect society from\nthe potential harm which may result from the contractual\nrelationship between the government and the individual.”\n\n284. Professor Guido Calabresi of Yale University Law School\nin his “Retroactivity, Paramount Power and Contractual\nChanges” (1961­62) 71 Yale Law Journal 1191, stated that the\ngovernment can make contracts that are necessary and proper\nfor carrying out any of the specific clauses of the Constitution\nor power to spend for general welfare. The Federal Government\nhas no power, inherent or sovereign, other than those\nspecifically or explicitly granted to it by the Constitution. At\npage 1197, it is further stated thus:\n\n“The government acts according to due process standards for\nthe due process clause is quite up to that task without the\nrule. Alterations of government contracts are not desirable in a\nfree country even when they do not constitute a ‘taking’ of\nproperty or impinge on questions of fundamental fairness of\nthe type comprehended in due process. The government may\nmake changes, but only if war or commerce require them and\nnot on the broader and more ephemeral grounds that the\ngeneral welfare would be served by the change. Any other rule\nwould allow the government to welch almost at will.”\nxxx\n286.\nIn\nBrojo Nath\ncase (supra, after elaborate consideration of\nthe doctrine of “reasonableness or fairness” of the terms and\nconditions of the contract vis­a­vis the relative bargaining\npower of the contracting parties this Court laid down that the\nprinciples deducible from the discussion made therein is in\nconsonance with right or reason intended to secure socio­\neconomic justice and conform to mandate of the equality\nclause in\nArticle 14.\nThe principle laid was that courts will not\nenforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike down an\nunfair and unreasonable contract or an unfair and\nunreasonable clause in a contract, entered into between\nparties who are not equal in bargaining power …. It will apply\nto situations in which the weaker party is in a position in\nwhich he can obtain goods or services or means of livelihood\nonly upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go\nwithout them. It will also apply where a man has no choice, or\nrather no meaningful choice, but to give his assent to a\ncontract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or\nstandard form or to accept a set of rules as part of the\ncontract, however unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a\nclause in that contract or form or rules may be. This principle,\nhowever, will not apply where the bargaining power of the\ncontracting parties is equal or almost equal or where both\nparties are businessmen, and the contract is a commercial\ntransaction.\n\n287. In today’s complex world of giant corporations with their\nvast infrastructural organisations the State through its\ninstrumentalities and agencies has been entering into almost\nevery branch of industry and commerce and field of service,\nthere can be myriad situations which result in unfair and\nunreasonable bargains between parties possessing wholly\ndisproportionate and unequal bargaining power. These cases\ncan neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court\nmust judge each case on its own facts and circumstances.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Court held that there can be myriad situations which result in\n\nunfair and unreasonable bargains, which are the outcome of an\n\nunequal bargaining power. Each case has to be seen on its own facts\n\nand circumstances.\n\n(c).\nIn\nD.T.C.\n(supra), the Court also held that\nArticle 14\nsheds light\n\non public policy to curb arbitrariness thus:\n“294.\nIn\nBasheshar Nath v. CIT\n, AIR 1959 SC 149, S.R. Das,\nC.J. held that\nArticle 14\nis founded on a sound public policy\nrecognised and valued in all States, and it admonishes the\nState when it disregards the obligations imposed upon the\nState.\n\n295.\nIn\nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu\n, (1974) 4 SCC 3,\nBhagwati, J. (as he then was) held that\nArticle 14\nis the genus\nwhile\nArticle 16\nis a specie.\nArticle 16\ngives effect to the\ndoctrine of equality in all matters relating to public\nemployment. The basic principle which, therefore, informs\nboth\nArticles 14\nand\nis equality and inhibition against\ndiscrimination. \"Equality is a dynamic concept with many\naspects and dimensions, and it cannot be “cribbed, cabined\nand confined” within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a\npositivistic point of view, equality is antithetical to\narbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn\nenemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the\nother, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where\nan act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both\naccording to political logic and constitutional law and is\ntherefore violative of\nArticle 14\n, and if it affects any matter\nrelating to public employment, it is also violative of\nArticle 16.\n\nArticles 14\nand\nstrike at arbitrariness in State action and\nensure fairness and equality of treatment. In Maneka Gandhi\ncase (1978) 1 SCC 248, it was further held that the principle of\nreasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an\nessential element of equality or non­arbitrariness pervades\n\nArticle 14\nlike a brooding omnipresence. In Ramana case\n(1979) 3 SCC 489, it was held that it is merely a judicial\nformula for determining whether the legislative or executive\naction in question is arbitrary and therefore constituting\ndenial of equality. If the classification is not reasonable and\ndoes not satisfy the two conditions, namely, rational relation\nand nexus, the impugned legislative or executive action would\nplainly be arbitrary, and the guarantees of equality under\n\nArticle 14\nwould be breached. Wherever, therefore, there is\narbitrariness in State action, whether it be of legislature or of\nthe executive or of an \"authority\" under\nArticle 12\n,\nArticle 14\n,\n\"immediately springs into action and strikes down such State\naction.\" In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non­\narbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is\na golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of\nthe constitution.\n\n302.\nArticle 14\nis the general principle, while\nArticle 311(2)\nis\na special provision applicable to all civil services under the\nState.\nArticle 311(2)\nembodies the principles of natural justice,\nbut proviso to clause (2) of\nArticle 311\nexcludes the operation\nof principles of natural justice engrafted in\nArticle 311(2)\nas an\nexception in the given circumstances enumerated in three\nclauses of the proviso to\nArticle 311(2)\nof the Constitution.\n\nArticle 14\nread with\nArticles 16(1)\n, and\nare to be\nharmoniously interpreted that the proviso to\nArticle 311(2)\n\nexcludes the application of the principles of natural justice as\nan exception; and the applicability of\nArticle 311(2)\nmust,\ntherefore, be circumscribed to the civil services and be\nconstrued accordingly. In respect of all other employees\ncovered by\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution, the dynamic role of\n\nArticle 14\nand other relevant articles like\nArticle 21\nmust be\nallowed to have full play without any inhibition, unless the\nstatutory rules themselves, consistent with the mandate of\n\nArticles 14\n, 16\n, 19\nand\nprovide, expressly such an\nexception.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n(d). Arbitrariness in State action whether of the legislature or the\n\nexecutive or of an authority under\nArticles 12\n, 14\nand\ncomes into\n\nplay to strike down such an action. The Court in\nD.T.C.\n(supra) held\n\nthus:\n\n“303.\nArticle 19(1)(g)\nempowers every citizen the right to\navocation or profession etc. which includes right to be\ncontinued in employment under the State unless the tenure is\nvalidly terminated consistent with the scheme enshrined in the\nfundamental rights of the Constitution. Therefore, if any\nprocedure is provided for deprivation of the right to\nemployment or right to the continued employment till the age\nof superannuation as is a source to right to livelihood, such a\nprocedure must be just, fair and reasonable. This Court in\n\nFertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.), Sindri v. Union of\nIndia\n(1981) 1 SCC 568, held that\nArticle 19(1)(g)\nconfers a\nbroad and general right which is available to all persons to do\nworks of any particular kind and of their choice. Therefore,\nwhenever there is arbitrariness in State action — whether it be\nof the legislature or of the executive or of an authority under\n\nArticle 12\n,\nArticles 14\nand\nspring into action and strikes\ndown such an action. The concept of reasonableness and non­\narbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional spectrum and\nis a golden thread which runs through the whole fabric of the\nConstitution. Therefore, the provision of the statute, the\nregulation or the rule which empowers an employer to\nterminate the services of an employee whose service is of an\nindefinite period till he attains the age of superannuation, by\nserving a notice or pay in lieu thereof must be conformable to\nthe mandates of\nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\nand\nof the\nConstitution. Otherwise, per se, it would be void.\nIn Moti Ram\nDeka case, AIR 1964 SC 600, Gajendragadkar, J. (as he then\nwas) after invalidating the Rules 149(3) and 148(3) under\n\nArticle 311(2)\nwhich are in pari materia with\nRegulation 9(b)\nof\nthe Regulations also considered their validity in the light of\n\nArticle 14\nand held thus: (SCR p. 731)\n\n“Therefore, we are satisfied that the challenge to the\nvalidity of the impugned Rules on the ground that they\ncontravene\nArticle 14\nmust also succeed.”\nThis was on the test of reasonable classification as the\nprinciple then was applied. Subba Rao, J. (as he then was) in a\nseparate but concurring judgment, apart from invalidating the\nrule under\nArticle 311(2)\nalso held that the rule infringed\n\nArticle 14\nas well, though there is no elaborate discussion in\nthat regard. But, Das Gupta, J. considered elaborately on this\naspect and held: (SCR p. 770)\n“Applying the principle laid down in the above case to the\npresent Rule, I find on the scrutiny of the Rule that it does not\nlay down any principle or policy for guiding the exercise of\ndiscretion by the authority who will terminate the service in\nthe matter of selection or classification. Arbitrary and\nuncontrolled power is left in the authority to select at its will\nany person against whom action will be taken. The rule thus\nenables the authority concerned to discriminate between two\nrailway servants to both of whom Rule 148(3) equally applied\nby taking action in one case and not taking it in the other. In\nthe absence of any guiding principle in the exercise of the\ndiscretion by the authority, the Rule has, therefore, to be\nstruck down as contravening the requirements of\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution.\"\n\n308. In Ramana case (1979) 3 SCC 489, it has been held\nthat: (SCC p. 504, para 10)\n“It is indeed unthinkable that in a democracy governed by\nthe rule of law, the executive government or any of its officers\nshould possess arbitrary power over the interests of the\nindividual.”\nThe procedure adopted should match with what justice\ndemands. History shows that it is always subtle and insidious\nencroachments made ostensibly for a good cause that\nimperceptibly but surely erode the foundations of liberty.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n(e). An employer cannot act in a manner that is in the negation of just,\n\nfair, and reasonable procedure. The Court held:\n\n“329. I am, therefore, inclined to hold that the courts,\nthough, have no power to amend the law by process of\ninterpretation but do have power to mend it so as to be in\nconformity with the intendment of the legislature.\nDoctrine of reading down is one of the principles of\ninterpretation of statute in that process. But when the\noffending language used by the legislature is clear,\nprecise, and unambiguous, violating the relevant\nprovisions in the Constitution, resort cannot be had to\nthe doctrine of reading down to blow life into the void law\nto save it from unconstitutionality or to confer\njurisdiction on the legislature. Similarly, it cannot be\ntaken aid of to emasculate the precise, explicit, clear and\nunambiguous language to confer arbitrary, unbridled and\nuncanalised power on an employer which is a negation to\njust, fair and reasonable procedure envisaged under\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution and to direct the\nauthorities to record reasons, (sic) unknown or\nunintended procedure, in the manner argued by the\nlearned counsel for the appellants.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n(f). In D.T.C. (supra) this Court also relied upon S.G. Jaisinghani v.\n\nUnion of India, AIR 1967 SC 1427 :\n\n“331. x x x “In this context it is important to\nemphasise that the absence of arbitrary power is the first\nessential of the rule of law upon which our whole\nconstitutional system is based. In a system governed by\nrule of law, discretion, when conferred upon executive\nauthorities, must be confined within defined limits. The\nrule of law from this point of view means that decisions\nshould be made by the application of known principles\nand rules and, in general, such decisions should be\npredictable, and the citizen should know where he is. If a\ndecision is taken without any principle or without any\nrule, it is unpredictable, and such a decision is the\nantithesis of a decision taken in accordance with the rule\nof law. (See Dicey: Law of the Constitution, 10th edn.,\nIntroduction cx.) ‘Law has reached its finest moments,'\nstated Douglas, J. in United States v. Wunderlich 342 US\n98, ‘when it has freed man from the unlimited discretion\nof some ruler …. Where discretion is absolute, man has\nalways suffered.’ It is in this sense that the rule of law\nmay be said to be the sworn enemy of caprice. Discretion,\nas Lord Mansfield stated it in classic terms in the case of\nJohn Wilkes (1770) 4 Burr 2528, ‘means sound discretion\nguided by law. It must be governed by rule, not by\nhumour: it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful’”.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n(g). The Court emphasised that the decision has to be predictable\n\nand it cannot be uncertain. The decision has to be taken by\n\napplication of known principles and rules. The exercise of power\n\ncannot be whimsical or capricious. This Court in\nD.T.C.\n(supra) held:\n\n“332. In an appropriate case where there is no sufficient\nevidence available to inflict by way of disciplinary\nmeasure, penalty of dismissal or removal from service\nand to meet such a situation, it is not as if that the\nauthority is lacking any power to make rules or\nregulations to give a notice of opportunity with the\ngrounds or the material on records on which it proposed\nto take action, consider the objections and record reasons\non the basis of which it had taken action and\ncommunicate the same. However, scanty the material\nmay be, it must form foundation. This minimal procedure\nshould be made part of the procedure lest the exercise of\nthe power is capable of abuse for good as well as for\nwhimsical or capricious purposes for reasons best known\nto the authority and not germane for the purpose for\nwhich the power was conferred. The action based on\nrecording reasoning without communication would\nalways be viewed with suspicion. Therefore, I hold that\nconferment of power with wide discretion without any\nguidelines, without any just, fair or reasonable procedure\nis constitutionally anathema to\nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n, 19(1)(g)\n\nand\nof the Constitution. Doctrine of reading down\ncannot be extended to such a situation.” (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n53. On the basis of aforesaid principles, it is apparent that once the\n\nCentral Board of Directors accepted the memorandum for making\n\npayment of pension, in case it was not accepting the proposal in the\n\nmemorandum, it ought to have said clearly that it was not ready to\n\naccept the proposals of the Government and the IBA and rejects the\n\nsame. Once it approved the proposals referred to in the memorandum,\nwhich were on the basis of IBA's letter and Government of India's\n\ndecision it was bound to implement it in true letter and spirit. By\n\naccepting the same, binding obligation was created upon the SBI to\n\nmake payment of pension on completion of 15 years of service. It\n\ncannot invalidate its own decision by relying on fact it failed to amend\n\nthe rule, whereas other Banks did it later on with retrospective effect.\n\nThey cannot invalidate otherwise valid decision by virtue of exclusive\n\nsuperior power to amend or not to amend the rule and act unfairly\n\nand make the entire contract unreasonable based on\n\nmisrepresentation. It was open to the Board of Directors to reject the\n\nproposal. Once it accepted the proposal to make payment of pension\n\non completion of 15 years of service as proposed in the memorandum,\n\nthough the scheme is tried to be interpreted by the SBI that pension\n\nwas to be admissible as provided in the rule that refers to\n\nproportionate pension as noted by this Court in\nO.P. Swarnakar &\n\nOrs.\n, (supra), and what was decided by Government of India/IBA, was\n\nnot taken away rather adopted by the Central Board of Directors. The\n\nscheme of contractual nature has to be read in the context and in the\n\nbackdrop of facts and what has been resolved by the Board of\n\nDirectors. There is no ambiguity with respect to the admissibility of\n\npension when the memorandum and the scheme are read together. In\n\ncase of ambiguity and even if two interpretations are possible in the\nbackdrop of facts of the case, one in favour of the employees has to be\n\nadopted and so­called clarification dated 11.1.2000 even if considered\n\nin the manner so as to deny the benefit of pension, has to be held to\n\nbe unenforceable, illegal and contrary to law.\n\n54. It is apparent from the eligibility clause of the VRS scheme that\n\neligibility is provided for the employees having 15 years of pensionable\n\nservice and they will be entitled for benefits as provided in the scheme.\n\nThe eligibility clause, when read with clauses providing the benefit,\n\ni.e., clauses 5 and 6 of the scheme, leaves no room for any doubt and\n\nmakes it clear that employees with 15 years of service were treated as\n\neligible to claim the benefit of the scheme floated by SBI. It was not\n\nthe provision in the VRS scheme that incumbents having completed\n\n20 years of service would be entitled for pensionary benefits. The\n\nscheme was carved out specially for attracting the employees by\n\nproviding pension and other benefits to eligible persons like ex gratia,\n\ngratuity, pension and leave encashment. Deprivation of pension would\n\nmake them ineligible for the benefits and would run repugnant to the\n\neligibility clause.\n\n55. The submission raised on behalf of the SBI that the draft scheme\n\nnowhere stipulated that 15 years’ service would be the eligibility or\n\nthat on completion of 15 years' service, the incumbent would be\neligible for pension, is factually incorrect. It is apparent from the\n\nmaterial circumstances, documents, and correspondence that the\n\ndecision was taken at all levels including the one by the Central Board\n\nof Directors of SBI, that the benefit of pension was to be given to the\n\nemployees on completion of 15 years of service. In that perspective,\n\nvagueness of scheme of SBI, if any, can be of no advantage as it is\n\nclear beyond the pale of doubt that pension was heart and soul of the\n\nscheme with ex gratia on completion of 15 years of service. It is due to\n\nthe reason that the benefit was to be accorded to the incumbents\n\nhaving completed 15 years of service,\nRegulation 28\nas applicable to\n\nother nationalised banks was proposed to be modified as reflected in\n\nthe letter of IBA dated 11.12.2000 and Government of India letter\n\ndated 5.9.2000. Later on, the regulation was amended in 2002 after\n\nthe scheme had already been implemented in right earnest. There was\n\nnot even an iota of doubt that VRS was to give benefits to all eligible\n\nemployees having completed 15 years of service. It was apparent from\n\nthe letter dated 29.12.2000 of SBI that the guidelines of IBA were\n\napproved by the Central Board of Directors in its meeting dated\n\n27.12.2000. Para 2 of the letter dated 29.12.2000 of SBI Deputy\n\nManaging Director­cum­SDO is extracted hereunder:\n\n\"2. Accordingly, the Central Board of Directors, in its\nmeeting held on 27.12.2000, has accorded approval for\nadopting and implementing the Voluntary Retirement\nScheme for the employees of the Bank, namely \"SBI\nVoluntary Retirement Scheme (SBIVRS).” The Scheme\n\"SBIVRS\" has been drawn up, keeping in view the\nguidelines issued by IBA. A copy of the Scheme is placed\nat Annexure ‘B’.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n56. As noted in\nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (supra), the case of bank\n\nitself was that it was a contractual scheme. The expression \"pension\"\n\nas per rules was only for the purpose of working out the proportionate\n\npension. It was clearly decided to open the scheme to employees who\n\nhave put in 15 years of service. It was not provided in the scheme that\n\nthe incumbent was required to render a pensionable service of 20\n\nyears as per the rules in order to acquire eligibility for the pension.\n\nThe submission made on behalf of SBI is too tenuous to be accepted.\n\nIt was observed in para 89 of\nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (supra) quoted\n\nabove that the employee must have proceeded on the basis of 15 years\n\nof service then they were entitled to pensionary benefits.\n\nThe Court further observed in\nO.P. Swarnakar & Ors.\n, (supra)\n\nthat the scheme is enforceable thus:\n\n“92. However, the case of the State Bank of India stands\nslightly on a different footing. Firstly, the State Bank of India\nhad not amended the Scheme. It, as noticed hereinbefore, even\npermitted withdrawal of the applications after (sic by) 15th\nFebruary. The Scheme floated by the State Bank of India\ncontained a clause (clause 7) laying down the mode and\nmanner in which the application for voluntary retirement shall\nbe considered. The relevant clause, as referred to hereinbefore,\ncreates an enforceable right. In the event the State Bank failed\nto adhere to its preferred policy, the same could have been\nspecifically enforced by a court of law. The same would,\ntherefore, amount to some consideration.\"\n57. While construing a contract, the language and surrounding\n\ncircumstances of the overall scheme, memorandum and letters are to\n\nbe read conjointly to find out whether any departure made by the\n\nBoard of Directors in its Resolution dated 27.12.2000 is of pivotal\n\nsignificance. In this case, the decision was taken by it of approval of\n\nthe IBA scheme as proposed. Its binding effect cannot be changed on\n\nthe basis what parties choose to say afterward, nor they can be\n\npermitted to wriggle out. The contract is required to be read as a\n\nwhole. It is apparent on a bare reading that optees will be eligible for\n\nproportionate pension under the Pension Regulations of the bank and\n\ntherefore, the bank bears the risk of lack of clarity, if any.\n\n58.\nIn\nBank of India & Anr. v. K. Mohandas & Ors.\n, (2009) 5 SCC 313\n\nwherein several other banks were also parties, the question arose as to\n\nthe nature of VRS, 2000. The Court noted the objectives, the\n\namendment made in\nRegulation 28\nin 2002, providing for 15 years of\n\nservice. The scheme was open in November­December, 2000 and in\n\nUnion Bank of India in January, 2001. The employees claimed that\n\nthose who completed 20 years of service, were entitled to the benefit of\n\nprovisions contained in\nRegulation 29(5)\nof Employees’ Pension\n\nRegulations, 1995 applicable to the said banks. They claimed having\n\ncompleted the qualifying service of 20 years under\nRegulation 29\n, were\n\nentitled for 5 years’ increase in the service tenure subject to the\nmaximum of 33 years which was not given to them on the ground that\n\nthe benefit of VRS was available to incumbents having completed 15\n\nyears of service as provided in amended\nRegulation 28\n, and\nRegulation\nwas not applicable. This Court held that the benefit of VRS was\n\navailable to the employees having completed 15 years of service, but\n\nthe additional benefit which was available on completion of 20 years of\n\nservice was also admissible as provided in\nRegulation 29(5)\n.\n\n59. While considering the aforesaid similar scheme of VRS, this\n\nCourt observed with respect to the construction of the contract on the\n\nbasis of the import of the words. The intention of the parties must be\n\nascertained from the language they have used and considered in the\n\nlight of surrounding circumstances, and the meaning cannot be\n\nchanged by a course of conduct adopted by the parties in acting under\n\nit. This Court in\nK. Mohandas\n(supra) held thus:\n\n“28. The true construction of a contract must depend upon\nthe import of the words used and not upon what the parties\nchoose to say afterwards. Nor does subsequent conduct of the\nparties in the performance of the contract affect the true effect\nof the clear and unambiguous words used in the contract. The\nintention of the parties must be ascertained from the language\nthey have used, considered in the light of the surrounding\ncircumstances and the object of the contract. The nature and\npurpose of the contract is an important guide in ascertaining\nthe intention of the parties.\n\n29. In Ottoman Bank of Nicosia v. Ohanes Chakarian, Lord\nWright made these weighty observations: (AIR p. 29)\n“… that if the contract is clear and unambiguous, its true\neffect cannot be changed merely by the course of conduct\nadopted by the parties in acting under it.”\n30.\nIn\nGanga Saran v. Firm Ram Charan Ram Gopal\nAIR 1952\nSC 9, a four­Judge Bench of this Court stated: (AIR p. 11, para\n\n6)\n“6. … Since the true construction of an agreement must\ndepend upon the import of the words used and not upon what\nthe parties choose to say afterwards, it is unnecessary to refer\nto what the parties have said about it.”\n\n31. It is also a well­recognised principle of construction of a\ncontract that it must be read as a whole in order to ascertain\nthe true meaning of its several clauses and the words of each\nclause should be interpreted so as to bring them into harmony\nwith the other provisions if that interpretation does no violence\nto the meaning of which they are naturally susceptible. (North\nEastern Railway Co. v. Lord Hastings, 1900 AC 260)”\n\n60. With respect to lack of clarity in the scheme, this Court in\nK.\n\nMohandas\n(supra) relied on maxim verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur\n\ncontra proferentem to hold that banks who were responsible for\n\nformulation of the terms in the contractual Scheme, bear the risk of\n\nlack of clarity. Thus, the benefit has to be given to the employees by\n\nmaking interpretation against the banks. The Court held :\n\n“32. The fundamental position is that it is the banks who were\nresponsible for formulation of the terms in the contractual\nScheme that the optees of voluntary retirement under that\nScheme will be eligible to pension under the Pension\nRegulations, 1995, and, therefore, they bear the risk of lack of\nclarity, if any. It is a well­known principle of construction of a\ncontract that if the terms applied by one party are unclear, an\ninterpretation against that party is preferred (verba chartarum\nfortius accipiuntur contra proferentem).\n\n33. What was, in respect of pension, the intention of the banks\nat the time of bringing out VRS 2000? Was it not made\nexpressly clear therein that the employees seeking voluntary\nretirement will be eligible for pension as per the Pension\nRegulations? If the intention was not to give pension as\nprovided in\nRegulation 29\nand particularly sub­regulation (5)\nthereof, they could have said so in the Scheme itself. After all,\nmuch thought had gone into the formulation of VRS 2000, and\nit came to be framed after great deliberations. The only\nprovision that could have been in mind while providing for\npension as per the Pension Regulations was\nRegulation 29\n.\n\nObviously, the employees, too, had the benefit of\nRegulation\n29(5)\nin mind when they offered for voluntary retirement as\nadmittedly\nRegulation 28\n, as was existing at that time, was not\napplicable at all. None of Regulations 30 to 34 was attracted.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n61.\nIn\nK. Mohandas\n(supra) the Court considered the argument that\n\nRegulation 28\nwould be applicable only for providing 15 years of\n\neligibility as provided by way of amendment of Regulation of 1995, and\n\nheld that as the banks are “State” within the meaning of\nArticle 12\n, it\n\nwould be an arbitrary action on their part to deny the benefit of\n\nsection 29(5)\n, and there has to be harmonious construction to the\n\nscheme and Pension Regulations, thus:\n\n“35. We are afraid; it would be unreasonable if amended\n\nRegulation 28\nis made applicable, which had not seen the light\nof the day and which was not the intention of the banks when\nthe Scheme was framed. The banks in the present batch of\nappeals are public sector banks and are \"State\" within the\nmeaning of\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution and their action even\nin contractual matters has to be reasonable, lest, as observed\nin O.P. Swarnakar (2003) 2 SCC 721, it must attract the wrath\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n36. Any interpretation of the terms of VRS 2000, although\ncontractual in nature, must meet the test of fairness. It has to\nbe construed in a manner that avoids arbitrariness and\nunreasonableness on the part of the public sector banks who\nbrought out VRS 2000 with an objective of rightsizing their\nmanpower. The banks decided to shed surplus manpower. By\nformulation of the special scheme (VRS 2000), the banks\nintended to achieve their objective of rationalising their force\nas they were overstaffed. The special Scheme was, thus,\noriented to lure the employees to go in for voluntary\nretirement. In this background, the consideration that was to\npass between the parties assumes significance and a\nharmonious construction to the Scheme, and the Pension\nRegulations, therefore, has to be given.\n37. The amendment to\nRegulation 28\ncan, at best, be said to\nhave been intended to cover the employees with 15 years of\nservice or more but less than 20 years of service. This\nintention is reflected from the communication dated 5­9­2000\nsent by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance,\nDepartment of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) to the\nPersonnel Advisor, Indian Banks’ Association.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIt opined that the amendment to\nRegulation 28\nof 1995\n\nRegulation intended to cover 15 years of service, i.e., employees with\n\n15 years of service who have not completed 20 years of service. A\n\nsimilar action to amend the Rule was required to be taken by the SBI,\n\nbut it failed to take it after having floated a similar scheme. It kept it\n\nuncertain what would be the position of the rule as on the appointed\n\ndate, i.e., 31.3.2001. Be that as it may. But it was crystal clear that\n\nthe incumbent with 15 years of service was eligible for the benefit as\n\nprovided in the scheme itself. The benefit clause has to be read with\n\nthe eligibility criteria. Once VRS was formulated and adopted by the\n\nSBI in toto, it constituted a complete contractual package in itself.\n\n62. As urged on behalf of SBI if\nsection 23\nof the Contract Act is\n\napplied, then how it is helpful to the bank, is not understandable. In\n\ncase it is held that the very scheme was opposed to the law/rules, the\n\nentire scheme would fall down. Once it adopted the scheme, invited\n\napplications and the employees acted upon it and retired on the basis\n\nof the scheme, they cannot be left in lurch. In case its submission is\n\naccepted, the Scheme becomes violative of Section 23 of Contact Act,\nthe bank would have to suffer the consequences of striking down of\n\nthe very scheme and would be required to reinstate the employees and\n\nto pay them the salary and other benefits. However, SBI accepted the\n\nscheme, it was incumbent upon it to bring the rules in consonance\n\nwith the similar VRS scheme as was done by other banks. The SBI\n\naccepted the scheme on 27.12.2000 without any ifs and buts. Thus,\n\nthe anomaly was the outcome of the bank's inaction to propose and\n\nmake amendment of rules. In such a scenario, the action of SBI is\n\nviolative of\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nof the Constitution. The situation\n\ncreated by itself is not going to benefit the bank to lend support to\n\narbitrary action. The bank was bound to extend the benefits by\n\namending the rules, if necessary, to salvage the situation for itself.\n\nBreach of law has been committed by the SBI itself, its action is\n\narbitrary and it cannot be permitted to take advantage of its own\n\nwrong.\n\n63. The pension cannot be dealt with arbitrarily and cannot be\n\ndenied in an unfair manner. The concept of pension was considered\n\nin\nD.S. Nakara & Ors. v. Union of India\n, (1983) 1 SCC 305. The right to\n\na pension can be enforced through the court, it observed :\n\n“20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a\ngratuitous payment depending upon the sweet will or grace of\nthe employer not claimable as a right and, therefore, no right\nto pension can be enforced through Court has been swept\nunder the carpet by the decision of the Constitution Bench in\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n(1971) 2 SCC 330\nwherein this Court authoritatively ruled that pension is a right\nand the payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of\nthe Government but is governed by the rules and a\ngovernment servant coming within those rules is entitled to\nclaim pension. It was further held that the grant of pension\ndoes not depend upon anyone’s discretion. It is only for the\npurpose of quantifying the amount having regard to service\nand other allied matters that it may be necessary for the\nauthority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive\npension flows to the officer not because of any such order but\nby virtue of the rules.\n\nThis view was reaffirmed in\nState of\nPunjab v. Iqbal Singh\n, (1976) 2 SCC 1.\n\n22. In the course of transformation of society from feudal to\nwelfare and as socialistic thinking acquired respectability.\n\nState obligation to provide security in old age, an escape from\nundeserved want was recognised and as a first step pension\nwas treated not only as a reward for past service but with a\nview to helping the employee to avoid destitution in old age.\nThe quid pro quo was that when the employee was physically\nand mentally alert, he rendered unto master the best,\nexpecting him to look after him in the fall of life. A retirement\nsystem, therefore, exists solely for the purpose of providing\nbenefits. In most of the plans of retirement benefits, everyone\nwho qualifies for normal retirement receives the same amount\n(see Retirement Systems for Public Employees by Bleakney, p.\n\n33).”\n\nThis Court observed that the principal aim of the socialist State\n\nas envisaged in the Preamble is to eliminate inequality. The basic\n\nframework of socialism is to provide security in the fall of life to the\n\nworking people and especially provides security from the cradle to the\n\ngrave when employees have rendered service in heydays of life, they\n\ncannot be destituted in old age, by taking action in an arbitrary\n\nmanner and for omission to complete obligation assured one. Though\n\nthere cannot be estoppel against the law but when a bank had the\n\npower to amend it, it cannot take shelter of its own inaction and SBI\nought to have followed the pursuit of other banks and was required to\n\nact in a similar fair manner having accepted the scheme.\n\n64. Resultantly, we are of the opinion that the employees who\n\ncompleted 15 years of service or more as on cut­off date were entitled\n\nto proportionate pension under SBI VRS to be computed as per SBI\n\nPension Fund Rules. Let the benefits be extended to all such similar\n\nemployees retired under VRS on completion of 15 years of service\n\nwithout requiring them to rush to the court. However, considering the\n\nfacts and circumstances, it would not be appropriate to burden the\n\nbank with interest. Let order be complied with and arrears be paid\n\nwithin three months, failing which amount to carry interest at the rate\n\nof 6 per cent per annum from the date of this order. The appeals are\n\naccordingly disposed of. No costs.\n\n…………………………J.\n(Arun Mishra)\n\n………………….……..J.\n(M.R. Shah)\n\nNew Delhi; …….…………………..J.\nMarch 2, 2020. (B.R. Gavai)",
