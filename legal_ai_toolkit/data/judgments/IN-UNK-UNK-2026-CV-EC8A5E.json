Yes.\nFor the Petitioners: Mr. M.L. Sharma and Ms. Meghna Kashava,\n Advocates.\nFor the respondents: Mr. Anup Rattan, Advocate General with Mr.\n Rajan Kahol, Mr. Vishal Panwar and Mr. B.C.\n Verma, Additional Advocates General with Mr.\n Ravi Chauhan and Mr. Arsh Rattan, Deputy\n Advocate General, for the State.\n Mr. Vishal Singh Thakur, Advocate, for the\n private respondents in all the petitions.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nSandeep Sharma, J. (Oral)\n\n Since common questions of facts and law are involved in\n\nthe above captioned cases and the petitioner, who is common in all the\n\ncases is aggrieved of the order dated 16.1.2024, passed by the Deputy\n\nLabour Commissioner-cum-Appellate Authority (Annexure P-9)\n\nunder the \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n ( in short \"the Act\"), this\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n -5-\n\nCourt after having clubbed all the cases, heard the same together and\n\nare now being disposed of vide common judgment.\n\n2. For having bird's eye view, facts which may be relevant for\n\nadjudication of the case at hand, are that private respondents, in all\n\nthe cases, prior to their services being taken over by the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh in the department of Education Himachal Pradesh,\n\nwere working with the Petitioner-School i.e. SD Senior Secondary\n\nSchool, Gunj Bazaar, Shimla, which though was being managed by\n\nSanatan Dharam Prabhandan Committee, Gunj Bazaar, Shimla, but\n\nw.e.f. 1987 to 1993 had been getting lump-sum Grant-in-Aid from\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh. Though w.e.f. 1987 to 1993, Grant-in-Aid\n\nwas paid by the State Government in lump sum, but thereafter,\n\npursuant to judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case titled\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh v. HP State Recognized and Aided\n\nSchools Managing Committees and Ors.\n, 1995 (4) SCC 507,\n\npetitioner-school came to be granted 95% Grant-in-Aid, as a result\n\nthereof, staff working in the school, at the relevant time, started\n\ngetting salary at par with the salary being received by their\n\ncounterparts in the various educational institutions of the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh. Though at one point of time, school management\n\nrefused to accept the Grant-in-Aid from the State Government and in\n\nthat regard, litigation was contested by the school management upto\n\nHon'ble Apex Court, whereby Hon'ble Apex Court directed the State\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n -6-\n\nGovernment to make the payment for remaining period i.e. from 1993\n\nto 1997 without interest and cost. In the year 2012, services of the\n\nemployees of 95% Grant-in-Aid schools were decided to be taken over\n\nby the State Government (without the assets and liabilities), by placing\n\nthem lowest in the promotion list, as proposed by the management of\n\npetitioner-school, but their pay was protected by the respondent-State\n\nas per scheme formulated for taking over the services of the privately\n\nmanaged government aided school. Private respondents, who at one\n\npoint of time, were the employees of the petitioner-school had become\n\nemployees of State of Himachal Pradesh and after taking over their\n\nservices in the year 2012 in the State of Himachal Pradesh, they\n\ncontinued to work in the different schools controlled by the\n\nDepartment of Education of the Himachal Pradesh in various\n\ncapacities.\n\n3. On 08.10.2012, first application for payment of gratuity\n\nwas collectively moved by the employees of petitioner-school alongwith\n\nseveral other issues, which was though accepted by the management\n\nof petitioner-school, but even then gratuity was not paid. After\n\nissuance of notices by the private respondents, private respondents\n\nstaked their claim for gratuity for the period they had rendered\n\nservices with the petitioner-school prior to their services being taken\n\nover by the Government of Himachal Pradesh in 2012. Since, no heed\n\nwas paid to the notices issued by the private respondents, they were\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n -7-\n\ncompelled to approach Labour Officer-cum-Controlling Authority, who\n\nafter having afforded due opportunity of hearing to both the parties,\n\npassed order dated 25.7.2022 (Annexure P-5), thereby directing the\n\npetitioner herein to make the payment of gratuity to the private\n\nrespondents within one month from the receipt of the notice under\n\nintimation to his office.\n\n4. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with aforesaid order,\n\npetitioner herein filed an appeal before the appellate authority i.e.\n\nLabour Officer-cum-Controlling Authority, but since petitioner-School\n\nfailed to deposit the amount ordered to be deposited by the Controlling\n\nAuthority as per \nSection 7\n Sub-Clause 7 of the Act, authority refused\n\nto entertain the appeal.\n\n5. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with aforesaid order\n\npassed by the appellate authority, petitioner herein approached this\n\nCourt by way of number of writ petitions. This Court vide order dated\n\n22.8.2023, passed in CWP No. 4754 of 2023 and other connected\n\nmatters, allowed the petition and set-aside the order dated 20.4.2023,\n\npassed by the Appellate Authority and remanded the case back to the\n\naforesaid authority to decide the same afresh, subject to furnishing\n\nbank guarantee equivalent to the amount determined by the\n\nControlling Authority alongwith a certificate in terms of Second Proviso\n\nto \nSection 7\n Sub-Clause 7 of the Act, which provides that no appeal by\n\nan employer shall be admitted unless at the time of preferring the\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n -8-\n\nappeal, the appellant either produces a certificate of the controlling\n\nauthority to the effect that the appellant has deposited with him an\n\namount equal to the amount of gratuity required to be deposited\n\nunder \nSection 4\n of or deposit with the appellate authority such\n\namount.\n\n6. Since bank guarantee in terms of the aforesaid order\n\npassed by this Court was furnished by the petitioner before the\n\nappellate authority, appellate authority proceeded to decide the\n\nappeals having been filed by the petitioner on its own merits and\n\nultimately, vide order dated 16.1.2024 (Annexure P-9), afore authority\n\nproceeded to dismiss the appeals. In the aforesaid, background,\n\npetitioner-School has approached this Court in the instant\n\nproceedings, praying therein to set-aside the afore order.\n\n7. Precisely, the grouse of the petitioner-school, as has been\n\nhighlighted in the petition and further canvassed by Mr. M.L. Sharma,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner is that learned appellate court below\n\nwhile passing impugned order failed to consider plea of limitation\n\nraised by the petitioner as well as liability of State Government\n\ntowards payment of gratuity to the extent of 95% being government\n\naided school to that extent. Besides above, petitioner has also raised\n\nground that appellate court below also erred in ordering payment of\n\ngratuity from the date of joining, whereas order of payment of gratuity\n\nought to have been made applicable from 3.4.1997 prospectively,\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n -9-\n\nwhen an amendment was introduced in Parliament, thereby bringing\n\nteachers in the ambit of \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n under the definition\n\nan of 'employee'.\n\n8. Mr. M.L. Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner-\n\nSchool, while elaborating submissions made by him with regard to\n\nlimitation strenuously argued that Payment of Gratuity HP Rules 1971\n\n(Annexure P11) (herein after referred to as \"the Rules\") are applicable\n\nto the claim petitions filed by the petitioner. He submitted that as per\n\naforesaid Rules, which have a statutory force, a person who is eligible\n\nfor payment of gratuity under this Act or any person authorized, in\n\nwriting, to act on his behalf shall send a written application to the\n\nemployer, within such time and in such form, as may be prescribed,\n\nfor payment of such gratuity. He submitted that since 7(1) of Rules\n\nprovides that an employee, who is eligible for payment of gratuity\n\nunder the Act shall apply, ordinarily within thirty days from the date\n\nhe/she is entitled for gratuity and in the case at hand, no application\n\nwithin the afore period of thirty days was submitted by the any of the\n\nprivate respondents, claim put forth by the private respondents ought\n\nto have been rejected on the ground of limitation itself. He further\n\nsubmitted that bare perusal of claim petitions filed at the behest of\n\nprivate respondents nowhere suggests that cogent and convincing\n\nreason was ever adduced qua the inordinate delay in filing the claim\n\npetitions and as such, impugned order passed by the appellate\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 10 -\n\nauthority, which ultimately upheld the order of controlling authority,\n\ndeserves to be quashed and set-aside on this sole ground only.\n\n9. Mr. Sharma, while inviting attention to Rule 7 (5), which\n\nprovides that no claim for gratuity under the Act shall be invalid\n\nmerely because the claimant failed to present his application within a\n\nspecified period, submitted that even in that eventuality an application\n\npraying therein for condonation of delay is required to be filed and in\n\ncase, no cogent and convincing reason is assigned, enabling the court\n\nto consider such application, delay, if any, in furnishing claim petition\n\ncannot be condoned. He further submitted that though Rule 7 (1)\n\nspecifically provides for limitation of thirty days, but even if it is\n\npresumed that in terms of Rule 7 (5), claimant can file claim petition\n\nafter expiry of thirty days, even then, same is required to be filed\n\nwithin a reasonable time, but definitely not beyond the period of three\n\nyears as prescribed under \nArticle 137\n of the \nLimitation Act\n. In support\n\nof aforesaid contention, Mr. Sharma \nplaced reliance upon\n judgments\n\ni.e. 1. \nSultan Begum v. Prem Chand Jain\n (1997) 1 SCC 373, 2. Anwar\n\nHasan Khanv. Mohammed Shafi (2001) 8 SCC 540, 3.\n \nFertilizer\n\nCorporation of India Limited v. Cormondal Sacks\n 2024 STPL 5156 (SC),\n\n4. Addl. \nSpl. Land Acquisition Officer, Bangalore v. Thakoredas, Major\n\n& Ors\n (1997) 11 SCC 412 and ; 5.\n \nState of Karnatka v. Laxman\n (2005) 8\n\nSCC 709.\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 11 -\n\n10. While elaborating his submissions qua the second point\n\nraised by him with regard to liability of State Government to gratuity,\n\nMr. Sharma, further argued that though there is no dispute that\n\npetitioner-School was a State Government aided school getting 95%\n\naid to meet the salary burden of the teachers and other employees of\n\nthe school, but bare perusal of \nSection 2 (f) (1)\n, which defines\n\nemployer, uses the specific expression \"belonging to or under the\n\ncontrol of\", meaning thereby, employees of Government aided schools\n\nwere to be provided all benefits including the gratuity by the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh not by School, who had been otherwise disbursing\n\n95% Grant-in-Aid as salary to its employees. \nIn support of his\n\naforesaid submissions, Mr. Sharma\n, \nplaced reliance upon\n judgment\n\npassed by the Chhattisgarh High Court in \nAmbika Mission Boys\n\nMiddle School, Ambikapur v. State of Chhattisgarh\n (2020) 2 SLJ\n\n499, and judgments passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nBirla\n\nInstitute of Technology v. State of Jharkhand and Ors.\n (\n2019) 4\n\nSCC 513 and Regional Provident Fund Commissioner v. Sanatan\n\nDharma Girls Secondary School\n (2007) 1 SCC 268.\n\n11. Lastly, Mr. Sharma, argued that since payment of gratuity\n\nact was made applicable to educational institution w.e.f. 3.4.1997,\n\nthere was no occasion for the controlling authority to order payment of\n\ngratuity from the date of their joining, rather private respondents, if\n\nany, could have been held entitled for payment of gratuity w.e.f.\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 12 -\n\n3.4.1997 when \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n was made applicable to the\n\nteachers. \nIn support of his aforesaid arguments, he \nplaced reliance\n\nupon\n judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nBirla Institute of\n\nTechnology v. State of Jharkhand and Ors.\n (2019) 4 SCC 513.\n\n12. While refuting the aforesaid submissions made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Arsh Rattan, learned Deputy\n\nAdvocate General appearing for the State and Mr. Vishal Thakur,\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the private respondents in all the\n\npetitions, vehemently argued that there is no limitation in approaching\n\nthe controlling authority for claiming payment of gratuity. While\n\nreferring to \nSection 7 (2)\n of the Act, above named counsel argued that\n\nemployer is obliged to determine the amount of gratuity and give\n\nnotice in writing to a person to whom the gratuity is payable. If it is\n\nso, there is otherwise no requirement, if any, for the private\n\nrespondents to lodge a complaint, rather same should have been itself\n\nallowed by the employer in terms of \nSection 7(2)\n of the Act. They also\n\nsubmitted that otherwise also, \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n 1972, being a\n\nbeneficial legislation has to be liberally interpreted. To substantiate\n\ntheir aforesaid submissions, learned counsel for the respondents\n,\n\nplaced reliance upon\n judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nH. Gangahanume Gowda v. Karnataka Agro Industries Corporation\n\nLimited\n 2003 3 SCC 40 (para-7), wherein it came to be ruled that\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 13 -\n\npayment of gratuity is the duty of the employer and as such, claim in\n\nthat regard cannot be defeated on the ground of limitation.\n\n13. Learned counsel representing the respondents further\n\nargued that once it is not in dispute that at the time of their discharge\n\nfrom the private school on account of taking over their services by the\n\ngovernment they were entitled to payment of gratuity under the Act\n\ncoupled with the fact that no assets and liabilities of the private school\n\nwere transferred, petitioner is estopped from claiming that liability, if\n\nany, to pay gratuity under the afore Act is of State Government, rather\n\nliability to pay gratuity for the period private respondents had served\n\nwith the institution squarely lies with the petitioner. They further\n\nargued that till the time of taking over the services of private\n\nrespondents by the government, their principal employer was\n\npetitioner herein, who had issued appointment letters in their favour\n\nand after receipt of Grant-in-Aid from the school petitioner-school had\n\nbeen paying salaries.\n\n14. While responding to the another submission raised by the\n\nlearned counsel representing petitioner with regard to date from which\n\ngratuity scheme became applicable to the claimants, learned counsel\n\nfor the respondents invited attention of this Court to judgment passed\n\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nBirla Institute of Technology v. State\n\nof Jharkhand and Ors.\n (2019) 4 SCC 513, wherein retrospective\n\napplications for amendment Act 2009, came to be upheld. While\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 14 -\n\ninviting attention of this Court to afore judgment, learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent argued that Hon'ble Apex Court having taken note of\n\nthe amendment, which came into force w.e.f. 3.4.1997, ruled that once\n\ncategory of teachers also came to be included under the definition of\n\nemployee for the purpose of payment under the \nPayment of Gratuity\n\nAct\n, rightful claim of such persons, who, before amendment, had been\n\nadmittedly working as a teacher, cannot be defeated on the ground\n\nthat since amendment came in force in 2009, it cannot be made\n\napplicable retrospectively, rather would only apply to the cases of the\n\nteachers, who were appointed after 2009.\n\n15. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\n\nthe material available on record.\n\n16. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\n\nmaterial available on record, this court finds that there is no dispute\n\nthat private respondents prior to taking over their services by the State\n\nhad been working with the petitioner-school in various capacities. It is\n\nalso not in dispute that at the time of taking over of services of the\n\nrespondents by the State, 95% of the Grant-in-Aid was being received\n\nby the management of the petitioner school. It is also not in dispute\n\nthat in the year 2012, services of the private respondents herein were\n\ntaken over by the State Government and thereafter, management of\n\nthe petitioner-school, despite there being offer made by the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh, chose not to be taken over, rather decided to run\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 15 -\n\nitself by using its own resources. It is also not in dispute that at the\n\ntime of taking over of the services of private respondents by the\n\nrespondent-State, assets and liabilities of the petitioner-school were\n\nnever taken over by the respondent-State, rather same remained with\n\nthe school management, who is still running the institution, but of\n\ntheir resources, not with the government aid.\n\n17. Precisely, the question which needs to be decided in the\n\ninstant proceedings is \"whether petitioner-school is under obligation to\n\npay gratuity to the private respondents qua the period they had\n\nrendered their services with the petitioner-school prior to their services\n\nbeing taken over by the State Government or not.\"?\n\n18. Though it came to be vehemently argued by learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner that since services of the private respondents\n\nwere taken over by the State of Himachal Pradesh w.e.f. 2012, liability,\n\nif any, to pay gratuity squarely lies with the State of Himachal\n\nPradesh, especially when it is not in dispute that school was being run\n\nwith 95% aid provided by the State of Himachal Pradesh, however this\n\nCourt is not persuaded to agree with aforesaid submissions made by\n\nthe petitioners for the reason that though till the year 2012, petitioner-\n\nschool was being provided 95% Grant-in-Aid by the State of Himachal\n\nPradesh, but not for payment of gratuity, rather such amount was\n\nbeing provided for giving salary to the employees of the school at par\n\nwith the salaries received by the teachers in the government schools.\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 16 -\n\n19. Mr. Sharma, further argued that by providing 95% Grant-\n\nin-Aid, State had virtually become employer within the meaning of 2\n\n(f) of the Act, which reads as under:\n\n 2(f) \"employer\" means, in relation to any establishment, factory, mine,\n oilfield, plantation, port, railway company or shop -\n\n (i) belonging to, or under the control of, the Central Government or a\n State Government, a person or authority appointed by the appropriate\n Government for the supervision and control of employees, or where no\n person or authority has been so appointed, the head of the Ministry or\n the Department concerned,\n\n (ii) belonging to, or under the control of, any local authority, the\n person appointed by such authority for the supervision and control of\n employees or where no person has been so appointed, the chief\n executive office of the local authority,\n\n (iii) in any other case, the person, who, or the authority which, has the\n ultimate control over the affairs of the establishment, factory, mine,\n oilfield, plantation, port, railway company or shop, and where the said\n affairs are entrusted to any other person, whether called a manager,\n managing director or by any other name, such person;\"\n\n20. As per aforesaid provision of law, employer, in relation to\n\nany establishment, would mean a person, who has control over the\n\nestablishment. Mr. M.L. Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nattempted to argue that since by providing 95% aid, control of the\n\nschool was actually with the State, petitioner school cannot be held\n\nliable to pay gratuity, however, such plea of Mr. Sharma, deserves to\n\nbe rejected outrightly, being totally fallacious. No doubt, in the case at\n\nhand, 95% aid was being provided by the respondent-State, but there\n\nis nothing to suggest that with the grant of 95% aid, respondent-State\n\nhad become owner of the school or same was being managed by the\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 17 -\n\nrespondent-State, rather there is ample material available on record\n\nsuggestive of the fact that till the year 2012, services of the private\n\nrespondents were being controlled by the management of the school\n\nand not by the respondent-State. Had by virtue of providing 95% aid,\n\nrespondent State's, intention was to take over the school, parties\n\nwould have not contested up to Hon'ble Apex Court, rather in the year\n\n2012, number of schools, who were being provided 95% Grant-in-Aid,\n\nwere taken over by the State of Himachal Pradesh subject to certain\n\nterms and conditions. Though opportunity, in the case at hand, was\n\nalso provided to the petitioner-school herein to give complete control of\n\nthe school to the respondent-State, but as has been observed herein\n\nabove, management of the petitioner-school chose to remain\n\nindependent, but services of the some of the employees including the\n\nprivate respondents were taken over by the respondent-State, in terms\n\nof policy framed by the State of Himachal Pradesh for taking over the\n\nservices of privately management government aided schools. It is also\n\nnot in dispute that assets and liabilities were never taken over by the\n\nState at the time of taking over the services of the private respondents,\n\nrather fact is that petitioner-School is being run privately by the\n\nmanagement of the school as of today. Had management of the\n\npetitioner-school agreed to transfer the school in totality, they would\n\nhave been right in contending that since entire assets and liabilities\n\nstand transferred to the State of Himachal Pradesh, liability, if any, to\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 18 -\n\nmake the payment, if any, is of the State of Himachal Pradesh, but\n\nsince in the case at hand, only services of few of the employees\n\nincluding the private respondents were taken over and assets and\n\nliabilities remained with the school, aforesaid submission made by the\n\nMr. Sharma with regard to control of the respondent-State, deserves\n\noutright rejection.\n\n21. At this stage, it would be apt to take note of judgments\n\npressed into service by Mr. M. L. Sharma, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner in support of his afore contentions. While referring to\n\njudgment passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh in \nAmbika\n\nMission Boys Middle School, Ambikapur v. State of Chhattisgarh\n\n(supra), Mr. M.L. Sharma, vehemently argued that State would be\n\nemployer within the definition of \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1970\n, of the\n\nemployees of the government aided educational institutions. If it is so,\n\nliability, if any, to pay gratuity, as has been claimed by the private\n\nrespondents in the case at hand, is entirely of the State of Himachal\n\nPradesh, however having perused aforesaid judgments, this Court\n\nfinds no application of the same in the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase. In the afore case, plea came to be raised by the petitioner-school\n\nthat since it was being provided 100% aid by the State of Himachal\n\nPradesh, State cannot be permitted to disown the teachers, who were\n\nreceiving the salary under the grant-in-aid on the pretext that school\n\nwas not under the control of the State. High Court of Chhattisgarh\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 19 -\n\nhaving taken note of the fact that petitioner-school was being provided\n\n100% aid, proceeded to rule that State would be employer under the\n\ndefinition of the Act of the employees of aided educational institutions.\n\nMost importantly, in the aforesaid case, an attempt was made to carve\n\nout a distinction between two classes of teachers/employees for\n\npayment of gratuity before or after cutoff date i.e. 1.4.2013 received by\n\nthe institution. While holding afore classification made by the State of\n\nChhattisgarh, High Court of Chhattisgarh ruled that once both the\n\ncategories are considered to be employee for the purpose of gratuity\n\nunder the Act, there cannot be unjustified classification so as to deny\n\nbenefit of gratuity to one set of employees. In the instant case, it is not\n\nin dispute that petitioner school never received 100% aid, rather it was\n\nin receipt of 95% of Grant-in-Aid and control of the management always\n\nremained with the petitioner-school. It is also not in dispute that services\n\nof private respondents from one particular date were taken over by the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh, but petitioner school, despite there being offer\n\nmade by the State of Himachal Pradesh, decided to be managed/run by\n\nthe management of the petitioner school. Moreover, State of Himachal\n\nPradesh, at no point of time, took responsibility of paying gratuity under\n\nthe Act to the employees of government aided school, rather liability,\n\nif any, came to be taken by the respondent-State qua those\n\nemployees, whose services were taken over by the State of Himachal\n\nPradesh that too from the date their services were taken over. Since\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 20 -\n\nissue, which ultimately came to be decided by the High Court of\n\nChhattisgarh was with regard to unreasonable classification made by\n\nthe State of Chhattisgarh between two classes of teacher/employees\n\nfor payment of gratuity before or after the cutoff date and \nin that\n\ncase\n, responsibility was taken by the State of Chhattisgarh to provide\n\nbenefit of gratuity under the Act to employees of Schools, who were in\n\nreceipt of 100% Grant-in-aid, no parity, if any, can be claimed by the\n\npetitioner-school placing reliance upon the aforesaid judgment, which\n\nis not applicable in the present facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n22. Similarly, this Court finds no application of judgment\n\npassed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case \nBirla Institute of\n\nTechnology v. State of Jharkhand and Ors\n (\n2019) 4 SC 513 and\n\nRegional Provident Fund Commissioner v. Sanatan Dharam Girls\n\nSecondary School and Ors.\n (2007) 1 SCC 268, wherein Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt while interpreting the expressions \"under control of\" and\n\n\"belonging to\" held that State cannot disown teacher, who are\n\nreceiving the salaries under the Act on the ground that that they\n\nwere not under the control of the State.\n\n23. If the aforesaid judgment is read in entirety, Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt while taking note of \nSection 2 (f) (i)\n of the Act, wherein\n\n\"employer\" has been defined, proceeded to elaborate the terms \"under\n\ncontrol of\" and \"belonging to\", but nowhere ruled that State would be\n\nunder obligation to pay gratuity to the employees/teachers of school,\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 21 -\n\nwho though are in receipt of 95% grant-in-aid, but yet are controlled\n\nand managed by private management, rather in the aforesaid\n\njudgments, Hon'ble Apex Court ruled that if the schools are under the\n\ncontrol of the government, it can otherwise not escape the liability to\n\npay gratuity in terms of Act being the Central Legislation, however, in\n\nthe case at hand, as has been discussed herein above, private\n\nrespondents, prior to taking over their services by the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh though received salary from petitioner-school out of\n\n95% grant-in-aid provided by the State, but fact remains that for all\n\nintents and purposes, they continued to be employees of the\n\npetitioner institution. Private respondents became employees of State\n\nof Himachal Pradesh from the date their services were taken over by\n\nthe State of Himachal Pradesh that too subject to certain terms and\n\nconditions. In afore cases decided by the High Court of Chhattisgarh\n\nand Jharkhand, schools were being provided 100% aid by the State of\n\nChhattisgarh and Jharkhand, as a result of thereof, complete control\n\nof the institution concerned was with the State of Himachal Pradesh,\n\nwhereas in the case at hand, situation is totally converse. Petitioner-\n\ninstitution like many other private institutions though kept on\n\nreceiving 95% grant-in-aid, but for a limited purpose i.e. payment of\n\nsalary, at no point of time, gave control of the administration and\n\nother assets to the State of Himachal Pradesh. Though at one point of\n\ntime, effort was made by the State Government to take over the school,\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 22 -\n\ncomplete in all respects, but such offer was rejected and only services\n\nof State employees, who had opted for taking over their services by the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh were permitted to be taken over by the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh, as a result thereof, private respondents\n\nceased to be employees of petitioner institution from the date their\n\nservices were taken over by the State of Himachal Pradesh. Most\n\nimportantly, in the case at hand, petitioner school is being run as of\n\ntoday, by the private management out of its own resources.\n\nSubmission made by Mr. M.L. Sharma, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, with regard to liability of the State of Himachal Pradesh to\n\npay gratuity to the private respondents on account of its having\n\nprovided 95% grant-in-aid, may not only open Pandora box, rather in\n\nthat eventuality, respondent-State would be liable to pay gratuity to all\n\nsuch employees, who despite there being offer made by the State,\n\nchose to work under the private institution fully knowing the\n\nconsequences of their having decided to continue with the private\n\nmanagement.\n\n24. Similarly, this Court having perused \nSection 7\n of the Act\n\nin its entirety finds no force in the submission of Mr. Sharma, learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner that claim put forth by the private\n\nrespondents ought to have been rejected by the controlling authority\n\nbeing barred by limitation. It would be apt to take note of \nSection 7 (1)\n\nand \n7(2)\n, which read as under:\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 23 -\n\n \"7(1) A person who is eligible for payment of gratuity under this Act or\n any person authorised, in writing, to act on his behalf shall send a\n written application to the employer, within such time and in such\n form, as may be prescribed, for payment of such gratuity.\n 7(2) As soon as gratuity becomes payable, the employer shall, whether\n an application referred to in sub-section (1) has been made or not,\n determine the amount of gratuity and give notice in writing to the\n person to whom the gratuity is payable and also to the controlling\n authority specifying the amount gratuity so determined.\"\n\n25. If \nSection 7(1)\n is read in its entirety, it clearly suggests\n\nthat any person, who is eligible for payment of gratuity under the Act,\n\nshall send a written application for payment of gratuity to the\n\nemployer, within the time as specified in the Rules, himself or through\n\nan authorized agent. \nSection 7 (2)\n as reproduced herein above, makes\n\nit mandatory for employer to give a notice in writing to a person, who\n\nbecomes entitled to gratuity so that amount, if any, on account of\n\ngratuity is paid to him/her within reasonable time. Though in the case\n\nat hand, claims for payment of gratuity appear to have been put forth\n\nby the respondents after 7-8 years of their discharge from the\n\npetitioner school, but that would not defeat their rightful claim, which\n\notherwise flows from \nSection 7\n of the Act. Though \nSection 7 (1)\n\nprovides for making an application within the time as specified in the\n\nRules but if \nSection 7 (2)\n is read, it clearly casts duty upon the\n\nemployer to give notice to its employee as well as controlling authority\n\nwith regard to gratuity payable to its employee. However in the case at\n\nhand, there is nothing to suggest that petitioner, ever gave notice to\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 24 -\n\nthe private respondents or controlling authority, specifying the amount\n\nof gratuity so determined, on account of services rendered by the\n\nprivate respondents before taking over their services by the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh.\n\n26. At this stage it would be pat to take note of Rule 7 (1) of\n\nthe Gratuity Rules, which read as under:\n\n \"7(1). An employee who is eligible for payment of gratuity under\n the Act, or any person authorized, in writing, to act on his\n behalf, shall apply, ordinarily within thirty days from the date\n the gratuity became payable, in Form 'I' to the employer\"\n\n27. Rule 7 (5), provides that an application for payment of\n\ngratuity filed after the expiry of the periods specified in this rule shall\n\nalso be entertained by the employer, if the applicant adduces sufficient\n\ncause for the delay. Rule 7(5) reads as under:\n\n \"7(5)An application for payment of gratuity filed after the expiry\n of the periods specified in this rule shall also be entertained by\n the employer, if the applicant adduces sufficient cause for the\n delay in preferring his claim, and no claim for gratuity under\n the Act shall be invalid merely because the claimant failed to\n present his application within the specified period. Any dispute\n in this regard shall be referred to the controlling authority for\n his decision.\"\n\n28. If the aforesaid Rules, which are statutory, are read in\n\nconjunction clearly reveals that ordinarily, an application should be\n\nfiled by the claimant within 30 days from the date gratuity becomes\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 25 -\n\npayable, but it also gives him liberty to stake claim after expiry of 30\n\ndays, but for that purpose, cogent and convincing reason is required to\n\nbe adduced.\n\n29. Question which needs to be determined at this stage is\n\n'whether Rule framed under the Act override the statue, which itself\n\ncasts duty upon the employer to give notice to an employee specifying\n\namount of gratuity so determined.\n\n30. No doubt, \nSection 7(1)\n talks about time for filing claim as\n\nmay be prescribed in rules, but \nSection 7 (2)\n dilutes the aforesaid\n\nmandate, if any, given in \nSection 7\n. Bare reading of \nSection 2\n casts\n\nduty upon the employer to give notice to the employee as soon as\n\ngratuity becomes payable so that necessary steps, if any, at the behest\n\nof the claimant are taken in that regard. \nSection 7 (2)\n besides casting\n\nliability upon employer to give notice to the employee also makes it\n\nmandatory to employer to give notice to the controlling authority\n\nspecifying therein amount of gratuity, meaning thereby, duty to\n\ndetermine amount of gratuity and thereafter, to notify the same is of\n\nemployer irrespective of the application. \nSection 7 (2)\n specifically states\n\nwhether an application referred to in sub-section (1) has been made or\n\nnot, duty is of employer to determine the amount of gratuity and\n\nthereafter notice in terms of the of aforesaid is required to be given to\n\nthe employee and controlling authority.\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 26 -\n\n31. Mr. Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner while\n\ninviting attention of this court to judgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in \nSultan Begum v. Prem Chand Jain\n (1997) 1 SCC 373,\n\nvehemently argued that every clause of statute should be construed\n\nwith reference to the context or other clauses of the act so as far as\n\npossible to make a consistent enactment or whole statute or series of\n\nstatutes relating to the subject matter. He submitted that since Rules,\n\nwhich are applicable in the case at hand, have a statutory force,\n\nhaving been framed in exercise of power conferred under \nSection 14\n\nand \nSection 7\n of the Act and there is specific provision for making\n\napplication within thirty days from the date gratuity becomes payable\n\nin Form I to the employer, private respondents herein, cannot be\n\npermitted to draw advantage, if any, of \nSection 7 (2)\n of the Act, which\n\ncasts duty upon employer to give notice in writing to a person who has\n\nbecome entitled to gratuity but aforesaid provision of law cannot be\n\nread in isolation, rather both \nSections 7 (1)\n and \n7 (2)\n are to be read in\n\nconjunction. He submitted that since \nSection 7 (1)\n clearly talks about\n\nmaking of an application within a time frame as may be prescribed by\n\nthe rules, submission made by the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents cannot be accepted that in terms of \nSection 7 (2)\n, no\n\napplication at all is required to be made. Aforesaid submission made\n\nby Mr. Sharma deserves outright rejection for two reasons; i.) Rules, if\n\nany, framed pursuant to power, if any, given under the parent Act\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 27 -\n\ncannot override the statute. No doubt, \nSection 7 (1)\n of the Act permits\n\nthe employer to prescribe timeline for making application, but if\n\nSection 7(2)\n is read in conjunction with \nSection 7 (1)\n, duty has been\n\ncast upon the employer to give notice in writing to a person who\n\nbecomes entitled to gratuity so that amount on account of gratuity, if\n\nany, is paid to him/her within reasonable time.\n\n32. At this stage it would be apt to take note of Rule 7 (5)\n\nwhich provides that no claim for gratuity under the Act shall be invalid\n\nmerely because the claimant failed to present his application within a\n\nspecified period. Aforesaid rule, which admittedly cannot override\n\nprovision contained under the \nParent Act\n wholly does away with the\n\nprovisions of Rule 7 (1), which provides that an employee, who is\n\neligible for payment of gratuity under this Act or any person\n\nauthorized, in writing to act on his behalf, shall apply within 30 days\n\nfrom the date gratuity becomes payable to the employee.\n\n33. True it is that as per cardinal principle of interpretation of\n\nstatutes, where there is a conflict between two different sections of the\n\nsame statue or different portion of the same, court has to adopt\n\nprinciple of doctrine of harmonious construction as has been\n\nrepeatedly held in the judgments pressed into service by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner. In all the judgments pressed into service\n\nby the petitioner, it has been held that provision of one section of the\n\nstatute cannot be used to defeat the other provision, otherwise court\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 28 -\n\nin its effort would find it impossible to effect reconciliation between\n\nthem. Most importantly in the aforesaid judgments, Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has held that while interpreting such provision of law court\n\nshould bear in mind that when there are two conflicting provisions in\n\nthe Act which cannot be reconciled with each other, they should be so\n\ninterpreted that, if possible, effect should be given to both.\n\n34. Mr. Sharma, attempted to argue that interpretation\n\nsought to be given by the aforesaid provision contained under \nSection\n\n7(2)\n of the Act, if accepted would render one of the provision as dead\n\nletter or useless number, which otherwise cannot be said to be\n\nharmonious construction. Though this Court finds no quarrel with\n\nthe aforesaid proposition of law \nlaid down in\n the judgments pressed\n\ninto service by learned counsel representing petitioner, but in the case\n\nat hand, no provision, if any, ever came to be made in the \nParent Act\n\nwith regard to period of limitation, rather \nSection 7(1)\n gave leverage to\n\nthe employer to provide timeframe within which period, an application,\n\nif any, can be made by person claiming gratuity. No doubt, in terms of\n\naforesaid provision of law, Payment of Gratuity Central Rules, 1972,\n\ncame to be framed by the Government of India, Rule 7 whereof talks\n\nabout application, if any, by the employee entitled for payment of\n\ngratuity within a period of 30 days from the date of gratuity.\n\n35. If aforesaid Rule is read in its entirety, it nowhere talks\n\nabout specific time of 30 days, rather word \"ordinarily\" has been used,\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 29 -\n\nmeaning thereby \"ordinarily\" or in normal circumstances, application\n\nin terms of aforesaid Rule should be filed within 30 days from the date\n\ngratuity became payable. Aforesaid Rule otherwise nowhere suggests\n\nthat in any eventuality, application is to be filed within 30 days. If\n\naforesaid rule is read in conjunction with Rule 7 (5), there appears to\n\nbe merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the private\n\nrespondents that an application for payment of gratuity filed after the\n\nexpiry of period, shall also be entertained by the employer.\n\n36. Though initial part of Rule 7 (5) suggests that application,\n\nif any, for release of payment of gratuity under the Act can be received\n\nafter prescribed period of 30 days, but in that regard, applicant may\n\nhave to render plausible explanation qua the delay, if any, but if\n\nsecond part of Rule is read, it clearly suggests that no claim for\n\ngratuity under the Act shall be invalid merely because the claimant\n\nfailed to present his application within the specified period, rather any\n\ndispute, in that regard, shall be referred to the controlling authority for\n\ndecision.\n\n37. At the cost of repetition, though this Court is of the view\n\nthat rules, if any, framed in terms of power of rule making provided in\n\nthe Act cannot override the provisions contained in the statute, but\n\neven if it is presumed that in terms of Rule 7 (1), private respondents\n\nherein ought to have filed an application, which they failed in doing so,\n\nclaim put forth by the private respondents cannot be defeated solely\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 30 -\n\non the ground of late submission of applications as has been provided\n\nunder Rule 7 (5).\n\n38. \nSection 7 (2)\n if read in conjunction with Rule 7 (5), clearly\n\nprovides that no claim of gratuity can be defeated on the ground of\n\ndelay and laches, rather duty has been cast upon the employer to\n\ndetermine the amount of gratuity and give notice in writing to a\n\nperson, to whom gratuity is payable and also controlling authority\n\nspecifying the amount of gratuity so determined. Once duty under the\n\naforesaid provision of law is cast upon the employer to intimate\n\namount of gratuity payable to employee, employer otherwise cannot be\n\npermitted to claim that application in that regard was required to be\n\nfiled by the person entitled for gratuity under the aforesaid act.\n\n39. At this stage it would be apt to take note of \nSection 7\n (3 A),\n\nwhich clearly provides that if amount of gratuity payable under sub-\n\nsection (3) is not paid by the employer within the period specified in\n\nsub-section (3), the employer shall pay, from the date on which the\n\ngratuity becomes payable to the date on which it is paid, simple\n\ninterest at such rate, not exceeding the rate notified by the Central\n\nGovernment from time to time for repayment of long terms deposits, as\n\nthat Government may, by notification specify.\n\n40. Though proviso to aforesaid provision of law provides that\n\nno such interest shall be payable if the delay in the payment is due to\n\nthe fault of the employee and employer has obtained permission in\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 31 -\n\nwriting from the controlling authority for the delayed payment on this\n\nground, however, no material worth credence ever came to be led on\n\nrecord to suggest that steps if any, were ever taken by the employer\n\ni.e. petitioner herein to intimate the controlling authority of the\n\namount payable to the respondents on account of gratuity under the\n\nAct. There is nothing to suggest that there was default, if any, on the\n\npart of the employees and petitioner had obtained permission in\n\nwriting from the controlling authority for the delayed payment.\n\n41. \nSection 7 (3)\n of the Act casts duty upon the employer to\n\npay the amount gratuity within 30 days from the date it becomes\n\npayable to the persons to whom the gratuity is payable and as such,\n\nrightful claim of the private respondents cannot be permitted to be\n\ndefeated on the ground of delay and laches. For the discussion made\n\nherein above, this Court finds no application of the judgments\n\n(\nSultana Begum vs. Prem Chand Jain\n, Fertilizer Corporation of India\n\nand ors. vs. M/S Coromandal Sacks Private Limited and Anwar Hasan\n\nKhan vs. Mohammad Shafi and ors.) pressed into service by Sh. M.L.\n\nSharma, learned counsel representing petitioner, wherein, Hon'ble\n\nApex while defining the essence of rule of harmonious construction,\n\nproceeded to rule that rule in conflict, if any, should be interpreted in\n\nsuch a manner that effect is given to both.\n\n42. If the aforementioned finding returned by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt is applied to the case at hand, it is evident that while Section\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 32 -\n\n7(1) of the Act grants the employer the liberty to frame rules,\n\nspecifying a time limit for submitting an application for payment of\n\ngratuity, Rule 7(2) imposes a clear obligation on the employer to issue\n\na notice to the employee as well as to the controlling authority\n\nregarding amount due, if any, under the Act.\n\n43. If the aforesaid provisions are read in conjunction with\n\nRule 7 (5), this Court would be inclined to give interpretation to the\n\naforesaid provision in a way where no claim, if any, for gratuity can be\n\nrejected on the ground of limitation, rather duty always shall remain\n\ncast upon the employer to apprise its employee as well as controlling\n\nauthority with regard to amount, if any, payable under the Act. In the\n\ncase at hand, there is nothing to suggest that notice, either to private\n\nrespondents or to controlling authority was ever given by the petitioner\n\nthereby notifying the amount of gratuity payable by the petitioner,\n\nrather its consistent stand has been that it is not liable to pay gratuity\n\nand liability, if any, to pay gratuity is of the State as it was providing\n\n95% grant-in-aid.\n\n44. Next question which needs to be answered in the instant\n\nproceedings is qua the date from which the gratuity scheme became\n\napplicable for the employees of the petitioner-institution.\n\n45. Mr. M.L. Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner-\n\nSchool argued that \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n was made\n\napplicable to educational institution w.e.f. 3.4.1997 and as such,\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 33 -\n\nprivate respondents otherwise could have been made entitled to\n\ngratuity, if any, from the afore date, but definitely, not from the date of\n\njoining as has been ordered by the controlling authority. While\n\nreferring to the claim petitions made by some of the employees, Mr.\n\nSharma, further argued that once private respondents themselves\n\nclaimed gratuity w.e.f. 3.4.1997, there was otherwise no occasion for\n\nthe controlling authority to allow such prayer with effect from the date\n\nof their joining.\n\n46. While referring to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in \nBirla Institute of Technology v. State of Jharkhand\n\nand Ors.\n (2019) 4 SCC 513, Mr. M.L. Sharma, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner argued that though in the aforesaid judgment,\n\nrespective application of amendment No. 47 of 2009 was upheld, but it\n\nnowhere came to be ruled that persons retired prior to the afore date\n\nare also entitled to be given gratuity from the date of their joining. He\n\nfurther submitted that even after amendment Act, 2009, private\n\nrespondents herein would be entitled to gratuity w.e.f. 3.4.1997 till\n\ntheir services were taken over by the respondent-State because prior\n\nto afore date, category of teachers was not in the purview of the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. He further submitted that mere upholding of\n\njudgment passed by the High Court of Jharkhand would not mean\n\nthat private respondents herein can claim parity with the persons, who\n\nwere before Division Bench of Jharkhand, especially when while\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 34 -\n\nrendering judgment in the year 2019, Hon'ble Apex Court, nowhere\n\ndeliberated upon the issue with regard to applicability of the Act qua\n\nthe employees/teachers, who stood retired prior to 3.4.1997.\n\n47. While ascertaining the correctness of afore submissions\n\nmade by the learned counsel for the petitioner, it would be apt to take\n\nnote of relevant paras of judgment passed by the Division Bench of\n\nJharkhand High Court in Birla Institute of Technology Versus\n\nState of Jharkhand & Ors. 2008 SCC OnLine Jhar 91, which\n\nultimately came to be upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Relevant\n\nparas of the afore judgment read as under:\n\n \"15. Let us now come to the Second Point, i.e., with regard to\n question as to whether respondent No. 4 is covered under the\n notification dated 03-04-1997 issued by the Central\n Government, especially when he has not completed 5 years of\n continuous service.\n\n (a) This point also has been considered by both the\n Controlling Authority and the Appellate Authority as well\n as by the learned single Judge in detail.\n\n (b) It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellant\n that the provisions of the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n has\n been extended to educational institutions by notification\n dated 03-04-1997 and it is only applicable to non-teaching\n staff of institute and this will not definitely cover\n respondent No. 4, who has not completed 5 years of\n continuous service.\n\n (c) This contention, as correctly pointed out by the learned\n single Judge, has no force. It is true that the \nPayment of\n Gratuity Act, 1972\n has been implemented in the institute\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 35 -\n\nof the appellant through the notification of the\nGovernment of India dated 3-4-1997 having formulated a\nseparate Act for the educational institutions, the\nGovernment of India has implemented it with effect from\n03-04-1997. It means such workman of the educational\ninstitution who has superannuated before 03-04-1997 are\nnot entitled to gratuity, but the workman superannuated\non or after 03-04-1997 shall be entitled to gratuity. The\nreckoning of the service period for the purpose of eligibility\nof gratuity is made under \nSection 4\n of the Payment of\nGratuity Act, 1972, which contains the provisions of\nreckoning the total service of the workman. Admittedly,\nthe total service of the respondent No. 4 is 30 years and on\nthat reason, both the Controlling Authority as well as the\nAppellate Authority has correctly rejected the contention.\n\n(d) While dealing with this point, the learned single Judge\nwould reject the said contention on the basis of the\nobservations made by the Supreme Court in (1995) 5 SCC\n642 : (AIR 1996 SC 580). In \nthe said judgment\n, the\nSupreme Court considered the commencement of the\nperiod for continuous ser vice and observed as under:--\n\n \"The starting point of the said period is from the date\n an employee gets employment, which in the nature of\n things would vary from employee to employee. It is\n nowhere envisaged in the scheme from the above\n provisions that the continuous service of the\n employee would be computed in a chain from\n calendar year to calendar year. Completed year of\n service would plainly mean continuous service for\n one year reckonable from the date of joining\n employment\".\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 36 -\n\n (e) As indicated above, the Act became applicable to the\n employees of educational institution with effect from 03-\n 04-1997. At that time, petitioner was in service and he\n retired only in 2001. As such, his entire period of service\n has to be reckoned for the purpose of payment of gratuity.\n\n (f) Therefore, the second ground also has to fail.\n\n16. The next question is as to whether the judgment reported\nin (2004) 1 SCC 755 is applicable in the present facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\n\n (a) This point has been dealt with by the learned single\n Judge in detail. It is true as pointed out by the learned\n counsel for the appellant that the Apex Court in (2004) 1\n SCC 755 held that a teacher employed in a School is not\n an employee within the meaning of \nSection 2 (e)\n of the Act.\n Let us refer to the relevant observations made by the\n Supreme Court:--\n\n 24. The contention advanced that teachers should be\n treated as included in the expression \"unskilled\" or\n \"skilled\" cannot, therefore, be accepted. The teachers\n might have been imparted training for teaching or\n there may be cases where teachers who are employed\n in primary schools are untrained. A trained teacher is\n not described in the industrial field or service\n jurisprudence as a \"skilled employee\". Such adjective\n generally is used for an employee doing manual or\n technical work. Similarly, the words \"semi-skilled\"\n\n and \"unskilled\" are not understood in educational\n establishments as describing nature of job of\n untrained teachers. We do not attach much\n importance to the arguments advanced on the\n question as to whether \"skilled\", \"semiskilled\" and\n \"unskilled\" qualify the words \"manual\", supervisory\",\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 37 -\n\n technical\", or \"clerical\" or the above words qualify the\n word \"work\". Even if all the words are read\n disjunctively or in any other manner, trained or\n untrained teachers do not plainly answer any of the\n descriptions of the nature of various employments\n given in the definition clause. Trained or untrained\n teachers are not \"skilled\", \"semi-skilled\", \"unskilled\",\n \"manual\", \"supervisory\", \"technical\" or \"clerical\"\n\n employees. They are also not employed in\n \"managerial\" or \"administrative\" capacity.\n\n Occasionally, even if they do some administrative\n work as part of their duty with teaching, since their\n main job is imparting education, they cannot be held\n employed in \"managerial\" or \"administrative\"\n\n capacity. The teachers are clearly not intended to be\n covered by the definition of \"employee\".\n\n(b) The reading of \nthe entire judgment\n including the said\nparagraph would clearly show that the judgment was\nrendered in the case of primary school teachers and it\ncannot be expected that they should be possessed of\nexpert knowledge. In that context, the Apex Court held\nthat the teachers in the primary school do not fail within\nthe definition of employee under the Act.\n\n(c) The Supreme Court was not considering the case of an\nemployee who was doing technical work which has been\nclearly specified in \nSection 2 (e)\n of the Act to bring an\nemployee within the ambit of \nSection 2 (e)\n of the Act. As\nindicated in the above paragraphs, the duties entrusted to\nthe skilled and technical person like respondent No. 4 is\nentirely different from the teacher working in the primary\nschool.\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 38 -\n\n (d) Similarly, the learned single Judge has also given the\n reason as to why this point has to be rejected in the\n following observation:--\n\n \"Based upon above observations, it is contended that\n teachers have not been held to be \"employee\" within\n the meaning of \nSection 2 (e)\n of the Act and thus\n benefit of gratuity is not available to respondent No.\n\n 4. It is relevant to notice that the judgment was\n rendered in the case of Primary School Teachers and\n they cannot be said to be possessed of any expert\n knowledge of teaching or any technical or any skilled\n knowledge. It is under these circumstances, Apex\n Court held that the teachers do not fall within the\n definition of \"employee\" under the Act. Though\n respondent No. 4 is a teacher in the petitioner-\n\n Institution but he is possessed of a degree in\n Mechanical Engineering and in course of his\n employment he not only teaches the students but\n also performs other functions like imparting technical\n knowledge even based on material testing in a\n laboratory. By and large, the nature of job of the\n petitioner as a teacher in engineering faculty cannot\n be considered to be teaching job simpliciter. Such a\n job, though academic, is also technical in nature. In\n my humble opinion, above judgment will not apply in\n the present case.\n\n (e) This observation by the learned single Judge to reject\n this point, in our view, is perfectly justified.\n\n48. In the afore case before the High Court of Jharkhand,\n\npetitioner therein though was engaged by the employer concerned in\n\nthe year 1971, but admittedly, he retired in the year 2001. Since with\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 39 -\n\nthe promulgation of the Amendment Act No. 47 of 2009, category of\n\nteacher was also brought under the purview of the \nPayment of\n\nGratuity Act\n with retrospective effect from 03.04.1997, Division Bench\n\nof Jharkhand High Court held that since at the time of his retirement,\n\npetitioner \nin that case\n had become eligible for gratuity in terms of the\n\nAct, his services rendered prior to afore date are also required to be\n\ntaken into consideration while computing period for calculation of\n\ngratuity. \nIt is not in dispute that aforesaid view taken by the Division\n\nBench of Jharkhand ultimately came to be upheld by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in \nBirla Institute of Technology v. State of Jharkhand and\n\nOrs.\n (2019) 4 SCC 513.\n \nAt this stage, it may be apt to take note of\n\nthe fact that prior to filing the judgment in the year 2019, as detailed\n\nherein above, Hon'ble Supreme Court had earlier dealt with the issue\n\nin \nAhmadabad Private Primary Teachers' Association v.\n\nAdministrative Officer\n, 2004 (1) SCC 755, wherein plea, which was\n\naccepted by the Hon'ble Division Bench of the Jharkhand High court\n\nwas negated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court by holding that teachers\n\nare not in the ambit of payment of \nGratuity Act\n. Though in the case\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Apex Court, one notification was produced\n\nsuggestive of the fact that category of teachers was included in the\n\ndefinition of employee in terms of the Act, but since no amendment\n\nwas carried in the Act, afore notification was not taken into\n\nconsideration by the Hon'ble Apex Court, as a result thereof, claim put\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 40 -\n\nforth by the teachers claiming themselves entitled to payment of\n\ngratuity under the Act was negated, however, subsequently, in\n\njudgment passed in \nBirla Institute of Technology v. State of\n\nJharkhand and Ors.\n (2019) 4 SCC 513, Hon'ble Apex Court ruled\n\nthat law \nlaid down by\n it in \nAhmadabad Private Primary Teachers'\n\nAssociation v. Administrative Officer\n, 2004 (1) SCC 755 was no\n\nlonger applicable against the petitioner and secondly, teachers were\n\nentitled to claim gratuity.\n \nRelevant paras of the judgment passed in\n\nBirla Institute of Technology v. State of Jharkhand\n read as under:\n\n \"22. The definition of \"employee\" as defined under \nSection 2(e)\n\n was accordingly amended with effect from 03.04.1997\n retrospectively vide \nPayment of the Gratuity (Amendment) Act,\n 2009\n (No. 47 of 2009) published on 31.12.2009. The amended\n definition reads as under:\n\n \"(e) \"employee\" means any person (other than an apprentice)\n who is employed for wages, whether the terms of such\n employment are express or implied, in any kind of work,\n manual or otherwise, in or in connection with the work of a\n factory, mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway company,\n shop or other establishment to which this Act applies, but\n does not include any such person who holds a post under the\n Central Government or a State Government and is governed\n by any other Act or by any rules providing for payment of\n gratuity.\"\n\n 23. In the light of the amendment made in the definition of the\n word \"employee\" as defined in \nSection 2(e)\n of the Act by\n \nAmending Act\n No. 47 of 2009 with retrospective effect from\n 03.04.1997, the benefit of the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n was also\n extended to the teachers from 03.04.1997. In other words, the\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 41 -\n\nteachers were brought within the purview of \"employee\" as\ndefined in \nSection 2(e)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act by\n\nAmending Act\n No. 47 of 2009 with retrospective effect from\n03.04.1997.\n\n24.The effect of the amendment made in the \nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n vide \nAmending Act\n No. 47 of 2009 on 31.12.2009\nwas two-fold. First, the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in the case\nof \nAhmadabad Pvt. Primary Teachers Association\n (supra) was\nno longer applicable against the teachers, as if not rendered,\nand Second, the teachers were held entitled to claim the\namount of gratuity under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n from\ntheir employer with effect from 03.04.1997.\n\n25. \nIn our considered opinion, in the light of the amendment\nmade in the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n as detailed above, reliance\nplaced by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant\n(employer) on the decision of \nAhmedabad Pvt. Primary Teachers\nAssociation\n(supra) is wholly misplaced and does not help the\nappellant in any manner. It has lost its binding effect.\n\n26. Learned counsel for the appellant then urged that the\nconstitutional validity of \nAmending Act\n No. 47 of 2009 is under\nchallenge in this Court in a writ petition, which is pending. 33.\nBe that as it may, in our view, pendency of any writ petition by\nitself does not affect the constitutionality of the \nAmending Act\n,\nand nor does it affect the right of respondent No.4 (teacher) in\nany manner in claiming gratuity amount from the\nappellant(employer) under the Act.\n\n27. It is only when the Court declares a Statute as being ultra\nvires the provisions of the Constitution then the question may\narise to consider its effect on the rights of the parties and that\nwould always depend upon the declaration rendered by the\nCourt and the directions given \nin that case\n. Such is not the case\nhere as of now.\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 42 -\n\n 28. In the light of the foregoing discussion, we find no merit in\n this appeal, which fails and is hereby dismissed with costs\n quantified at Rs.25,000/- payable by the appellant to\n respondent No.4(teacher).\"\n\n49. If the aforesaid judgment is read in its entirety, it came to\n\nbe rule by Hon'ble Apex Court that once a teacher has been brought in\n\nthe definition of employee as defined under \nSection 2 (e)\n of the Act by\n\namending Act No. 47 of 2009 with retrospective effect from 3.4.1997,\n\nthe benefit of the Act is required to be extended to the teachers from\n\n3.4.1997.\n\n50. Though, at this stage, Mr. M.L. Sharma, learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner vehemently argued that even in terms of aforesaid\n\njudgment passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court, teacher or category of\n\nteacher is eligible to be granted benefit of gratuity w.e.f. 3.4.1997, but\n\nthis Court is not persuaded to agree with aforesaid submission of Mr.\n\nSharma, for the reason that in a case before Hon'ble Apex Court, issue\n\nwas not with regard to applicability of Amendment Act qua the\n\nteachers, who admittedly stood retired prior to 3.4.1997, rather \nin that\n\ncase\n, judgment passed by the Division Bench of Jharkhand, upholding\n\nthe claim of the petitioner, who was appointed as teacher in the 1971\n\nbut had retired after 2007 was upheld. By upholding judgment\n\npassed by the Division Bench in the aforesaid judgment, Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt virtually ruled that since on 3.4.1997, category of teacher had\n\nbecome eligible for payment of gratuity under the Act, teachers\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 43 -\n\nworking on that day, shall be eligible for payment of gratuity under the\n\nAct and period for computing minimum service would be counted\n\ntaking note of service rendered prior to such date i.e. 3.4.1997.\n\n51. There is another aspect of the matter that minimum\n\nservice required for claiming the payment of gratuity is five years in\n\nterms of \nSection 4\n Clause 1, which reads as under:\n\n \"4. Payment of gratuity.-(1) Gratuity shall be payable to an\n employee on the termination of his employment after he has\n rendered continuous service for not less than five years,\n\n (a) on his superannuation, or\n\n (b) on his retirement or resignation, or\n\n (c)on his death or disablement due to accident or disease:\n\n Provided that the completion of continuous service of five years\n shall not be necessary where the termination of the employment\n of any employee is due to death or disablement:\n\n [Provided further that in the case of death of the employee,\n gratuity payable to him shall be paid to his nominee or, if no\n nomination has been made, to his heirs, and where any such\n nominees or heirs is a minor, the share of such minor, shall be\n deposited with the controlling authority who shall invest the\n same for the benefit of such minor in such bank or other\n financial institution, as may be prescribed, until such minor\n attains majority.] [ Substituted by Act 22 of 1987, \nSection 4\n\n (w.e.f. 1.2.1991).]\n\n Explanation .-For the purposes of this section, disablement\n means such disablement as incapacitates an employee for the\n work which he was capable of performing before the accident or\n disease resulting in such disablement.\"\n\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 44 -\n\n52. As per aforesaid provision, gratuity shall be payable to an\n\nemployee on the termination of his employment after his having\n\nrendered continuous service for not less than five years. In case\n\nargument advanced by Mr. Sharma, is accepted that private\n\nrespondents herein became eligible for payment of gratuity after\n\n3.4.1997, they would never become eligible for gratuity for the reason\n\nthat person claiming gratuity must have rendered at least five years of\n\nservice.\n\n53. By way of parliamentary amendment brought in the year\n\n2009, with retrospective effect from 03.04.1997, \"teachers\" have been\n\nspecifically included within the ambit of the word employee as defined\n\nunder \nsection 2\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Upon the said\n\namendment being introduced in the Act, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in \nBirla Institute of Technology vs State of Jharkhand2019\n 4\n\nSCC 513, upheld the claim of Gratuity of the private respondent\n\ninvolved in the aforesaid case.\n\n54. At the same time, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India also\n\nobserved in para 24,\n\n \"The effect of amendment made in the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n\n vide the amending act, 47 of 2009on 31.12.2009 was twofold.\n First, the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in Ahmedabad Private\n Primary Teachers Association(2004 1 SCC 755) was no longer\n applicable against the teachers, as if not rendered, and second,\n the teachers were held entitled to claim the amount of gratuity\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 45 -\n\n under the payment of Gratuity act, from their employer with\n effect from 03.04.1997\".\n\n55. In the aforesaid case, the private respondent, whose claim\n\nfor gratuity was upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, had rendered\n\nthe services as a teacher at the Institute from 16.09.1971 to\n\n30.11.2001. The claim of Gratuity, raised by the private respondent\n\ntherein, was allowed by the Controlling Authority, (i.e., the First\n\nAuthority), thereafter, sequentially upheld by the Appellate Authority,\n\nthe Hon'ble Single Bench of the Jharkhand High Court, and the\n\nHon'ble Division Bench. Ultimately, the appeal against these decisions\n\nwas dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the \nBirla\n\nInstitute\n case (supra). Therefore, the entire services rendered by the\n\nprivate respondent concerned in the said litigation i.e., w.e.f. 1971 to\n\n2001, were counted in order to compute the claim of gratuity, which\n\nwas ultimately affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n56. Furthermore, the Act itself stipulates by way of \nSection 4\n\n(1)\n that in order to be eligible for gratuity, a person must have\n\nrendered at least 5 years of service and in case, the services are to be\n\ncounted w.e.f. 03.04.1997 then the private respondent concerned\n\nbefore Apex Court would never have been eligible to seek gratuity in\n\nthe first place because from 03.04.1997 to 30.11.2001 (date of\n\nretirement), the period of 5 years is not completed and thus the person\n\ndoes not becomes entitled for gratuity, however, the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt after discussing the facts of the case in para 12 of Birla Institute\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 46 -\n\n(Supra), upheld the claim of Gratuity, thereby necessarily implying\n\nthat the services rendered before the date of 03.04.1997 would be\n\ncounted for computing the claim of gratuity.\n\n57. Otherwise also, if the services rendered by an employee\n\nprior to 03.04.1997, are excluded, any person retiring after that date\n\nbut before completing the statutorily prescribed of five years of service\n\nwould be rendered ineligible to claim gratuity. For instance, employees\n\nretiring on 04.04.1997, 05.04.1997 or 30.04.1997, and so forth would\n\nremain ineligible to claim gratuity, despite their total service exceeding\n\nfive years. Therefore, such an interpretation would cause grave\n\ninjustice to employees who have dedicated their entire careers as\n\nteachers, effectively denying them gratuity merely because they retired\n\nafter 03.04.1997, but before completing five years counted from that\n\ndate.\n\n58. Furthermore, the effect of the amendment is not that a\n\nperson becomes a teacher only after 03.04.1997, rather a person who\n\nhas been a teacher prior to such date, also becomes entitled to claim\n\ngratuity provided he fulfills the requirement of rendering 5 years of\n\nservice as a teacher. A teacher retiring prior to 03.04.1997, say on\n\n02.04.1997, would not be entitled to claim gratuity because gratuity\n\nbecomes payable only upon superannuation and since on the\n\nsuperannuation of such a person, teachers were not included within\n\nthe definition of employee, a teacher who had superannuated prior to\n 2024:HHC:12413\n\n - 47 -\n\n03.07.1997 could not claim gratuity. However, a teacher retiring on or\n\nafter 03.04.1997 would be entitled to claim gratuity because upon the\n\nsuperannuation of such a person, category of 'teacher' stood included\n\nwithin the definition of employee under the Act.\n\n59. Consequently, in view of the detailed discussion made\n\nherein above as well as law taken into consideration, this Court finds\n\nno illegality and infirmity in the impugned order passed by the\n\nappellate authority, which appears to be based upon proper\n\nappreciation of facts and law and as such, same is upheld.\n\nAccordingly, present petitions fail and dismissed being devoid of merit.\n\nAll pending applications also stand disposed of.\n\nNovember 7, 2024 (Sandeep Sharma),\nmanjit Judge",
