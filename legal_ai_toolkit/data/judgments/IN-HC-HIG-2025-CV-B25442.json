The essential facts of the cases that are required for the disposal of\n\nthe writ petitions are deliberated as follows:-\n\n3.1. Petitioner in W.P.No.24381 of 2025 belongs to Konda Reddis\n\n(ST) community, which falls under the category of 'Schedules Tribes' as per\n\nthe Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950. He was issued with such\n\n__________\n\nPage No.4 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\ncommunity certificate on 01.03.1972 by the Tahsildar. Thereafter, the\n\npetitioner got appointed in Vijaya Bank (now Bank of Baroda) in the year\n\n1984. After completing 37 years of service, he reached superannuation on\n\n30.06.2021 and the petitioner was sanctioned with his own contribution of\n\nProvident Fund amounts and provisional pension alone. Other retirement\n\nbenefits such as sanctioned gratuity, earned leave encashment and full\n\npension/commutation, are yet to be received by the petitioner and the\n\npetitioner has initiated separate legal proceedings to secure those retirement\n\nbenefits.\n\n3.2. On 16.05.2025, nearly after four years from the date of retirement\n\nof the petitioner, the second respondent has issued a notice calling upon the\n\npetitioner to appear for enquiry on 20.05.2025 for verification of his\n\ncommunity certificate, which was issued 53 years ago. Based on the same,\n\nthe first respondent has issued a show cause notice to the petitioner on\n\n03.06.2025. Aggrieved against the same, the petitioner has filed the present\n\nwrit petition.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.5 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n3.3. Meanwhile, in W.P.No.24387 of 2025, the petitioner therein also\n\nbelongs to Konda Reddis (ST) community, which falls under the category of\n\n'Schedules Tribes' as per the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950.\n\nIssued with a community certificate on 02.02.1980 by the Tahsildar, the\n\npetitioner was appointed in the year 1981 in the office of the third\n\nrespondent herein/ Southern Railways. After completing 37 years of service,\n\nthe petitioner attained superannuation on 30.12.2018. Likewise in this matter\n\nalso, the petitioner was sanctioned with provisional pension alone and other\n\nretirement benefits such as full pension, gratuity, earned leave encashment,\n\netc., have not been granted, for which, the petitioner has given\n\nrepresentation to the third respondent and the same is pending. While that\n\nbeing so, on 17.06.2025, the second respondent issued a notice calling the\n\npetitioner to appear for enquiry on 26.02.2025 for verification of his\n\ncommunity certificate, issued 45 years ago. Aggrieved against the same, the\n\npetitioner has preferred the present writ petition.\n\n4. Mr.V.Vijay Shankar, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\n\nin both the writ petitions, submitted that this Court in a series of judgments\n\nhas consistently taken a view that after retirement of an employee, the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.6 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nprocess of verification will be academic and has restrained the\n\ncommittee/verifying authority from proceeding further. The petitioners have\n\nnot been summoned for more than 40 years for verification of certificate and\n\nin the interregnum reached superannuation. Therefore, he would submit that\n\nrespondents may be refrained from conducting verification of the petitioners'\n\ncaste status, since they have retired from service. The petitioners have also\n\nfiled affidavits of undertaking, respectively, stating that they will not make\n\nany claim or concession based on their community certificates.\n\n5. Per contra, the learned Additional Government Pleader appearing\n\nfor the respondents would submit that the impugned summons and show\n\ncause notice have been issued to the petitioners only to appear before the\n\nfirst respondent to submit their explanation along with proof of documents,\n\nif any, and no adverse orders would be passed and the authorities concerned\n\nare taking steps to verify the community certificates in the light of the\n\ndirection issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide orders dated 25.02.2025\n\nand 02.06.2025 in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.27890 of 2019.\n\n6. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.7 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nlearned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the official\n\nrespondents and perused the materials placed before this Court.\n\n7. The extract of the observations and directions issued by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court vide orders dated 25.02.2025 in Special Leave to Appeal (C)\n\nNo.27890 of 2019 is as follows:-\n\n“4. This litigation has something to do with Caste\nCertificate. It is the case of the respondent herein that she\nbelongs to Hindu Konda Reddis Community (Scheduled\nTribe).\n\n5. She applied for a caste certificate for her son. The\nsame was declined after an inquiry undertaken by Revenue\nDivisional Officer (for short the “RDO”). In such\ncircumstances, the respondent preferred a writ petition in\nthe High Court. The High court disposed of the writ petition\nobserving the following in para 7:-\n\n“7. Be that as it may. As on date, the\nCommunity Certificates issued to the Petitioner, her\nsister, her brother and also of her close relatives,\nwere not cancelled and when they were not\ncancelled, there cannot be any impediment in issuing\nthe Community Certificate to the Petitioner's son.\nAccordingly, the Respondent RDO Mettur Dam,\nSalem District, is directed to issue a Community\nCertificate to the Petitioner's son S.P. Yesvanth,\n\n__________\n\nPage No.8 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nwithin a period of two weeks from the date of receipt\nof a copy of this order. Thereafter, the Respondent-\nRDO, Mettur Dam, Salem District is directed to refer\nthe said Community Certificate of the Petitioner,\nPetitioner's brother, Petitioner's sister and also her\nclose relatives and .also of her son to be issued as\ndirected above, to the State Level Scrutiny Committee\nfor verification of the genuineness of the same. The\nState Level Scrutiny Committee shall verify the\ngenuineness of the community. Certificates of the\nPetitioner, Petitioner's brother, Petitioner's sister\nand also of her close relatives, as also her son to be\nissued as directed above, and pass appropriate\norders on or before 31.10.2019.”\n\n6. Para 7 is in two parts. The first part of the para 7\nsays that the necessary certificate be issued in favour of the\nson of the respondent herein and the second part says that\nafter the same is issued let there be a thorough inquiry at\nthe end of the State Level Scrutiny Committee whether the\nentire family belongs to the Hindu Konda Reddis\nCommunity (ST) or not.\n\n7. Caste Certificate seems to be a big big problem in\nthe State of Tamil Nadu. It appears that thousands of such\ncertificates have been issued certifying people to be\nmembers of the Hindu Konda Reddis Community falling\nwithin Scheduled Tribe.\n\n8. It is a different thing to say whether RDO could\nhave inquired into the genuineness of the claim or not. We\ndo not propose to get into this controversy for the present.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.9 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n9. However, we would like to ensure whether these\ncertificates are genuine or not. We would also like to know\nin what manner such caste certificates have been procured\nby thousands of people in the area.\n\n10. For the present, we do not level any allegations\nbut prima facie it appears to be a huge racket. This is\nsomething extremely dangerous.\n\n11. In such circumstances, we propose to pass an\ninterim order today.\n\n12. We are conscious of the fact that the State has\nbeen able to obtain an interim order by which the operation\nof the impugned judgment has been stayed. However, we\nmodify the order to the extent that let the State Level\nScrutiny Committee undertake an extensive inquiry into this\nissue at the earliest and file its report before us to enable us\nto proceed further in the matter. We direct the State Level\nScrutiny Committee to undertake this exercise at the earliest\nand file its appropriate report within six weeks from today\nwithout fail. The Report should be exhaustive supported by\nsome contemporaneous record and it should be in correct\nenglish.\n\n13. Once the report comes on record, we shall\nthereafter proceed to look into each of the petitions\nindependently and decide them on their own merits.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.10 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n14. It goes without saying that in the course of the\ninquiry all stake holders in other words all those who claim\nto be members of this Hindu Konda Reddis Community shall\nbe heard.\n\n15. The Committee shall undertake a fair, transparent\nand impartial inquiry without being influenced in any\nmanner by any of the observations made in the impugned\norder or by any other extraneous consideration including\nany observation made by this Court on merits in the present\norder.\n\n16. We expect the State level Scrutiny Committee to\nassist us in the right direction.\n\n17. Rest of the interim order shall continue to\noperate.\n\n18. The impugned order of the High Court is modified\nto the extent indicated above.\n\n19. List the matter(s) after the report of the State\nLevel Scrutiny Committee is received. ”.\n\n8. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, while hearing Appeal (C) No.27890 of\n\n2019, arising out of the impugned final judgment and order passed by this\n\nCourt, dated 22.04.2019 in W.P.No.11336 of 2019, wherein the writ\n\npetitioner has approached this Court for a direction to the official\n\nrespondents to issue community certificate to her son S.P.Yesvanth to the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.11 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\neffect that he belongs to the Hindu Konda Reddis Community (ST) in the\n\nlight of the Community Certificate issued in favour of the petitioner on\n\n30.06.1986. She has sought for a similar certificate for her son on\n\n20.10.2016, by enclosing necessary documents including Community\n\nCertificates of herself, her sister, her brother and other close relatives, which\n\ncame to be rejected by the official respondent therein. The counsel for the\n\npetitioner therein has submitted that a common impugned order was passed\n\nin respect of several individuals who applied along with the petitioner by\n\nassigning stereo-typed reasons and the respondent has summarily rejected\n\nthe petitioner's request. Considering the same, this Court, vide its order dated\n\n22.04.2019, has directed the respondents to issue community certificate to\n\nthe petitioner's son, which shall be sent to the State Level Scrutiny\n\nCommittee for verification of the genuineness of the community certificate\n\nalong with the community certificates of the petitioner, her sister, her\n\nbrother and other close relatives. The facts of the present writ petitions are\n\ntotally different to that of the writ petition cited by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in Appeal (C) No.27890 of 2019. In the present case on hand, the\n\npetitioners have rendered 37 years of service to the Government, and after\n\n__________\n\nPage No.12 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nattaining superannuation, the genuineness of the community certificates of\n\nthe petitioners have been questioned by the respondents, which this Court\n\nfeels is purely academic.\n\n9. A similar issue was considered by this Bench in W.P.No.31452 of\n\n2022, in which I was one of the parties to the said order. I allowed the claim\n\nmade by the petitioner therein, holding that the action of the respondent in\n\ninitiating a vigilance enquiry after the petitioner’s superannuation, and in\n\npassing the impugned order after an unexplained and inordinate delay of\n\nseven years, was not sustainable. It was observed that such delay could not\n\nbe construed as falling within a reasonable time and was therefore\n\nunjustifiable. However, the other learned Judge constituting the Division\n\nBench rendered a divergent view and dismissed the petitioner’s claim. In\n\nview of the difference of opinion, the writ petition was placed before a Third\n\nJudge for resolution of the point of divergence. The learned This Judge of\n\nthis Court, vide its order dated 20.09.2024, concurred with the views\n\nexpressed by me.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.13 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n10. It is also pertinent to note that in the decision rendered by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in\nUnion of India vs. S.Renuka (S.L.P.(C)\n\nNo.24458/2019\n) vide order dated 03.03.2023, the Hon'ble Apex Court has\n\nrecorded the submissions made by the learned senior counsel for the first\n\nrespondent, held that the respondent No.1, who served in the Railways has\n\nsuperannuated on 28.02.2022 and therefore, the exercise in this case would\n\nlargely be academic on the aspect of whether she belonged to the claimed\n\nScheduled Tribe category, and considering the above, closed the\n\nproceedings.\n\n11. It is seen from the records that the petitioners in W.P.Nos.24381 &\n\n24387 of 2025 have rendered nearly 37 years of service to the Government\n\nand attained superannuation in their service on 30.06.2021 and 31.12.2018\n\nrespectively. Therefore, questioning the genuineness of their community\n\ncertificates, after a long time, that too, after a lapse of more than nearly 4\n\nyears and 7 years respectively, after their retirement, is definitely uncalled\n\nfor.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.14 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n12. The Apex Court in the case of\nR.Sundaram vs. The Tamil Nadu\n\nState Level Scrutiny Committee and Others\ndated 17.03.2023, in Paragraph\n\nNo.16 held as follows:-\n\n“16. It has been explicitly stated by this court that the\nexercise of verification of community certificate must be\ncompleted expeditiously. In the present case, however, as has\nbeen mentioned above, there has been an inordinate and\nunexplained delay of 19 years, an amount of time which cannot\nbe fathomed, within the ambit of 'reasonable time'.”\nIn the present cases on hand, it can be seen that the petitioner in\n\nW.P.No.24381 of 2025 has entered government service in the 1984 and\n\nretired on 30.06.2021, after rendering 37 years of service. Likewise, the\n\npetitioner in W.P.No.24387 of 2025 has entered government service in the\n\n1981 and retired on 31.12.2018, also after rendering 37 years of service. The\n\ninordinate delay on the part of the respondents in initiating any enquiry into\n\nthe genuineness of the community certificates of the petitioners from the\n\ndates of their initial appointment until their respective dates of\n\nsuperannuation is highly unreasonable and cannot be justified under any\n\nacceptable standard of prompt administrative action.\n\n13. In yet another case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\n__________\n\nPage No.15 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nSLP(C) No.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023, was pleased to hold as under:\n\n“It is submitted that the respondent No.1 who served in\nthe Railways has superannuated on 28.02.2022 and therefore,\nthe exercise in this case would largely be academic on the\naspect of whether she belonged to the claimed Scheduled Tribe\ncategory. Considering the above, we deem it is appropriate to\norder for closure of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Special\nleave Petition stands disposed of.”\n\n14. The decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case\n\nof\nKumari Madhuri Patil vs. Additional Commissioner\n, reported in 1995\n\nAIR 94 weighs much importance in the cases on hand, had elaborately dealt\n\nwith the issue of community certificate and observed that as per\nArticle\n\n15(4)\nof the Constitution of India, it is for the State to make special\n\nprovisions for advancement of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nFurther, it was observed that in the light of\nArticle 16(1)\n, equality of\n\nopportunity to all citizens in matters of appointments to an office or a post\n\nunder the Union or a State Government or public undertakings etc., should\n\nbe ensured. For that purpose,\nArticle 16(4)\nempowers the State to make\n\nprovisions for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of classes of\n\ncitizens not adequately represented in the services under the State. The\n\n__________\n\nPage No.16 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court, in\nthe said judgment\nwhile issuing certain\n\nguidelines, insisted that the community certificate in respect of SC/ST\n\nshould be scrutinised at the earliest. For the sake of convenience, relevant\n\nparagraphs of the judgment are reproduced below:\n\n“It is, therefore, necessary that the certificates issued are\nscrutinised at the earliest and with utmost expedition and\npromptitude. For that purpose, it is necessary to streamline the\nprocedure for the issuance of social status certificates, their\nscrutiny and their approval, which may be the following:\n\n1. The application for grant of social status\ncertificate shall be made to the Revenue Sub-\n\nDivisional Officer and Deputy Collector or Deputy\nCommissioner and the certificate shall be issued by\nsuch officer rather than at the Officer, Taluk or\nMandal level.\n\n2. The parent, guardian or the candidate, as the\ncase may be, shall file an affidavit duly sworn and\nattested by a competent gazetted officer or non-\ngazetted officer with particulars of castes and sub-\ncastes, tribe, tribal community, parts or groups of\ntribes or tribal communities, the place from which he\noriginally hails from and other particulars as may be\nprescribed by the Directorate concerned.\n\n3. Application for verification of the caste\ncertificate by the Scrutiny Committee shall be filed at\nleast six months in advance before seeking admission\ninto educational institution or an appointment to a\npost.\n\n4. All the State Governments shall constitute a\nCommittee of three officers, namely, (1) an Additional\nor Joint Secretary or any officer higher in rank of the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.17 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nDirector of the department concerned, (11) the\nDirector, Social Welfare/Tribal Welfare/Backward\nClass Welfare, as the case may be, and (III) in the case\nof Scheduled Castes another officer who has intimate\nknowledge in the verification and issuance of the\nsocial status certificates.\n\nIn the case of the Scheduled Tribes, the Research Officer\nwho has intimate knowledge in identifying the tribes, tribal\ncommunities, parts of or groups of tribes or tribal communities.\n\n5. Each Directorate should constitute a vigilance cell\nconsisting of Senior Deputy Superintendent of Police in over-\nall charge and such number of Police Inspectors to investigate\ninto the social status claims. The Inspector would go to the\nlocal place of residence and original place from which the\ncandidate hails and usually resides or in case of migration to\nthe town or city, the place from which he originally hailed\nfrom. The vigilance officer should personally verify and collect\nall the facts of the social status claimed by the candidate or the\nparent or guardian, as the case may be. He should also examine\nthe school records, birth registration, if any.

The Director concerned, on receipt of the report from\nthe vigilance officer if he found the claim for social status to be\n\"not genuine\" or 'doubtful' or spurious or falsely or wrongly\nclaimed, the Director concerned should issue show-cause\nnotice supplying a copy of the report of the vigilance officer to\n\n__________\n\nPage No.18 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nthe candidate by a registered post with acknowledgement due\nor through the head of the educational institution concerned in\nwhich the candidate is studying or employed. The notice should\nindicate that the representation or reply, if any, would be made\nwithin two weeks from the date of the receipt of the notice and\nin no case on request not more than 30 days from the date of\nthe receipt of the notice.”\n\n15. Keeping in mind the above judgment of the Apex Court, an Office\n\nMemorandum was issued on 24.12.2020 by the Joint Secretary, Lok Sabha\n\nSecretariat. The relevant portions of the Office Memorandum are extracted\n\nhereunder:\n\n“...It is pertinent to mention that the\nDepartments/Banks/PSUs have not adhered to the above\nmentioned guidelines of DoP&T and CVC and also it is not in\nconformity with the Hon'ble Supreme Court judgment\ndelivered vide\nKumari Madhuri Patil Vs. Addl\n. Commissioner\nin 1995 AIR 94, 1994 SSC (6) 241 Order dated 02.09.1994\nsince this judgment can only be implemented in prospective.\n\n2. Here, it is pertinent to bring to your notice DoP&T\nOM no.230/08/2005-AVD II dated 25.05.2005, which clearly\nstates the following:-\n\n“Government has, therefore decided that a\ndetailed verification of all such certificates produced\nbefore various appointing authorities since 1995 be\ncarried. The CVOs are requested to initiate this task by\ncollecting the details of all those who had been\nappointed in the Ministries/Departments or agencies\nincluding CPSUs with which they are concerned, since\n\n__________\n\nPage No.19 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n1995 on the strength of ST certificates.\n\n2. Keeping in view the above mentioned facts, it is\nrequested that the concerned State Level Scrutiny Committee\nbe directed to verify the ST caste certificates of only those\nemployees who were appointed after the year 1995 and the\nprocess of verification should be completed within two\nmonths. The Action Taken Report in this regard may be please\nbe forwarded to this Secretariat at the earliest but not later than\n18.02.2021 so that the same may be placed before the\nCommittee.”\n\n16. The above referred Office Memorandum makes it very clear that\n\ncommunity certificates of employees, who were inducted into Government\n\nService after 1995 can alone be subjected for scrutiny / verification. To be\n\nmore precise, it is incumbent on the employers / authorities to conduct\n\nverifications ideally at the time of an employee's entry into service, so as to\n\nensure the accuracy and integrity of personnel records.\n\n17. In furtherance thereof, the Government of India, Ministry of\n\nPersonnel, PG & Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training issued\n\ninstructions dated 21.10.2022 to all State / UT Governments, insisting upon\n\nthe need for timely verification of Caste / Community certificates, indicating\n\nas follows:\n\n__________\n\nPage No.20 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n“3. In this regard, it is reiterated that the responsibility\nfor the issue and verification of Caste Certificate lies with the\nconcerned State / UT Government. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt, vide its order dated 02.09.1994 in the matter of\nKumari\nMadhuri Patil vs. Addl\n. Commissioner, has laid down the\ndetailed guidelines for effective verification of the Caste\nCertificates of the employees by the State Government, so that\nno person, on the basis of fake caste certificate, may secure\nemployment wrongfully in the Government.”\n\n18. On a reading of the aforesaid instructions, it is apparent that the\n\nGovernment of India is very keen in curbing the wrongful entry of an\n\nemployee in the Government Service based on the fake community\n\ncertificate and issued instructions to all State / UT Governments for\n\nverification of the community certificates at the earliest point of time.\n\n19. In an another Office Memorandum dated 30.11.2021, issued by\n\nthe Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, PG & Pensions,\n\nDepartment of Pension & Pensioner's Welfare strictly instructed concerned\n\nDepartments that unless departmental or judicial proceedings are pending\n\nagainst a retired employee, the pensionary / retirement benefits due to the\n\nretiring employee should not be withheld or delay on the ground of\n\npendency of verification of caste certificate.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.21 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n20. Learned counsel for the petitioners drew our attention to the\n\nGovernment Order dated 15.10.2012 issued by the Government of Tamil\n\nNadu, constituting a District Level Vigilance Committee and State Level\n\nScrutiny Committee to verify the genuineness of the community certificates.\n\nVigilance Cells at Chennai, Salem, Trichy and Madurai were also formed to\n\nverify the community status and submit a report to the Committee. In the\n\nGovernment Order, the functions of the Vigilance Cells have been\n\nenumerated and a time frame has also been fixed for completion of enquiry,\n\nwhich reads as follows:\n\n“vii) The inquiry should be completed as expeditiously\nas possible preferably by day to day proceedings within such\nperiod not exceeding two months. If after inquiry, the\ncompetent committee finds the claim to be false or spurious,\nthey should pass an order cancelling the certificate issued and\nconfiscate the same. It should communicate within one month\nfrom the date of the conclusion of the proceedings the result of\nenquiry to the parent / guardian and the applicant.”\n\n21. In the light of various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nand also the guidelines / instructions / GO issued by both Government of\n\nIndia and State Government, from time to time, we are of the view that the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.22 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nrespondents cannot keep the matter pending for months / years together in\n\nthe garb of verification of community certificates, especially when there is a\n\nspecific time frame fixed for completion of such verification.\n\n22. In the present cases, the petitioners have entered Government\n\nservice and subsequently, got retired, after rendering nearly 37 years of\n\nservice. Therefore, the verification of the community certificates at this\n\nbelated stage will be a futile exercise and is not in consonance with the\n\nvarious judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the guidelines issued\n\nby the Government. Hence, we have no other option, but to set aside the\n\nimpugned proceedings.\n\n23. Learned counsel for the petitioners would state that the petitioners,\n\nat this age are finding difficult to appear for enquiry before the officials and\n\ntherefore, the petitioners would state that they are willing to surrender their\n\ncommunity certificates and they will not claim concessions to their children\n\non the basis of their community certificate, which is given solely to avoid\n\nfurther harassment at the hands of the respondents under the pretext of\n\n__________\n\nPage No.23 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nverification proceedings initiated after superannuation.\n\n24. It is relevant to extract the relevant paragraphs of the affidavits of\n\nundertaking dated 30.06.2025 submitted by the petitioners, which read as\n\nfollows:\n\nW.P.No.24381 of 2025:\n\n\"2) 1 submit that I belong to the Konda reddis\ncommunity (ST) Based on the community certificate in the\nyear 1972 issued in my favour, I was appointed in the\nVijaya Bank in the year 1984. 1 reached superannuation\nafter completing 37 years of service on 30.06.2021.

He has yet to\nbe sanctioned gratuity, earned leave encashment and full\npension/commutation, for which I am taking separate legal\naction.\n\n3) I submit that I have two sons both are working in private\ncompany. I have not obtained community certificates for\nthem to the effect that they belong to ST.\n\n4) I, humbly submit that I am presently aged 64 years.

Recording the above I pray that this\nHon'ble Court may pass appropriate orders restraining the\nrespondents from conducting any verification into my caste\nand pass such other order or orders as may be deemed fit.\nW.P.No.24381 of 2025:\n\n2) I submit that I belong to the Konda reddis\ncommunity (ST) Based on the community certificate in the\nyear 1980 issued in my favour, I was appointed in the\nSouthern Railway in the year 1981.

Once a government servant has retired and completed all service\n\nverifications during his tenure, reopening of the community certificate issue\n\namounts to re-litigation. It is pertinent to note that the employer accepted the\n\ncommunity certificates at the time of appointment of the petitioners and did\n\nnot raise any issue during the long years of service of the petitioners. A\n\nretired employee has a legitimate expectation that benefits earned during\n\nservice will not be taken away arbitrarily after retirement. When a\n\ncommunity certificate is issued and accepted for decades, and no concerns\n\nare raised, then there is a presumption that such certificates are valid and the\n\ninformation contained within it are accurate. Post-retirement verification of a\n\ncommunity certificate is inherently burdensome, as it involves practical\n\ndifficulties such as loss of records, fading memories, and changed\n\ncircumstances, making it unjustly onerous for the individual to establish the\n\ncertificate’s authenticity.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.26 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n26. In view of the above, this Court is inclined to pass the following\n\norders:-\n\n(i) With regard to W.P.No.24381 of 2025, the\nimpugned Summons (91BNSS) dated 16.05.2025 of the 2nd\nrespondent and the Show Cause Notice No.12597/CV-\n\n3(2)/2012-9 dated 03.06.2025 of the 1st respondent, are\nhereby set aside;\n\n(ii) With regard to W.P.No.24387 of 2025, the\nimpugned summon of the 2nd respondent in\nC.No.76/DSP/SC/ST VIGILANCE CELL/CBE/17 dated\n17.06.2025, is hereby set aside. In view of setting aside of the\nimpugned summon dated 17.06.2025, a direction is issued to\nthe 3rd respondent to sanction full pension along with\ncommutation, gratuity, earned leave, encashment and all\nother terminal benefits to the petitioner within a period of two\nweeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order: &\n\n(iii) The petitioners shall surrender their community\ncertificates (if not already surrendered) to the concerned\nOfficials on due acknowledgment.

He was appointed in the year\n\n1984 in Vijaya Bank (now Bank of Baroda). After completing 37 years of\n\nservice, he reached superannuation on 30.06.2021. He has been sanctioned\n\nwith his own contribution of Provident Fund amounts and provisional\n\npension and yet to be sanctioned gratuity, earned leave encashment and full\n\npension/commutation, for which, he is taking separate legal action. While\n\nthat being so, on 16.05.2025, the second respondent issued a notice calling\n\nhim to appear for enquiry on 20.05.2025. He was shocked to receive the\n\nsame, especially, as it seems to make verification of his community\n\ncertificate issued 45 years ago and he has retired from service and he is now\n\naged about 64 years. Based on the same, the first respondent has issued a\n\nshow cause notice to him on 03.06.2025, aggrieved by which, he has filed\n\nthe present writ petition.\n\n6. The case of the petitioner in W.P.No.24387 of 2025 is that he\n\nbelongs to Konda Reddis (ST) community. He was issued with a community\n\ncertificate on 02.02.1980 by the Tahsildar.

He has been\n\nsanctioned with provisional pension, but, yet to be sanctioned other benefits\n\nsuch as full pension, gratuity, earned leave encashment, etc., for which, he\n\nhas given representation to the third respondent and the same is pending.\n\nWhile that being so, on 17.06.2025, the second respondent issued a notice\n\ncalling him to appear for enquiry on 26.02.2025.

Aggrieved by the same, he has filed the present writ\n\npetition.\n\n7. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that this\n\nCourt in a series of judgments has consistently taken a view that after\n\nretirement of an employee, the process of verification will be academic and\n\nhas restrained the committee/verifying authority from proceeding further.\n\nThe petitioners have not been summoned for more than 40 years for\n\nverification of certificate and in the interregnum reached superannuation.\n\nTherefore, he would submit that respondents may be refrained from\n\n__________\n\nPage No.37 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nconducting verification of the petitioners' caste status, since they have retired\n\nfrom service. The petitioners have also filed affidavits of undertaking,\n\nrespectively, stating that they will not make any claim or concession based\n\non their community certificate.\n\n8.

We have considered the submissions made on either side and\n\nperused the available records.\n\n11. The points for consideration of legal issues arises in these\n\npetitions are:\n\n1.Whether the verification of community status of Government\n\nemployee can be continued even after the retirement of employee and\nwhether an enquiry as to the genuineness of Community Certificate\nwould be purely academic?\n\n2.Whether a time limit should be prescribed for initiating\n\n__________\n\nPage No.40 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nproceedings for verification of community status or communicate\ncertificate of an employee?\n\n12. It is to be noted that the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court\n\nhas already been dealt with the above legal issues in W.P.No.9995 of 2021\n\n& 12700 of 2022 and passed an order dated 12.04.2024. The relevant\n\nparagraphs are extracted hereunder:\n\n''9.While hearing the lengthy arguments of not only\nthe learned counsels appearing for the petitioners in these three\ncases, but also several other counsels who have raised same legal\nissues in the writ petitions, the learned counsel appearing for the\nemployers in all these three cases, and Mr.P.Kumaresan, learned\nAdditional Advocate General, appearing for the official\nrespondents, this Court was requested to consider the following\nlegal issues :\n\n(A)Whether the verification of community status of\nGovernment employee can be continued even after the retirement\nof employee and whether an enquiry as to the genuineness of\nCommunity Certificate would be purely academic as observed by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India and another v.\n\nS.Renuka and others [SLP (C) No.24458/2019 dated\n03.03.2023] ?\n\n(B)Whether the verification of Community Certificate or\ncommunity status of any individual who secured employment\n\n__________\n\nPage No.41 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nunder SC or ST quota before 1995, can be permitted/directed ?\n\n(C)Whether a time limit should be prescribed for initiating\nproceedings for verification of community status or Community\nCertificate of an employee ?\n\n(D)Whether terminal benefits of employees can be\nwithheld on account of pendency of proceedings for verification\nas to the genuineness of Community Certificate or community\nstatus of an employee who secure employment under SC or ST\nquota ?\n\nIssue No.(A): Whether the verification of community\nstatus of Government employee can be continued even after the\nretirement of employee and whether an enquiry as to the\ngenuineness of Community Certificate would be purely\nacademic as observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nUnion\nof India and another v. S.Renuka and others\n[SLP (C)\nNo.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023] ?\n\n20.Therefore, we are unable to follow the three\njudgments relied upon by the learned counsels appearing for the\npetitioners, viz.,\nUnion of India and another v. S.Renuka and\nothers\n[SLP (C) No.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023],\nV.Vallinayagam v. The Chairman, State Level Scrutiny\nCommittee-II, Secretariat, Chennai [W.P.No.27823 of 2023,\ndated 25.09.2023] and V.Shanmugaraj v. The Chairman, State\nLevel Scrutiny Committee-II, Secretariat, Chennai\n[W.P.No.29976 of 2023, dated 03.11.2023], in view of the\ncategorical pronouncement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\njudgments above referred to, on principles. Ratio of judgment\n\n__________\n\nPage No.42 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nalone is binding. It is only the reason assigned in the ratio\ndecidendi of a judgment.\n\nThe judgment of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in\nS.Renuka\n's case without considering the spirit of\nseveral judgments including larger Bench of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt, need not be followed.\n\nTherefore, we have no hesitation to\nhold that those three judgments may not be binding precedents as\nthey were rendered without noticing the binding precedents on\nprinciples reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of\n\nKumari Madhuri Patil, R.Vishwanatha Pillai, and Food\nCorporation of India\n(supra). Verification once started shall\ncontinue till its logical end and retirement of an employee during\nenquiry as to his community status does not affect the\nproceedings.\n\nIssue No.(B): Whether the verification of Community\nCertificate or community status of any individual who secured\nemployment under SC or ST quota before 1995, can be\npermitted/directed ?\n\n32.When the Hon'ble Supreme Court has rendered a\njudgment which is reiterated in several judgments of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, there cannot be an Office Memorandum which\nwould whittle down the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court\nwhich is binding as a law declared in terms of\nArticle 141\nof the\nConstitution. When the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is\nbinding not only as a precedent, but as a law declared, there\ncannot be an official instruction on the interpretation of the\njudgment so as to limit its operation. This is the mischief that was\n\n__________\n\nPage No.43 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\ndone by way of the Office Memorandum dated 24.12.2020.\n\n33.Therefore, this Court is unable to agree with the\nsubmission of the learned counsels appearing for the petitioners\nthat there cannot be verification of Community Certificates which\nwere obtained prior to 1995. Equally, merely because\nappointment was before 1995, it cannot be said that verification\nin those cases cannot be done, as rightly pointed out by Hon'ble\nMrs. Justice N.Mala while expressing dissenting view that this\nCourt cannot declare or legitimise fraud committed by a person\nmerely because he obtained the false certificate or got\nemployment based on a false claim before 1995. It is settled that\nfraud vitiates every solemn transaction and there cannot be a\nlegal sanction to condone fraud if it is committed before 1995.\nTherefore, irrespective of date of Community Certificate or date\nof appointment before or after 1995, verification as to the\ngenuineness of Community Certificate or claim as to one's\ncommunity status shall continue to its logical end.\n\nIssue No.(C): Whether a time limit should be prescribed\nfor initiating proceedings for verification of community status\nor Community Certificate of an employee ?\n\n37.As it was pointed out by the Constitution Bench of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in\nState of Maharashtra v. Milind\n\nreported in (2001) 1 SCC 4, which is clarified by later judgments,\nno person can take advantage of the Scheduled Tribes Order for\nany other purpose, merely because he has been shown indulgence\nto complete his course or has secured an appointment by\n\n__________\n\nPage No.44 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nproducing false certificate. Mere delay in making a reference\ndoes not invalidate the order on scrutiny by competent authority.\nSince we have held that verification can continue even after\nretirement of an employee, this Court finds no logic to accept the\narguments of learned counsels appearing for the petitioners that\nthere must be time limit or limitation to be prescribed.\n\nIssue No.(D): Whether terminal benefits of employees\ncan be withheld on account of pendency of proceedings for\nverification as to the genuineness of Community Certificate or\ncommunity status of an employee who secure employment\nunder SC or ST quota ?\n\n38.This Court, in several cases, finds that the delay is\ncaused mainly due to the recalcitrant and non-cooperative\nattitude of the employees who refuse to cooperate with the\nenquiry under some pretext or the other. Despite the Government\nspending huge money for establishing a machinery to verify the\ngenuineness of the certificates or the claims as to one's\ncommunity status, the manner in which the employees adopt\ndelaying tactics, precludes us from holding that the employee\nshould be given benefit of his employment or terminal benefits\neven during the pendency of verification of community status.\n\n39.In a case where the verification was initiated just\nbefore retirement on the basis of a stale claim or a complaint\nwithout any verifiable material, the terminal benefits of an\nemployee cannot be withheld merely because the enquiry has\nbeen commenced. In all other cases, where delay is attributable to\n\n__________\n\nPage No.45 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nthe conduct of employee, there must be some protection to the\nemployer in the matter of disbursement of retirement benefits.\nDepending upon the individual cases, this Court can direct\nprovisional pension to be disbursed to the employee subject to the\noutcome of verification process either by State Level Scrutiny\nCommittee or by the District Level Vigilance Committee. Once a\nperson is retired, the verification process cannot be delayed\nbeyond three months. If the employee seeks unnecessary\nadjournment or refuses to appear for an enquiry, he need not be\ngiven provisional pension or retirement benefits without giving\nhim a clean chit as to the genuineness of his claim.''\n\n13. It is apposite to mention that with regard to the legal issues as\n\nto whether the Office Memorandum dated 24.12.2020 prohibits the scrutiny\n\nof caste certificate issued prior to 1995 and there can be any limitation for\n\nreviewing the act of fraud on constitution, the Hon'ble Division Bench of\n\nthis Court in W.P.No.4484 of 2021 vide order dated 24.08.2023, has\n\ndelivered a split verdict. In view of the same, the case was placed before the\n\nlearned third Judge to decide the legal issues. The learned third Judge vide\n\norder dated 16.11.2023, had formulated the following points for\n\nconsideration:\n\n''(i) Whether the O.M., dated 24.12.2020 prohibits\n\n__________\n\nPage No.46 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nscrutiny of caste certificate issued prior to 1995?\n\n(ii) Whether the observation in the said O.M., that the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nKumari Madhuri\nPatel Vs. Additional Commissioner\ncan be implemented only\nprospectively is legally sustainable?\n\n(iii) Can there be any limitation for reviewing act of\nfraud on constitution?''\n\n14. The relevant paragraphs of the aforesaid order, in which\n\nanswers to the above questions are given, are extracted hereunder:\n\n''35. In the light of the above discussion and\nreasoning, the questions framed for consideration are\nanswered as below:-\n\n(i) Whether the O.M., dated 24.12.2020 prohibits\nscrutiny of caste certificate issued prior to 1995?\n\nNO. The observations made in the said OM is\nmisconception of the earlier OM dated 25/05/2005 and the\nCVC circular is general in nature. There can be no\nexecutive order prohibiting enquiry of fake or false caste\ncertificate which is not only a misconduct in the parlance of\nservice jurisprudence but a crime under penal law.\n\n(ii) Whether the observation in the said O.M., that\nthe decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kumari\n\n__________\n\nPage No.47 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nMadhuri Patel Vs. Additional Commissioner can be\nimplemented only prospectively is legally sustainable?\n\nNo. Any interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment\ncontrary to the spirit of the judgment is non est in law as per\nthe decision of the constitutional Bench of the Supreme\nCourt in its judgement rendered in Commissioner of Central\nExercise -vs- Rathan Melting and wire Industries ( 2008\n(13) SCC 1).\n\n(iii) Can there be any limitation for reviewing act of\nfraud on constitution? Fraud vitiates every solemn Act. By\nexecutive orders limitation cannot be prescribed by acts of\nfraud committed against constitution and laws. The\npetitioner herein whose birth register entry made in the year\n1958 show he belong to Hindu Man Ottan community. He\nhad obtained community certificate from Tahsildar, Attur at\nSalem District as if he belongs to Kattunaiyakan community\nwhich is a Schedule Tribe. His ST certificate cancelled by\nthe District Collector after enquiry as early as 1992 (i.e)\neven before Maduri Patil judgment. However the petitioner\nwas able to manover, by filing writ petitions in sequences.\nHe had not cooperated for enquiry conducted by State Level\nScrutiny Committee. Enquiry by a senior police officer of\nthe rank of DSP attached to the special vigilance cell for\nSC/ST had unravelled several truth about the dishonest act\nof the petitioner which independently requires prosecution\napart from confiscation of his false community certificate\n\n__________\n\nPage No.48 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nbesides departmental proceedings.\n\n36. As a result, the judgement of the Hon'ble Mrs.\nJustice N.Mala is confirmed. The Writ Petition stands\ndismissed.\n\n37. Since the petitioner has prevented the valuable\nright of public office of a Schedule Tribe Member, it is open\nto the State to take necessary penal action against the\npetitioner for offences under\nIPC\nand also under\nSection 3\n(1)\nza (E) of SC /ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The\nsecond respondent/Employer is permitted to proceed\nagainst the petitioner for necessary action for recovery in\naccordance with law. No costs. Consequently, connected\nMiscellaneous Petitions are closed.''\n\n15. Feeling aggrieved by the above order dated 16.11.2023 in\n\nW.P.No.4484 of 2021, the writ petitioner therein has preferred the Special\n\nLeave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SLP. (CIVIL) Diary\n\nNo. 50747/2023, in which, the Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated\n\n15.12.2023, has passed the following order:\n\n''Delay condoned.\n\nIssue notice to the respondents, returnable in six\nweeks. Until the next date of listing, operation of para 37 of\nthe impugned order dated 16.11.2023 shall remain stayed.\n\nWe further grant liberty to the respondents to take note\n\n__________\n\nPage No.49 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nof the judgment in\nChairman and Managing Director, Food\nCorporation of India and Others v.

A careful perusal of the above order dated 15.12.2023 shows\n\nthat paragraph no.37 of the order dated 16.11.2023 passed in W.P.No.4484\n\nof 2021 alone has been stayed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.\n\n17. It is pertinent to mention that with regard to the issuance of\n\ncommunity certificate based of the community certificate already issued to\n\nthe parents and relatives has already been dealt with by the Hon'ble Division\n\nBench of this Court in W.P.No.11336 of 2019 vide order dated 22.04.2019.\n\nAggrieved over the same, the State has also preferred an appeal before the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No.27890 of\n\n2019 .\n\n__________\n\nPage No.50 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\n18. It is most relevant to cite that the Hon'ble Division Bench of\n\nthis Court in W.P.No.11336 of 2019 vide order dated 22.04.2019 had issued\n\ndirection to provide community certificate based on the father's and\n\nrelatives' community certificates to the writ petitioner's minor son therein\n\n(Hindu Konda Reddis (ST) Community). The relevant portion of the said\n\norder is extracted hereunder:\n\n''2. It is the case of the petitioner that her family belongs to\nKonda Reddis Community, which is classified as a Scheduled Tribe\nCommunity. The petitioner was issued with Community Certificate\non 30.06.1986 by the Tahsildar, Mettur Dam. The petitioner's own\nbrother B.Vinothkumar was also issued with a Community\nCertificate in the year 1989 by the Tahsildar. All of them, including\nthe petitioner, had been described as belonging to the Konda Reddis\nCommunity in their educational and land records. It is also stated\nthat the petitioner's close relatives possess Community Certificates\ndescribing them as belonging to Konda Reddis Community.\n\n3. On 20.10.2016, the petitioner applied to the respondent for\nissuance of Community Certificate for her minor child, viz.,\nS.P.Yesvanth, by enclosing necessary documents including\nCommunity Certificates of herself, her sister, her brother and other\nclose relatives. By the impugned order dated 23.03.2018, the\npetitioner's application stated above, was rejected. Hence, the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.51 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\npetitioner has filed the present Writ Petition for the relief stated\nsupra.\n\n4. When the Writ Petition is taken up for hearing, the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner made his submissions adverting to the\naverments made in the affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition.\n\n5. This Court also heard the submissions of the learned\nSpecial Government Pleader appearing for the respondent on the\nabove aspects.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that by the\nimpugned order, a common order has been passed in respect of\nseveral individuals who applied along with the petitioner by\nassigning stereo-typed reasons and the respondent has summarily\nrejected the petitioner's request. However, learned counsel for the\npetitioner submitted that the respondent/RDO has made discreet\nenquiry behind the back of the petitioner and placed reliance on such\nmaterials. Learned counsel for the petitioner further stated that the\nimpugned order was passed by the RDO, Sankagiri, who was holding\nthe additional charge of the post of RDO, Mettur Dam.\n\n7. Be that as it may. As on date, the Community Certificates\nissued to the petitioner, her sister, her brother and also of her close\nrelatives, were not cancelled and when they were not cancelled,\nthere cannot be any impediment in issuing the Community\nCertificate to the petitioner's son. Accordingly, the respondent-\n\nRDO Mettur Dam, Salem District, is directed to issue a Community\nCertificate to the petitioner's son S.P.Yesvanth, within a period of\ntwo weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\n__________\n\nPage No.52 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nThereafter, the respondent-RDO, Mettur Dam, Salem District is\ndirected to refer the said Community Certificate of the petitioner,\npetitioner's brother, petitioner's sister and also her close relatives\nand also of her son to be issued as directed above, to the State Level\nScrutiny Committee for verification of the genuineness of the same.\nThe State Level Scrutiny Committee shall verify the genuineness of\nthe Community Certificates of the petitioner, petitioner's brother,\npetitioner's sister and also of her close relatives, as also her son to\nbe issued as directed above, and pass appropriate orders on or\nbefore 31.10.2019.\n\n8. With the above observations and directions, this Writ\nPetition is disposed of. No Costs.''\n\n19. Aggrieved over the above order passed in W.P.No.11336 of\n\n2019, the Sub Collector/Revenue Divisional Officer has preferred a Petition\n\nbefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Petition for Petition for Special Leave\n\nto Appeal (C) No.27890 of 2019. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide order\n\ndated 25.02.2025, has passed the following order:\n\n''4. This litigation has something to do with Caste Certificate.\nIt is the case of the respondent herein that she belongs to Hindu\nKonda Reddis Community (Scheduled Tribe).\n\n5. She applied for a caste certificate for her son. The same\n\n__________\n\nPage No.53 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nwas declined after an inquiry undertaken by Revenue Divisional\nOfficer (for short the “RDO”). In such circumstances, the\nrespondent preferred a writ petition in the High Court. The High\ncourt disposed of the writ petition observing the following in para\n7:-\n\n“7. Be that as it may. As on date, the Community\nCertificates issued to the Petitioner, her sister, her\nbrother and also of her close relatives, were not cancelled\nand when they were not cancelled, there cannot be any\nimpediment in issuing the Community Certificate to the\nPetitioner's son. Accordingly, the Respondent RDO\nMettur Dam, Salem District, is directed to issue a\nCommunity Certificate to the Petitioner's son S.P.\nYesvanth, within a period of two weeks from the date of\nreceipt of a copy of this order. Thereafter, the\nRespondent-RDO, Mettur Dam, Salem District is directed\nto refer the said Community Certificate of the Petitioner,\nPetitioner's brother, Petitioner's sister and also her close\nrelatives and .also of her son to be issued as directed\nabove, to the State Level Scrutiny Committee for\nverification of the genuineness of the same. The State\nLevel Scrutiny Committee shall verify the genuineness of\nthe community.

Para 7 is in two parts. The first part of the para 7 says that\nthe necessary certificate be issued in favour of the son of the\nrespondent herein and the second part says that after the same is\nissued let there be a thorough inquiry at the end of the State Level\nScrutiny Committee whether the entire family belongs to the Hindu\nKonda Reddis Community (ST) or not.\n\n7. Caste Certificate seems to be a big big problem in the State\nof Tamil Nadu. It appears that thousands of such certificates have\nbeen issued certifying people to be members of the Hindu Konda\nReddis Community falling within Scheduled Tribe.\n\n8. It is a different thing to say whether RDO could have\ninquired into the genuineness of the claim or not. We do not propose\nto get into this controversy for the present.\n\n9. However, we would like to ensure whether these\ncertificates are genuine or not. We would also like to know in what\nmanner such caste certificates have been procured by thousands of\npeople in the area.\n\n10. For the present, we do not level any allegations but\nprima facie it appears to be a huge racket. This is something\nextremely dangerous.\n\n11. In such circumstances, we propose to pass an interim\norder today.\n\n12.

We direct the\nState Level Scrutiny Committee to undertake this exercise at the\nearliest and file its appropriate report within six weeks from today\nwithout fail. The Report should be exhaustive supported by some\ncontemporaneous record and it should be in correct English.\n\n13. Once the report comes on record, we shall thereafter\nproceed to look into each of the petitions independently and decide\nthem on their own merits.\n\n14. It goes without saying that in the course of the inquiry\nall stake holders in other words all those who claim to be members\nof this Hindu Konda Reddis Community shall be heard.\n\n15. The Committee shall undertake a fair, transparent and\nimpartial inquiry without being influenced in any manner by any\nof the observations made in the impugned order or by any other\nextraneous consideration including any observation made by this\nCourt on merits in the present order.\n\n16. We expect the State level Scrutiny Committee to assist us\nin the right direction.\n\n17. Rest of the interim order shall continue to operate.\n\n18. The impugned order of the High Court is modified to the\nextent indicated above.''\n\n20. Further, the Honb'le Apex Court in the said Special Leave to\n\nAppeal (C) No.27890 of 2019 vide dated 02.06.2015 has passed the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.56 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nfollowing order:\n\n“ 1. Let I.A. Nos. 135459 of 2025 and 135460 of 2025 be\nplaced before the appropriate Bench subject to approval of\nHon’ble the Chief Justice of India.\n\n2. Considering that the Bench which has passed the\nearlier orders in the present matters is not available during the\npartial Court working days, the time allowed for submission of\nthe report to the State Level Scrutiny Committee by this Court\nvide order dated 25.02.2025 shall stand extended by a further\nperiod of three months.\n\n3. Accordingly, I.A. No.93854 of 2025 seeking extension\nof time is allowed.''\n\n21. From the reading of the above order, it is clear that the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has issued directions to the State Level Scrutiny Committee\n\nin paragraph nos.14 and 15 to undertake a fair, transparent and impartial\n\ninquiry without being influenced in any manner by any of the observations\n\nmade by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n22. It is brought to the notice of this Court that the Hon'ble Division\n\nBench of this Court by order dated 27.03.2024 in W.P.No.31452 of 2022,\n\nhad passed a dissenting order. Thereafter, the issue was decided by the\n\n__________\n\nPage No.57 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nlearned third Judge of this Court vide order dated 20.09.2024. The facts of\n\nthat case are that the petitioner therein was issued with the community\n\ncertificate by the Tahsildar, Mettur, on 14.09.1978, based on which, he was\n\nappointed as Time Scale Clerk in the Department of Telecommunication on\n\n07.09.1979 and he was terminated from service vide order dated 01.06.1984\n\non the basis of the letter of the Collector and thereafter, the petitioner therein\n\nchallenged the same before this Court and the same was transferred to the\n\nCentral Administrative Tribunal in T.A.No.6 of 1992, which was allowed on\n\n16.03.1994. When the District Level Vigilance Committee attempted to\n\nverify the petitioner's community certificate, he had challenged the same in\n\nW.P.No.6404 of 2004 on the ground that the District Level Vigilance\n\nCommittee did not have jurisdiction to verify the community certificate. The\n\nsaid writ petition came to be allowed stating that the competent authority\n\nwas the State Level Scrutiny Committee. Meanwhile, the petitioner therein\n\nsuperannuated from service on 30.11.2014. After superannuation, the\n\npetitioner therein had received summons from the Vigilance Cell for enquiry\n\nin February 2019. Finally, the Tamil Nadu State Level Scrutiny Committee-\n\nIII had canceled the community certificate of the petitioner's therein vide\n\n__________\n\nPage No.58 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\norder dated 17.08.2021, aggrieved by which, a writ petition came to be filed\n\nby the petitioner therein. In the instant case on hand, after retiring from their\n\nservice, the second respondent has issued summons for appearance of the\n\npetitioners to conduct enquiry with regard to the genuineness of their\n\ncommunity certificates. The facts of the present case is entirely different\n\nfrom the facts of the case involved in the aforesaid writ petition in\n\nW.P.No.31452 of 2022.\n\n23. It is to be noted that the State Government of Tamil Nadu has\n\nconstituted the District Level Vigilance Committee and State Level Scrutiny\n\nCommittee and also issued guidelines to verify the genuineness of the\n\ncommunity certificate issued to the persons belonging to the SC & ST vide\n\nGovernment Order in G.O.Ms.No.106 dated 15.10.2012 (Adi Dravidar and\n\nTribal Welfare (CV- I) Department), the relevant portion of which, reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n“In order to protect the welfare of the genuine Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes people from the false claimants, the\nGovernment have been examining the matter to frame suitable\nguidelines based on the guidelines issued by Supreme Court of India\n\n__________\n\nPage No.59 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nin\nMadhuri Patil and another Vs Additional Commissioner, Tribal\nDevelopment and others\nto suit the conditions prevailing in Tamil\nNadu, so that they could work out in a systematic manner without\nfacing any difficulty in its implementation. Accordingly in\nsupersession of the orders and guidelines issued on the subject, the\nGovernment have issued orders in the G.O. 5th cited modified the\nconstitution of the District Level Vigilance Committee and State\nLevel Scrutiny Committee as well as their functions as detailed\ntherewith.\n\n2. However, as per the Supreme Court direction, the\nVigilance Cells have not been constituted to verify the community\nstatus of the persons belonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\nTribes and to submit its report to the District Level Vigilance\nCommittee/State Level Scrutiny Committee. Hence the District Level\nVigilance Committees/State Level Scrutiny Committee utilizes the\nservices of the Revenue Officials such as Tahsildars/Revenue\nDivisional Officers for making spot enquiry about the individual’s\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes community status going to their\nplace and submits the reports to the competent Committee.\n\n3. Whileso, the Hon’ble Bench of Madras High Court in\nvarious Writ Petition Nos. 20277/2011, 17002/2011, 25148/2011\nfiled by Tvl. P. Vinoth, S. Saraswathi and V. Sampangiramiah\nrespectively has set aside the proceedings of the State Level Scrutiny\nCommittee when the Community Certificate was declared as not\ngenuine stating that the State Level Scrutiny Committee has not\nobtained the spot enquiry report of the Vigilance Cells as directed\n\n__________\n\nPage No.60 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nby the Supreme Court and also directed that it is high time that the\nGovernment should take note of the same and constitute vigilance\ncells with qualified personnel to decide about the communal status\nof the candidates so as to head off the repetition of such sort of\ndecisions given by the State Level Scrutiny Committee in a half –\nhearted manner”. Further in W.P. No.16325 of 2012 and M.P. No.\n1 of 2012 filed by Thiru. R.P. Arul Vs the Secretary to Government,\nAdi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department had directed to\nconstitute a Vigilance Cell citing its earlier orders of the Hon’ble\nDivision Bench of Madras High Court passed in W.P.

In consonance to the orders of the Supreme Court of India\nand as per the directions of Hon’ble Bench of Madras High Court,\nMadras in the above Writ Petitions, the Government after careful\nexamination have decided to constitute Vigilance Cells and also to\nmodify the functions of the Committees ordered in G.O.(2D)No. 108\nAdi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department dated 12.09.2007.\n\n5.

In the instant case on hand, according to the petitioners, the\n\ncommunity certificates (Konda Reddis (ST) Community) issued in their\n\nfavour by the Tahsildar still holds good and has not been canceled so far and\n\nafter their retirement, process of verification will be academic and has\n\nrestrained the verifying authority from proceeding. For the past forty years,\n\n__________\n\nPage No.67 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\nthey have not been summoned for verification and in the interregnum\n\nreached superannuation. For consideration of this Court, they also filed\n\naffidavits of undertaking.\n\n25. It is not the case of the petitioners that there is a violation of\n\nprinciple of natural justice and there is a defiance of the guidelines issued by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Division Benches of this Court\n\nand the impugned noticed issued by the authorities are not in consonance\n\nwith G.O.Ms.No.106 dated 15.10.2012 (Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare\n\n(CV- I) Department). It is no doubt, High Court play a crucial role in dealing\n\nwith issuance and verification of Scheduled Caste(s) and Scheduled Tribe(s)\n\ncommunity certificates, as mandated under the Constitution of India by\n\nbalancing the need to verify authenticity by protecting genuine individuals'\n\nright from harassment or undue delay.\n\n26. Thus, keeping in mind the ratio\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in various cases pertaining to this issue and the Hon'ble\n\nDivision Benches of this Court and also taking into account G.O.Ms.No.106\n\n__________\n\nPage No.68 of 73\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/08/2025 06:37:33 pm )\nW.P.Nos.24381 & 24387 of 2025\n\ndated 15.10.2012 Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare (CV- I) Department, I\n\nam of the view that verification once started shall continue till its conclusion\n\nand mere acceptance of undertaking affidavits filed by the petitioners for\n\nrestraining the authorities is not sustainable under law when the authorities\n\nare empowered to issue the impugned notices calling upon the petitioners for\n\nenquiry to verify the genuineness of their community certificates in order to\n\nensure implementation of constitutional reservation benefits to the\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and therefore, the same cannot be\n\nquashed at this stage. There is no merits in these petitions and the same is\n\nliable to be dismissed.\n\nErgo, these writ petitions stand dismissed. No costs.
