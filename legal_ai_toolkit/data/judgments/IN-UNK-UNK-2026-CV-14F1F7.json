Gr-I on 14.12.1995 under direct recruitment\n\nquota. He was promoted to the post of Sr. Horticulture Assistant w.e.f.\n\n10.10.2005 by way of seniority-cum-fitness on the recommendation of\n\nDPC. As per the Gradation List of Sr. Horticulture Assistant, issued on\n\n11.11.2009, he was placed at Sl. No. 8. Ld. Counsel for the applicant\n\nclaiming that basing upon the DoP&T O.M. dated 02.07.1997\n\n(Annexure-A/4),promotion to the post of Assistant Superintending\n\nHorticulturist (in short ASH) was effected earlier w.e.f. 1997 by\n\napplying roster based reservation, the applicant submitted\n\nrepresentation on 24.12.2015 for consideration of his case for\n\n 3 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\npromotion to ASH against SC Roaster Point stating that as per the\n\nroster point the next vacancy to the said post will go in favour of SC\n\ncategory. Respondents rejected the claim of the applicant being not\n\nauthentic, however, given opportunity to prove its authenticity by\n\ndocument, if any. It appears that the applicant resubmitted his\n\nrepresentation and, subsequently, approached this Tribunal in O.A. No.\n\n726/2016, which was disposed of by this Tribunal with direction to\n\nthe respondents to consider the representation. Consequently,\n\nrespondents considered the representation and, vide impugned order\n\ndated 23.01.2017 (Annexure-A/10) decided that the applicant is not\n\ndue for promotion against the quota reserved for SC category. Hence,\n\nthe applicant has filed this O.A. with the following reliefs:\n\n (i) To quash the order dt. 23.01.2017 under Annexure-\n\n A/10.\n\n (ii) To direct the respondents to promote the applicant in\n the post of Asst. Superintending Horticulturist as per\n roster point reservation of SC category at Sr No.15\n retrospectively in view of OM dt. 02.07.1997 under\n Annexure A/4.\n\n (iii) To direct the respondents to pay the applicant all his\n service and financial benefits retrospectively.\n\n (iv) To pas any other appropriate order......\"\n\n2. Respondents filed their counter inter alia stating that there are\n\nonly three sanctioned post of ASH in Archaeological Survey of India,\n\n 4 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\nwhich are filled up 100% by promotion. The reservation roster is\n\nprescribed for the post in a cadre where the sanctioned strength is two\n\nor more but less than 14, which shall be applicable in the present case.\n\nAs per the roster, in respect of post filled up by promotion the point\n\nNo. 7 falls against SC category and point No. 14 for the ST category and\n\nthe reservation shall be provided by rotation on the basis of 14 point\n\nroster. Since, the post reserved for SC category was already consumed\n\non the appointment of Sri H.P.Verma against the reserved quota. The\n\nvacancy which would arise up to the 14th point shall be filled up under\n\nthe unreserved quota and one Sri Naresh Chand, although belongs to\n\nSC category, he being senior to the applicant was promoted as ASH\n\nagainst the unreserved quota on basis of merit. Ld. Counsel for the\n\nrespondents submits that the representation of the applicant was duly\n\nconsidered and speaking order dated 23.01.2017 was communicated\n\nto him clarifying that he is not due for promotion against the quota\n\nreserved for SC category and his case shall be considered as per his\n\nseniority. It is further submitted that, in the meantime, the applicant\n\nhas been promoted to the post of ASH and he has accepted the same\n\nunconditionally and assumed the charge on 27.03.2019. Hence, as\n\nsuch, there is no cause of action for adjudication by this Tribunal.\n\n 5 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\n3. Applicant has filed rejoinder, which has been taken into\n\nconsideration.\n\n4. According to the Ld. Counsel for the applicant, the applicant is\n\nentitled to the relief prayed for in this O.A. because the respondents\n\nrejected the case without considering the true merit of the matter\n\ninasmuch as Point Nos. 7 and 15, as per the post based roster, meant\n\nfor SC category and Point No. 14 is meant for ST category. If the\n\nversion of the respondents is taken to be correct that one Sri\n\nH.P.Verma was promoted and adjusted against Sl. No. 7, roster point at\n\nSl. No. 15 still remains against which the applicant could have been\n\npromoted. It has been stated that the 14 point roster is applicable for\n\ndirect recruitment and not for promotion. The reservation roster\n\nclearly prescribes for the post in a cadre where sanctioned strength is\n\n2 or more but less than 14 shall be applicable in the present case and,\n\ntherefore, gross injustice was caused to the applicant in the decision\n\nmaking process in the matter. On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for the\n\nrespondents has submitted that the applicant has in the meantime has\n\nbeen promoted to the post of ASH. The argument advanced is on\n\nconjecture and surmises without any basis because the roster is\n\nmaintained and filled up as per the extant rules. The case of the\n\n 6 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\napplicant was duly considered with reference to the applicable roster\n\npoint/DoP&T O.M. and taking into consideration sanctioned/vacancy\n\nposition in the grade of ASH and, there being no illegality, the applicant\n\nis not entitled to the relief claimed in the O.A. Accordingly, Ld. Counsel\n\nfor the respondents has prayed for dismissal of the O.A.\n\n5. We have given careful consideration to the rival contentions\n\nmade by both sides and perused the materials on records. Facts\n\nremains that the applicant has in the meantime promoted to the post\n\nof ASH. It is seen that the respondents rejected the grievance of the\n\napplicant on the ground that there are only three sanctioned posts of\n\nASH in Archaeological Survey of India, which are to be filled up 100%\n\nby promotion. The reservation roster is prescribed for the post in a\n\ncadre where the sanctioned strength is two or more but less than 14,\n\nwhich shall be applicable in the present case. As per the roster, in\n\nrespect of post filled up by promotion the point No. 7 falls against SC\n\ncategory and point No. 14 for the ST category and the reservation shall\n\nbe provided by rotation on the basis of 14 point roster. Since, the post\n\nreserved for SC category was already consumed on the appointment of\n\nSri H.P.Verma against the reserved quota. The vacancy which would\n\narise up to the 14th point shall be filled up under the unreserved quota\n\n 7 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\nand one Sri Naresh Chand, although belongs to SC category, he being\n\nsenior to the applicant was promoted as ASH against the unreserved\n\nquota on basis of merit.\n\n6. It is seen that the respondents considered the representation of\n\nthe applicant and rejected the same under Annexure-A/10 dated\n\n23.01.2017 on the ground as under:\n\n WHEREAS the representation of Shri V.P. Mohod has been\n examined vis-à-vis the extant instructions issued by the\n DoP&T with regard to reservation of posts for Scheduled\n Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotion and\n the following observations are made in this regard:\n\n (i) Whereas there being only three sanctioned posts of ASH\n in ASI which are filled up 100% by the method of\n promotion, the reservation roster prescribed for posts in a\n cadre where the sanctioned strength is 2 or more but less\n than 14 shall be applicable in the present case. The\n extracts of instructions issued by the Government in this\n regard are enclosed.\n\n (ii) As per the above said Roster in respect of post filled up\n by promotion, the point no. 7 falls against SC Category and\n Point No 14 for the ST Category And the reservation shall\n be provided by rotation on the basis of the said 14 point\n roster.\n\n (iii) As regards the post of ASH in ASI, the post reserved for\n SC Category has already been consumed on the\n appointment of Shri H.P. Verma against the reserved\n quota. A copy of the Minutes of the DPC which had\n recommended the promotion of Shri H.P. Verma is\n enclosed.\n\n (iv) Therefore, the vacancies which would arise up to the\n 14thpoint (reserved for ST) shall be filled up under the\n unreserved quota.\n\n 8 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\n (v) Shri Naresh Chand who belongs to SC Category and is\n senior to the applicant was, therefore, promoted as ASH\n against the unreserved quota on merit.\n\n NOW, THEREFORE, in the light of the above position, the\n Competent Authority after due consideration of the\n representation submitted by Shri VP Mohod, Sr. Horticulture\n Assistant has decided that he is not due for promotion against\n the quota reserved for SC Category. However, he shall be\n considered for promotion as per his seniority.\n\n From the above it appears that, according to the respondents, point\n\nno. 7 falls against SC Category and Point No 14 for the ST Category.\n\nThereafter, point no. 15 falls against the SC category as per the Post based\n\nroster for promotion. According to the respondents, the post reserved for\n\nSC category has already been consumed on promotion of Sri H.P.Verma\n\nagainst the reserved quota at Sl. No. 7. It is the case of the applicant that\n\nthe reservation roster prescribed for the post in a cadre where sanctioned\n\nstrength is 2 or more but less than 14 shall be applied in his case and as per\n\nthe roster in respect of the post in question the point no. 7 falls against SC\n\ncategory and point no. 14 against ST category and the reservation shall be\n\nprovided by rotation on the basis of 14 point roster. The respondents in the\n\norder of rejection so also in the counter did not whisper anything relating to\n\nroster point number 15. It is the specific grievance of the applicant that as\n\nper roster based reservation in promotion cadre of SC at Sl. No. 7 which is\n\nmeant for Sl. No. 1 i.e. Sri H.P.Verma since then no SC candidate\n\n 9 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\npromoted to the post of Asst. Superintending Horticulturist as per the post\n\nbased roster dated 02.07.1997 (Annexure-A/4) but Sl. No. 8 was promoted\n\nto the said post on seniority basis. As per record, one post of Asst.\n\nSuperintending Horticulturist is vacant and, thus, as per the principle set\n\nout under Annexure-A/4. next roster based reservation is at Sl. No. 15 and\n\nSl. No. 9 was meant for SC category whereas the respondents filled up the\n\npost meant for SC (Sl. No. 10) and thereafter Sl. No. 11 which is in\n\nviolation of the DoP&T order dated 02.07.1997 (Annexure-A/4). Be that as\n\nit may, the order of rejection is conspicuously silent on the above aspect\n\nespecially relating to the roster point at Sl. No. 15. Every employee has\n\ngenuine expectation to achieve career advancement by way of climbing the\n\nladder of promotion. When the applicant had apprehended that he has been\n\ntreated shabbily in matter of applying the reservation roster, it is expected\n\nthat the authority concerned should not leave any room for doubt in the\n\nmind of an employee that his case has not been dealt into in its proper\n\nperspective. On the above count, the irresistible conclusion would be that\n\nthe order of rejection was passed without due application of mind by\n\nmeeting/answering the points specifically raised by the applicant. In other\n\nwords, the order of rejection is arbitrary and hence illegal. Therefore, the\n\norder of rejection under Annexure-A/10 dated 23.01.2017 is hereby\n\nquashed and the matter is remitted back to Respondent No. 2 to reconsider\n\n 10 O.A.No. 260/00091of 2017\n\nthe matter afresh after due opportunity to the applicant and pass a reasoned\n\nand speaking order within a period of 120 days from the date of receipt of a\n\ncopy of this order.\n\n7. In view of the aforesaid observations and discussions, this O.A.\n\nstands allowed to the above extent by leaving the parties to bear their\n\nown costs.\n\n(SWARUP KUMAR MISHRA) (DEVENDRA CHAUDHRY)\n Member (Judicial) Member (Admn.)\n\nRK/PS",
