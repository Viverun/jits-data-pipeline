The Applicant had approached the learned Sessions Court seeking\nAnticipatory Bail, however, the same was dismissed vide Order dated\n01.04.2025.\n\n5. At the outset, it is submitted that the Applicant is a law abiding citizen\nand has clean antecedents. She is 21 years old and is currently pursuing her\nM.Sc. from IGNOU. It is asserted that she has been wrongly and falsely\nimplicated in the present case, being the sister of Pankaj Lamba, the main\naccused who was the husband of the Complainant‟s daughter/Ms. Harshita\nBarela (since deceased).\n\n6. Pankaj Lamba and Harshita Barela got married on 22.03.2024\naccording to Hindu rights and ceremonies, in an arranged marriage. It was\nalleged by the Complainant that the co-accused and his family had subjected\nthe Complainant‟s daughter and her family to cruelty and harassment\nconnected to dowry demand, even prior to the solemnisation of their\nmarriage.\n\n7. After the marriage, the co-accused moved to the United Kingdom,\nwhile the Complainant's daughter moved into her matrimonial home in\nDharoli. She was allegedly subjected to harassment and cruelty, which led\nher to leave the matrimonial home and stay at her parental house.

The Applicant, submits that the FIR does not disclose any allegation\nof cruelty/harassment at the instance of the Applicant \"soon before the\ndeath\" which resulted the dowry death. The deceased had moved to United\nKingdom shortly after her marriage and there was thus, no proximate and\nlive link between the alleged dowry death and cruelty being meted out\nagainst the Applicant. Thus, addition of 304B\nIPC\nto the FIR is prima facie\nfalse and holds no water.\n\n10. Reliance has been placed on the case of\nManohar Lal vs. State of\nHaryana\n, (2014) 9 SCC 645 wherein the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that\n\"Facts must show existence of proximate live link between the effect of\ncruelty based on dowry demand and death of victim\".\n\n11. Reliance has also been placed\nBalwant Singh and Anr. vs. State of\nPunjab\n, (2004) 7 SCC 724, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that since one\nof the ingredients of the offence under\nSection 304B\nIPC is that cruelty\nshould have been meted out to the deceased soon before her death, it is for\nthe prosecution to establish affirmatively that the victim was subjected to\ncruelty and harassment based on dowry demand soon before her death.\n\n12. It is submitted that the Applicant has clean antecedents and she\nundertakes that she will not flee from justice if is admitted to Bail and is\nready and willing to co-operate with administration of justice.\n\n13. Furthermore, the grant of Bail is a norm and refusal thereof is\nexception and the Courts should exercise the discretion of Bail judicially and\nthe Bail should not be denied to an accused only as a punishment.\n\n14. Thus, it is prayed that Anticipatory Bail be granted to the Applicant.\n\n15.
