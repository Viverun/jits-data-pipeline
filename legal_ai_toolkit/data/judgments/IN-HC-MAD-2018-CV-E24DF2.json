In W.P.(MD) No.16774 of 2018, the petitioner is still working as\n\nVocational Instructors. In W.P.(MD) Nos.17306, 17234 and 17235 of 2018,\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.inthe respective petitioners have retired from service.\n3. Since their services have been brought to time scale of pay after\n\nsome years and from that date, their services have been calculated for the\n\npurpose of pensionary benefits. Their grievance appears to be in spite of\n\nthe amendment having been brought under Rule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu\n\nPension Rules, the past services rendered by them, as either double time or\n\npart time Vocational Instructors had not been taken into account for the\n\npurpose of pensionary benefits.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that the\n\nissue raised in these batch of cases have already been decided by a number\n\nof decisions of this Court and in this regard, the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners have also relied upon a recent judgment of Mine dated\n\n09.07.2018 in W.P.(MD) No.14365/2014 etc batch, in the matter of\n\nA.Ramalingam v. State of Tamil Nadu\nand three others.\n\n5. I have heard the learned counsel for the respective petitioners and\n\nalso the learned Additional Government Pleader and Government Advocate\n\nfor the official respondents and learned standing counsel for the Accountant\n\nGeneral and I have also gone through the materials placed before this\n\nCourt.\n\n6. As has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nparties, the issue raised in these batch of cases is no more res integra, as\n\nthese issues have already been considered and decided by this Court. After\n\nhaving considered all those aspects, I have passed the order in the\n\naforementioned judgment in\nA.Ramalingam\n's case on 09.07.2018.\n\n7. For the sake of better understanding and clarity, the relevant\n\nportion of my order is extracted hereunder:\n\n“11.I have heard the said submissions made by the\nlearned counsel for the parties.\n\n12.As has been rightly submitted by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners, the issue raised in this batch of\nwrit petitions has already been decided in number of cases\nby this Court.\nIn this regard, one of the earliest decision of\nthe learned Judge of this Court was made in W.P.(MD)No.\n16771 of 2013 in the matter of\nV.Ragavan Vs. State of\nTamil Nadu\nrepresented by its Secretary, School\nEducation Department and others. In\nthe said decision\n,\nthe learned Judge has dealt with the similar issue and has\ngiven his verdict after exhaustively discussed the various\ngrounds raised by both sides. In this regard, the following\nparagraph of\nthe said decision\ncan be usefully referred to:-\n\n“3.The petitioner was appointed as a\nsingle part time Vocational teacher on\n\n08.10.1980 and he was regularised on\n01.04.1990 in such capacity. Thereafter, he\nwas promoted as P.G.Assistant (Commerce) and\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nretired from service on 30.03.2013 on attaining\nthe age of superannuation. The Government as\nwell as the private schools were engaging\nnumber of qualified persons as Teachers for the\nVocational subjects either as Double part time\nor Single part time Teachers according to their\nneeds. All of them were employed indefinitely\nfor years together. After repeated\nrepresentations and agitations, the\nGovernment, in order to bring them under time\nscale of pay in a phased manner, directed to fill\nup 800 posts for the Vocational Instructors in\nG.O.Ms.No.712 Education Department dated\n28.05.1990 by appointing them as Double part\ntime Teachers. Further, G.O.No.68 dated\n20.03.2007 was passed stating that the\nVocational Teachers can been appointed on par\nwith B.T.Assistants. After the retirement of\nthe petitioner, the service rendered by him as\npart time Vocational Teacher from 08.10.1980\nto 31.03.1990 was not taken into account while\ncalculating the pension. Under similar\ncircumstances, this Court in W.P.No.39177 of\n2002 dated 16.04.2009 directed the respondents\nto count 50% of the part time service rendered\nby the petitioner therein for the purpose of\ncalculating the pension. A writ appeal filed\nchallenging the said order, in W.A.No.1702 of\n2010 was dismissed on 20.09.2010. Further\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nappeal preferred before the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt also came to be dismissed. Therefore,\nthe petitioner is also entitled to similar relief.”\n\n13.The learned Judge, after having taken into\naccount the earlier decision rendered in this regard, which\nhad been taken on appeal by way of intra Court appeal,\nwherein also, the view of the learned Single Judge was\nconfirmed and the same was also taken to the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt by filing SLP, the Hon'ble Apex Court also dismissed\nthe said SLP, confirming the view taken by the High Court,\nhas allowed the said writ petition.\n\n14.When I had an occasion to consider the similar\nissue in W.P.(MD)Nos.256 and 257of 2015 in the case of\n\nP.Natarajan and another Vs. the State of Tamil Nadu\n\nrepresented by its Secretary, School Education Department\n\nand others, I have considered\nthe said decision\nof the\nlearned Judge\nreferred to above\n, in the teeth of the\namended Rule 11(4) of the Rules, 1978, which reads thus:-\n\n“In the said Rules in Rule 11, after sub-\nrule (3), the following sub-rule shall be added\nnamely:-\n\n“(4)Half of the service rendered under\nthe State Government in non-provincialised\nservice, consolidated pay, honorarium or daily\nwages basis on or after 1st January 1961 in\nrespect of Government employees absorbed in\nregular service before 1st April 2003 shall be\ncounted for retirement benefits, along with\nregular service, subject to the following\nconditions, namely:-\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in (i)Service rendered in non-provincialised\nservice, consolidated pay, honorarium or daily\nwages basis shall be in a job involving whole\ntime employment;\n\n(ii)Service rendered shall be on\nconsolidated pay, honorarium or daily wages\npaid on monthly basis and subsequently\nabsorbed in regular service under the State\nGovernment.\n\n(iii)Service rendered in non-provincialised\nservice, consolidated pay, honorarium or daily\nwages basis shall be followed by absorption in\nregular service before 1st April 2003 without a\nbreak:\n\nProvided that this sub-rule is applicable\nto all employees who rendered service under\nthe State Government in non-provincilised\nservice, consolidated pay, honorarium or daily\nwages basis on or after 1st January 1961 and\nabsorbed in regular service before 1st April 2003:\n\nProvided further that wherever there was\nbreak in service before their absorption in\nregular service before 1st April 2003, the same\nshall be specifically condoned by the orders of\nthe Head of Departments, in which the\nemployees were regularly absorbed and such\nperiod of break shall not count for the purpose\nof pensionary benefits.”\n\n15.In\nthe said judgment\nin W.P.(MD)Nos.256 and 257\nof 2015 cited supra, after having considered the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsubmissions made on behalf of the Government that, the\ncases decided in favour of the employees and also the\norder complied with by the respondents cannot be taken as\nprecedent, I passed the following order:-\n\n“12.The learned Judge in\nthe said\ndecision\ndated 09.04.2014, made in W.P.(MD)\nNos.16771 to 16775 of 2013 etc., batch has in\nfact discussed this issue exhaustively and has\ngiven a detailed interpretation as to how the\nvery word 'whole time employment' as employed\nin Rule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules\nhas to be interpreted. The learned Judge has\ngiven a complete answer to the objections\nraised by the respondents herein in paragraphs\n26 to 29 of\nthe said judgment\n, which have\nalready been extracted herein above. The\nlearned Judge has also made a reference that\nRule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules\nitself was impliedly overruled by the Division\nBench of this Court in W.A.No.1702 of 2010\ndated 20.09.2010.\n\n14.Yet another factor in the said batch of\ncases cited supra is that, all those petitioners\nwere worked as part-time Vocational\nInstructors. For the said part-time Vocational\nInstructors, though the timing was restricted\neither to have 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. or 10.00\na.m. to 1.00 p.m. or like that cannot be\nconstrued that those people had worked only in\nthat time and for the remaining time, they left\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe institution. This issue has been exhaustively\ndiscussed by the learned Judge in\nthe said\ndecision\n(cited supra). The word 'whole time\nemployment' was also to be considered in a\nparticular manner, has also been discussed and\ndecided by the learned Judge in\nthe said\ndecision\n. In this regard it was specifically held\nthat even though the job is only for a few hours\nthe teacher had to wait in the school and\npresent for the whole day signing attendance\nfor both sessions. This factor has been\nspecifically discussed and decided by the\nlearned Judge.\n\n15.Across the Bar, it was also informed\nthat\nthe said judgment\nwas also implemented.\nIt is also informed across the bar that as against\nsome similar decisions made by this Court, the\nState had gone upto Supreme Court and the\nS.L.P. filed by the State Government has been\ndismissed. Though specific reference was not\ngiven by the petitioners side, the said\nsubmissions made by them are not disputed\nfrom the respondents side.\n\n16.Moreover, in one such case, this Court\nin W.P.No.4556 of 2007 by order dated\n29.07.2011, a direction was given to the\nrespondents that 50% of the past service should\nbe taken into account for the pensionary\nbenefits. The said order of this Court dated\n29.07.2011 has been implemented by the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nGovernment through G.O.(4D) No.19 School\nEducation Department dated 04.11.2014.\n\n17.The defence now taken by the learned\nGovernment Advocate that this kind of isolated\ncases cannot be accepted. When similarly placed\npersons are not treated equally, that also would\namount discrimination. Therefore, the\nprovisions of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of\nIndia can very well be invoked in this case.\nTherefore, such kind of discrimination that too\nfrom the State Government cannot be accepted\nand permitted.\n\n18.It is an admitted fact that these two\npetitioners were working as part-time\nVocational Instructors for longer years. Only\nafter several years they were brought under\nfull-time Vocational Instructors by regularising\ntheir services. Though both the petitioners are\ngetting pensions, since their past 50% service\nhas not been taken into account they are\ngetting a very meagre pension. Considering\nthese aspects, legislators themselves though it\nfit to make amendment in the Rule. That is why\namendment in Rule 11(4) came into the\nstatutory book. The normal rule of\ninterpretation of statutory Rule is to be given\neffect when specific Rule was brought in by way\nof beneficial rule. Rule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu\nPension Rules has been brought in by way of\nbeneficial rule for the benefit of those who\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nhave rendered unblemished service for several\nyears and going without getting any pensionary\nbenefits. Therefore, the said Rule cannot be\nsubjected to a different interpretation as has\nbeen sought for by the respondents side.\nTherefore, this Court is of the view that Rule\n11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules certainly\nwould give leverage to the petitioners i.e., 50%\nof their past service, when they were working\nas part-time Vocational Instructors, shall be\ntaken into account for the purpose of\npensionary benefits.\n\n19.For all the reasons and discussions\nmade above, this Court is of the firm view that\nthe petitioners succeed in these Writ Petitions\nand they are entitled to the mandamus as\nsought for in these Writ Petitions.\n\n20.In the result, these Writ Petitions are\nallowed and the respondents are directed to\ntake into consideration 50% of the past services\nof the petitioners when they were working as\npart-time Vocational Instructors. Based on such\nservice, the pensionary benefits of the\npetitioner shall be recalculated and the\nrecalculated pension shall be continued to be\npaid to the petitioners. It is needless to state\nthat when the pension is recalculated from\ntheir date of retirement till payment, arrears\nshall also be paid to them. The aforesaid\nexercise shall be completed within a period of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthree months from the date of receipt of a copy\nof this order.\n\n21.With these directions, these two Writ\nPetitions are allowed. No costs.”\n\n16.In the recent judgment of the Hon'ble Division\nBench of this Court in W.A.No.882 of 2017 etc., batch, in\nthe case of The Government of Tamil Nadu, represented\nby its Secretary to Government,- School Education\nDepartment and others Vs. K.Pachaiyappan and others,\nthe Division Bench, after having gone through the issue\nonce again, has passed the following order:-\n\n“15.In terms of the above discussions, we\ndispose of the writ appeals as under:-\n\n(i)50% of the services rendered by the\nrespondents herein, as Part Time Vocational\nInstructorss (either as Single Part Time or\nDouble Part Time Vocational Instructors), shall\nbe counted for the purpose of computing\npension and other retiral benefits.\n\n(ii)The above said benefit shall be\nextended only to the respondents in these writ\nappeals and for the persons similarly situated\nlike that of the respondents herein, whose cases\nare pending before this Court. Thus it is made\nclear that the above said benefit shall not be\nextended to any other future cases that may be\nfiled on this account, on the ground of delay\nand laches, since all along they have not come\nup before this Court and remained as fence-\n\nsitters. It is also needless to point out that\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nallowing such cases would amount to opening\nthe pandora's box, touching upon the financial\nimplications of the State.”\n\n17.The learned Special Government Pleader heavily\nrelied upon the aforesaid observation made by the Division\nBench of this Court that, the benefit extended in the said\nbatch of cases shall be applicable only to those parties and\nthe similar benefit shall not be extended to any other\nfuture case that may be filed before this Court, on the\nground of delay and latches. Since the said observation of\nthe Division Bench has been heavily relied upon by the\nlearned Special Government Pleader, this Court wants to\ndeal with this issue also.\n\n18.First of all, number of cases in this batch, have\nalready been filed, prior to the said decision rendered by\nthe Division Bench on 06.04.2018 and were pending before\nthis Court.\n\n19.Further, it is a settled proposition of law that, in\nservice matters, if the similarly placed persons, who are\nentitled to get the benefit under law, having been denied\nthe benefit, even though in this regard already a decision\nhas been rendered by the Court of law and the same is\nimplemented, the very same relief shall also be extended\nto all similarly placed persons irrespective of the fact,\nwhether they approached the Court or not, if the law\ndeclared by the Court is judgement in rem.\n\n20.Insofar as the declaration made by this Court in\nnumber of decisions, as has been referred to above, which\nwere confirmed by the Division Bench of this Court and\nsubsequently, by the Hon'ble Apex Court and also with\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nregard to the entitlement of pensionary benefits of the\nTeachers / employees, who had rendered continuous /\nunblemished services for several years, either as part time\nor full time or temporary or adhoc basis, by taking note of\nthe 50% of the said services they rendered, prior to they\nbrought in under regular time scale of pay or absorption,\nsuch entitlement was declared by the Court of law, which\nshall be the judgment in rem. If the law is declared by the\nCourts and similar pensionary benefits, having been\ndeclared by the Court of law and having been conferred to\nseveral such similarly placed persons by employer /\nGovernment, then, certainly this Court can extend those\nbenefits for similarly placed, who seek such remedy by\napproaching this Court.\n\n21.Moreover, the cause of action arose in these kind\nof cases are continuous cause of action as each of the\npetitioners, who are the erstwhile employees of the\nrespective employer / State, would be entitled to get the\npensionary benefits till their life time. Thereafter, the\nlegal heirs would be entitled to get the family pension\nbenefits.\n\n22.Therefore, the benefits accrued on them, which\nhave been claimed before this Court, by way of this\nlitigations, are continuous in nature. Therefore, once the\ncontinuous cause of action is available for litigant, he / she\ncan approach the Court of law at any point of time.\n\n23. If the judgment is in rem, the benefit of the\njudgment to other similarly placed or situated persons can\nbe extended and in this regard, the plea of delay/laches or\nexpiry of limitation can be condoned.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\n24. Emphasizing the said principle, the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in 1997 (6) SCC 721 in the matter of\nK.C.Sharma\nand others v. Union of India and others\nheld as follows:\n\n“3. This appeal is directed against the\njudgment of the Principal Bench of the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as\n'the Tribunal') dated July 25, 1994 in O.A. No. 774 of\n1994. The appellants were employed as guards in the\nNorthern Railway and they retired as guards during\nthe period between 1980 and 1988. They felt\naggrieved by the notifications dated December 5,\n1988 whereby Rule 2544 of the Indian Railways\nEstablishment Code was amended and for the\npurpose of calculation of average emoluments the\nmaximum limit in respect of Running Allowances was\nreduced from 75% to 45% in respect of period from\nJanuary 1, 1973 to March 31, 1979 and to 55% for the\nperiod from April 1, 1979 onwards.\n\n4. The validity of the retrospective\namendments introduced by the impugned\nnotifications dated December 5, 1988 had been\nconsidered by the Full Bench of the Tribunal in its\njudgment dated December 16, 1993 in O.A. No.\n395-403 of 1993 and connected matters and the said\nnotifications in so far as they gave retrospective\neffect to the amendments were held to be invalid as\nbeing violative a\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. Since the appellants were adversely\naffected by the impugned amendments, they sought\nthe benefit of the Full Bench of the Tribunal by filing\nrepresentations before the Railway Administration.\n\nSince they failed to obtain redress, they filed the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\napplication (O.A. NO. 774 of 1994) seeking relief\nbefore the Tribunal in April 1994. The said\napplication of the appellants was dismissed by the\nTribunal by the impugned judgment on the view that\nthe application was barred by limitation. The\nTribunal refused to condone the delay in the filing of\nthe said applications.\n\n5. The correctness of the decision of the Full\nBench of the Tribunal has been affirmed by this Court\nin\nChairman, Railway Board & Ors. V. C.R.\nRangadhamaiah & Ors., Civil Appeals Nos\n. 4174-4182\nof 1995 and connected matters decided today.\n\n6. Having regarding to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, we are of the view that\nthis was a fit case in which the Tribunal should have\ncondoned the delay in the filing of the application\nand the appellants should have been given relief in\nthe same terms as was granted by the Full Bench of\nthe Tribunal. The appeal is, therefore, allowed, the\nimpugned judgment of the Tribunal is set aside, the\ndelay in filing of O.A. No. 774 of 199 is condoned and\nthe said application is allowed. The appellants would\nbe entitled to the same relief in matter of pension as\nhas been granted by the Full Bench of the Tribunal in\nits judgment dated December 16, 1993 in O.A. Nos.\n395-403 of 1993 and connected matters. No order as\nto costs.”\n\n25. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in (2006) 2 SCC 747\nin the matter of\nState of Karnataka and others v.\nC.Lalitha\n, has made the following observations:\n\n“29.Service jurisprudence evolved by this\nCourt from time to time postulates that all persons\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nsimilarly situated should be treated similarly. Only\nbecause one person has approached the court that\nwould not mean that persons similarly situated\nshould be treated differently.\n\n26. Insofar as the principle that, seeking redressal\nagainst the denial of service benefits, for which, the\nemployee is entitled to, and if it is the continuing cause of\naction, the question of limitation/delay does not arise in\nthose cases, where the employee seek for such benefit,\nwhich has already been given to similarly placed persons,\nCourts have taken the view in favour of the employees.\n\n27. To emphasize the said principle, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in (2010) 12 SCC 538 in the matter of\nState of Madhya Pradesh and others v. Yogendra\nSrivatsava has held as follows:\n\n“16. The Tribunal directed payment of the\ndifference in NPA to respondents from their\nrespective dates of appointment. The respondents\nwere appointed from 1982 onwards. The respondents\nhad approached the Tribunal long after their\nappointment, that is, in 1998 or thereafter.\n\n17. The appellants contended that the claims\nwere therefore barred by limitation. It was pointed\nout that the respondents were paid NPA at a fixed\nrate as stipulated in the appointment orders and NPA\nwas increased only when it was revised by\nGovernment orders from time to time; that\nrespondents accepted such NPA without protest; and\nthat therefore, they cannot, after periods varying\nfrom 5 to 15 years, challenge the fixation of NPA or\ncontend that they are entitled to NPA at a higher\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in rate, that is 25% of their pay.\n18.We cannot agree. Where the issue relates\nto payment or fixation of salary or any allowance,\nthe challenge is not barred by limitation or the\ndoctrine of laches, as the denial of benefit occurs\nevery month when the salary is paid, thereby giving\nrise to a fresh cause of action, based on continuing\nwrong. Though the lesser payment may be a\nconsequence of the error that was committed at the\ntime of appointment, the claim for a higher\nallowance in accordance with the Rules\n(prospectively from the date of application) cannot\nbe rejected merely because it arises from a wrong\nfixation made several years prior to the claim for\ncorrect payment. But in respect of grant of\nconsequential relief of recovery of arrears for the\npast period, the principle relating to recurring and\nsuccessive wrongs would apply. Therefore the\nconsequential relief of payment of arrears will have\nto be restricted to a period of three years prior to\nthe date of the original application. [See:\nM.R. Gupta\nvs. Union of India\n-\n1995 (5) SCC 628, and Union of\nIndia vs. Tarsem Singh\n2008.”\n\n28. More than one Division Bench of this Court\nconsidered the issue raised in these batch of cases, as to\nwhether the single or double part time Vocational\nInstructors were entitled to seek the benefit of reckoning\nthe 50% of the past services rendered by them till they\nbrought under time scale of pay and absorption, in view of\nRule 11, especially, Rule 11(4) of the Tamil Nadu Pension\nRules, 1978. Having considered and decided in favour of\nthe employees and against those decisions, though State\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\npreferred Special Leave Petitions, the Hon'ble Apex Court\nby dismissing the said S.L.Ps. affirmed the decisions of this\nCourt and following which\n,\nthe said decision\nrendered by\nthe Writ Court as affirmed by the Division Bench of this\nCourt as well as the Hon'ble Apex Court has been\nimplemented. When that being so, whether diagonally\nopposite view can be taken by a subsequent decision to\ndeny such benefits to those, who had not immediately\ncome and approached this Court subsequently and in this\nregard, whether a cut off date can be fixed to prevent the\naggrieved persons/employees/litigant to approach the\nCourt, can no longer be an issue without any resolvement.\n\n29.\nIn this regard, the Hon'ble Apex Court has given a\nstrong observation in 2015 (8) SCC 129 in\nP.Suseela and\nothers v. University Grants Commission and others\n,\nwhere the Hon'ble Apex Court has made the following\nobservations:\n\n“25.In SLPs (C) Nos.3054-55 of 2014, a\njudgment of the same High Court dated 06.01.2014\nagain by a Division Bench arrived at the opposite\nconclusion. This is also a matter which causes us\nsome distress. A Division Bench judgment of the\nsame High court is binding on a subsequent Division\nBench. The subsequent Division bench can either\nfollow it or refer such judgment to the Chief Justice\nto constitute a Full Bench if it differs with it. We do\nnot appreciate the manner in which this subsequent\njudgment (even though it has reached the right\nresult), has dealt with an earlier binding Division\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nBench judgment of the same High Court.”\n\n30. That apart, it has been brought to the notice of\nthis Court by the learned members of the Bar, who\nsupported the case of the petitioners herein that, at least\nin two Division Benches of this Court, in recent decisions,\nthe view taken by this Court in a number of decisions on\nthe issue, raised in this batch of cases, have been\nreaffirmed and amplified.\n\n31. The first decision is by a Division Bench of this\nCourt made in W.A.No.51 of 2018 etc batch dated\n27.03.2018 in the matter of Government of Tamil Nadu\nrepresented by its Principal Secretary to Government,\nForest and Environment Department and others v.\nK.Sakthivel and others.\n\n32. In the said Division Bench judgment, the issue of\ncalculating the 50% of past services rendered by temporary\nemployees (in that case, it was Plot Watcher), was\nconsidered in detail, where the earlier judgments of this\nCourt had been taken note of and ultimately, the Division\nBench concluded that the said benefits conferred to the\nprivate respondents, who were the petitioners before the\nWrit Court were affirmed/confirmed.\n\n33. The Division Bench in the said judgment has\nmade the following decision:\n\n“24.The validity of fixing such a cut-off date\nwas the subject matter of consideration in the case\nof\nP.Chinniyan v. State of Tamil Nadu\nrep. by its\nSecretary to Government, Forest and Environment\n(FR-2) Department, Chennai ? 600 009 and Others\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in reported in (2014)6 MLJ 316 and the Court held that\nthe prescription of cut-off date as 01.04.2003 for\nabsorption into regular service under Rule 11(4) to\ncount half of the service rendered prior to absorption\nhas no rational basis and the same is arbitrary and\nviolative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n25.It was further held that Rule 11(4) is\ntotally redundant in view of Rule 11(2), which does\nnot prescribe any cut-off date as to absorption into\nregular service. Therefore, it was held that the\nbenefits given under Rule 11(2) cannot be deprived\nand taken away by Rule 11(4) and thus the cut-off\ndate of absorption as 01.04.2003 prescribed in Rule\n11(4) should be ignored, otherwise it will lead to\ngrave injustice. The Court took note of the facts of\nthe said case, where the petitioner therein was\nworking on daily wages from 1967 till 2003 and when\nhe was absorbed as a Mali, he has served for more\nthan 36 years before his absorption in regular service.\n\nThe said decision in the case of B.Chinnaiyan was\nfollowed in the cases of W.P.Nos.21355 and 21356 of\n2017, dated 08.09.2017. In\nthe said decision\n,\nreference was made to the decision of the Hon'ble\nDivision Bench in the case of Union of India v.\nK.Punniyakottai reported in 2014 (2) CTC 777, where\nmore or less an identical case was considered arising\nunder the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 in respect of the\nemployees of the Central Government. Therefore,\nthe Court concluded that 50% of the services\nrendered by the employee on daily wages should be\nconsidered for computing total length of service.\n\n26.The two Division Benches in the cases of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in the State of Tamil Nadu rep. by its Secretary to\nGovernment, (FR-2) Forest and Environment\nDepartment, Fort St. George, Chennai ? 600 009 v.\nS.Jayaraman [W.A.No.1482 of 2016, dated\n22.01.2018] and Government of Tamil Nadu rep. by\nits Secretary, Environment and Forest Department,\nFort St. George, Chennai ? 600 009 v. S.Thillai\nGovindan [W.A.No.1733 of 2017, dated 13.02.2018]\ntook note of the decision in the case of B.Chinnaiyan,\nwherein the cut-off date was quashed, dismissing the\nappeals filed by the Government. Thus, the decision\nin the case of B.Chinnaiyan has received the seal of\napproval of the Hon'ble Division Benches. Thus, in the\npresent factual position, whether the appellants are\njustified in contending that the earlier Judgments are\nnot binding upon them, despite most of them having\nbeen implemented by the appellants.\n\n27.In our considered view, the stand taken by\nthe appellants is wholly unsustainable as the Special\nLeave Petitions filed against some of the decisions of\nthe Hon'ble Division Bench was not dismissed in\nlimini, but were dismissed on the ground that there\nwere no merits in the appeal. Therefore, the order\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has assigned\nreasons and it is not a dismissal of a Special Leave\nPetition simpliciter. Therefore, the decisions bind the\nGovernment and consequently, the decisions relied\non by the learned Special Government Pleader in the\ncases of Harpal Kaur Chahal (Smt) v. Director, Punjab\nInstructions, Punjab and Another reported in 1995\nSupp (4) SCC 706 and Col.B.J.Akkara (Retd.) v.\nGovernment of India and Others reported in (2006)11\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in SCC 709 are distinguishable on facts.\n28.The Judgment of the Division Bench in the\ncase of Principal Secretary, Social Welfare and\nNutritious Meal Programme Department, Fort. St.\nGeorge, Chennai and Others v. M.Palanikani\n[W.A(MD)No.587 of 2014, etc. batch, dated\n03.12.2014] does not render any support to the case\nof the appellants, as the said case arose out of an\nappointment to the posts of Teachers/Supervisor\nGrade II and Rural Welfare Officers from those who\nwere functioning as Noon Meal Organisers in Schools\nas well as Child Welfare Organizers in Integrated\nChild Development Scheme (ICDS). Thus, the\nappointment in those cases, were fresh appointment\nto a different department, unlike the case on hand.\nFurther, the cases on hand are not cases seeking\nretrospective regularisation, as sought for in the case\nof the State of Tamil Nadu, rep. by the Secretary,\nDepartment of Health and Family Welfare, Fort St.\nGeorge, Chennai and Others v. T.Gopal and Others\nreported in 2016 Writ L.R. 1160.\n\n29.As noticed above, the decision to bring the\nwrit petitioners into regular time scale of pay, was\ntaken in the year 1999 and the writ petitioners were\nextended the benefits in the year 2009. By then,\nseveral of them, had completed more than 30 years\nof service, as daily wagers. The past service was\nreckoned for the purpose of justifying their\nabsorption into regular time scale of pay. Therefore,\nit will be a misnomer to state that the appointments\nmade to the post of Forest Watchers is a fresh\nappointment. The stand taken by the appellants in\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in this regard is to be rejected by merely referring to\nthe preamble portion of G.O.(Ms)No.64, dated\n08.03.1999 and G.O.(Ms)No.95, dated 07.08.2009.\nTherefore, the said contention raised by the\nappellants required to be outrightly rejected.\n\n30.There can be no denying the fact that the\nappellants themselves have implemented various\ndecisions of the Division Benches, in some of which,\nno appeals were preferred to the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt. Therefore, now to take a different stand in\nthe present appeals as well as writ petitions would\nimpermissible and a situation cannot be allowed to\nprevail causing discrimination between similarly\nplaced persons. Thus, in the facts and circumstances\nof the case and in the light of the above discussion,\nwe find that the State has not made any grounds to\ninterfere with the orders passed in the writ petitions\nand therefore, the writ appeals are liable to be\ndismissed and the similar writ petitions are liable to\nbe allowed.\n\n31.In the result,\n\n(i)W.A(MD)Nos.51 of 2018, 1431 and 1432 of\n2017 are dismissed, confirming the orders passed in\nW.P(MD)Nos.22833 of 2016, 15903 of 2012 and 22832\nof 2016. No costs. Consequently, connected\nC.M.P(MD)No.262 of 2018, 10923 and 10927 of 2017\nare dismissed.\n\n(ii)All other writ petitions filed by the Plot\nWatchers are allowed, as prayed for. No costs.\nConsequently, connected W.M.P(MD)Nos.4753 and\n4754 of 2018 are closed.\n\n(iii)The appellants/respondents are directed\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in to verify the service particulars of all the writ\npetitioners and count 50% of the services rendered by\nthem on temporary basis and consequently refix their\npension within a period of four months from the date\nof receipt of a copy of this Judgment/ order.\n\n(iv)In case, where the petitioners/employees\nhad died, the benefit shall accrue to their legal heirs\nand the payment shall be effected in the name of\none of the legal heirs after obtaining proper\nauthorisation from the other legal heirs.\n\n(v)So far as W.P(MD)No.6878 of 2017 is\nconcerned, though the petitioner seeks for promotion\nto the post of Plot Watcher, the same is a misnomer\nas it is not a promotion, but absorption in the post of\nForest Watcher. Therefore, whatever the relief\ngranted to the other petitioners, shall enure in favour\nof this petitioner also and the writ petition stands\ndisposed of accordingly. No costs.\n\n(vi)In W.P(MD)No.22510 of 2015, apart from\nseeking for regularisation of the services by counting\n50% of the services rendered as Plot Watcher, the\npetitioner seeks for pensionary benefits also. This\nCourt has directed that the benefit of 50% of the\nservices should be reckoned, while calculating the\nlength of service. Thus, if the petitioner has attained\nthe age of superannuation, it goes without saying\nthat consequential revision in pensionary benefits are\nrequired to be settled and the writ petition stands\ndisposed of accordingly. No costs.”\n\n34. Yet another decision of another Division Bench of\nthis Court, which is latest in this regard is the decision\nmade in WA(MD) No.844 of 2018 dated 03.07.2018 in the\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nmatter of State of Tamil Nadu represented by Secretary,\nSchool Education Department and others v. C.Jeya Rani\nGnana Devi.\n\n35. In the said judgment, dated 03.07.2018, the\nDivision Bench of this Court has passed the following order:\n\n“4. When the matter is taken up for hearing,\nthe learned counsel appearing for the respondent\nsubmitted that the issue involved in the present writ\nappeal is covered by the decision of a Division Bench\nof this Court dated 21.04.2017 made in W.A(MD)Nos.\n392, 393 and 389 of 2017 etc., batch, wherein the\nDivision Bench held as follows:\n\n“10. The Writ Court further observed that in\nthe light of the decision of the Hon'ble First Bench,\nthe Rule itself stands impliedly overruled. That\napart, it was held that if the benefit is not granted,\nit would amount to discriminating the similarly\nplaced persons. Further, the Writ Court noted that\nthe Government has chosen to extend certain\nbenefits in respect of part time workers as found in\nG.O.Ms.No.39, 13.06.2011 and therefore, the benefit\ncannot be denied to part time vocational instructors\nby stating that the said Government Order is\napplicable to panchayat clerks and not to vocational\ninstructors.\n\n11. Learned Additional Government Pleader\nafter elaborately referring to the factual matrix\nplaced reliance on the decision of the Division Bench\nin the case of the Principal Secretary Social Welfare\nand Nutritious Meal Programme Department and\nothers vs. M.Palanikani made in W.A.Nos.587 etc.,\nbatch dated 03.12.2014 and submitted that the\nDivision Bench has allowed the appeals and set aside\nthe order passed by the learned single Judge wherein\nrelief was granted to count 50% of the services in the\nnoon meal scheme.\n\n12.Firstly, we may point out that the terms of\nemployment of staff in the noon meal scheme are not\nin pari materia with that of the terms of appointment\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in of vocational instructors. This fact cannot be denied\nby the appellants. Furthermore, in paragraph 21 of\nthe said judgment, the Court framed the question\nwhich has to be decided with a specific reference\nand a cutt off date which had been fixed namely, on\n01.04.2003. Admittedly, all the writ petitioners were\nappointed much prior to the said date and the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Division Bench is factually\ndistinguishable. Thus, we are of the considered view\nthat the impugned order having been rendered by\nreferring to and relying upon the decisions of the\nHon'ble First Bench, we find no grounds to take a\ndifferent view in the matter. Accordingly, the writ\nappeals are dismissed. No Costs. Consequently,\nconnected miscellaneous petitions are closed.”\n\n5. Mr.Baskarapandian, learned Special\nGovernment Pleader appearing for the appellants\nalso fairly submitted that the issue involved in the\npresent writ appeal is covered by the decision relied\non by the learned counsel for the respondent.\n\n6. In view of the submissions made by the\nlearned counsel on either side, following the\njudgment made in W.A(MD)Nos.392, 393 and 389 of\n2017 etc., batch dated 21.04.2017, the writ appeal is\nliable to be dismissed and accordingly, the same is\ndismissed. No Costs. Consequently, connected\nMiscellaneous Petition is closed.”\n\n36. From the reading of the aforesaid judgments,\nespecially, the later decisions rendered by two Division\nBenches of this Court, it become clear that, the view taken\nby this Court insofar as the confirmation of benefit of\ncalculating 50% of the past services rendered by the\nemployees, who worked as Vocational Instructors or\notherwise on temporary basis before they brought in\nregular time scale of pay and regular absorption, had been\nconsistently followed by various Division Benches of this\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nCourt.\n37. There had been earlier judgments of the Division\nBenches and there had been later judgments of the\nDivision Benches including the recent one passed, just\nbefore a week or two. While so, the only Division Bench\ndecision dated 06.04.2018 made in W.A.No.882/2017, as\nhas been relied upon by the learned Special Government\nPleader takes a slightly different view, where also, the\nprinciple in extending the said benefit had been accepted,\nbut the only prohibition was that the same shall not be\nextended hereafter to any such employee, who comes to\nthe Court, after 06.04.2018. In this regard, the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners have relied upon a Full Bench\njudgment of the Patna High Court reported in AIR 1987\nPatna 191, in Amarsingh Yadav and another v. Shanti\nDevi and others.\n\n38. One of the question posed before the Full Bench\nfor resolvement is as follows:\n\n“(1) Where there is a direct conflict between\ntwo decisions of the Supreme Court, rendered by co-\nequal Benches, which of them should be followed by\nthe High Court and the Court below ?”\n\n39. After elaborate consideration, the Full Bench has\ngiven its answer, which reads thus:\n\n“24. To conclude on this aspect, it is held that\nwhere there is a direct conflict between two\ndecisions of the Supreme Court rendered by co-equal\nBenches, the High Court must follow that judgment\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nwhich appears to it to state the law more elaborately\nand accurately. The answer to question (1) posed at\nthe outset is rendered in these terms.”\n\n40. Therefore, the principle was, as enunciated in\nthe said Full Bench judgment of the Patna High Court that,\nif two conflicting decisions are available, rendered by co-\nequal benches, the High Court must follow the judgment,\nwhich appears to it to state the law more elaborately and\naccurately.\n\n41. If the said principle is applied to the facts of the\npresent case, except the decision dated 06.04.2018 of a\nDivision Bench of this Court, no other Division Bench either\nprior to or after to that, has taken any different view, as\nthe one taken in the said judgment and in all other Division\nBench judgments, a uniform and consistent stand taken by\nthis Court was that, the benefit of taking into account 50%\nof the services rendered by the employees before they\nbrought into regular service shall be the basis for\ncalculating for the purpose of pension and retiral benefits.\nEven in the said judgment dated 06.04.2018 in W.A.No.\n882/2017, that view was accepted and endorsed by the\nsaid Division Bench also, but the only embargo the Division\nBench has put in that, the said benefit cannot be extended\nto those who come to the Court hereafter. In order to\nmeet out the said embargo, the aforesaid judgments of the\nHon'ble Apex Court, as referred to above, with regard to\nthe continuous cause of action and the benefit, which has\nbeen declared by the Court through a judgment in rem has\nto be extended to similarly placed persons, had been\nquoted.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in 42. In view of the settled legal position, as has been\ndeclared in all these decisions, all these petitioners, even\nthough filed writ petitions recently and some of them\nmight have filed after 06.04.2018 i.e., the date, on which\nthe aforesaid Division Bench Judgment had been rendered\nby this Court, in the opinion of this Court, are entitled to\nget the similar benefits, as that of the benefits which have\nalready been given to the number of similarly placed\nemployees / Teachers.\n\n43. Therefore, the observations made in the\naforesaid judgment made in W.A.No.882 of 2017 and etc.,\nbatch, as has been heavily relied upon by the learned\nSpecial Government Pleader in this regard, would no way\nadvance the case of the respondents and that no way be\nhelpful to the respondents to deny the lawful right of the\npetitioners, which have already been accrued and has been\ncontinuously accruing every month because the pensionary\nbenefits are to be disbursed till the death of the\nemployee / death of the legal heirs. Therefore, the said\nobjection raised by the respondents are liable to be\nrejected, accordingly, they are rejected.\n\n44. In view of the aforesaid judgments, wherein the\nissue as has been put forth by the learned counsel for the\npetitioners, having been dealt with and decided more than\nonce by the Writ Court and the same has been confirmed\nby the Division Bench of this Court more than once and in\ncases, where SLP preferred before the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt, wherein also the view taken by this Court has been\nconfirmed, all these petitioners are entitled to, for\ncalculating 50% of the past services, rendered by each of\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe petitioners in the respective employment before they\ngot absorbed by bringing them under the time scale of pay\nirrespective of the years of service, for the purpose of\npensionary benefits. Hence, these petitioners also shall be\nentitled to get the same benefits and accordingly, all these\nwrit petitions are fit to succeed.\n\n45. In the result, these writ petitions are allowed\nand the respective respondents in each of the writ\npetitions are hereby directed to take into account the 50%\nof the past services rendered by each of the petitioners\neither as Vocational Instructors or any other employment\neither as a Part Time / Full time / adhoc / temporary /\ndaily wages employees before they brought in under the\nregular time scale of pay on permanent basis or absorption\nand by calculating the said 50% of their past service,\npension eligibility and pension enhancement or difference\nof pay and pension shall be calculated and disbursed in\nfavour of the respective petitioners. After fixing the\nrevised pension by taking into account the past 50%\nservices, the revised pension arrears shall be calculated\nand to be disbursed to the petitioners within a period of 12\nweeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. It\nis needless to mention that the petitioners shall continue\nto receive the revised pension.\n\n46. Insofar as W.P.(MD)Nos.6065 of 2016 and 6789 of\n2017 are concerned, the petitioners since having not been\npaid any pension so far, the aforesaid exercise shall be\nundertaken by the respective respondents in that writ\npetitions also and the entire arrears of pension shall be\ndisbursed to the said petitioners within the said time frame\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nindicated above.\n47. Insofar as W.P.(MD)No.11896 of 2018 is\nconcerned, since the petitioner is the widow of the\nemployee, the pensionary benefits shall be calculated,\naccordingly, as indicated, and arrears till the death of the\npetitioner's husband shall be calculated and thereafter, the\nfamily pension arrears shall be calculated and all the\narrears shall be disbursed to the petitioner i.e., the widow\nof the employee, within the period of twelve weeks, from\nthe date of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\n48. With these directions all these writ petitions are\nallowed as indicated above. No costs.”\n\n8. Since the said issue has been considered and decided already in\n\nnumber of cases and in some of the cases, even though appeal filed before\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court, the decision rendered by this Court has been\n\nconfirmed and accordingly, in those cases, the orders passed by this Court\n\nhave been complied with. When that being the position, since one of the\n\npetitioner herein is still working as Teacher and some of them have already\n\nretired, and in both, the benefits now sought by these petitioners given\n\nraise to them as a continuous cause of action and therefore, the accrued\n\nright on the part of the petitioners and it is still accruing every month\n\ncannot be taken away merely by placing a predicament or impediment that\n\nthose, who approaches this Court belatedly, cannot be granted the relief or\n\nextended the similar relief extended to similar persons.\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n9. In this regard, in the aforesaid decision of Mine, I have given a\n\ndetailed and thorough consideration on the case laws and in view of the\n\nsettled legal propositions, the said embargo, as has been taken by the\n\nlearned Special Government Pleader in those batch of cases, by citing the\n\nsaid Division Bench judgment dated 06.04.2018, cannot be applicable to\n\nthese cases also. Hence, this Court has no hesitation to grant the similar\n\nrelief, which have already been granted to similarly persons, to these writ\n\npetitioners also.\n\n10. Accordingly, all these writ petitions are ordered in terms of the\n\nsaid order dated 09.07.2018 by giving the following directions:\n\n“the respective respondents in each of the writ\npetitions are hereby directed to take into account the 50%\nof the past services rendered by each of the petitioners as\nVocational Instructors either as a Part Time / Full time\nemployees before they brought in under the regular time\nscale of pay on permanent basis or absorption and by\ncalculating the said 50% of their past service, pension\neligibility and pension enhancement or difference of pay\nand pension shall be calculated and disbursed in favour of\nthe respective petitioners. After fixing the revised pension\nby taking into account the past 50% services, the revised\npension arrears shall be calculated and to be disbursed to\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\nthe petitioners within a period of 12 weeks from the date\nof receipt of a copy of this order. It is needless to mention\nthat the petitioners shall continue to receive the revised\npension.”\n\nNo costs.
