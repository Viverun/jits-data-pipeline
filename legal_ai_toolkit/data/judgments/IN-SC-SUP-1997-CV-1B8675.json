SARDANA & ORS.\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 11/07/1997\n\nBENCH:\nG.B. PATTANAIK\n\nACT:\n\nHEADNOTE:\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nJ U D G M E N T\nPATTANAIK, J.\n\nI have gone through the erudite judgment prepared by\nBrother Ramaswamy. J. and having given an anxious\nconsideration to the conclusions arrived at I am in\nrespectful disagreement with the same. Taking into account\nthe fact that Brother Ramaswamy, J. would be demiting his\noffice on 13th of July, 1997, and the short time I have at\nmy disposal I have not been able to be as elaborate as my\nbrother. But the two broad features which have persuaded me\nto take a contrary view are that the implementation of the\nconclusions arrived at by Brother Ramaswamy, J. would lead\nto a situation where a direct recruit like Mr. B.D. Sardana\nas an Assistant Executive Engineer in the year 1977 would\nbecome senior to the promotees like Shri S.S. Bhola who were\npromoted as Executive Engineer way back in 1971 long before\nthe entry of Mr. Sardana into the services. Further when the\nlegislatures being aware of the aforesaid gross inequities\nand anomalous situation have come forward with a legislation\nby enacting an Act and giving it retrospective effect from\nthe date the State of Haryana came into existence the Court\nshould try to sustain the Act unless the Act is found to be\nrepugnant to any of the constitutional provision. With the\naforesaid background I have endeavoured broadly with the\nquestions that arose for consideration.\n\nThese appeals by Special Leave as well as the Transfer\nCases relate to the age old problem in almost all services\ni.e. determination of inter-se seniority between the direct\nrecruits and promotees within a cadre. These cases arise out\nof the directions of this Court in two cases, namely,\nA.N.\nSehgal and others vs. Raje Ram Sheoran and others\n1992 Supp.\n\n(1) Supreme Court\nCases 304 and S.L. Chopra and others vs.\nState of Haryana and others\n- 1992 Supp. (1) Supreme Court\nCases 391 and the seniority list drawn up by the Government\nof Haryana pursuant to the aforesaid direction and the\nintervention by the legislators in enacting an Act called\nthe haryana Service Engineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Building and Roads Branch), Public Health\nBranch) and (Irrigation Branch) Act, 1995 (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the Act\"). Civil appeals nos.\n422/93, 423/93\nand 424/93, Writ Petition No. 582/95, and Transfer Case No,\n44/96 relate to Public Health Branch and the orders passed\nby the State Government determining the inter se seniority\nin the said Branch. Out of these three Civil Appeals one is\nby the State of Haryana and two others are by the promotee\naffected officers belonging to the Public Health Branch and\nthey are aggrieved by the judgment of the Division Bench of\nthe Punjab and Haryana High Court in Letters Patent Appeal.\nWrit Petition No. 582/95 is by direct recruit B.D. Sardana\nunder\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution challenging the\nvalidity of the Act and praving for direction to grant him\nseniority just below the 10 officers who initially\nconstituted the service when the State of Haryana came into\nexistence. Transfer Case No. 44/96 had also been filed by\ndirect recruit in the Punjab and Haryana High Court\nchallenging the validity of the Act which has been\ntransferred pursuant to the orders of this Court. Civil\nAppeal Nos. 1448-49/93 filed by the State and Civil Appeal\nNos. 1452-53/93 filed by the promotee officers belonging to\nthe Irrigation Branch are directed against the judgment of\nthe Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in\nLetters Patent Appeal which arose out of a Writ Petition\nfiled by one M.L. Gupta who was directly appointed as an\nAssistant Executive Engineer on 27.8.1971. Transfer Case No.\n40/96 is the Writ Petition filed by Shri Gupta challenging\nthe validity of the Act which stood transferred to this\nCourt pursuant to the orders of this Court. The brief facts\nleading to the enactment of the Act may be stated as under:-\n\nThe separate State of Haryana came into existence on\n1.11.1966. When Punjab and Haryana was one State, the\nrecruitment and conditions of service of Engineers in the\nState was being regulated by Rules framed by the Governor of\nPunjab in exercise of powers conferred by proviso under\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution. The set of Rules dealing\nwith the Engineers of the Public Health Branch was called\n\"The Punjab Service Engineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Public Health Branch) Rules 1961. A similar set\nof Rules had also been framed by the Governor under Proviso\nto\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution for the Engineers\nbelonging to the Roads and Building Branch called the Punjab\nService of Engineers, Class I, Public Works Department\n(Roads and Buildings Branch) Rules, 1960. The provisions of\nthese two rules are almost identical. A third set of Rules\nalso had been framed by the Governor for Engineers belonging\nto the Irrigation Branch, called \"The Punjab Service of\nEngineers, Class I. Public Works Department (Irrigation\nBranch) Rules. After the formation of the State of Haryana\nthe Government of Haryana adopted all the aforesaid three\nRules to deal with the service conditions of the Engineers\nbelonging to the three branches, namely, the Public Health\nBranch, the Roads and Buildings Branch and the Irrigation\nBranch. The dispute relating to the fixation of seniority of\npromotees and direct recruits in the Roads and Buildings\nBranch came up for consideration before this Court in the\ncase of\nA.N. Sehgal and others vs. Raje Ram Sheoran and\nothers\n- 1992 Supp (1) Supreme Court Cases 304, and this\nCourt after thorough analysis of different provisions of the\nRules relating to the Roads and Buildings Branch interpreted\nthe Rules of seniority and directed the Government of\nHaryana to determine the cadre post regularly from time to\ntime and to issue orders appointing substantively to the\npost within the quota and determine the inter se seniority\nbetween the promotees and the direct recruits in the\nrespective quota cadre post of Executive Engineer.\n\nThe\nprovisions of the Public Health Branch Rules came up for\nconsideration in the case of\nS.L. Chopra & others vs. State\nof Haryana and Others\n1992 Supp. (1) Supreme Court Cases\n391, and the dispute\nin that case\nalso was the determination\nof inter se seniority between the direct recruits and the\npromotees. This Court also interpreted the relevant\nprovisions of the Rules for determination of inter se\nseniority in the Public Health Branch and directed the State\nGovernment to determine the cadre strength in Haryana\nService of Engineers, Class I, PWD (Public Health Branch)\nRules of the posts of Executive Engineer, Superintending\nEngineer and Chief Engineer and consider the cases of the\nappellant in the said case as well as the respondents for\npromotion to the senior posts of Executive Engineers,\nSuperintending Engineers and Chief Engineers respectively\nwith the respective quota of 50 per cent and make\nappointment if found eligible and fit for promotion. It may\nbe stated that the Rules relating to Irrigation Branch which\nis slightly different from both the aforesaid Rules, namely,\nthe Public Health Branch and Roads and Buildings Branch had\nnever cropped up for consideration. After the aforesaid two\njudgments of this Court and pursuant to the directions\nissued, the State Government began the exercise of fixing\nthe cadre strength during each year commencing from 1966 and\nalso began determination of inter se seniority of the\npromotees and direct recruits in the different posts within\nthe service and also drew up the seniority list of the\nemployees. The first set of seniority list was drawn up on\n6.4.92 and being aggrieved by the said seniority list Writ\nPetitions were filed and the Punjab and Haryana High Court\nhaving quashed the same, Special Leave Petitions were filed\nin this Court. During the pendency of the Special Leave\nPetitions in this Court and prior to the hearing of the\ncases two other sets of seniority lists had been drawn up,\none on 13.3.1997 and another on 19.3.97 and strenuous\narguments had been advanced in support of and against the\naforesaid lists drawn up by the Government.\n\nThe main attack\nto the aforesaid list is that the earlier directions issued\nby this Court in\nSehgal\n's case (supra) as well as Chopra's\ncase (supra) have not been duly followed in drawing up the\nseniority list.\n\nSubsequent to the judgment of the Punjab and\nHaryana High Court striking down the seniority list prepared\nby the Government pursuant to the directions of this Court\nin\nChopra\n's case (supra) the Haryana Legislators enacted the\nAct to regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of\npersons appointed in all the three branches and the validity\nof the said Act had been challenged in the Writ Petitions\nfiled in Punjab and Haryana High Court.\nThose Writ Petitions\nhave been transferred to this Court and have been numbered\nas Transfer case.\nElaborate arguments were advanced by the\ncounsel for parties challenging the validity of the\naforesaid Act basically on the ground that it seeks to\nmerely annul the judgment of this Court in\nSehgal\n's case\n(supra) and in\nChopra\n's case (supra) which is not\npermissible in law.\n\nIt may be stated that if the Act is held\nto be valid then necessarily the seniority list drawn up by\nthe State Government pursuant to the directions of this\nCourt in\nSehgal\n's case (\nsupra) and Chopra\n's case (supra)\nwill not bold good and a fresh seniority list has to be\ndrawn up as the Act in question has been given retrospective\neffect with effect from the date of the formation of the\nState of Haryana in November 1966.\n\nIf the Act is held to be\nultra vires then also it has to be examined whether the\nseniority list drawn up by the State Government is in\naccordance with the earlier direction given by this Court in\n\nSehgal\n's case (\nsupra) and Chopra\n's case (supra) and if not\nwhat further directions are necessary? It is in this context\nit must be borne in mind that in the earlier cases only the\nprinciples of determination of inter se seniority between\nthe direct recruits and the promotees had been considered\nand adjudge bet as to how the initial allottees to the\nservices would be considered there was no adjudication in as\nmuch as that question did not crop up for consideration.\n\nSo far as the public health branch is concerned, on the\ndate of the formation of the State of Haryana 14 persons\nwere brought from the erstwhile Punjab cadre of Engineers of\nconstitute the initial cadre in the State of Haryana and\nsince the cadre strength of the service in Haryana was only\n10, four of these persons were adjusted against ex-cadre\npost. While bringing persons from the erstwhile Punjab cadre\nto Haryana the relevant Rules and the quota of direct\nrecruit and promotees in the service had not been borne in\nmind and officers were brought from the erstwhile Punjab\ncadre depending upon the domicile of the employees. In other\nwords, those who belonged to the Haryana State were brought\nover to Haryana cadre and in regulating the cadre strength\nthe ratio between direct recruits and promotees as per\nRecruitment Rules then in force has not been observed. In\nthe aforesaid premises a question which would arise for\nconsideration and ultimate decision would be as to how these\n10 officers who were brought over from the erstwhile Punjab\nState and constituted the initial cadre strength of service\nin Haryana would be dealt with? This question had not been\ndealt with either in\nSehgal\n's case or in Chopra's case\nreferred to supra. At this stage it would be appropriate to\nnotice as to what was decided by this Court in Sehgal and\nChopra. Sehgal deals with roads and building branch. In that\ncase, one, R.R. Sheoran challenged Gradation List and the\nseniority assigned to Sehgal and others by filing a writ\npetition in Punjab and Haryana High Court. The Division\nBench of the High Court came to hold that Sheoran was a\nmember of the service from the date of his initial\nappointment as Assistant Executive Engineer whereas Sehgal\nand others who were promoted were not members of the\nservice. This decision was challenged by Sehgal, a promotee\nofficer and it was agreed between the parties that this\nCourt would decide the principles on consideration of the\nRules and leave the matter for the State Government to\ndetermine the inter se seniority by applying the law. The\nCourt considered Rule 3(1), Rule 3(2), Rule 5(1)(a), Rules 6\nand 7, Rule 11(1), Rule 12(3) and sub-rule (12) of Rule 2.\nThis Court came to the conclusion that a direct recruit\nwould always be recruited and appointed to a substantive\nvacancy and from the date he starts discharging the duty\nattached to the post he is a member of the service subject\nto his successfully completing the probation and declaration\nthereof at a later date and this appointment related back to\nthe date of initial appointment, subject to his being\ndischarged from service on failure to complete the probation\nwithin or extended period or termination of the service\naccording to rules. So far as a promotee is concerned it was\nheld that a promotee would have initial officiating\npromotion to a temporary vacancy or substantive vacancy and\non successful completion and declaration of the probation,\nunless reverted to lower posts, he awaits appointment to a\nsubstantive vacancy. Only on appointment to a substantive\nvacancy he becomes a member of the service. It was also held\nthat a direct recruit appointed to an ex-cadre post alone is\na member of the service even while on probation and Rule\n2(12)(a) applies to them and it does not apply to a promotee\nfrom Class II service. This Court also held:\n\n\"on a conjoint reading of Rules\n12(3) and 12(5) it is clear that\nthe year of allotment of the\nAssistant Executive Engineer in the\npost of Executive Engineer, shall\nbe the calendar year in which the\norder of appointment as Assistant\nExecutive Engineer had been made.\nThus his seniority as Executive\nEngineer, by fiction of law, would\nrelate back to his date of initial\nappointment as Assistant Executive\nEngineer and in juxtaposition to\nClass II officers' seniority as\nExecutive Engineer is unalterable\".\n\nSince Shri Sheoran was appointed as an Assistant\nExecutive Engineer on August 30, 1971, it was directed that\nhis seniority as Executive Engineer shall accordingly be\nreckoned. While interpreting Rule 5(2) and proviso thereto\nit was held that the intendment appears to be that so long\nas the direct recruit Assistant Executive Engineer, eligible\nand considered fit for promotion is not available, the\npromotee from Class II service in excess of the quota is\neligible to occupy in officiating capacity the senior posts,\ni.e., Executive Engineers and above. The moment direct\nrecruits are available, they alone are entitled to occupy 50\nper cent of their quota posts and the promotees shall give\nplace to the direct recruits. On the question what is the\ndate from which the seniority of a promotee as Executive\nEngineer shall be reckoned, the Court held that a promotee\nwithin quota under Rule 5(2) gets his seniority from the\ninitial date of his promotion and the year of allotment, as\ncontemplated in Rule 12(6) shall be the next below `the\njuniormost officer in the service whether officiating or\nconfirmed as Executive Engineer before the former's\nappointment' counting the entire officiating period towards\nseniority, unless there is break in the service or from the\ndate of later promotion. Such promotee, by necessary\nimplication, would normally become senior to the direct\nrecruit promoted later. Combined operation of sub-rules (3)\nto (5) of Rule 12 makes the direct recruit a member of the\nservice of Executive Engineer from the date of year of\nallotment as an Assistant Executive Engineer. The result is\nthat the promotee occupying the posts within 50 per cent\nquota of the direct recruits, acquired no right to the post\nand should yield to direct recruit, though promoted later to\nhim, to the senior scale posts i.e., Executive Engineer,\nSuperintending Engineer and Chief Engineer. The promotee has\nright to confirmation in the cadre post as per Rule 11(4) if\na post is available to him within his quota or at a later\ndate under Rule 5(2) read with Rule 11(4) and gets\nappointment under Section 8(11). His seniority would be\nreckoned only from the date of the availability of the post\nand the year of allotment, he shall be next below to his\nimmediate senior promotee to that year or the juniormost of\nthe previous year of allotment whether officiating or\npermanent occupying the post within 50 per cent quota. The\nofficiating period of the promotee between the dates of\ninitial promotion and the date of the availability of the\ncadre post would thus be rendered fortuitous and stands\nexcluded. A direct recruit on promotion within the quota,\nthough later to the promotee is interposed in between the\nperiods and interjects the promotee's seniority's snaps the\nlinks in the chain of continuity and steals a march over the\napproved promotee probationer. Harmonious construction of\nRules 2(1), 2(2), 2(7), 2(10), 2(12), 2(12)(a), 5(2)(a), 8,\n9(2), 11, 12(3), 12(5) to 12(7) would yield to the above\nresult, lest the legislative animation would be defeated and\nthe rules would be rendered otiose and surplus. It would\nalso adversely affect the morale and efficiency of the\nservice. Mere officiating appointment by promotion to a\ncadre post outside the quota; continuous officiating therein\nand declaration of probation would not clothe the promotee\nwith any right to claim seniority over the direct recruits.\nThe necessary conclusion would, therefore, be that the\ndirect recruits shall get his seniority with effect from\nthe date of the year of the allotment as Assistant Executive\nEngineer which is not alterable. Whereas the promotee would\nget his seniority w.e.f. the date of the availability of the\nposts within 50 per cent quota of the promotees. The year of\nallotment is variable and the seniority shall be reckoned\naccordingly. Appointment to the cadre post substantively and\nconfirmation thereof shall be made under Rule 8(11) read\nwith Rule 11(4) of the Rules. A promotee Executive Engineer\nwould only then become member of the service. `Appointed\nsubstantively' within the meaning of the Rule 2(12)(a) shall\nbe construed accordingly. We, further hold that the\nseniority of the promotee from Class II service as Executive\nEngineer shall be determined with effect from the date on\nwhich the cadre post was available to him and the seniority\nshall be determined accordingly.\" Ultimately this Court\ndirected the Government of Haryana to determine the cadre\nposts, if not already done, regularly from time to time\nincluding the post created due to exigencies of service in\nterms of Rule 3(2) read with Appendix `A' and allot the\nposts in each year of allotment as contemplated under Rule\n12 read with Rule 5(2)(a) and issue orders appointing\nsubstantively to the respective posts within the quota and\ndetermine the inter se seniority between the appellants\ntherein who were promotees and Sheoran, direct recruits in\nthe respective quota cadre posts of Executive Engineer. The\nCourt also held that the inter se seniority of the direct\nrecruits and promotees shall be determined in accordance\nwith the principles laid down.\n\nIn\nS.L. Chopra\n's case, which deals with Public Health\nBranch, this Court held that direct recruits get seniority\nfrom the date of appointment as Assistant Executive Engineer\nand it is unalterable. But the promotee's seniority is\nvariable by operation Rules 8(11) and 11(4); 2(12)(a) and\n5(2) of the Rules. The State Government was accordingly\ndirected to determine the cadre strength in the Haryana\nService of Engineers, Class I PWD (Public Health Branch)\nunder the rules, Executive Engineers, Superintending\nEngineers and Chief Engineers and consider the cases of the\nappellants therein as well as the contesting respondents\nB.D. Sardana, F.L. Kansal for promotion to the senior posts\nof Executive Engineers, Superintending Engineers and Chief\nEngineers respectively with the respective quota of 50 per\ncent and make appointment if found eligible and fit for\npromotion. In the said case the appellant was a promotee\nand the respondents were direct recruits.\n\nThe seniority list which was drawn up on 6.4.92 assumed\nthat out of ten incumbents who originally constituted the\nservice in the Public Health Branch five have to be treated\nas directed recruits fictionally under Rules 5(3) and 5 as\npromotees so that the disparity in the ratio will not\ninfluence the future promotion. The seniority list which was\ndrawn up on 19.3.97 took the ten incumbents originally\nconstituted service belonging to the quota of promotees\nsince factually all of them were promotees under the Punjab\nRules and then determined the inter se seniority of direct\nrecruits and the promotees by application of law\nlaid down\nby\nthis Court in\nSehgal\n's case (\nsupra) and Chopra\n's case\n(supra).\n\nIn course of his submissions, Mr. Tulsi appearing for\nthe State demonstrated that the Seniority List which was\ndrawn up on 19.3.77 topsy turbid the position to such an\nextent that a direct recruit as Assistant Executive Engineer\nwho was not even born on the cadre when a promotee had been\nappointed as the Executive Engineer, such direct recruit\nbecame senior to the promotee Executive Engineer. Such gross\ninequity which was resulted on account of giving effect to\nthe Rules in force and interpreted by this Court in Sehgal\nand Chopra persuaded the legislature to intervene by\nenacting the Act and giving it retrospective effect.\n\nLet us now examine the validity of the Act itself which\nwas challenged by the direct recruits in filing writ\npetitions in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana and those\nwrit petitions stood transferred to this Court. Mr. Sachar,\nthe leaned counsel appearing for the writ petitioners -\ndirect recruits contended that the Act is nothing but an\nusurpation of judicial power by the legislature to annual\nthe judgments of this Court in Sehgal and Chopra and it\nmerely declares the earlier judgments to be invalid without\nanything more and as such is invalid and inoperative.\nFurther the Act takes away the rights accrued in favour of\nthe direct recruits pursuance to the judgments of this Court\nin Sehgal and Chopra and consequently the Act must be struck\ndown. The learned counsel also urged that the mandamus\nissued by this Court in Sehgal and Chopra has to be complied\nwith and the State Legislature has no power to make the\nmandamus ineffective by enacting an Act to override the\njudgment of this Court which tantamounts to a direct in-road\ninto the sphere occupied by judiciary and consequently the\nAct has to be struck down. This argument of Mr. Sachar was\nalso supported by Mr. Mahabir Singh, the learned counsel\nappearing for the petitioners in T.P. (Civil) No. 46 of 1997\nin his written submissions and it was urged that in any view\nof the matter the legislatures could not have given\nretrospective operation to the Act itself with reference to\na situation that was in existence 25 years ago and such an\nact of the legislature must be held to be invalid as was\nheld by this Court in the case of\nSTATE OF GUJARAT AND\nANOTHER VS. RAMAN LAL KESHAV LAL SONI AND OTHERS\n. (1983) 2\nS.C.C. 33. In elaborating the contention that the Act merely\npurports to override the judgment of this Court in Sehgal\nand Chopra the learned counsel referred to the Objects and\nReasons of the Act as well as the affidavit filed on behalf\nof the State Government which would unequivocally indicate\nthat the Act was enacted to get over the judgments of this\nCourt in Sehgal and Chopra.\n\nMr. K.T.S. Tulsi, the learned senior counsel for the\nState of Haryana and Mr. D.D. Thakur and Dr. Rajeev Dhawan,\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the promotee\nrespondents on the other hand contended that the power of\nthe State Legislature under\nArticles 245\nand\nof the\nConstitution is wide enough to make law determining the\nservice conditions of the employees of the State and it is\nundisputed position of law that the legislature can make law\ngiving it retrospective effect. According to the learned\ncounsel the legislature having been aware of the inequities\nsituation which have been the result of the Rules which were\noperating for determination of the inter se seniority\nbetween the direct recruits and the promotees as interpreted\nby this Court in Sehgal and Chopra, intervened in enacting\nthe Act to remove the aforesaid inequities not by merely\ndeclaring the interpretation given by this Court to the\nrelevant provisions of the Rules in Sehgal and Chopra to be\ninvalid but by making substantial alterations and changes to\nthe basis itself and as such the legislatures cannot be said\nto have encroached upon the field of judiciary nor the\nlegislation can be held to be an act of usurpation of the\njudiciary nor the legislation can be held to be an act of\nusurpation of judicial power by the legislatures. According\nto the learned counsel the basic changes made in the Act are\nby altering the definition of service by addition of sub-\nclause (c), by providing the quota of promotees could exceed\nbeyond 50% as per proviso to Section 5(2) and by changing\nthe very criteria for determination of seniority namely the\ncontinuous length of service as engrafted in Section 12(2)\nand these changes having been made and the legislative\ncompetence not having been assailed, the Act must be held to\nbe valid piece of legislation. It was also contended by the\nlearned counsel that in deciding the constitutionality of\nthe Act the Court can look into the Objects and Reasons of\nthe Act only when there is ambiguity in the substantive\nprovisions of the Act itself, but where there is no\nambiguity in the language of the Act which declares the\nintention of the legislature, the Court would not be\njustified in looking to the Objects and Reasons for the\nenactment or the affidavit filed by the State Government to\nhold that the legislatures have usurped the judicial power\nand have enacted the Act merely to get over the judgments of\nthis Court and mandamus issued by this Court in Sehgal and\nChopra. According to the learned counsel in enacting the Act\nthe legislature has taken into account the needs of the\nadministration and laid down the principles for determining\nthe inter se seniority in consonance with the accepted norms\nof service jurisprudence namely determination of seniority\non the basis of length of continuous service in the cadre\nwhich was also observed by this Court in the two earlier\ncases while interpreting the Rules of 1961 which was\noperative in determination of inter se seniority of the\nemployees. The learned counsel further urged that no vested\nright of any employee has been taken away by the Act\ninasmuch as to obtain a particular position in the seniority\nlist within a cadre is neither a vested right of an employee\nnor can be said to be fundamental right under Part - III of\nthe Constitution. Mr. Tulsi, learned counsel appearing for\nthe State of Haryana in this context said that by operation\nof the Act no employee whether a direct recruit or a\npromotee would be reverted to any lower post from the post\nto which promotion has already been made even if he is found\nto be junior to others in the rank of Executive Engineer and\nas such the contention of Mr. Sachar and Mr. Mahabir Singh\nthat it takes away a vested right of the employees is\nincorrect in law. Lastly, it was contended that the\nlegislative competence having been conceded and the Act not\nhaving been found to be contrary to any of the fundamental\nrights under Part - III of the Constitution the only\nquestion that requires consideration is whether it\ntantamounts to usurpation of judicial power by the\nlegislature and for the contentions already advanced the Act\nnot being one merely declaring a law\nlaid down by\nthis Court\nto be invalid, there has been no usurpation of judicial\npower, and therefore, the same is a valid piece of\nlegislation determining the service conditions of the\nemployees in the State of Haryana and this Court will not be\njustified in holding the Act to be invalid. A large number\nof authorities were cited at the Bar in support of their\nrespective contentions which we will notice while examining\nthe correctness of the rival submissions.\n\nAt the outset it must be borne in mind that in the case\nof\nSehgal\n(supra) as well as\nChopra\n(supra) this Court had\nnot invalidated any provisions of the recruitment rules but\nmerely interpreted some provisions of the Rules for\ndetermining the inter se seniority between the direct\nrecruits and the promotees. The Act passed by the\nlegislature, therefore, is not a validation Act but merely\nan Act passed by the State Legislature giving it\nretrospective effect from the date the State of Haryana came\ninto existence and consequently from the date the service in\nquestion came into existence. The power of the legislature\nunder\nArticle 246(3)\nof the Constitution to make law for the\nState with respect to the matters enumerated in List II of\nthe VIIth Schedule to the Constitution is wide enough to\nmake law determining the service conditions of the employees\nof the State. In the case in hand there has been no\nchallenge to the legislative competence of the State\nlegislature to enact the legislation in question and in our\nview rightly, nor there has been any challenge on the ground\nof contravention of Part III of the Constitution. Under the\nconstitutional scheme the power of the legislature to make\nlaw is paramount subject to the field of legislation as\nenumerated in the Entries in different Lists. The function\nof the judiciary is to interpret the law and to adjudicate\nthe rights of the parties in accordance with law made by the\nlegislature. When a particular Rule or the Act is\ninterpreted by a Court of law in a specified manner and the\nlaw making authority forms the opinion that such an\ninterpretation would adversely effect the rights of the\nparties and would be grossly inequitious and accordingly a\nnew set of Rule or Law is enacted, it is very often\nchallenged as in the present case on the ground that the\nlegislatures have usurped the judicial power. In such a case\nthe Court has a delicated function to examine the new set of\nlaws enacted by the legislatures and to find out whether in\nfact the legislatures have exercised the legislative power\nby merely declaring an earlier judicial decision to be\ninvalid and ineffective or the legislatures have altered and\nchanged the character of the legislation which ultimately\nmay render the judicial decision ineffective.\n\nIt cannot be\ndisputed that the legislatures can always render a judicial\ndecision ineffective by enacting valid law on the topic\nwithin its legislative field fundamentally altering or\nchanging its character retrospectively as was held by this\nCourt in the case of\nIndian Aluminum Company vs. The State\nof Kerala\n(1996) 7 Supreme Court Cases 637. What is really\nprohibited is that legislature cannot in exercise of its\nplenary power under\nArticle 245\nand\nof the Constitution\nmerely declare a decision of a Court of Law to be invalid or\nto be inoperative in which case it would be held to be an\nexercise of judicial power. Undoubtedly under the scheme of\nConstitution the legislature do not possess the same.\nBearing in mind the aforesaid principles it is necessary to\nexamine the legality of the Act in question. If we do not\nexamine the substantive provisions of the Act and merely go\nby the object and reasons as given for the enactment of the\nAct as well as the counter affidavit field on behalf of the\nState then the Act would be possibly held to be an intrusion\nto the judicial sphere by the legislature. The Statements of\nObjects and Reasons while introducing the Bill in Haryana\nVidhan Sabha is extracted herein below in extenso:-\n\n\"There was separate rules\nregulating service conditions and\nfixation of seniority in the\nEngineering Services in P.W.D., B &\nR., Public Health and PWD\nIrrigation Branch. These rules\nalthough different for the three\nbranches were on identical lines\nwith minor variations. These rules\nhave been interpreted in the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nA.N.\nSehgal versus R.R. Sheoran\nand S.L.\nChopra versus B.D. Sardana.\n\nSubsequently, the judgment has been\ninterpreted further in the case of\n\nA.N. Sehgal versus R.R. Sheoran\nby\nan order dated 31st March, 1995 of\nthe Supreme Court in a Contempt\nPetition filed by Shri R.R.\nSheoran.\n\nIn the Public Health side,\nthe seniority list prepared under\nthe directions of the Supreme Court\nin S.L. Chopra versus B.D.\nSardana's case was challenged in\nthe High Court which struck down\nthe list., Thereafter, an appeal\nwas filed by the State in the\nSupreme Court against the order of\nthe High Court in the case of\nState\nversus B.D. Sardana\n. The appeal was\nadmitted by the Supreme Court and\nthe operative portion of the\njudgment of the High Court was\nstayed. The matter is pending for\nfinal decision in the Supreme\nCourt, and mean while the seniority\nlist prepared by the State is being\noperated by Public Health Branch.\n\n2. Meanwhile, consequent to the\ndirections given by the Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nA.N. Sehgal\nvs. R.R. Sheoran\nand orders of the\nSupreme Court dated 31st March,\n1995 in the Contempt Petition filed\nby R.R. Sheoran subsequently the\nseniority list had to be redrawn in\nthe case of B & R Branch, which was\ntotally at variance with the\nmanner in which the seniority was\ndrawn up in the case of Public\nHealth Branch. Thus, the directions\nof the Supreme Court in the case of\nB & R Branch had created a lot of\nAdministrative problems with\ncertain very junior officers\ngetting undue seniority and\nbecoming senior to the officers\nunder whom they were previously\nworking. The naturally resulted in\nsever groupism and tension between\nofficers of the department in their\nday today working.\n\n3. In order to have uniform rules\nfor all three branches of\nEngineering services and to clarify\nthe position in an unambiguous\nmanner so as to have uniformity and\nclarity in interpretation, it\nbecame necessary to make certain\namendments with retrospective\neffect. This was possible only by\nenacting a legislation in this\nregard. As the Haryana Vidhan Sabha\nwas no in Session, it was decided\nto achieve the purpose through\nissue of an Ordinance on 13th May,\n1995. The Ordinance replaced the\nexisting rules for all the three\nbranches of the PWD and the common\nenactment was to govern the service\nmatters of Class-I service B & R\nBranch, Public Health Branch and\nIrrigation Branch.\"\n\nThe relevant portion of the affidavit of Shri S.N.\nTanwar, Joint Secretary to the Government of Haryana filed\nin the Punjab and Haryana High Court indicating the ground\nwhich impelled the legislature to enact the legislation in\nquestion may be extracted hereinunder:-\n\n\"This interpretation by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\ncaused great hardships to the promotees. In order to remove\nthis hardship to the promotees an Ordinance was issued on\n\n13.5.1995 which has now become an Act No. 20 of 1995 after\nassent of the Governor of Haryana on 30.11.1995. If this\nOrdinance/Act is not issued the net result of the Order of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court would be that the directly\nrecruited Assistant Executive Engineer would be considered\nto be Executive Engineer from the date he was recruited as\nAssistant Executive Engineer. The interpretation of the\njudgment of the Supreme Court create such a situation that\npersons who were promotees and were working as Executive\nEngineer years before even the Assistant Executive Engineers\nwere recruited became junior to the latter when the latter\nwas promoted as Executive Engineer. This w as somehow\nconsidered by the Government to be very seriously hampering\nproper working of the department. Giving such a seniority to\na person recruited as Assistant Executive Engineer have\neffected adversely the effective working of the department\nbecause the persons who are occupying the posts much higher\nto the Executive Engineer and above could became junior to\nAssistant Executive Engineer who is recruited even after the\npromotees have been discharging their duties on these higher\nposts. If such a situation will continue to prevail the\npromotees will not be able to working that capacity when\nthey would considered to be junior to the persons who were\nrecruited to Class I service much later than their\npromotions. Moreover, the Government of Haryana always\nconsidered that the Assistant Executive Engineer directly\nrecruited would deem to be having a seniority from the date\nwhen he is actually promoted as Executive Engineer. Since\nthe Supreme Court did not accept this interpretation it\nbecame essential for the Government of Haryana inter alia\nfor the reasons mentioned above to issue this Act\nretrospectively.\"\n\nIf these materials are alone considered then one may be\npersuaded to accept the submission of Mr. Sachhar, the\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the direct recruits -\nWrit Petitioners, that the Act in question was merely to\ndeclare the earlier decisions of this Court in\nSehgal\n\n(supra) and in\nChopra\n(supra) a invalid and as such is\nusurpation of the judicial power by the legislature. But it\nis a cardinal rule of interpretation that Objects and\nReasons of a statue is to be look into as an extrinsic aid\nto find out legislative intent only when the meaning of the\nstatute by its ordinary language is obscure or ambiguous.\nBut if the words used in a statue are clear and unambiguous\nthen the statue itself declares the intention of the\nlegislature and in such a case it would not be permissible\nfor a Court to interpret the Statute by examining the\nObjects the Reasons for the Statute question.\n\nIn the case of\nASWINI KUMAR GHOSH AND VS. ARABINDA BOSE\nAND ANOTHER\n, S.C.R. (1953) 1, Patanjali Sastri, J., speaking\nfor the majority of the Court, emphatically ruled out the\nObjects and Reasons appended to a Bill an aid to the\nconstruction of a statute. It was observed:\n\n\"As regards the propriety of the\nreference to the Statement of\nObjects and Reasons, it must be\nremembered that it seeks only to\nexplain what reasons induced the\nmover to introduce the Bill in the\nHouse and what objects he sought to\nachieve. But those objects and\nreasons may or may not correspond\nto the objective which the majority\nof members had in view when they\npassed it into law. The Bill may\nhave undergone radical changes\nduring its passage through the\nHouse or Houses, and there is no\nguarantee that the reasons which\nled to its introduction and the\nobjects thereby sought to be\nachieved have remained the same\nthroughout till the Bill emerges\nfrom the House as an Act of the\nLegislature, for they do not form\npart of the Bill and are not voted\nupon by members. We, therefore,\nconsider that the Statement of\nObjects and Reasons appended to the\nBill should be ruled out as an aid\nto the construction of the\nstatute.\"\n\nIn the case of\nTHE CENTRAL BANK OF INDIA VS. THEIR\nWORKMEN\n. S.C.R. (1960) 200, S.K. DAS, J., reiterated the\nprinciple:\n\n\"The Statement of Objects and\nReasons is not admissible, however,\nfor construing the section far less\ncan it control the actual words\nused\".\n\nSinha, J., in the case of\nSTATE OF WEST BENGAL VS.\nUNION OF INDIA, S.C.R.\n(1) (1964) 371 held:-\n\n\"It is well settled that the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons\naccompanying a Bill, when\nintroduced in Parliament cannot be\nused to determine the true meaning\nand effect of the substantive\nprovisions of the statute. They\ncannot be used except for the\nlimited purpose of understanding\nthe background and the antecedent\nstate of affairs leading up to the\nlegislation\".\n\nIn the case of\nTATA ENGINEERING AND LOCOMOTIVE CO. LTD.\nVS. GRAM PANCHAYAT, PIMPRI WAGHERE\n, (1976) 4 SCC 177, this\nCourt did not accept the recital in the Statement of Objects\nand Reasons that the amendment was made for the reason that\nthe Panchayats could not levy tax on buildings and held that\nthe word `houses' as originally used was comprehensive\nenough to include all buildings including factory buildings\nand that the amendment only made explicit what was\nimplicit\".\n\nThe general rule of interpretation is that the language\nemployed is primarily the determining factor to find out the\nintention of the legislature. Gajendragadker, J. as he then\nwas in the case of\nKANAI LAL SUR VS. PARAMNIDHI SADHUKHAN,\nS.C.R.\n1958 360 had observed that \"the first and primary\nrule of construction is that he intention of the legislature\nmust be found in the words used by the legislature itself\".\n\nIn the case of ROBERT WIGRAM CRAWFORD VS. RICHARD SPOONER, 4\nMIA 179 (PC) p. 1987 Lord Brougham had stated thus \"If the\nlegislature did intend that which it has not expressed\nclearly; much more if the legislature intended something\nvery different; if the legislature intended pretty nearly\nthe opposite of what is said, it is not for judges to invent\nsomething which they do not meet within the words of the\ntext\". Thus when the plain meaning of the words used in a\nstatute indicate a particular state of affairs the courts\nare not required to get themselves busy with the \"supposed\nintention\" or with \"the policy underlying the statute\" or to\nrefer the objects and reasons which was accompanied the Bill\nwhile introducing the same on the floor of the legislation.\nIt is only when the plain meaning of the words used in the\nstatute creates an ambiguity then it may be permissible to\nhave the extrinsic aid of looking to the Statement of\nObjects and Reasons for ascertaining the true intention of\nthe legislatures. In the aforesaid state affairs to find out\nwhether the impugned Act is a usurpation of judicial power\nby the legislature it would not be permissible to look to\nthe Statement of Objects and Reasons which accompanied the\nBill while introducing the same on the floor of the\nlegislation nor the affidavit filed by an officer of the\nGovernment would control the true and correct meaning of the\nwords of the statute. It would, therefore, be necessary to\nexamine the Act itself and the changes brought about by the\nAct and the consequences thereof in relation to the\ndecisions of this Court in Sehgal and Chopra interpreting\nthe Rules of seniority which were in force and which stood\nrepealed by the Act itself.\n\nThe Preamble of the Act which is a key to the enactment\nclearly indicates that it is an act for consolidation of\nruled relating to different Branches. It reads thus:-\n\n\"to regulate the recruitment and\nconditions of service of persons\nappointed to the Haryana Service of\nEngineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Building and Roads\nBranch), (Public Health Branch) and\n(Irrigation Branch) respectively.\"\n\nA comparative study of the provisions of the 1961 Rules\nframed by the Governor in exercise of power under the\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution and 1995 Act\npassed by the Haryana Legislature indicate the following\nchanges which have been brought about by the Act:\n\n(a) The definition of member of\nservice in Rule 2(12) of 1961 rules\nhas been amended. Sub-clause (c)\nhas been inserted in Clause 12 of\nSection 2 of 1995 Act by which an\nofficer awaiting appointment to a\ncadre post has been made a member\nof service.\n\n(b) A proviso has been added to\nSection 5(2) of 1995 Act which\nexpressly provides for exceeding\nthe quota of 50% of officers\npromoted to the post of Executive\nEngineers in the event, adequate\nnumber of Assistant Executive\nEngineers are not available.\n\n(c) The percentage of quota has\nbeen altered from 50% to 75% in the\ncase of Irrigation Branch by\nincorporating a second proviso to\nSection 5(2) of the Act.\n\n(d) The rule with regard to\ndetermination of seniority has been\ncompletely changed from the one\nthat existed in 1961 rules. While\nunder the 1961 rules, according to\nRule 12, no member of service could\nenjoy the benefit of service except\nin accordance with the quota\nprescribed under Rule <??> under\nClause 2 of Section 12 of the Act,\nlength of continuous service for\nthe post of executive engineers,\nhas been made the sole determining\nfactor for the fixation of\nseniority.\"\n\nThe aforesaid changes and alterations in the Act itself\nand giving it retrospective effect w.e.f. the date when the\nState of Haryana came into existence and consequently the\nservice of engineers came into existence, rendered the\nearlier decisions of this Court in Sehgal and Chopra\nineffective. The provisions of the Act and the definition of\n\"service\" in Section 2(12)(c), proviso to Section 5(2) and\nthe criteria for promotion which was engrafted in Section\n12(2) and making it retrospective w.e.f. 1.11.1966, when\ninterpreted lead to the only conclusion that this Court\ncould not have rendered the decision in Sehgal and Chopra on\nthe face of the aforesaid provisions of the Act. It is,\ntherefore, not a case of legislature by mere declaration\nwithout anything more overriding a judicial decision but a\ncase of rendering a judicial decision ineffective by\nenacting a valid law within the legislative field of the\nlegislature. It would be appropriate to extract a passage\nfrom the judgment of this Court in\nINDIAN ALUMINIUM CO. AND\nOTHERS VS. STATE OF KERALA AND OTHERS\n, (1996) 7 S.C.C. 637,\nto which two of us were parties (Ramaswamy. J. and\nPattanaik, J.):\n\n\"In a democracy governed by rule of\nlaw, the legislature exercises the\npower under\nArticles 245\nand\nand other companion articles read\nwith the entries in the respective\nlists in the Seventh Schedule to\nmake the law which includes power\nto amend the law. Courts in their\nconcern and endeavour to preserve\njudicial power equally must be\nguarded to maintain the delicate\nbalance devised by the Constitution\nbetween the three sovereign\nfunctionaries. In order that rule\nof law permeates of fulfil\nconstitutional objectives of\nestablishing an egalitarian social\norder, the respective sovereign\nfunctionaries need free play in\ntheir joints so that the march of\nsocial progress and order remains\nunimpeded. The smooth balance built\nwith delicacy must always be\nmaintained. In its anxiety to\nsafeguard judicial power, it is\nunnecessary to be overzealous and\nconjure up incursion into the\njudicial preserve invalidating the\nvalid law competently made.\"\n\nIt would be appropriate now to examine the different\ncitations made at the Bar. Mr. Sachar, the learned senior\ncounsel in support of his contention that the impugned\njudgment is essentially a usurpation of the judicial power\nby the legislature relied upon the decisions of this Court\nin\nB.S. Yadav and others vs. State of Haryana & others\nand\n\nPritpal Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and Others\n-\n1980 (Supp.) Supreme Court Cases 524, State of Gujarat &\nAnother etc. vs. Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni and others etc. -\n(1983) 2 Supreme Court Cases 33, Ex. Capt.\n\nK.C. Arora and\nAnother vs. State of Haryana and Others\n.\n\n- (1984) 3 Supreme\nCourt\nCases 281, T.R. Kapur and others vs. State of Haryana\nand others\n1986 (Supp) Supreme Court Cases 584, P.D.\nAggarwal and others vs. State of U.P. and others - (1987) 3\nSupreme Court Cases 622, Madan Mohan Pathak and Another etc.\nvs. Union of India and others - (1978) 2 Supreme Court Cases\n\n50. In B.S. Yadav's case (supra) the question for\nconsideration before this Court was whether Governor could\nframe rules relating to conditions of service of judicial\nofficers, and if so, then whether such rule contravenes\n\nArticle 235\nof the Constitution? This Court held that a\ncombined reading of\nArticle 309\nand\nArticle 235\nwould lead\nto the conclusion that though the legislature or the\nGovernor has the power to make Rules regulating the\nrecruitment and the conditions of service of judicial\nofficers of the State and thereby regulate seniority of\njudicial officers by laying down rules of general\napplication, but that power cannot be exercised in a manner\nwhich will lead to interference with the control vested in\nthe High Court by the first part of\nArticle 235.\nIn\nparagraph 76 of the judgment of Court examined the amended\nrule and the retrospectively of the same and held that since\nthe Governor exercises the legislative power under the\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution, it is open to\nhim to give retrospective operation to the rules made under\nthat provision. But the date from which the rules are made\nto operate must be shown to bear, either from the face of\nthe rules or by extrinsic evidence, reasonable nexus with\nthe provisions contained in the rules, especially when the\nretrospective effect extends over a long period and no\nnexus is shown in the present case on behalf of the State\nGovernment. On the aforesaid reasonings the Court came to\nthe conclusion that the retrospective effect that was given\nto the rules is bad in law. In the said case neither this\nCourt examined the question of legislature in-validating a\ndecision of a competent Court of law nor the question\nwhether there has been any intrusion by the legislature into\nthe judicial sphere. We fail to understand how this case is\nof any assistance to the petitioners in the Writ Petitions\nchallenging the validity of the Act.\n\nIn\nRaman Lal\n's case (supra) the employees of the\nPanchayat Services filed a Writ Petition in Gujarat High\nCourt claiming that they are entitled to the benefit of\nrevision of scales of pay which were made on the basis of\nthe recommendation of the Pay Commission. The State of\nGujarat resisted those petitions on the ground that the\nmembers of the Panchayat Service were not government\nservants and, therefore, they are not entitled to claim the\nrelief asked for. The High Court of Gujarat allowed the Writ\nPetition on coming to the conclusion that the members of the\nPanchayat Service belonging to the local cadre were\ngovernment servants and directed the State Government to\nmake suitable orders under Gujarat Panchayat Service\n(Absorption, seniority, pay and allowance) Rules, 1965 and\nseveral other directions to fix the pay scales and allowance\nand other conditions of service of those employees in par\nwith the State Government servants. The State had filed\nappeal against\nthe said judgment\nin the Supreme Court and\nduring the pendency of the appeal an Ordinance was passed\nwhich was later on replaced by the Act. The constitutional\nvalidity of the amending Act was challenged by filing the\nWrit Petition by the ex-Municipal employees who were\nincluded in the local cadre. This Court came to the\nconclusion that the Panchayat Service constituted under\nSection 203 of the Gujarat Panchayat's Act is a Civil\nService of the State and the members of the service are\ngovernment servants. The Court, however, examined the\nvalidity of the\nAmending Act\nand came to the conclusion that\nbefore the\nAmending Act\nwas passed the employees who had\nbeen allocated to the Panchayat Service had achieved the\nstatus of government servants under the provisions of the\nprincipal Act of 1961 and that status as government servant\ncannot be extinguished so long as the posts are not\nabolished and their services were not terminated in\naccordance what the provisions of\nArticle 311\nof the\nConstitution. It is in this context it was observed:-\n\n\"The legislation is pure and\nsimple, self-deceptive, if we may\nuse such an expression with\nreference to a legislature-made\nlaw. The legislature is undoubtedly\ncompetent to legislate with\nretrospective effect to take away\nor impair any vested right acquired\nunder existing laws but since the\nlaws are made under a written\nConstitution, and to have conform\nto the dos and don'ts of the\nConstitution, neither prospective\nnor retrospective laws can be made\nso as to contravene fundamental\nrights. The law must satisfy the\nrequirements of the Constitution\ntoday taking into account the\naccrued or acquired rights of the\nparties today. The law cannot say,\n20 years ago the parties had no\nrights, therefore, the requirements\nof the Constitution will be\nsatisfied if the law is dated back\nby 20 years. We are concerned with\ntoday's rights and not yesterday's.\nA legislature cannot legislate\ntoday with reference to a situation\nthat obtained 20 years ago and\nignore the march of events and the\nconstitutional rights accrued in\nthe course of the 20 years. That\nwould be most arbitrary,\nunreasonable and a negation of\nhistory.\"\n\nThus the Amending Act was held to have offended the\nconstitutional provisions of\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle 311\nand,\ntherefore, was struck down.\n\nThus is Raman Lal, the amending Act had the effect of\ndepriving the ex-Municipal employees of their status of\nmembership under the State without any option to them which\nwas considered to be unconstitutional. In the case in hand\nthe impugned Act and its retrospectivity merely alters the\nseniority within a cadre and such an alteration neither\ncontravenes any constitutional provision nor it affects any\nright under Part - III of the Constitution. In this view of\nthe matter the aforesaid decision is of no assistance to the\ndirect recruit petitioners who have assailed the legality of\nthe Act.\nIn\nK.C. ARORA\n's case, (1984) 3 S.C.C. 281 the\namended provisions being given retrospective effect was\nfound to have affected the accrued fundamental rights of the\nparties.\n\nFollowing the earlier judgment of this Court in\n\nSTATE OF GUJARAT vs. RAMAN LAL KESHAV LAL SONI\n, (1983) 2 SCC\n33, this Court held that the Government cannot take away the\naccrued rights of the petitioners and the appellants, by\nmaking amendment to the rules with retrospective effect. In\nthe aforesaid case under the rules in force the seniority\nhad been determined by counting the period military service.\nUnder the amended rules by giving it retrospective effect\nthe aforesaid benefit had been taken away. This Court,\ntherefore, held that in view of the rules in force and the\nassurances given by the Government the accrued right of\nconsidering the military service towards seniority cannot be\nretrospectively taken away. In the case in hand no such\naccrued rights of the direct recruits are being taken away\nby the Act. On the other hand on account of gross\ninequitious situation the legislatures have enacted an Act\nin consonance with the normal service jurisprudence of\ndetermining the seniority on the basis of continuous length\nof service in a cadre. The aforesaid decision, therefore,\ncannot be said to be a decision in support of the contention\nthat legislature have usurped the judicial power nor is it a\ndecision in support of the contention that by the impugned\nAct any fundamental rights of the direct recruits have been\ninfringed.\n\nIn the case of\nT.R. KAPUR AND OTHER vs. STATE OF\nHARYANA AND OTHERS\n, 1986 (supp) SCC 584, when the validity\nof Punjab Service of Engineers, Class I, PWD (Irrigation\nbranch) Rules, 1964 as amended by State of Haryana by\nnotification dated June 22, 1984 came up for consideration\nthis Court found that the said rule is violative of\nSection\n82(6)\nof the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966, as the prior\napproval of the Central Government had not been taken. On\nthe question of power of the Governor of frame Rules under\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nand to give it retrospective effect\nthe Court held that though the rules can be amended\nretrospectively but any benefit accrued under existing rule\ncannot be taken away. In other words a promotion which has\nalready been held in accordance with the rules in force\ncannot be nullified by the amended rules by fixing an\nadditional qualification for promotion. By the impugned Act\nthe Haryana Legislatures have not purported to nullify and\npromotion already made under the 1961 Rules which was in\nforce prior to being repealed by the impugned Act. Even Mr.\nTulsi, appearing for the State, submitted that no promotion\nalready made under the pre-amended rules will be altered in\nany manner by giving effect to the provisions of the Act. In\nthis view of the matter, the aforesaid decision is also of\nno assistance to the direct recruits.\n\nIn\nMADAN MOHAN PATHAK\nAND ANOTHER vs. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS\n, (1978) 2 SCC 50,\na seven Judge Bench of this Court considered the question of\nthe power of the legislature to annual a judgment of the\ncourt giving effect to rights of a party. There has ben some\nobservations in the aforesaid case which may support the\ncontention of Mr. Sachar inasmuch as this Court observed\nthat the rights which had passed into those embodied in a\njudgment and become the basis of a mandamus from the High\nCourt could not be taken away in an indirect fashion. The\nmain plank of Mr. Sachar's argument is that after the\njudgment of this Court in Sehgal and Chopra interpreting the\nrules of seniority between the direct recruits and\npromotees, the direction of this Court to re-draw the\nseniority list according to the principle\nlaid down by\nthis\nCourt has been taken away by the enactment of the\nlegislature and thus there has been an in-road of the\nlegislature into the judicial sphere. But a deeper scrutiny\nof the decision of this Court in Pathak will not sustain the\narguments advanced by Mr. Sachar.\n\nIn\nPathak\n's case in\naccordance with Regulation 58 a settlement had been arrived\nat for payment of bonus to Class III and Class IV employees\non 24th of January, 1974 and the said settlement had been\napproved by the Central Government. Notwithstanding the\nsettlement when the Life Insurance Corporation did not pay\nbonus, the employees approached the Calcutta High Court. The\nHigh Court, therefore, issued a writ of mandamus on 21st of\nMay, 1976 calling upon the Life Insurance Corporation to pay\nthe bonus in accordance with the settlement in question.\nAgainst the judgment of the learned Single Judge a Letters\nPatent Appeal was preferred and while the said appeal was\npending, the Life Insurance Corporation (Modification of\nSettlement) Act, 1976 came into force on 29th of May, 1976\nand\nSection 3\nthereof purported to nullify the judgment of\nthe Calcutta High Court by the non-obstante clause in\nrelation to provisions of\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n. In other\nwords the Calcutta High Court while issuing mandamus had\nheld the settlement has a binding effect once approved by\nthe Central Government and the same cannot be rescinded. But\nthe impugned Act purported to nullify the rights of the\nemployees working under Class III and Class IV to get annual\ncash bonus in terms of such settlement. It is in this\ncontext in the majority judgment of the Court delivered by\nBhagwati, J., it was observed:\n\n\"that the judgment given by the\nCalcutta High Court is not merely a\ndeclaratory judgment holding an\nimpost or tax to be invalid so that\nt validation statute can remove the\ndefect pointed out by the judgment\namending the law with retrospective\neffect and validate such impost or\ntax. It is a judgment giving effect\nto the right of the petitioners to\nannual cash bonus under the\nsettlement by issuing a writ of\nmandamus directing the LIC to pay\nthe amount of such bonus. If by\nreason of retrospective alteration\nof the factual or legal situation,\nthe judgment is rendered erroneous,\nthe remedy may be by way of appeal\nor review but so long as the\njudgment stands, if cannot be\ndisregarded or ignored and it must\nbe obeyed by the LIC. Therefore, in\nany event, irrespective of whether\nthe impugned Act is\nconstitutionally valid or not, the\nLIC is bound to obey the writ of\nmandamus issued by the Calcutta\nHigh Court and pay annual cash\nbonus for the year April 1, 1975 to\nMarch 31, 1976 to the Class III and\nClass IV employees.\"\n\nIn making the aforesaid observation the Court did not\nconsider the constitutionality of the Act but went by theory\nthat the mandamus issued by the court calling upon a party\nto confer certain benefits to the adversary unless annulled\nby way of appeal or review has to be obeyed. This principle\nhas no application to the case in hand as the nature of\nmandamus which has been issued by this Court in Sehgal and\nChopra was merely a declaration of the principles of\nseniority as per 1961 Rules and the State Government was to\ndraw up the seniority list in accordance with the said\nRules. The legislature by enacting the Act and giving it\nretrospective effect made several vital changes both on the\ndefinition of service as well as the criteria for\ndetermining the inter se seniority between the direct\nrecruits and promotees. The impugned Act as has been stated\nearlier has not taken away any accrued rights of the direct\nrecruits, and therefore, the aforesaid observation in\n\nPathak\n's case really will be of no assistance in deciding\nthe question as to whether the Act purports to have made an\nin-road into the judicial sphere. The majority judgment came\nto hold that the impugned Act is violative of\nArticle 31\n\nClause (2) as the effect of the Act was to transfer\nownership debts due owing to Class III and Class IV\nemployees in respect of annual cash bonus to the Life\nInsurance corporation and there has been no provision for\npayment of any compensation of the compulsory acquisition of\nthese debts. It may be stated that the majority judgment did\nnot consider the question as to whether the legislatures by\nenacting the Act have usurped the judicial power and have\nmerely declared the judgment of a competent court of law to\nbe invalid. Beg, C.J. in his concurring judgment in\nparagraph 32 of the judgment, however, has observed:\n\n\"that the real object of the Act\nwas to set aside the result of the\nmandamus issued by the Calcutta\nHigh Court, though, it does not\nmention as such, and therefore, the\nlearned Judge held that\nSection 3\n\nof the Act would be invalid for\ntrenching upon the judicial power.\"\n\nThree other learned Judges, namely; Y.V. Chandrachud,\nS. Murtaza Fazal Ali and P.N. Shinghal. JJ. agreed with the\nconclusion of Bhagwati, J. but preferred to rest their\ndecision on the sole ground that the impugned Act violates\nthe provisions of\nArticle 31(2)\nof the Constitution and in\nfact they considered it unnecessary to express any opinion\non the effect of the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in\nWrit Petition No. 371 of 1976. Thus out of seven learned\nJudges, six learned Judges rested their decision on the\nground that the impugned Act violates\nArticle 31(2)\nof the\nConstitution and did not consider the enactment in question\nto be an act of usurpation of judicial power by the\nlegislature. The observation of Beg, C.J., in paragraph 32\ndoes not appear to be in consonance with the several\nauthorities of this Court on the point to be discussed\nhereafter. Thus the aforesaid decision cannot be pressed\ninto service in support of Mr. Sachar's contention. In the\naforesaid premises the authorities cited by Mr. Sachar in\nfact do not support the content in urged by the learned\nsenior counsel and on the other hand a series of authorities\nof this Court to be discussed hereafter are directly on the\npoint unequivocally indicating that the power of the\nlegislature to enact law and giving it retrospective effect\nwhich may factually render a decision of a competent court\nof law ineffective cannot be whittled down.\n\nIn\nI.N. SAXENA vs. THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH\n(1976) 3\nSCR 237 a contention had been raised with regard to the\nvalidity of an Act to the effect that the Act has been\npassed to over rule a decision of this Court which the\nlegislature has no power to do. In that case the State of\nMadhya Pradesh had raised age of compulsory retirement for\ngovernment servants from 55 years to 58 years but the very\nMemorandum increasing the age of superannuation empowered\nthe Government to retire a government servant after the\nservant attains the age of 55 years. Thereafter Rules under\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution were framed\nwhereby the age of superannuation was raised to 58 years and\nthere was no provision in the Rules empowering the\ngovernment to retire a government servant after the age of\n55 years. The employee concerned, however, was retired from\nservice on completion of 55 years and the said order on\nbeing challenged the Supreme Court held that the appellant\nwill be deemed to have continued in service inspite of the\norder till he attains the age of 58 years and since the\nappellant had already attained the age of 58 years it is not\npossible to direct that he should be put in service. But he\nwill be entitled to such benefits an may accrue now to him\nby virtue of the success of the Writ Petition. After the\njudgment of the Supreme Court or Ordinance was promulgated\nwhich later on became an Act of the State of Madhya Pradesh\nand the said Act validated the retirement of the government\nservants including the appellant Saxena despite the judgment\nof the Court.\nThe Act\nwas given retrospective effect and it\nempowered a government to retire a government servant on his\nattaining the age of 55 years and the\nAmending Act\nwas\nchallenged on the ground that the legislature has usurped\nthe judicial power. This Court had negatived the said\ncontention and held:-\n\n\"The distinction between a\n\"legislative\" act and a \"judicial\"\n\nact is well known, though in some\nspecific instances the line which\nseparates one category from the\nother may not be easily\ndiscernible. Adjudication of the\nrights of the parties according to\nlaw enacted by the legislature is a\njudicial function. In the\nperformance of this function, the\ncourt interprets and gives effect\nto the intent and mandate of the\nlegislature as embodied in the\nstatute. On the other hand, it is\nfor the legislature to lay down the\nlaw, prescribing norms of conduct\nwhich will govern parties and\ntransactions and to require the\ncourt to give effect to that law.\n\nWhile, in view of this distinction\nbetween legislative and judicial\nfunctions, the legislature cannot\nby a bare declaration, without\nmore, directly over-rule, reverse\nor over-ride a judicial decision,\nit may, at any time in exercise of\nthe plenary powers conferred on it\nby\nArticle 245\nand\nof the\nConstitution render a judicial\ndecision ineffective by enacting or\nchanging with retrospective,\ncurative or neutralising effect the\nconditions on which such decision\nis based. As pointed out by Ray,\nC.J. in\nIndira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj\nNarain\n, the rendering ineffective\nof judgments or orders of competent\ncourts and tribunals by changing\ntheir basis by legislative\nenactment is a well-known pattern\nof all validating Acts. Such\nvalidating legislation which\nremoves the causes for\nineffectiveness or invalidity of\nactions or proceedings is not an\nencroachment on judicial power.\"\n\nIn the case of\nM/S UTKAL CONTRACTORS AND JOINERY (P)\nLTD. AND OTHERS vs. STATE OR ORISSA\n, 1987 (Supp.) Supreme\nCourt Cases 751 a similar contention had been raised but\nnegatived by this Court. In that case the right to collect,\nsale and purchase of sale seeds had been given to the\npetitioner and during the subsistence of the contact Orissa\nlegislature passed an Act called Orissa Forest Produce\n(control of trade) Act 1981. Under the provisions of the\nsaid Act the State issued Notification on 9.12.1982 which\nhad the effect of rescinding the contract of the petitioner.\nThat order was challenged by filing a Writ Petition which,\nhowever, was dismissed by the Orissa High Court. On an\nappeal this Court reversed the decision of the Orissa High\nCourt and held that the Act does not apply to sale seeds on\ngovernment land. A declaration was made by this Court that\nthe Act and the Notification issued under the Act do not\napply to the forest produce grown in government forest and\nthat it was, therefore, open to the government to treat the\ncontract dated 29th May, 1987 as rescinded. The judgments of\nthis Court is reported in (1987) 3 SCC 279. Thereafter on\n29th May 1987 an Ordinance was promulgated, called the\nOrissa Forest Produce (Control of Trade) (Amendment and\nValidation) Ordinance, 1987 and it was given retrospective\neffect as a result of which the earlier decision of this\nCourt became ineffective. The petitioner, therefore,\nchallenged the validity of the same on the ground that the\nlegislature have encroached upon the judicial power and set\naside the binding judgment of this Court. Negativing the\nsaid contention this Court held:-\n\n\"The legislature may, at any time,\nin exercise of the plenary power\nconferred on it by\nArticles 245\nand\nof the Constitution render a\njudicial decision ineffective by\nenacting valid law. There is no\nprohibition against retrospective\nlegislation. The power of the\nlegislature to pass a low\npostulates the power to pass it\nprospectively as well as\nretrospectively. That of course, is\nsubject to the legislative\ncompetence and subject to other\nconstitutional limitations. The\nrendering ineffective of judgments\nor orders of competent courts by\nchanging their basis by legislative\nenactment is a well known pattern\nof all validating acts. Such\nvalidating legislation which\nremoves the causes of\nineffectiveness of invalidity of\naction or proceedings cannot be\nconsidered as encroachment on\njudicial power. The legislature,\nhowever, cannot by a bare\ndeclaration, without more, directly\noverrule, reverse or set aside any\njudicial decision.\"\n\nThis case is to a great extent in pari materia with the\ncase in hand where this Court had earlier interpreted the\nRules determining the inter se seniority between the direct\nrecruits and promotees and thereafter the Haryana\nlegislatures have enacted the Act giving it retrospective\neffect as a result of which earlier decisions of this Court\nin\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra) have become\nineffective.\n\nIn\nBHUBANESHWAR SINGH AND ANOTHER vs. UNION OF\nINDIA AND OTHERS\n1994 6 SCC 77, a three Judge Bench of this\nCourt held:\n\n\"it is well settled that the\nParliament and State Legislatures\nhave plenary powers of legislation\non the subjects within their field.\nThey can legislate on the said\nsubjects prospectively as well as\nretrospectively. If the intention\nof the legislature is clearly\nexpressed that it purports to\nintroduce the legislation or to\namend the existing legislation\nretrospectively, then subject to\nthe legislative competence and the\nexercise being not in violation of\nany of the provisions of the\nConstitution, such power cannot be\nquestioned.\"\n\nThe Court also further held:-\n\n\"that the exercise of rendering\nineffective the judgments or orders\nof competent Courts by changing the\nvery basis by legislation is a well\nknown device of validating\nlegislation and such validating\nlegislation which removes the cause\nof the invalidity cannot be\nconsidered to be an encroachment on\njudicial power.\"\n\nIn rendering the aforesaid decision, this Court relied\nupon heavily on the Constitution Bench decision of this\nCourt in\nShri P.C. Mills Ltd. Vs. Broach Borough\nMunicipality\n(1969) 2 SCC 283.\n\nThe Court also relied upon\nthe decisions of this Court in\nWest Ramona Electric\nDistribution Company Ltd. Vs. State of Madras\n(1963) 2 SCR\n747, Udai Ram Sharma and others etc.\n\nvs. Union of India and\nothers (1968) 3 SCR 41, Krishna Chandra Gangopadhyaya and\nothers vs. Union of India and others (\n1975) 2 SCC 302 and\nHindustan Gum and Chemicals Ltd. Vs. State of Haryana\nand\nother (1985) 4 SCC 124.\n\nIn\nComorin Match Industries (P) Ltd.\nVs. State of Tamil Nadu\n(1996) 4 SCC 281 the same question\nagain came up for consideration. In this case an assessment\norder under the Central Sales Tax was set aside on the basis\nof the decision of Madras High Court in the case of Larsen\nand Tubro. In Larsen and Turbo certain provisions of the Act\nwere declared ultra vires. In an appeal against the judgment\nof Madras High Court the Supreme Court held that the\nprovisions of the\nCentral Sales Tax Act\nwhich had been\ndeclared ultra vires by Madras High Court were validly\nenacted.\nThe Central Sales Tax Act\nwas amended and the\n\nAmending Act\nwas given retrospective effect declaring all\nassessments made upto 9.1.1969 valid and binding. This was\nchallenged on the ground that it tantamounts to over riding\na decision of this Court by Legislatures. Rejecting the said\ncontention this Court held:\n\n\"this is not a case of passing a\nlegislation trying to nullify the\ninterpretation of law given in the\njudgment of a court of law. This is\na case of changing the law itself\non the basis of which the judgment\nwas pronounced holding that the\nassessment orders were erroneous in\nlaw.\"\n\nIn the case of\nIndian Aluminium\n(supra) to which two of\nus Brother Ramaswamy, J. and Pattanaik, J. were parties a\nsimilar contention had been raised and after considering a\nlarge number of authorities of this court and explaining the\ndecision in the case of\nMadan Mohan Pathak vs. Union of\nIndia\nthis Court negatived the contention and held that when\nthe legislatures enacting the Act has competence over the\nsubject matter and when the said enactment is consistent\nwith the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and the\nearlier defects pointed out by the Court have been removed\nby the legislatures then the enactment is a valid piece of\nlegislation and cannot be struck down by the Court on the\nground that it encroaches upon the judicial sphere. A\nrelevant passage from the aforesaid decision has already\nbeen quoted in the earlier part of the judgment.\n\nIn MEERUT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND OTHERS ETC. vs.\nSATBIR SINGH AND OTHERS ETC. (1996) 11 SCC 462 on a similar\ncontention being raised this Court negatived the same and\nheld:-\n\n\"It is well settled that when the\nSupreme Court in exercise of power\nof judicial review, has declared a\nparticular statute to be invalid,\nthe legislature has no power to\noverrule the judgment; however, it\nhas the power to suitably amend the\nlaw by use of appropriate\nphraseology removing the defects\npointed out by the court and by\namending the law consistent with\nthe law declared by the Court so\nthat the defects which were pointed\nout were never on statute for\neffective enforcement of the law.\"\n\nA similar view has been expressed by this Court in the\ncase of\nState of Orissa and another vs. Gopal Chandra Rath\nand others\n- (1995) 6 SCC 242.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid\nlegal position when the impugned Act is examined the\nconclusion is irresistible that the said Act cannot be said\nto be an Act of usurpation of the judicial power by the\nHaryana Legislature, but on the other hand it is a valid\npiece of legislation enacted by the State Legislature over\nwhich they had legislative competence under Entry 41 of List\nII of the VIIth Schedule and by giving the enactment\nretrospective effect the earlier judgments of this Court in\n\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra) have become ineffective.\nBut since this does not tantamount to a mere declaration of\ninvalidity of an earlier judgment and nor does it amount to\nan encroachment by the legislature into the judicial sphere\nthe Court will not justified in holding the same to be\ninvalid. Needless to mention that the impugned Act has\nneither been challenged on the ground of the lack of\nlegislative competence nor has it been established to have\ncontravened any provisions of Part III of the Constitution.\nConsequently Mr. Sachhar's contention has to be rejected and\nthe Act has to be declared intra vires. Necessarily,\ntherefore the seniority list drawn up on different dates in\naccordance with the earlier Rules of 1961 will have to be\nannulled and fresh seniority list has to be drawn up in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act since the Act has\nbeen given retrospective effect with effect from 1.11.1996.\nIt may, however, be reiterated that any promotion already\nmade on the basis of the seniority list drawn up in\naccordance with the Recruitment Rules of 1961 will not be\naltered in any manner.\n\nAn ancillary question which arises for consideration is\nwhether on account of the impugned Act any accrued or vested\nright of any of the direct recruits to the service is being\ntaken away? This consideration is relevant inasmuch as\nthough the legislature may be empowered to enact law and\ngive it retrospective effect but such law cannot take away\nany accrued or vested rights of the employees. Under the\n1961 Rules as interpreted by this Court in the case of\nSehgal and Chopra, a direct recruit gets the year of\nallotment as the year in which he is recruited as Assistant\nExecutive Engineer but so far as promotees are concerned\nthey become a member of the service only after they are\nappointed substantively to a cadre post and the quota of\npromotees can't exceed 50% of the total number of posts in\nthe service excluding the posts of Assistant Executive\nEngineers to which direct recruitments are made. Inter se\nseniority between direct recruits and promotees is regulated\nby Rule 12(6) and (7). As a necessary consequence a direct\nrecruit when promoted as Executive Engineer from the post of\nAssistant Executive Engineer was getting seniority over the\npromotee Executive Engineers and this situation has been\navoided by the impugned Act by changing the definition of\n\"service\" in Rule 2(12) of the 1961 Rules, by providing the\nquota for promotees to exceed 50% in certain contingencies\nlike non-availability of direct recruits to man the post of\nExecutive Engineer and by changing the criteria for\ndetermination of inter se seniority and in place of\ndetermination of year of allotment, by providing length of\ncontinuous service to the post of Executive Engineer to be\nthe determining factor. Necessarily, therefore, by the\nimpugned Act a direct recruit in the rank of Executive\nEngineer would come down in the gradation list than what was\nassigns under the Rules of 1961. The question, therefore is\nthat, is the right of a competence under Entry 41 of List II\nof the VIIth Schedule and by giving the enactment\nretrospective effect the earlier judgments of this Court in\n\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra) have become ineffective.\nBut since this does not tantamount to a mere declaration of\ninvalidity of an earlier judgment and nor does it amount to\nan encroachment by the legislature into the judicial sphere\nthe Court will not be justified in holding the same to be\ninvalid. Needless to mention that the impugned Act has\nneither been challenged on the ground of the lack of\nlegislative competence nor has it been established to have\ncontravened any provisions of Part III of the Constitution.\nConsequently Mr. Sachhar's contention has to be rejected and\nthe Act has to be declared intra vires. Necessarily,\ntherefore the seniority list drawn up on different dates in\naccordance with the earlier Rules of 1961 will have to be\nannulled and fresh seniority list has to be drawn up in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act since the Act has\nbeen given retrospective effect with effect from 1.11.1996.\nIt may, however, be reiterated that any promotion already\nmade on the basis of the seniority list drawn up in\naccordance with Recruitment Rules of 1961 will not be\naltered in any manner.\n\nAn ancillary question which arises for consideration is\nwhether on account of the impugned Act any accrued or vested\nright of any of the direct recruits to the service is being\ntaken away? This consideration is relevant inasmuch as\nthough the legislature may be empowered to enact law and\ngive it retrospective effect but such law cannot take away\nany accrued or vested rights of the employees. Under the\n1961 Rules as interpreted by this Court in the case of\nSehgal and Chopra, a direct recruit gets the year of\nallotment as the year in which he is recruited as Assistant\nExecutive Engineer but so far as promotees are concerned\nthey become a member of the service only after they are\nappointed substantively to a cadre post and the quota of\npromotees can't exceed 50% of the total number of posts in\nthe service excluding the posts of Assistant Executive\nEngineers to which direct recruitments are made. Inter se\nseniority between direct recruits and promotees is regulated\nby Rule 12(6) and (7). As a necessary consequence a direct\nrecruit when promoted as Executive Engineer from the post of\nAssistant Executive Engineer was getting seniority over the\npromotee Executive Engineers and this situation has been\navoided by the impugned Act by changing the definition of\n\"service\" in Rule 2(12) of the 1961 Rules, by providing the\nquota for promotees to exceed 50% in certain contingencies\nlike non-availability of direct recruits to man the post of\nExecutive Engineer and by changing the criteria for\ndetermination of inter se seniority and in place of\ndetermination of year of allotment, by providing length of\ncontinuous service to the post of Executive Engineer to be\nthe determining factor. Necessarily, therefore, by the\nimpugned Act a direct recruit in the rank of Executive\nEngineer would come down in the gradation list than what was\nassigns under the Rules of 1961. The question, therefore is\nthat, is the right of a government servant to get a\nparticular position in the gradation list is a vested or\naccrued right? The answer to this question has to be in the\nnegative. As early as in 1962 this Court in the case of THE\nHIGH COURT\nOF CALCUTTA vs. AMAL KUMAR ROY\n, (1963) 1 S.C.R.\n437, in the Constitution Bench considered the question\nwhether losing some places in the seniority list amounted to\nreduction in rank, and came to hold:\n\n\"In the context of Judicial Service\nof West Bengal, \"reduction in rank\"\n\nwould imply that a person who is\nalready holding the post of a\nSubordinate Judge has been reduced\nto the position of a Munsif, the\nrank of a Subordinate Judge being\nhigher than that of a Munsif. But\nSubordinate Judge in the same cadre\nhold the same rank, though they\nhave to be listed in order of\nseniority in the Civil List.\n\nTherefore, losing some places in\nthe seniority list is not\ntantamount to reduction in rank.\n\nHence, it must be held that the\nprovisions of\nArticle 311(2)\nof the\nConstitution are not attracted to\nthis case.\"\n\nTo the said effect the judgment of this Court in the\ncase of\nTHE STATE OF PUNJAB vs. KISHAN DAS\n, (1971) 3 S.C.R.\n389, wherein this Court observed:\n\n\"an order forfeiting the past\nservice which has earned a\nGovernment servant increments in\nthe post or rank he holds,\nhowsoever adverse it is to him,\naffecting his seniority within the\nrank to which he belongs or his\nfuture chances of promotion does\nnot attract\nArticle 311(2)\nof the\nConstitution since it is not\ncovered by the expression reduction\nin rank.\"\n\nThus to have a particular position in the seniority\nlist within a cadre can neither be said to be accrued or\nvested right of a Government servant and losing some places\nin the seniority list within the cadre does not amount to\nreduction in rank even though the future chances of\npromotion gets delayed thereby. It was urged by Mr. Sachar\nand Mr. Mahabir Singh appearing for the direction recruits\nthat the effect of re-determination of the seniority in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act is not only the\ndirect recruits lose a few places of seniority in the rank\nof Executive Engineer but their future chances of promotion\nare greatly jeopardise and that right having been taken away\nthe Act must be held to be invalid. It is difficult to\naccept this contention since chances of promotion of\nGovernment servant are not a condition of service.\nIn the\ncase of\nSTATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER vs. CHANDRAKANT\nANANT KULKARNI AND OTHERS\n, (1981) 4 S.C.C. 130 this Court\nheld:\n\n\"Mere chances of promotion are not\nconditions of services and the fact\nthat there was reduction in the\nchances of promotion did not\ntantamount to a change in the\nconditions of service. A right to\nbe considered for promotion is a\nterm of service, but mere chances\nof promotion are not\".\n\nTo the said effect a judgment of this Court in the case\nof\nK. JAGADEESAN vs. UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS\n, (1990) 2\nS.C.C. 228, where in this Court held:\n\n\"the only effect is that his\nchances of promotion or his right\nto be considered for promotion to\nthe higher post is adversely\naffected. This cannot be regarded\nas retrospective effect being given\nto the amendment of the rules\ncarried out by the impugned\nnotification and the challenge to\nthe said notification on that\nground must fail\".\n\nAgain in the case of\nUNION OF INDIA AND OTHER vs. S.L.\nDUTTA AND ANOTHERS\n, (1991) 1 S.C.C. 505, this Court held:\n\n\"in our opinion, what was affected\nby the change of policy were merely\nthe chances of promotion of the Air\nVice-Marshals in the Navigation\nStream. As far as the posts of Air\nMarshals open to the Air Vice-\n\nMarshals in the said stream were\nconcerned, their right or\neligibility to be considered for\npromotion still remained and hence,\nthere was no change in their\nconditions of service\".\n\nIn\nZOHRABI vs. ARJUNA AND OTHERS\n, (1980) 2 S.C.C. 203,\nthis Court observed that\n\"a mere right to take advantage of\nthe provisions of an Act is not an\naccrued right\".\n\nThe aforesaid observation would equally apply to the\ncase in hand since the only argument advanced on behalf of\nthe direct recruits was that the advantage which they we re\nreceiving under the 1961 Rules to get their seniority in the\nrank of Executive Engineer is being taken away by the\nimpugned Act. Since the said right is not an accrued right\nthe legislatures were well within their power to make the\nlaw.\n\nIn the aforesaid premises, it must be held that the\ndirect recruits did not have a vested right nor any right\nhad accrued in their favour in the matter of getting a\nparticular position in the seniority list of Executive\nEngineers under the pre-amended Rules which is said to have\nbeen taken away by the Act since such a right is neither a\nvested right of an employee nor can it be said to be an\naccrued right. Thus there is no bar for the legislature to\namend the law in consequence of which the inter se position\nin rank of Executive Engineer might get altered.\nconsequently, we see no invalidity in the enactment of the\n\nHaryana Service of Engineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Building and Roads Branch) (Public Health\nBranch) and (Irrigation Branch) Respectively Act, 1995\n.\nThough the Act in question is a valid piece of legislation\nbut it is difficult to sustain\nSection 25\nof the Act in toto\nsince a plain reading of the said provision does not make\nout any meaning.\nSection 25\nof the Act is quoted hereinbelow\nin extenso:-\n\n\"25. The Haryana Service of\nEngineers Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Buildings and Roads\nBranch), (Public Health Branch) and\n(Irrigation Branch) Respectively\nOrdinance, 1995 (Haryana Ordinance\nNo. 6 of 1995), is hereby repealed.\nThe Punjab Service of Engineers,\nClass-I, Public Works Department\n(Buildings and Roads Branch) Rules,\n1960, the Punjab Service of\nEngineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Public Health Branch)\nRules, 1961, the Punjab Service of\nEngineers Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Irrigation Branch)\nRules, 1964, in their application\nto the State of Haryana, are also\nhereby repealed to the extent that\nthese rules shall continue to apply\nto the person who were members of\nthe Service before 1st day of\nNovember, 1966;\n\nProvided that such repeal shall not\neffect--\n\n(a) any penalty or punishment\nimposed as a result of disciplinary\nproceedings;\n\n(b) any disciplinary action or\nproceedings initiated or pending\nunder the rules so repealed;\n\n(c) any relaxation in\nqualifications granted to any\nmember of the service under the\nrules so repealed;\n\n(d) the benefits accrued to the\npersons who have retired from\nservice during a period commencing\nfrom the 1st day of November, 1966\nand ending with the date of\npromulgation of the Haryana Service\nof Engineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Buildings and Roads\nBranch), (Public Health Branch) and\n(Irrigation Branch) respectively\nOrdinance, 1995.\n\nand the Punjab Service of\nEngineers, Class I, Public Works\nDepartment (Building and Roads\nBranch) Rules, 1960, the Punjab\nService of Engineers, Class I,\nPublic Works Department (Punjab\nHealth Branch) Rules 1961 and the\nPunjab Service of Engineers, Class\nI, Public Works Department\n(Irrigation Branch) Rules, 1964,\nshall continue to be in force as if\nthe same had not been repealed.\"\nThe aforesaid provision repeals the previous Rules\nframed under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution as\nwell as repealed the Ordinance of 1995. It also saves the\naction taken in respect of matters enumerated in Clause a to\nd. It further purports to indicate that the earlier Rules\nwould apply to the person who were members of the service\nbefore 1st day of November 1996 though on a plain reading of\nthe main part of Section 25 really does not convey the\naforesaid meaning. The learned counsel appearing for the\nState of Haryana could not indicate as to what is the true\nmeaning of Section 25. Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned senior\ncounsel, however, in course of his arguments contended that\nthough on a plain grammatical meaning being given to Section\n25 is not susceptible of representing the true intention of\nthe Legislature and in fact it conveys absolutely no meaning\nbu the Court should fill up the gap by applying the\nprinciple of causes and provide the work \"except\" in the\nfirst part of Section 25 after the worked \"to the extend\"\n\nand such filling up being done the provisions of Section 25\nwould convey the true intention of the legislature. Though\non principles Mr. Dhawan, learned senior counsel may be\nright in this submission that Courts can apply the principle\nof causes omissus and fill the gap by adding certain words\nwhen the Statute does not convey the correct meaning. But it\nthe case in hand we do not think it appropriate to apply\nthat principle, inasmuch as the Act itself having been given\nretrospective effect with effect from 1st November, 1966 the\ndate on which the State of Haryana came into existence there\nis no rational to apply the pre existing rules to those\nemployees who were members of the service before that date\neven after the pre-existing rule is being repealed by the\nAct. In this view of the matter we hold that the expression\n`to the extent that these rules shall continue to apply to\nthe persons who were members of the Service before 1st day\nof November, 1966' is invalid and is accordingly struck\ndown. Remaining part of Section 25 as well as the proviso to\nthe said Section will, however, remain operative.\n\nThough in view of our conclusion that the Act is intro\nvirus, the inter se seniority of the concerned officers are\nrequired to be re-determined in accordance with the Act\nitself, subject however, to the restrictions that promotions\nalready made will not be annulled but since the judgment of\nthe Punjab and Haryana High Court in favour of the direct\nrecruit B.D. Sardana was rendered by interpreting the\nRecruitment Rules of 1961 and relying upon the earlier\ndecisions of this Court in\nSehgal and Chopra\n(supra) it\nwould be appropriate for us to also deal with the said\njudgments since an appeal has been carried to this Court by\nthe promotees in Civil Appeal No. 422 of 1993.\n\nAfter the\njudgment of this Court in\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra)\nwhen the State Government drew up the seniority list in the\nrank of Executive Engineers on 6.4.92 Shri Sardana who had\nbeen appointed directly as an Assistant Executive Engineer\non 7.12.1977 challenged the said seniority list claiming\ntherein that initially 10 officers having formed the cadre\nwhen haryana became a separate State and all of them being\npromotees and as such the quota of promotees was in excess\nof the 50% which is the permissible quota under the\nRecruitment Rules, he should be given the position just\nafter 10 persons who constituted the initial cadre\nirrespective of the fact that he was recruited on 7.12.1977.\n\nThe further contention before the High Court was that the\nState Government was not entitled to re-determine the cadre\nstrength each year after the judgment of this Court in\n\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra). The High Court by the\nimpugned judgment appears to have been persuaded to accept\nboth these contentions and the promotees, therefore, have\nassailed the legality of the same.\n\nMr. D.D. Thakur, learned\nsenior counsel appearing for these promotees as well as Dr.\nRajiv Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for some of\nthe promotees urged that the High Court was in error to hold\nthat the State Government was not entitled to re-determine\nthe cadre strength each year retrospectively subsequent to\nthe judgment of this Court in\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n\n(supra). It was contended that 10 persons who constituted\nthe initial cadre when the State of Haryana was formed and\nall those 10 persons having been allocated to Haryana from\nthe erstwhile State of Punjab on the basis of their domicile\nit would be reasonable to construe and apply the Recruitment\nRules which was in force in Punjab and which had been\nadopted by Haryana by fictionally holding the recruitment of\n10 persons to be the initial recruitment to the cadre and by\nfictionally holding that the Recruitment Rules which was\nadopted by Haryana was in fact came into existence so far as\nthe State of Haryana is concerned on 1.11.1966. According to\nthe learned counsel unless such a construction is given the\nposition will be very anomalous and direct recruits like\nShri Sardana will be senior to promotees who had been\npromoted even in the year 1968 or 1969 even though Sardana\nwas recruited as an Assistant Executive Engineer only on\n7.12.1977. According to the learned counsel the Rule in\nquestion cannot be construed in such a manner to bring about\ngross inequities and, therefore, a reasonable construction\nshould be made.\n\nMr. Sachhar, learned senior counsel and Mr.\nMahabir Singh, learned counsel appearing for the direct\nrecruits and Mr. Sardana, appearing in person, on the other\nhand, submitted that it was not necessary for the State\nGovernment to redetermine the cadre strength every year\nretrospectively since the judgment of this Court in\nSehgal\n\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra) merely authorises the Government\nto determine the cadre strength if it has not already been\ndone. According to the learned counsel such re-determination\nof cadre strength every year has been mala fidely done by\nincreasing the strength of the cadre so as to accommodate\nthe promotees within 50% quota available for them under the\nRecruitment Rules and, therefore, such redetermination must\nbe struck down and the High Court has rightly struck down\nthe same. It was also contended on their behalf that the\ninitial cadre having been constituted on 1.11.1966 and the\nentire cadre being filled up by application of the\nprovisions of the Recruitment Rules, 5 of them were beyond\nthe permissible limit of 50% quota in the service.\nConsequently until the cadre strength is so maintained so as\nto bring down the ratio of 50% so far as the promotees are\nconcerned any direct recruit may during the intervening\nperiod must be held to be senior to such promotees and\ntherefore, the High Court was fully justified in holding\nthat Mr. Sardana should rank below 10 persons who\nconstituted the initial cadre irrespective of the hardship\nthat may be caused to the promotees. According to the\nlearned counsel while interpreting a particular rule the\nCourt is not required to look into the hardship which the\ninterpretation may cause so long as the rules are\nunambiguous.\n\nIt was ultimately contended that the High Court\nhas rightly struck down the seniority list that has been\ndrawnup on 6.4.1992 as well as the determination of cadre\nstrength made by the state government and, further the list\nthat was drawn up on 15.4.1997, while the appeals were\npending in this Court is the correct gradation list\nreflecting he inter se seniority of the direct recruits and\npromotees correctly in accordance with the interpretation of\nthe rules given by this Court in the case of\nSehgal\n(supra)\nand\nChopra\n(supra).\n\nThe rival submissions require a careful\nexamination of the relevant provisions of Rule of 1961 as\nwell as in the light of the earlier decisions of this Court\nin\nSehgal\n(supra) and\nChopra\n(supra). Before examining the\nsame it may be stated that the Division Bench of the Punjab\nand Haryana High Court in the impugned judgment came to the\nconclusion that the State Government was not entitled to re-\ndetermine the cadre strength retrospectively and by such\naction of the State Government by increasing the cadre\nstrength promotees have been given undue advantage and\ndirect recruits like B.D. Sardana have lost their vested\nright and, therefore, such an order cannot be sustained in\nlaw. The High Court also further came to the conclusion that\non carving of State of Haryana when the initial cadre was\nfixed at 10 and 10 persons brought over from erstwhile State\nof Punjab the Recruitment Rules of 1961 must be made\napplicable to them and consequently the quota of promotees\ncannot exceed 50%. In this view of the matter since all the\n10 persons who constituted the cadre in 1966 were promotees\nand thus far beyond the permissible quota of 50% the first\ndirect recruit in the cadre Shri Sardana must be given 11th\nposition in the seniority list and he would be senior to all\nthose promotees who were promoted after the initial\nformation of the cadre irrespective of their date of\npromotion as an Executive Engineer and irrespective of the\ndate on which Mr. Sardana was appointed directly as an\nAssistant Executive Engineer on 7.12.1977.\n\nAs has been\nstated earlier, this Court in\nA.N. Sehgal\n's case (supra) on\nconsidering the recruitment rules decided the principles for\ndetermination of inter se seniority between the direct\nrecruits and the promotees and left the matter for the State\nGovernment to re-determine the same by applying the law as\ndeclared by this Court. While interpreting the provisions of\nthe Rules the Court came to hold that a promotee within\nquota under Rule 5 (2) gets his seniority form the initial\ndate of his promotion and the year of allotment, as\ncontemplated in Rule 12(6) shall be the next below `the\njuniormost officer in the service whether officiating or\nconfirmed as Executive Engineer before the former's\nappointment' counting the entire officiating period towards\nseniority, unless there is break in the service or from the\ndate of later promotion. Such promotee, by necessary\nimplication, would normally become senior to the direct\nrecruit promoted later. Combined operation of sub-rules (3)\nto (5) of Rule 12 makes the direct recruit a member of the\nservice of Executive Engineer form the date of year of\nallotment as an Assistant Executive Engineer. The\nCourt\nfurther held\nthat necessary conclusion would, therefore, be\nthat the direct recruits shall get seniority with effect\nfrom the date of the year of the allotment as Assistant\nExecutive Engineer which is not alterable. Whereas the\npromotee would get his seniority with effect from the date\nof the availability of the posts within 50% quota of the\npromotees and the year of allotment is variable and the\nseniority shall be reckoned accordingly. In concluding\nparagraph of the judgment the Court directed the Government\nof Haryana to determine the cadre posts regularly form time\nto time including the post created due to exigencies of\nservice in terms of Rule 3(2) read with Appendix `A' and\nallot the posts in each year of allotment as contemplated\nunder Rule 12 read with Rule 5(2)(a) and issue orders\nappointing substantively to the respective posts within the\nquota and determine the inter se seniority between the\npromotees and direct recruits in the respective quota cadre\nposts of Executive Engineers etc.\n\nin\nSehgal\n(supra) the\nCourt was dealing with the service of Engineers Class I PWD\n(Roads and Building) Branch.\n\nSimilarly in\nChopra\n(supra) the\nCourt dealt with the service of Engineers (Public Health\nBranch), the rules of Public Health Branch being the same as\nthe rules in Roads and Building Branch. In concluding\nparagraph of\nthe said judgment\nthough an affidavit had been\nfiled by one of the appellants that the State Government has\ndetermined the cadre strength but this Court declined to go\ninto the question and left it open to the Government of\ndetermine the seniority after giving opportunity to all\nparties in the light of the law\nlaid down in\nthe case.\n\nIn\n\nChopra\n's case (supra) in paragraph 10 of the judgment this\nCourt had observed that under Rule 3(2) read with Appendix\n`A' the State Government is enjoined to determine the cadre\npost from time to time and during the first 5 years on first\nday of January every year and later from time to time and\ndivide the posts as per the ratio f the available cadre post\nto the promotees and the direct recruits and shall make\nappointment in a substantive capacity.\n\nIn course of argument Mr. K.T.S Tulsi, learned senior\ncounsel appearing for the State of Haryana had pointed out\nthat the State Government had taken steps for making direct\nrecruitment to the cadre but as no competent people were\navailable, per force the cadre was to be managed by filling\nup the posts by promotees and it was done in the public\ninterest. The learned counsel had urged that there is no\njustification in the arguments advanced by the counsel for\ndirect recruits that the promotees were in fact given undue\nfavour. We are, however, really not concerned with this\nsubmission while interpreting the relevant provisions of the\nRules and the Rules having been framed under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution the same has to be\nscrupulously followed. But at the outset on going through\nthe two earlier decisions of this Court in\nSehgal\n(supra)\nand\nChopra\n(supra) there should be no hesitation to come to\nthe conclusion that the High Court was in error to hold that\nthe State Government was not entitled to re-determine the\ncadre strength retrospectively every year and such re-\ndetermination is invalid and inoperative. On the other hand\nsince the cadre strength had not been determined regularly\nthough it was enjoined upon the State Government to do so\nthis Court had called upon the State Government to re-\ndetermine the cadre strength and thereafter determine the\ninter se seniority of the direct recruits and promotees in\nterms of Rule 12 of Recruitment Rules bearing in mind the\nlaw\nlaid down by\nthis Court interpreting the different\nprovisions of the Rules. The said conclusion of the High\nCourt, therefore, must be quashed.\n\nNow coming to the question as to how the initial\nappointees to the service are to be dealt with since in the\ntwo earlier cases this Court had never considered this\nquestion, the question assumes a greater significance.\n\nThe Rules framed under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof\nthe Constitution came into force w.e.f. the <??> June, 1961,\nthe date on which the Rule was published in the official\nGazet. Under sub-rule (1) of Rule 3, it is stipulated that\nthe service shall comprise of such number of posts of\nAssistant Executive Engineers, Executive Engineers,\nSuperintending Engineers and Chief Engineers as may be\nspecified by Government from time to time. Under sub-rule\n(2) of Rule 3 the strength of the service for the first five\nyears after the common cement of these rules shall be\ndetermined each year on the 1st day of January or soon\nthereafter as may be practicable according to the provisions\nof Appendix A and the strength so determined shall remain in\nforce till it is revised. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 stipulates\nthat the recruitment to he service shall be so regulated\nthat the number of posts filled up by promotion form Class\nII Service shall not exceed fifty per cent of the number of\nposts in the Service, excluding the posts of Assistant\nExecutive Engineers. Proviso to sub-rule (2) provides that\ntill adequate number of Assistant Executive Engineers\neligible and considered fit for promotion are not available\nthe actual percentage of officers promoted form Class II\nservice may be larger than 50%. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 5\nspeaks of a fictional situation namely in the service as\nconstituted immediately after the commencement of these\nrules, it shall be assumed that the number of persons\nrecruited by promotion form Class II Service shall be 50% of\nthe senior posts in the Service and future recruitment shall\nbe based on this assumption. Sub-rules (1) and (2) of Rule 3\nand sub-rules (2) and (3) of Rule 5 of 1961 Rules may be\nextracted herein below in extenso :\n\n\"3. Strength of Service : (1) the\nService shall comprise of such\nnumber of posts of Assistant\nExecutive Engineers, Executive\nEngineers and Chief Engineers as\nmay be specified by Government from\ntime to time.\n\n(2) Without prejudice to the\ngenerality of the provisions of\nsub-rule (1) the strength of the\nService for the first five years\nafter the commencement of these\nrules shall be determined each year\non the 1st day of January or as\nsoon thereafter as may be\npracticable according to the\nprovisions of Appendix A. The\nstrength so determined shall remain\nin force till it is revised.\n\n5. Recruitment to service : (2)\nRecruitment to the service shall be\nso regulated that the number of\nposts filled by promotion from\nClass II Service shall not exceed\nfifty per cent of the number of\nposts in the Service, excluding the\nposts of Assistant Executive\nEngineers;\n\nProvided that till such time as an\nadequate number of Assistant\nExecutive Engineers, who ar\neligible and considered fit for\npromotion, are available, the\nactual percentage of Officers\npromoted from Class II Service may\nbe larger than fifty per cent.\n\n(3) In the Service as constituted\nimmediately after the commencement\nof these rules, it shall be assumed\nthat the number of recruited by\npromotion from Class II Service is\nfifty per cent of the senior posts\nin the Service and further\nrecruitment shall be based on this\nassumption.\"\n\nFrom a combined reading of the aforesaid provisions the\nfollowing situation emerges :-\n\n(a) That the Rules came into force w.e.f. 9th of June,\n1961 but the service existed even prior to the said date;\n\n(b) On constitution of the service immediately after the\ncommencement of the Rules by operation of a fictions it was\nassumed that number of persons recruited by promotion from\nClass II service is 50% of the senior post in the service.\n\nThis fictional situation emerges in view of sub-rule (3) of\nRule 5, so that, the future recruitment to the service can\nbe regulated appropriately under sub-rule (2) of Rule 5; and\n\n(c) A duty was enjoined upon the State Government to\ndetermine the strength of the service each year on the 1st\nday of January or soon thereafter as may be practicable for\nthe first five years after the commencement of the Rules and\nthe strength thus determined year to year would remain in\nforce till it is revised.\n\nWhen recruitments were being made without determination\nof the cadre strength and statutory rules came into force\nfor the first time on 9th of June, 1961 the Rules cast a\nduty on the Government to determine the cadre strength each\nyear and thereafter make recruitment in terms of Rule 5\nregulating the manner of filling up the post in the service\nsubject to the provisions contained in sub-rule (2) of Rule\n\n5. Rule 12 is rules for determination of seniority. This\nRule has already been interpreted by this Court in Sehgal\nand Chopra indicating the manner in which the seniority bas\nto be determined inter se between the promotees and direct\nrecruits. When State of Haryana came into existence and\npersons were serving in the erstwhile State of Punjab were\ndrafted into State of Haryana and constituted the initial\ncadre strength of the service in the State of Haryana and\nthe Government of Haryana adopted the Punjab Rules of 1961\nfor determining the service conditions of the employees it\nwould be reasonable to hold that so far as the State of\nHaryana is concerned the Recruitment Rules came into force\non 1.11.1966 and since the persons who constituted the\nservice came from erstwhile State of Punjab depending upon\ntheir domicile it would be further reasonable to construe\nthat they constituted the service soon after the rules were\nadopted by the State of Haryana and thereafter Rule 5(3)\nshould be attracted in respect of those 10 officers who\nconstituted the service and by such application, by a\nfiction 50% should be treated to be promotees and on so\ntreating them further recruitment to the service was\nrequired to be regulated in accordance with sub-rule (2) of\nRule 5 and it is then the inter se seniority has to be\ndetermined under Rule 12. In other words, out of 10 persons\nwho were brought over form the erstwhile State of Punjab and\nconstituted the service in the State of Haryana 5 will be\nassumed to have been recruited by promotion from Class II\nservice by application of sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 even if\nfactually all the 10 were promotees while they were\nrecruited under the Punjab Rules. Since the initial cadre\nstrength was only 10 in the year 1966 and since under Rule\n5(2) the promotees cannot exceed 50% of the total number of\nposts in the services, the Recruitment Rules by fiction held\n50% of the persons constituted the service immediately\nafter the commencement of the Rules to be promotees.\nThereafter the State Government was duty bound to determine\nthe cadre strength every year in the first five years as per\nsub-rule (2) of Rule 3 and in fact this direction had been\ngiven in the earlier judgments in the case of Sehgal and\nChopra and after such determination of the cadre strength if\nin a particular year it is found that the promotees have\nusurped the quota of direct recruit then such promote cannot\nbe held to be senior to the direct recruit notwithstanding\ntheir earlier recruitment to the service. If these\nprinciples are borne in mind then the gradation list which\nhad been prepared by the State Government on 6.4.1992 was\npossibly the correct gradation list and the High Court was\nin error to quash the said gradation list on a conclusion\nthat the earlier direction of this Court in Sehgal and\nChopra has not been followed. Obviously, the High Court\nmisunderstood the directions of this Court in the case\nSehgal and Chopra. We are however, not going o examine the\nsaid gradation list that was prepared on 6.4.1992 or any\nother gradation list which had been prepared subsequently\nduring the pendency of these appeals, since in our view the\nAct having been come into force and the Act have been given\nretrospective effect the seniority has to be drawn up afresh\nin accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nSo far as the rules dealing with Irrigation Branch is\nconcerned, the said rules namely Punjab Service of Engineers\n(Irrigation Branch) Class I Service Rules, 1964 has not been\nconsidered earlier by this Court at any point of time. One\nShri M.L. Gupta was appointed to the post of Assistant\nExecutive Engineer as a direct recruit on 27.8.1971,\npursuant to he result of a competitive examination held by\nthe Haryana Public Service Commission in December, 1970.\nSaid Shri Gupta was promoted to the post of Executive\nEngineer on 17.9.1976. He made representation to the State\nGovernment to fix up his seniority in accordance with the\nservice rules but as the said representation was not\ndisposed of for more than three years he approached the High\nCourt of Punjab and Haryana by filing C.W.P. NO. 4335 of\n1984. That petition was disposed of by the High Court on the\nundertaking given by the State that the seniority will be\nfixed up soon. The said undertaking not having been complied\nwith, said Shri Gupta approached the High Court in January\n1986 by filling Contempt Petition. In September, 1986 the\nState Government fixed the inter se seniority of said Shri\nGupta and other members of the service ad Gupta was shown at\nserial no. 72. Two promotees had been shown at serial no. 74\nand 75. Those two promotees filed a writ petition\nchallenging the fixation of inter se seniority between the\ndirect recruits and promotees and High Court of Punjab and\nHaryana by its judgment passed in May 1987 quashed the order\ndated 29.9.1986 whereunder the seniority of the direct\nrecruits and promotees has been fixed and called upon the\nState Government to pass a speaking order assigning position\nin the gradation list. The State Government issued a fresh\nnotification on 24.7.1987 giving detailed reasons re-\naffirming the earlier seniority which had been notified on\n29.9.1986. Prior to the aforesaid notification of the State\nGovernment Shri Gupta had filed a writ petition in the\nPunjab and Haryana High Court which had been registered as\nCWP No. 6012 of 1986 claiming his seniority at No. 22\ninstead of 72 which had been given to him under the\nnotification dated 29.9.1986. The promotees also filed a\nwrit petition challenging the Government order dated\n24.7.1987 which was registered as CWP No. 5780 of 1987. Both\nthe writ petitions, one filed by direct recruit - Shri Gupta\n(CWP No. 6012 of 1986) and the other filed by the promotees\n(CWP No. 5780 of 1987) were disposed of by the learned\nSingle Judge by judgments dated 24th January, 1992 and 4th\nMarch, 1992 respectively, whereunder the learned Single\nJudge accepted the stand of the promotees and Shri Gupta was\nplaced below one Shri OP Ganged. Said Shri Gupta filed two\nappeals to the Division Bench against the judgment of the\nlearned Single Judge, which was registered as Letters Patent\nAppeal nos, 367 and 411 of 1992. The aforesaid Letter Patent\nAppeals were allowed by judgment dated 27th August, 1992.\nThis judgment of the Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana\nHigh Court was challenged by the State of Haryana in the\nSupreme Court which has been registered as CA Nos. 1448-49\nof 1993. This Court granted leave and stayed the operation\nof the judgment in the matter of fixation of seniority. The\npromotees also challenged\nthe said judgment\nof the Division\nBench in this Court which has been registered as CA Nos.\n1452-1453 of 1993. During the pendency of these appeals in\nthis Court, a Ordinance was promulgated on 13.5.1985 as\nOrdinance No. 6 of 1995 and the said Ordinance was replaced\nby the impugned Act of 20 of 1995 by the Haryana\nLegislature. The validity of the Act was challenged by said\nShri Gupta and pursuance to the order of this Court the said\nwrit petition having been transferred to this Court has been\nregistered as T.C. No. 40 of 1996. So far as the validity of\nthe Act is concerned, the question of any usurpation of\njudicial power by the legislature does not arise in relation\nto Irrigation Branch inasmuch as the Recruitment Rules of\n1964 framed by the Governor of Punjab in exercise of power\nunder proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution which has\nbeen adapted by the State of Haryana on and from the date\nHaryana was made separate State had not been considered by\nthis court nor any direction has been issued by this court.\nThe legislative competence of the State legislature to enact\nthe Act had also not ben assailed and in our view rightly\nsince the State legislature have the powers under Entry 41\nof List - II of the Seventh Schedule to frame law governing\nthe conditions of service of the employees of the State\nGovernment. That apart\nArticle 309\nitself stipulates that\nthe appropriate Legislature may regulate the recruitment,\nand conditions of service of persons appointed, to public\nservices and posts in connection with the affairs of the\nUnion or of any State subject to the provisions of the\nConstitution. Proviso to\nArticle 309\nconfers power on the\nPresident in connection with the affairs of the Union and on\nthe Governor in connection with the affairs of the State to\nmake rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of\nservice until provision in that behalf is made by or under\nan Act of the appropriate Legislature under\nArticle 309\nmain\npart. In this view of the matter, the legislative competence\nof the State legislature to enact the legislation in\nquestion is beyond doubt. The only question which therefore,\narises for consideration and which is contended in assailing\nthe validity of the Act is that under the Act the direct\nrecruits would lose several positions in the gradation list\nand thereby their accrued and vested rights would get\njeopardised and their future chances of promotion also would\nbe seriously hampered and such violation tantamounts\nviolation of rights under Part - III of the Constitution.\nFor the reasons already given while dealing with the\naforesaid contention in connection with the Public Health\nBranch and the Road Building Branch the contention rased in\nthe Transfer Case cannot be sustained and, therefore, the\nTransfer Case would stand dismissed.\nThe Act\nin question\ndealing with the service conditions of he engineers\nbelonging to the Irrigation Branch must be held to be a\nvalid piece of legislation passed by the competent\nlegislature and by giving it retrospective effect no\nconstitutional provision has ben violated nor any right of\nthe employee under Part - III of the constitution has been\ninfringed requiring interference by this Court.\n\nSo far as the four appeals are concerned, one at the\ninstance of the State and other at the instance of the\npromotee engineer, even though it is not necessary to\nexamine those appeals since the inter se seniority of the\nmembers of the service will have to be re-drawn up in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act, yet arguments\nhaving been advanced by the learned advocates appearing for\nthe parties, we may briefly deal with the same. The Division\nBench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in disposing of\nthe Letters Patent Appeal in favour of the direct recruit\nhas come to the conclusion that the interpretation given by\nthe Supreme Court to the Recruitment Rules dealing with the\nPublic Health Branch and the Roads and Building Branch in\nSehgal and Chopra would equally apply to the Irrigation\nBranch. In coming to the aforesaid conclusion the learned\nJudges of the High Court have failed to appreciate the\ndifference between the rules dealing with the Irrigation\nBranch and the two sets of rules dealing with the Public\nHealth Branch and the Roads and Building Branch. So far as\nthe rules dealing with the Irrigation Branch is concerned,\nRule 2(12)(c) makes a promotee officer on probation or\nhaving successfully completed his probation awaiting\nappointment to a cadre post to be a member of the service\nwhich was not the position in the Public Health Branch as\nwell as in the Roads and Building Branch. Then again under\nrule 5(2) the percentage of promotees was required to be so\nregulated so as not to exceed 75% of the number of posts in\nthe service for the first 10 years form the date of the\ncommencement of the Rules and thereafter it shall not exceed\n50% of the number of posts in the service excluding the\nposts of Assistant Executive Engineer. Proviso to the\naforesaid rules also entitles the Government to grant\npermission beyond 75% during the first 10 years of the\ncommencement of the rules and beyond 50% thereafter in case\nsufficient number of direct recruits - Assistant Executive\nEngineers are not available and considered fit for\npromotion. Rule 12 which deals with the determination of\ninter se seniority is also somewhat different than the\nsimilar rule for the Public Health Branch and the Roads and\nBuilding Branch which had been considered by this Court in\nthe cases of Sehgal and Chopra.\nIn this view of the matter,\nthe Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court was\nnot justified in disposing of the appeal relying upon the\nearlier decisions of this Court in\nA.N. Sehgal\n's case. The\nlearned Judges have not focussed their attention to the\ndifference in the rules meant for the Irrigation Branch and\nthe Rules meant for the Public Health Branch and Roads and\nBuilding Branch. The impugned judgment, therefore, passed by\nthe Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court is\nerroneous and cannot be sustained. But as has been stated\nearlier it is not necessary to delve into the question in a\nmore detailed manner since the Act having come into force\nand the Act being made effective retrospectively w.e.f\n1.11.1966, the date on which the State of Haryana was\nformed, the inter se seniority has to be determined in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act. Consequently, the\njudgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in LPA Nos.\n367 and 411 of 1992 is set aside an the State of Haryana is\ndirected to re-determine the inter se seniority of the\nmembers of the service belonging to the Irrigation Branch in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act. Civil Appeal Nos.\n1448-1449 of 1993, 1452-1453 of 1993 and T.C. No. 40 of 1996\nare disposed of accordingly.\n\nIn the ultimate result, therefore, we hold Haryana Act\n20 of 1995 is intra virus except part of Section 25 which\nhas been held to be ultra virus.\nThe Act\nhaving been given\nretrospective effect with effect from 1.11.1966 the inter se\nseniority of direct recruits and promotees in each of the\nservices, namely, the PWD Branch, the Public Health Branch\nand the Irrigation Branch will have to be re-drawn up in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act. The seniority\nlists already drawn up subsequent to the judgment of this\ncourt in the case of Sehgal and Chopra and as well as during\nthe pendency of these appeals in this court are of no\nconsequence in view of the Act coming into force. It is,\nhowever, made clear that any promotion already given on the\nbasis of seniority determined by the Government under the\npre-existing rules will not be annulled notwithstanding any\nchange in the seniority to be determined under the Act. The\nimpugned judgments of Punjab and Haryana High Court are set\naside. The State Government is directed to re-consider the\nquestion of seniority of the employees of the three Branches\nunder the Act within a period of six months form today and\nto give consequential promotion on that basis soon\nthereafter.\n\nAll the appeals and the transfer cases are disposed of\naccordingly.",
