(Now Chhattisgarh) on 10 October, 2023\n\nAuthor:\nSanjay Karol\n\nBench:\nHrishikesh Roy\n,\nSanjay Karol\n\n2023INSC895 REPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL No.1578 OF 2012\n\nKAMAL PRASAD & ORS. …APPELLANT(S)\n\nVersus\n\nTHE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH\n(NOW STATE OF CHHATTISGARH) …RESPONDENT(S)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nSANJAY KAROL J.,\n\n1. This appeal calls into question the correctness of a judgment\n\nand order passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh in Criminal\n\nAppeal No.596 of 1992 by which the guilt of the accused and the\n\nsentence of imprisonment imposed in Sessions Trial No.198 of\n\n1988 vide a judgment dated 11.05.1992 stands confirmed.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nNITIN TALREJA\n\nDate: 2023.10.10\n\n16:15:36 IST\n\nReason:\n\n1- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\n\n2. Challenging their conviction, before us are three convict(s) -\n\nappellants, namely, Kamal Prasad (A-3); Shersingh (A-6); and\n\nBhavdas (A-9).\n\n3. The convict-appellants stand convicted of having committed\n\nan offence punishable under Sections 148, 302 read with 149, 307\n\nread with 149,\nIndian Penal Code\n, 18601 and\nSections 4\n/\nof the\n\nExplosive Substance Act, 1908 under which the sentence awarded\n\nvaries from rigorous imprisonment for 3 years to life\n\nimprisonment, all to run concurrently.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4. Facts, as they emerge from the judgments of the Court below\n\nare:\n\n4.1 On 17.04.1988 one Chetram was taking his son Kapildeo @\n\nGuddu to the hospital for treatment with one\n\nChoubisram (PW-3) as a pillion rider. Upon reaching the\n\nhouse of accused Darasram, 11 persons attacked them with\n\ncountry made bombs as also Laathis and tabbal. Chetram\n\nreceived multiple injuries and eventually succumbed while\n\n1 For Brevity, “\nIPC\n”\n\n2- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nreceiving the treatment. PW-3 escaped this attack and took\n\nshelter in the house of Baisakhu Kewat. Kapildeo, son of\n\nChetram, who was being taken to the hospital by his father\n\nand Chaubisram, was found close to a tree near the place of\n\noccurrence alive and was taken to a Government Hospital,\n\nPalari and was shifted to D.K. Hospital, Raipur. However, in\n\nthe course of treatment, he also died, same day at about 4.55\n\np.m.\n\n4.2 Post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased\n\nChetram was conducted by Dr. R.P. Pandey (PW-11) and the\n\npost-mortem examination of Kapildeo was conducted by Dr.\n\nK.L. Gopawar (PW-10). The police reached the spot of the\n\ncrime at 11.15 a.m. after reading the dehatinalishi recorded\n\nat 11.00 a.m at the instance of PW-3.\n\n4.3 The investigation having been conducted by SI Sahid Ali (PW-\n\n19) revealing the complicity of all 11 accused persons, challan\n\nwas presented before the Court concerned for trial.\n\n5. The Trial Court, based on the evidence led by the prosecution\n\nand the accused endeavoring to establish their plea of alibi, finding\n\n3- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nthe evidence led by the prosecution to be reliable; the witnesses to\n\nhave established the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt;\n\nthe witnesses’ testimonies being of sterling quality and their credit,\n\nunimpeachable, convicted 9 of the 11 accused persons.\n\n6. In an appeal preferred by the convicts, the findings of fact,\n\nreasoning adopted, and the judgment of conviction and\n\nconsequent sentence imposed, stands affirmed. The High Court in\n\nthe impugned judgment records as follows:\n\n“(21.) After due appreciation of these witnesses, it comes\nthat firstly two accused persons namely Anandram and\nKamal threw bombs on the deceased and thereafter the\nother accused persons started assaulting the deceased\nby lathis and tabbal while he fell down on the ground. If\nwe examine the conduct of each accused it would appear\nthat they had an intention to commit murder of the\ndeceased and for that they had made preparation by\nforming an unlawful assembly which is evident from the\nseries of events which took place in a sequence when\nfirstly two accused threw bombs on the deceased and\nwhen the. Deceased fell down, all of them attack over\nhim with deadly weapons like lathis and tabbal and\ncaused multiple injuries to him.”\n\n7. Counsel for the appellants contended before the High\n\nCourt that since most of the witnesses were close relatives or\n\ninterested witness, hence their testimonies could not be relied\n\nupon, which contention was not accepted, not only in view of\n\n4- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nthe unimpeachable creditworthiness of the witnesses, fully\n\ninspiring in confidence, but also in the light of principles of law\n\nenunciated by this Court. On facts, the Court also observed\n\nthat PW-3, is not a relative at all, and Khorbahrin Bai (PW-16)\n\nalthough is a relative of the deceased but is not a close relative.\n\nAlso, even though PW-17 is the wife of the deceased, nothing\n\nelicited prompting her testimony to be unbelievable.\n\nTHE PRESENT APPEAL\n\n8. Before us, the aforesaid convict-appellants have assailed the\n\nimpugned judgment on four fronts- (a) Inordinate delay in filing of\n\nthe First Information Report (F.I.R.) (Ex.15) introduces to the case,\n\nthe possibility of improvements thereby casting doubt on the\n\nversion of the prosecution; (b) the testimonies of the witnesses of\n\nthe prosecution being contradictory, hence unreliable; (c) the\n\ndeceased being a history-sheeter, having numerous cases pending\n\nagainst him, hence equal probability that someone other than the\n\nconvict(s)-appellant(s) favouring and wanting, his elimination;\n\nand (d) that the accused persons were, in fact, not at the scene of\n\nthe crime and their plea of alibi is probable.\n\n5- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\n\n9. The case of the prosecution rests primarily on the\n\ntestimonies of three witnesses, namely, Choubisram PW-3;\n\nKhorbahrin Bai PW-16 and Jugbai PW-17.\n\n10. Here only we may record that the Courts below have\n\nconcurrently found the witnesses to have deposed truthfully, their\n\ntestimonies to be entirely inspiring in confidence.\n\n11. Further that the death of the deceased Chetram and\n\nKapildeo is undisputed, with medical and scientific evidence\n\nincluding the post-mortem reports conducted by two doctors\n\nreferred to supra (PW-10 and PW-11), confirm such fact. Deceased\n\nChetram having sustained multiple injuries upon vital parts of the\n\nbody as a result of the bombs being thrown at him also stands\n\nproved.\n\n12. It is also a matter of record that PW-3 had sustained\n\nlacerated wounds the causation of which could well have been the\n\ncountry made bombs used in the commission of offence. Such fact\n\nis evident from the medical opinion of Dr. Ghanshyam (PW-20)\n\nwho conducted his medical examination.\n\n6- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\n\n13. Before proceeding to the four contentions advanced, firstly it\n\nwould be necessary for us to appreciate the principles of law in\n\nrespect of delay in registration of FIR as evolved over time.\n\n13.1 This Court in\nApren Joseph v. State of Kerala2\n,\n\nhas observed that “Undue unreasonable delay in lodging\n\nthe FIR”, “inevitably gives rise to suspicion which puts the\n\nCourt on guard to look for the possible motive and the\n\nexplanation for the delay and consider its effect on the\n\ntrustworthiness or otherwise of the prosecution version.”\n\nThe Bench of three learned Judges further observed that\n\nno time duration, in the abstract could be fixed as the\n\n‘reasonable time’ to give information to the police and\n\ntherefore, the same is a question to be determined as per\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case.\n\n13.2 Further, referring to\nRam Jag v. State of U.P.3\n, this\n\nCourt in\nState of M.P. v. Ratan Singh4\nobserved that\n\nCourts when faced with the question of delay in\n\nregistration of FIR are duty-bound to determine whether\n\n2 (1973) 3 SCC 114\n3 (1974) 4 SCC 201\n4 (2020) 12 SCC 630\n\n7- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nthe explanation afforded is plausible enough based on the\n\ngiven facts and circumstances of each case.\n\n13.3 This Court recently in\nBhagwan Singh v. Dilip\n\nSingh\nalias Depak & Anr5 has observed that if the\n\nprosecution attempts to ‘improvise its case stage by stage\n\nand step by step’ during the intervening period, it would\n\nbe open for the accused to contend that the delay was fatal\n\nto the proceedings and the same was done to ‘stave off\n\nproceedings against the accused’.\n\n14. In respect of the first contention put forth by the convict-\n\nappellants it is seen from the record that the FIR was registered\n\nabout two hours after the incident having taken place on\n\n17.04.1988 at about 08.00 a.m. The document itself records the\n\ntime of incident as being 8.15 a.m. and the time of report as being\n\n11.00 a.m. The testimony of PW-3 at whose instance the FIR was\n\nrecorded, shows that out of fear and having sustained numerous\n\ninjuries, he ran from the place of occurrence and hid in the house\n\nof Baisakhu Kewat and only emerged therefrom two hours later.\n\n5 2023 SCC OnLine 1059\n\n8- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nIn such a situation, delay in filing of the FIR cannot be said to be\n\nfatal to the case of the prosecution more so in view of the injuries\n\nsustained by him; the place of occurrence being a remote village\n\narea and that the version of events was dictated to the police by\n\nthis witness only upon their reaching his place of shelter. To us it\n\ndoes not appear to be a case of prior consultation; discussion;\n\ndeliberation or improvements.\n\n15. Relevant portion of the testimony of PW-3 reads as under:-\n\n“After 2 hours someone opened the door and I came out\nfrom the place where I was hiding. Public had assembled\nthere. But I cannot tell the names of those persons who\nhad assembled. Because I was badly injured and I was\nfeeling immense pain. My left eye which was perfectly\nalright before this incident, was completely damaged in\nthis incident. Thereafter I dictated report of this incident\nto the station House Officer at the house of Baisakhu.\nFirst information report was read over to witness and he\nstated that this is the same report which I had dictated.\nFirst information report marked Ex. P15.”\n\n16. Significantly, this part of his testimony goes unrefuted. Even\n\na suggestion of such statement being false was not given by any\n\none of the accused in cross-examination. Having perused the\n\nsame and also the cross-examination forming part of the record,\n\nwe do not find anything emanating therefrom which would\n\n9- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\ncredibly suggest that the time gap between the occurrence of\n\nincidence and registration of the FIR is unjustified.\n\n17. Resultantly, the first contention of the convict appellants\n\nmust necessarily be answered in the negative.\n\n18. Another defence taken by the convict-appellants is that of\n\nthe plea of alibi. This Court in Binay Kumar Singh v. State of\n\nBihar6 has noted the principle as:\n\n“23. The Latin word alibi means “elsewhere” and that word is\nused for convenience when an accused takes recourse to a\ndefence line that when the occurrence took place he was so\nfar away from the place of occurrence that it is extremely\nimprobable that he would have participated in the crime.”\n\n19. The principles regarding the plea of alibi, as can be\n\nappreciated from the various decisions7 of this Court, are:\n\n19.1 It is not part of the General Exceptions under the\n\nIPC\nand is instead a rule of evidence under\nSection\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n\n6 (\n1997) 1 SCC 283\n7 Dhananjoy Chatterjee v. State of W.B.\n, (1994) 2 SCC 220;\nBinay Kumar Singh\n(supra)\n\nJitender Kumar v. State of Haryana\n(2012) 6 SCC 204;\nVijay Pal v. State (Govt. of NCT of\nDelhi\n) (2015) 4 SCC 749;\nDarshan Singh v. State of Punjab\n(2016) 3 SCC 37;\nMukesh v. State\n(NCT of Delhi\n) (2016) 6 SCC 1;\nPappu Tiwari v. State of Jharkhand\n2022 SCC OnLine\nSC 109.\n\n10- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\n19.2 This plea being taken does not lessen the burden of\n\nthe prosecution to prove that the accused was\n\npresent at the scene of the crime and had\n\nparticipated therein.\n\n19.3 Such plea is only to be considered subsequent to the\n\nprosecution having discharged, satisfactorily, its\n\nburden.\n\n19.4 The burden to establish the plea is on the person\n\ntaking such a plea. The same must be achieved by\n\nleading cogent and satisfactory evidence.\n\n19.5 It is required to be proved with certainty so as to\n\ncompletely exclude the possibility of the presence of\n\nthe accused at the spot of the crime. In other words,\n\na standard of ‘strict scrutiny’ is required when such\n\na plea is taken.\n\n20. We notice that the defendants have laid certain evidence\n\nattempting to indicate their presence being at a place other than\n\nthe spot of commission of the offence. The statements of four\n\nwitnesses, namely, Sonchand DW-1; Jageshwar Prasad DW-2;\n\n11- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nRamadheen DW-3; and Parsu Das DW-4 form part of record.\n\nHowever, DW-3 testifies to the whereabouts of accused Sandas\n\nand DW-4 does so for accused Anand Ram, both of whom the\n\npresent case does not concern as the appellants before us are\n\nKamal Prasad (A-3), Shersingh (A-6) and Bhavdas (A-9). The two\n\nrelevant defence witnesses for the convict-appellants before us,\n\nare as under:-\n\n20.1 DW-1 states that A-9 is his uncle and had come to\n\nhis house to go to Sandi Bazar. When the police came to\n\narrest him he mentioned to them that he had just been\n\nreturning from Bhalesur and did not have any relation\n\nwith the offence. He was arrested by the police.\n\n20.2 DW-2 submitted that on the day of the offence, A-9\n\nwent to the shop run by him at Bhalesur to purchase some\n\ntea and jaggery. The distance between Bhalesur and\n\nSundri is 16 Kilometres.\n\n21. In our considered view, both these defence witnesses do not\n\nconclusively establish the plea of alibi, based on the principle of\n\npreponderance of probability as their statements stand\n\n12- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nunsupported by any other corroborative evidence. Not only that,\n\nno reason stands explained in such testimony for A-9 having\n\ntravelled from Bhalesur to Sundri in order to go to Sandi Bazar.\n\nIt is a matter of record that A-9 is a resident of Bhalesur where he\n\nresided with his family. He owned farms in Sundri. The family of\n\nA-9 was not examined to substantiate the claim of such travel.\n\nFor those reasons, we cannot believe the version testified to by\n\nDW-1 and DW-2. We also cannot ignore that all 3 primary\n\nwitnesses of the prosecution i.e., PW-3, PW-16, and PW-17 have\n\ncategorically deposed the presence of the convict-appellants at the\n\nspot of the crime and such a statement could not be shaken in\n\ncross-examination.\n\n22. We find that for the plea of alibi to be established, something\n\nother than a mere ocular statement ought to have been present.\n\nAfter all, the prosecution has relied on the statement of\n\neyewitnesses to establish its case against the convict-appellants\n\nleading to the unrefuted conclusion that convict-appellants were\n\npresent on the spot of the crime and had indeed caused injuries\n\nunto the deceased as also PW-3 with Lathis and Tabbal on various\n\nand vital parts of their bodies.\n\n13- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\n\n23. As we have hitherto observed, the prosecution case relies\n\nprimarily on 3 witnesses whom, the Courts below have believed\n\nwithout exception. It is next urged that there are contradictions in\n\nthe testimonies of three witnesses, hence, it would neither be\n\nappropriate nor safe to place reliance thereon. Having perused the\n\nsame, we find them to be coherent on material facts such as the\n\npresence of the accused on the spot of the crime; the death of\n\nChetram; a blast having taken place; and the accused being the\n\nassailants. A perusal thereof reveals PW3 to have categorically\n\ndeposed that Kamal (A3) threw a bomb on him and deceased\n\nChetram. He also stated the other two accused Shersingh (A6) and\n\nBhavdas (A9) were also present at that time. PW16 has named all\n\nthree accused persons, attributing upon them the act of hitting the\n\ndeceased with shovels and lathis and further stated that accused\n\nKamal hurled abuses at the said witness and the others present\n\nalongside, prompting them to run away from that place. She,\n\nhowever, does not ascribe particular roles to any of the accused as\n\nto who had hit the deceased with a lathi or who did so with a\n\nshowel. Jugbai PW-17 deposed that the three accused before us,\n\nas well as others had lathis and shovels with them and they had\n\n14- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\nchallenged her presence there forcing her to run away. She stated\n\nthat she along with others had witnessed the incident from near\n\nthe house of one Samaru and that she had seen the accused\n\nbeating the deceased. Therefore, we find no force in the contention\n\nthat the testimonies relied on by the prosecution are inherently\n\ncontradictory.\n\n24. It may be true that the deceased Chetram was a history-\n\nsheeter and had scores of criminal cases pending against him or\n\ncases in which he was involved. However, such fact is\n\nunsubstantiated on record for no detail whatsoever stands\n\nprovided in respect of such cases involving the deceased. Be that\n\nas it may, simply because the deceased had a chequered past\n\nwhich constituted several run-ins with the law, Courts cannot give\n\nbenefit thereof, particularly when such claims are bald assertions,\n\nto those accused of committing such a person’s murder. And in\n\nany event, such a plea is merely presumptuous.\n\n25. In conclusion, we find that the charges levied against the\n\naccused, i.e., under Sections 148, 302 read with 149, 307 read\n\nwith 149,\nIPC\n, and Sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substance Act,\n\n15- [Cr. A No.1578 OF 2012]\n1908, and the sentence corresponding thereto as awarded by the\n\nTrial Court and confirmed by the High Court, do not warrant\n\ninterference of this Court. It may also be observed that the\n\nsentences awarded are in no manner excessive or\n\ndisproportionate to the crimes for which the convict-appellants\n\nstand convicted.\n\n26. The appeal, therefore, fails and is accordingly dismissed.\n\n27. The bail granted by this Court vide order dated 1st October\n\n2012, stands cancelled. The appellants are directed to surrender\n\nforthwith. The concerned trial court to take consequential steps.\n\n28. Pending Interlocutory application(s), if any, shall stand\n\ndisposed of.\n\n……………………J.\n(ABHAY S. OKA)\n\n…..……………….J.\n(SANJAY KAROL)\n\nDate : 10 October, 2023;\n\nPlace : New Delhi.\n\n16- [Cr.
