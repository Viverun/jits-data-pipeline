Fifty Thousand only) with two\n\n solvent sureties each of Rs.25,000/- to the satisfaction of the\n\n Arresting Authority.\n\n This order will remain operative subject to compliance of the\n\n following conditions :-\n\n 1.\n The petitioners will comply with all the terms and conditions\n of the bond executed by them;\n\n 2. The petitioners will cooperate in the investigation/trial, as the\n case may be;\n\n 3. The petitioners will not indulge themselves in extending\n inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with\n the facts of the case so as to dissuade him/her from disclosing\n such facts to the Court or to the Police Officer, as the case\n may be;\n\n 4. The petitioners shall not commit an offence similar to the\n offence of which they are accused;\n\n 5. The petitioners will not seek unnecessary adjournments\n during the trial;\n\n 6. The petitioners will not leave India without previous\n permission of the trial Court/Investigating Officer, as the case\n may be;\n\n 7.
