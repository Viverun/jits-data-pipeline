The first safeguard (which is\ngiven by clause (1) of \nArticle 311\n) is that such person\ncannot be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate\nto that by which he was appointed. The second safeguard\n(which is given by clause (2) of\n133\n\nArticle 311\n is that he cannot be dismissed removed or\nreduced in rank except after an inquiry in which he has been\ninformed of the charges against him and given a reasonable\nopportunity of being heard in respect of those charges.\nThe second safeguard is, however, not available when a\nperson is dismissed, removed or reduced in rank in any of\nthe three cases set out in clauses (a) to (c) mentioned in\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n Under clause (a), such\nperson can be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank without\nany inquiry on the ground of conduct which has led to his\nconviction on a criminal charge. Under clause (b), any of\nthe three penalties can be imposed where the authority\nempowered to impose any of the penalties is satisfied that\nfor some reason, to be recorded by that authority in\nwriting, it is not reasonably practicable to hold such\ninquiry. Under clause (c), any of the aforesaid penalties\ncan be imposed where the President, or the Governor of a\nState, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest\nof the security of the State it is not expedient to hold\nsuch inquiry.\n All the Government servants in the above Appeals and\nWrit Petitions had been either dismissed or removed from\nservice without holding any inquiry. They had not been\ninformed of the charges against them nor given any\nopportunity of being heard in respect of those charges. The\npenalty of dismissal or removal, as the case may be, had\nbeen imposed upon them under one or the other of the three\nclauses of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or under\nsimilar provisions in rules made under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\n or in rules made under an Act referable to\n\nArticle 309\n, for instance, Rule 19 of the Central Civil\nServices (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965.\nRule 14 of the Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal)\nRules 1968, and Rule 37 of the Central Industrial Security\nForce Rules, 1969, or under such a rule read with one of the\nclauses of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n\n The affected government servants assailed the aforesaid\norder in writ petitions under \nArticle 226\n in different High\nCourts, and some of these writ petitions were allowed on the\nbasis of this Court's decision in Divisional Personal\nOfficer, Southern Railway & Anr. v. T.R. Challappan [1976] 1\nS.C.R. 783, and a few were dismissed.\n Appeals by Special Leave against those judgments were\nfiled, and in three such appeals it was noticed by a three\nJudge Bench of this Court that there was a conflict between\n134\nChallappan's Case and another three Judge Bench in M. Gopala\nKrishna Naidu v. State of Madhya Pradesh [1968] 1 S.C.R. 355\nand directed that the papers in the three appeals be placed\nbefore the Hon'ble Chief Justice for reference to a larger\nBench. These appeals were thus referred to the Constitution\nBench and all other similar Appeals and Writ Petitions were\nalso placed before the Constitution Bench for disposal.\n The arguments advanced on behalf of the government\nservants on the pleasure doctrine and the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311 (2)\n were :\n 1. The pleasure doctrine in England is a part of the\nspecial prerogative of the Crown and had been inherited by\nIndia from England and should, therefore, be construed\nstrictly against the Government and liberally in favour of\ngovernment servants.\n 2. The second proviso which withdraws from government\nservants the safeguards provided by clause (2) of \nArticle\n311\n must be also similarly construed, otherwise great\nhardship would result to government servants as they could\nbe arbitrarily thrown out of employment, and they and their\ndependents would be left without any means of subsistence.\n 3. There are several stages before a government servant\ncan be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank namely,\nserving upon him of a show-cause notice or a charge-sheet,\ngiving him inspection of documents, examination of\nwitnesses, arguments and imposition of penalty. An inquiry\nstarts only after a show cause notice is issued and served.\nA show cause notice is thus preparatory to the holding of an\ninquiry and even if the entire inquiry is dispensed with,\nthe giving of a show cause notice and taking of the\nexplanation of the government servant with respect thereto\nare not excluded.\n 4. It is not obligatory upon the disciplinary authority\nto dispense with the whole of the inquiry. Depending upon\nthe circumstances of the case, the disciplinary authority\ncan dispense with only a part of the inquiry.\n 5. Imposition of penalty is not a part of the inquiry\nand once an inquiry is dispensed with, whether in whole or\nin part, it is obligatory upon the disciplinary authority to\ngive an opportunity to the government servant to make a\nrepresentation with respect to the penalty proposed to be\nimposed upon him.\n135\n 6. \nArticle 311\n is subject to \nArticle 14.\n Principles of\nnatural justice and the audi alteram partem rule are part of\n\nArticle 14\n, and therefore, a show cause notice asking for\nthe explanation of the government servant with respect to\nthe charges against him as also a notice to show cause with\nrespect to the proposed penalty are required to be given by\n\nArticle 14\n and not giving such notices or either of them\nrenders the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank\ninvalid.\n On behalf of the Union of India it was submitted that:\n 1. The second proviso is unambiguous and must be\nconstrued according to its terms.\n 2. Where the second proviso of clause (2) of \nArticle\n311\n is made inapplicable, there is no scope for holding any\npartial inquiry.\n 3. The very contents of the three clauses of the second\nproviso show that it is not necessary or not practicable or\nnot expedient that any partial inquiry could be or should be\nheld, depending upon which clause applies.\n 4. \nArticle 14\n does not govern or control \nArticle 311.\n\nThe Constitution must be read as a whole. \nArticle 311(2)\n\nembodies the principle of natural justice including the audi\nalteram partem rule. Once the application of clause (2) is\nexpressly excluded by the Constitution itself, there can be\nno question of making applicable what has been so excluded\nby seeking recourse to \nArticle 14.\n\n 5. Considerations of sympathy for the government\nservants who may be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank\nare irrelevant to the construction of the second proviso.\nThe doctrine of tenure at pleasure in \nArticle 310\n and the\nsafeguards given to a government servant under clauses (1)\nand (2) of \nArticle 311\n as also the withdrawal of the\nsafeguard under clause (2) by the second proviso are all\nenacted in public interest and where public interest\nconflicts with private interest, the latter must yield to\nthe former.\n Allowing the Appeals of the Union of India and\ndismissing the Writ Petitions and Transferred Cases of the\nemployees.\n^\n HELD: (Per Chandrachud, CJ. V.D. Tulzapurkar, R.S.\nPathak & D.P. Madon JJ. - M.P. Thakkar,J. dissenting)\n136\n I. The Pleasure Doctrine in the United Kingdom\n 1. The pleasure doctrine relates to the tenure of a\ngovernment servant, that is, his right to continue to hold\noffice. All public officers and servants of the Crown in the\nUnited Kingdom hold their appointments at the pleasure of\nthe Crown and their services can be terminated at will\nwithout assigning any cause. [166 F]\n 2. The pleasure doctrine is not based upon any special\nprerogative of the Crown but is based on public policy and\nis in public interest and for public good. The basis of the\npleasure doctrine is that the public is vitally interested\nin the efficiency and integrity of civil services and,\ntherefore, public policy requires, public interest needs and\npublic good demands that civil servants who are inefficient,\ndishonest or corrupt or have become a security risk should\nnot continue in service. [166 G]\n 3. In the United Kingdom, Parliament is sovereign and\ncan make any law whatever and the courts have no power to\ndeclare it void. The pleasure doctrine is therefore subject\nto what may be expressly provided otherwise by legislation.\n[167 A-168 B]\n Halsbury's Laws of England. Fourth Edn. Volume 8 para\n1106;1162.\n Sbenton v. Saith, L.R. [1895] A.C. 229 J.C., Dunn v.\nthe Queen, L.R. [1896] Q.B.D. 116; s.c. (1895-96) 73 L.T.R.\n695 and sub nomine Dunn v. Regen in [1895-99] All E.R. Rep.\n907., Gould v. Stuart, L.R.

In India the pleasure doctrine has received\nConstitutional sanction by being enacted in \nArticle 310(1)\n\nof the Constitution of India. Under \nArticle 310(1)\n except as\nexpressly provided in the Constitution, every person who is\na member of a defence service or of a civil service of the\nUnion of India or of any all-India service or holds any post\nconnected with defence or any civil post under the Union of\nIndia holds office during the pleasure of the President, and\nevery person who is a member of a civil service of a State\nor holds any civil post under a state holds office during\nthe pleasure of the Governor of the State. [186 H, 187 E]\n137\n 2. In India, unlike in the United Kingdom, the pleasure\ndoctrine is not subject to any law made by Parliament or a\nState Legislature but is subject to only what is expressly\nprovided in the Constitution. In India, therefore, the\nexceptions to the pleasure doctrine can only be those which\nare expressly provided in the Constitution. [187 E]\n 3. Several exceptions to the pleasure doctrine are\nexpressly provided in the Constitution.\n 4. \nArticle 311\n, being an express provision of the\nConstitution, is an exception to the pleasure doctrine\ncontained in \nArticle 310(1)\n of the Constitution. Clauses (1)\nand (2) of \nArticle 311\n restrict the operation of the\npleasure doctrine so far as civil servants are concerned by\nconferring upon civil servants the safeguards provided in\nthose clauses. [179 D]\n 5. Under clause (1) of \nArticle 311\n no civil servant can\nbe dismissed or removed from service by an authority\nsubordinate to that by which he was appointed. [179 E]\n 6. Under clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n no civil servant can\nbe dismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank\nexcept after an inquiry in which he has been informed of the\ncharges against him and given a resonable opportunity of\nbeing heard in respect of such charges. As a result of the\namendment made by the \nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment)\nAct, 1976\n, in clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n it is now not\nnecessary to give to a civil servant an opportunity of\nmaking a representation with respect to the penalty proposed\nto be imposed upon him. [179 F,181 E]\n 7. An order of compulsory retirement from service\nimposed upon a civil servant by way of penalty amounts to\n\"removal\" from service and attracts the provisions of\n\nArticle 311.\n[180 E, 197 B]\n 8. Restrictions on the operation of the pleasure\ndoctrine contained in legislation made by Parliament in the\nUnited Kingdom and in clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n in\nIndia are based on public policy and are in public interest\nand for public good in as much as they give to civil\nservants a feeling of security of tenure. [182 E-F]\n 9. The safeguard provided to civil servants by clause\n(2) of \nArticle 311\n is taken away when any of the three\nclauses of the second proviso (originally the only proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2)\n) becomes applicable. [182 D]\n138\n 10. It is incorrect to say that the pleasure doctrine\nis a prerogative of the British crown which has been\ninherited by India and transposed into its Constitution,\nadapted to suit the Constitutional set up of the Republic of\nIndia. Authoritative judicial dicta both in England and in\nIndia, have laid down that the pleasure doctrine and the\nprotection afforded to civil servants by legislation in the\nUnited Kingdom and by clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n in\nIndia are based on public good. Similarly, the withdrawal of\nthe safeguard contained in clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n by the\nsecond proviso to that clause is also based on public policy\nand is in public interest and for public good. [191 C-E]\n 11. Neither \nArticle 309\n nor \nArticle 310\n nor \nArticle 311\n\nsets out the grounds for dismissal, removal or reduction in\nrank or for imposition of any other penalty upon a civil\nservant. These Articles also do not specify what the other\npenalties are These matters are left to be dealt with by\nrules made under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n or by Acts\nreferable to that Article or rules made under such Acts.\n[191 G]\n 12. The pleasure of the President or the Governor is\nnot to be exercised by him personally. It is to be exercised\nby the appropriate authority specified in rules made under\nthe proviso to \nArticle 309\n or by Acts referable to that\nArticle or rules made under such Acts. Where, however, the\nPresident or the Governor, as the case may be, exercise his\npleasure under \nArticle 310(1)\n, it is not required that such\nact of exercise of the pleasure under \nArticle 310(1)\n must be\nan act of the President or the Governor himself but it must\nbe an act of the President or the Governor in the\nConstitutional sense, that is, with the aid and on the\nadvice of the Council of Ministers. [193 E]\n North-West Frontier Province v. Suraj Narian Anand,\nL.R. [1947-48] 75 I.A., 343,352-3., State of Madhya Pradesh\nand Others v. Shardul Singh, [1970] 3 S.C.R. 302, 305-6.,\nSardari Lal v. Union of India ans others, [1971] 3 S.C.R.\n461, 465., Kameshwar Prasad and Others v. The State of Bihar\nand another[1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 369., G.K. Ghose and\nanother v. E.X. Joseph, [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 789 referred\nto.\n III. The Inquiry under \nArticle 311(2)\n 1.\n Clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n gives a Constitutional\nmandate to the principles of natural justice and the audi\nalteram partem\n139\n rule by providing that a civil servant shall not be\ndismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank until\nafter an inquiry in which he has been given a reasonable\nopportunity of being heard in respect of those charges. [234\nE]\n 2. The nature of this inquiry has been elaborately set\nout by this Court in Khem Chand v. The Union of India and\nOthers [1958] S.C.R. 1980, 1095-97 and even after the\n\nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n, the inquiry\nrequired by clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n would be the same\nexcept that it would not be necessary to give to a civil\nservant an opportunity to make a representation with respect\nto the penalty proposed to be imposed upon him. [235 B]\n 3. Apart from \nArticle 311\n prior to its amendment by the\n\nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n, it is not\nnecessary either under the ordinary law of the land or under\nindustrial law to give a second opportunity to show cause\nagainst the penalty proposed to be imposed upon an employee.\n[243 H]\n 4. If an inquiry held against a civil servant under\n\nArticle 311(2)\n is unfair or biased or had been conducted in\nsuch a manner as not to give him a fair or reasonable\nopportunity to defend himself, the principles of natural\njustice would be violated; but in such a case the order of\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank would be bad as\ncontravening the express provision of \nArticle 311(2)\n and\nthere is no scope for having recourse to \nArticle 14\n for the\npurpose of invalidating it. [235 C]\n IV. The Second Proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n 1.\n The language of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\nis plain and unambiguous. The key-words in the second\nproviso are \"this clause shall not apply\". There is no\nambiguity in these words. Where a situation envisaged in any\nof the three clauses of the second proviso arises, the\nsafeguard provided to a civil servant by clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n is taken away. [204 C]\n 2. The second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n becomes\napplicable an the three cases mentioned in clauses (a) to\n(c) of that proviso, namely, (a) Where a person is dismissed\nor removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which\nhas led to his conviction on a criminal charge; (b) Where\nthe authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to\nreduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason, to be\nrecorded by that\n140\nauthority in writing, it is not reasonably practicable to\nhold such inquiry; and (c) Where the President or the\nGovernor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the\ninterest of the security of the State it is not expedient to\nhold such inquiry. [203 A-C]\n 3. The governing words of the second proviso to clause\n(2) of \nArticle 311\n, namely, \"this clause shall not apply\",\nare mandatory and not directory and are in the nature of a\nConstitutional prohibitory injunction restraining the\ndisciplinary authority from holding an inquiry under \nArticle\n311(2)\n or from giving any kind of opportunity to the\nconcerned civil servant in a case where one of the three\nclauses of the second proviso becomes applicable. There is\nthus no scope for introducing into the second proviso some\nkind of inquiry or opportunity to show cause by a process of\ninference or implication. The maxim \"expressum facit cessare\ntacitum' (\"when there is express mention of certain things,\nthen anything not mentioned is excluded\") applies to the\ncase. This well known maxim is a principle of logic and\ncommonsense and not merely a technical rule of construction.\n[213 H-214 A]\n 4. The second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n has been in the\nConstitution of India since the time the Constitution was\noriginally enacted. It was not blindly or slavishly copied\nfrom \nsection 240(3)\n of the Government of India Act, 1935.\nThere was a considerable debate on this proviso in the\nConstituent Assembly. The majority of the members of the\nConstituent Assembly had fought for freedom and had suffered\nimprisonment in the cause of liberty and were therefore, not\nlikely to introduce into our Constitution any provision from\nthe earlier Government of India Acts which had been enacted\npurely for the benefit of a foreign imperialistic power.\nThey retained the second proviso as a matter of public\npolicy and as being in the public interest and for public\ngood. They further inserted clause (c) in the second proviso\ndispensing with the inquiry under \nArticle 311 (2)\n in a case\nwhere the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is\nsatisfied that in the interest of the security of the State\nit is not expedient to hold such inquiry as also added a new\nclause, namely, clause (3), in \nArticle 311\n giving finality\nto the decision of the disciplinary authority that it is not\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry under \nArticle\n311(2).\n \nSection 240\n of the Government of India Act, 1935,\ndid not contain any provision similar to clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or clause (3) of \nArticle\n311.\n [215 F-H]\n141\n Hira Lal Rattan Lal etc. v.

The principles of natural justice are not the\ncreation of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. \nArticle 14\n is\nnot the begetter of the principles of natural justice but is\ntheir Constitution guardian.[230 D]\n 2. The principles of natural justice consist primarily\nof two main rules, namely, \"nemo judex in cause sua\" (\"no\nman shall be a judge in his own cause\") and \"audi alteram\npartem\" (\"hear the other side\"). The corollary deduced from\nthe above two rules and particularly the audi alteram partem\nrule was \"qui aliquid statuerit parte inaudita altera,\nadguum licet dixerit, haud aequum fecerit\" (\"he who shall\ndecide anything without the other side having been heard,\nalthough he may have said what is right will not have done\nwhat is right\" or as is now expressed \"justice should not\nonly be done but should manifestly be seen to be done\").\nThese two rules and their corollary are neither new nor were\nthey the discovery of English judges but were recognised in\nmany civilizations and over many centuries.

Rep. 48b,\n52a, referred to.\n 3. \nArticle 14\n applies not only to discriminatory class\nlegislation but also to arbitrary or discriminatory State\naction. Violation of a rule of natural justice results in\narbitrariness which is the same as discrimination, and where\ndiscrimination is the result of a State action, it is a\nviolation of \nArticle 14.\n Therefore, a violation of a\nprinciple of natural justice by a State action is a\nviolation of \nArticle 14.\n [229 F-G]\n 4. The principles of natural justice apply both to\nquasi judicial as well as administrative inquiries entailing\ncivil consequences. [233 H-234 A]\n 5. It is well established both in England and in India\nthat the principles of natural justice yield to and change\nwith the exigencies of different situations which are not\nalike. They are neither cast in a rigid mould nor can they\nbe put in a legal strait-jacket. They are not immutable but\nflexible and can be adapted, modified or excluded by statute\nand statutory rules as also by the Constitution of the\ntribunal which has to decide a particular matter and the\nrules by which such tribunal is governed. [235 D-F]\n 6. If legislation and the necessities of a situation\ncan exclude the principles of natural justice including the\naudi alteram partem rule, a fortiorari so can a provision of\nthe Constitution such as the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2).\n [238 B]\n 7. The audi alteram partem rule having been excluded by\na Constitutional provision, namely, the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n, there is no scope for reintroducing it by a\nside-door to provide once again the same inquiry which the\nConstitutional provision has expressly prohibited. [238 D]\n 8. A right of making a representation after an action\nis taken against a person has been held by this Court to be\na sufficient compliance with the requirements of natural\njustice. In the case of a civil servant to whom the\nprovisions of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n have been\napplied, he has the\n143\nright of a departmental appeal in which he can show that the\ncharges made against him are not true, and an appeal is a\nwider and more effective remedy than a right of making a\nrepresentation. [234 C]\n 9. The majority view in A. K. Gopalan v. The State of\nMadras, [1950] S. C. R. 88 namely, that particular Articles\ngoverning certain Fundamental Rights operate exclusively\nwithout having any inter-relation with any other Article in\nthe Chapter on Fundamental Rights was disapproved and held\nto be not correct in Rustom Cawasji Cooper v. Union of India\n[1970] 3 S.C.R. 530, its burial service was read in Sambhu\nNath Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal and Others [1974] 2\nS.C.R. 1, Haradhan Saha and another v. The State of West\nBengal and Others [1975] 1 S.C.R. 832 and its funeral\noration was delivered in Maneka Gandhi's case, [1978] 2\nS.C.R. 64 and it is to be hoped that the ghost of that\nmajority view does not at some future time rise from its\ngrave and stand, clanking its chains, seeking to block the\nonward march of our country to progress, prosperity and the\nestablishment of a Welfare State. [240 H-241 A]\n 10. R.C. Cooper's case and the other cases which\nfollowed it do not, however apply where a Fundamental Right,\nincluding the audi alteram partem rule comprehended within\nthe guarantee of \nArticle 14\n, is excluded by the\nConstitution. Express exclusionary provisions contained in\nthe Constitution are \nArticle 31A (1)\n, \nArticle 31B\n, \nArticle\n31C\n, \nArticle 22 (5)\n and the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\nas regards the audi alteram partem rule, namely, affording\nan opportunity of a hearing to a civil servant before\nimposing the penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction in\nrank upon him. [241 B]\n 11. The principles of natural justice must be confined\nwithin their proper limits and not allowed to run wild. The\nconcept of natural justice is a magnificant thorough bred on\nwhich this nation gallops forwards towards its proclaimed\nand destined goal of \"JUSTICE, social, economic and\npolitical\". This thoroughbred must not be allowed to turn\ninto a wild and unruly house, carrering off were it lists,\nunsaddling its rider, and bursting into fields where the\nsign \"no passaran\" is put up.

[1975] 2 S.C.R. 832.\n VI. Service Rules and Acts\n 1. \nArticle 309\n is expressly made subject to the\nprovisions of the Constitution. Rules made under the proviso\nto \nArticle 309\n, Acts referable to that Article, and rules\nmade under such Acts are, therefore, subject both to \nArticle\n310(1)\n as also to \nArticle 311.\n If any such rule or Act\nimpinges upon or restricts the operation of the pleasure\ndoctrine embodies in \nArticle 310(1)\n except as expressly\nprovided in the Constitution or restricts or takes away the\nsafeguards provided to civil servants by clauses (1) and (2)\nof \nArticle 311\n, It would be void and unconstitutional as\ncontravening the provisions of \nArticle 310(1)\n or clause (1)\nor clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n, as the case may be. Any such\nAct or rule which provides for dismissal, removal or\nreduction in rank of a civil servant without holding an\ninquiry as contemplated by clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n except\nin the three cases specified in the second proviso to that\nclause would therefore, be unconstitutional and void as\ncontravening \nArticle 311(2).\n [243 A-C]\n 2. In the same way, for an Act or a rule to provide\nthat in a case where the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\napplies, any of the safeguards excluded by that proviso will\nbe available to a civil servant would be void and\nunconstitutional as impinging upon the pleasure of the\nPresident or the Governor, as the case may be. [243 E]\n 3. A well-settled rule of construction of statutes is\nthat where two interpretations are possible, one of which\nwould preserve and save the constitutionality of the\nparticular statutory provision while the other would render\nit unconstitutional\n145\nand void, the one which saves and preserves its\nconstitutionality should be adopted and the other rejected.\n[243 F]\n 4. Where an Act or a rule provides that in a case in\nwhich the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n applies any of\nthe safeguards excluded by that proviso will be available to\na civil servant, the constitutionality of such provision\nwould be preserved by interpreting it as being directory and\nnot mandatory. The breach of such directory provision would\nnot, however, furnish any cause of action or ground of\nchallenge to a civil servant because at the threshold such\ncause of action or ground of challenge would be barred by\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n [243 G]\n 5. Service rules may reproduce the provisions of the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n and authorise the\ndisciplinary authority to dispense with the inquiry as\ncontemplated by clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n in the three cases\nmentioned in the second proviso to that clause or any one or\nmore of them. Such a provision, however, is not valid and\nconstitutional without reference to the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n and cannot be read apart from it. Thus, while\nthe source of authority of a particular officer to act as a\ndisciplinary authority and dispense with the inquiry is\nderived from the service rules, the source of his power to\ndispense with the inquiry is derived from the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2)\n and not from any service rule. [243 F-G]\n 6. The omission to mention in an order of dismissal,\nremoval or reduction in rank the relevant clause of the\nsecond proviso or the relevant service rule will not have\nthe effect of invalidating the order imposing such penalty,\nand the order must be read as having been made under the\napplicable clause of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\nread with the relevant service rule. [266 H-267 A]\n 7. Rule 37 of the Central Industrial Security Force\nRules, 1969, is clumsily worded and makes little sense. To\nprovide that a member of the Central Industrial Security\nForce who has been convicted to rigorous imprisonment on a\ncriminal charge \"shall be dismissed from service\" and at the\nsame time to provide that\" only a notice shall be given to\nthe party charged proposing the penalty of dismissal for his\nhaving been convicted to rigorous imprisonment and asking\nhim to explain as to why the proposed penalty of dismissal\nshould not be imposed\" is a contradiction in terms. To read\nthese provisions as mandatory would be to render\n146\nthem unconstitutional and void. These provisions must,\ntherefore, be read as directory in order to preserve their\nconstitutionality. [263 C-G]\n 8. Rule 19 of the Central Civil Services\n(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, is\nidentical with Rule 14 of the Railway Servants (Discipline\nand Appeal) Rules, 1968, and the interpretation of the said\nRule 19 would be the same as that of the said Rule 14. [256\nF-H]\n VII. Challappan's Case\n 1. The three-Judge Bench of this Court in Divisional\nPersonnel Officer, Southern Railways and another v. T.R.\nChallappan was in error in interpreting Rule 14 of the\nRailway Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968, by\nitself and not in conjunction with the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2).\n [256 D]\n 2. The Court in Challappan's case also erred in holding\nthat the addition of the words \"the disciplinary authority\nmay consider the circumstances of the case and make such\norder thereon as it deems fit\" in the said Rule 14 warranted\nan interpretation of the said Rule different from that to be\nplaced upon the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n [254 G]\n 3. The Court in Challappan's case also erred in holding\nthat the addition of the words \"the disciplinary authority\nmay consider the circumstances of the case and make such\norder thereon as it deems fit\" in the said Rule 14 warranted\nan interpretation of the said Rule different from that to be\nplaced upon the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n It also\nerred in the interpretation placed by it upon the word\n\"consider\" occurring in the above phrase in the said Rule 14\nand in taking the view that a consideration of the\ncircumstances of the case cannot be unilateral but must be\nafter hearing the delinquent civil servant would render this\npart of the said Rule 14 unconstitutional as restricting the\nfull exclusionary operation of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2).\n [255 A-C]\n 4. The word \"consider\" in its ordinary and natural\nsense is not capable of the meaning assigned to it in\nChallappan's case. [255 G]\n 5. The consideration of the circumstances under the\nsaid Rule 14 must, therefore, be ex parte and without\naffording to the concerned civil servant an opportunity of\nbeing heard. [255 H]\n147\n 6. The decision in Challappan's case never held the\nfield for the judgment in that case was delivered on\nSeptember 15, 1975 and hardly was that case reported when in\nthe next group of appeals in which the same question was\nraised the matter was referred to a larger Bench by an order\nmade on November 18, 1976. The reference was in view of the\nearlier decision of another three-Judge Bench in M. Gopala\nKrishna Naidu v. State of Madhya Pradesh. The correctness of\nChallappan Case was, therefore, doubted from the very\nbeginning. [256 E]\n VIII. Executive Instructions\n Executive Instructions stand on a lower footing than a\nstatutory rule. Executive instructions which provide that in\na case where the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n applies,\nany safeguard excluded by that proviso would be available to\na civil servant would only be directory and not mandatory.\n[265 H]\n IX. The Scope of the Second Proviso\n 1. The three clauses of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311\n are not intended to be applied in normal and ordinary\nsituations. The second proviso is an exception to the normal\nrule and before any of the three clauses of that proviso is\napplied to the case of a civil servant, the conditions laid\ndown in that clause must be satisfied. [204 F-205 C]\n 2. Where a situation envisaged in one of the clauses of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n exists, it is not\nmandatory that the punishment of dismissal, removal of\nreduction in rank should be imposed upon a civil servant.\nThe disciplinary authority will first have to decided what\npunishment is warranted by the facts and circumstances of\nthe case. Such consideration would, however, be ex parte and\nwithout hearing the concerned civil servant. If the\ndisciplinary authority comes to the conclusion that the\npunishment which is called for is that of dismissal, removal\nor reduction in rank, it must dispense with the inquiry and\nthen decide for itself which of the aforesaid three\npenalties should be imposed. [205 A-B]\n X. Clause (a) of the Second Proviso\n 1. In a case where clause (a) of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n applies the disciplinary authority is to take\nthe conviction of the concerned civil servant as sufficient\nproof of\n148\nmisconduct on his part. It has thereafter to decide whether\nthe conduct which had led to the civil servant's conviction\non a criminal charge was such as to warrant the imposition\nof a penalty and, if so, what that penalty should be. For\nthis purpose it must peruse the judgment of the criminal\ncourt and take into consideration all the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and the various factors set out in\nChalappan's Case such as, the entire conduct of the civil\nservant of the gravity of the offence committed by him, the\nimpact which his misconduct is likely to have on the\nadministration, whether the offence for which he was\nconvicted was of a technical or trivial nature, and the\nextenuating circumstances, if any, present in the case.\nThis, however, has to be done by the disciplinary authority\nex parte and without hearing the concerned civil servant.\n[267 C-E]\n 2. The penalty imposed upon the civil servant should\nnot be arbitrary or grossly excessive or out of all\nproportion to the offence committed or one not warranted by\nthe facts and circumstances of the case. [267 H]\n 3. Where a civil servant goes to the office of his\nsuperior officer whom he believes to be responsible for\nstopping his increment and hits him on the head with an iron\nrod, so that the superior officer falls down with a bleeding\nhead, and the delinquent civil servant is tried and\nconvicted under \nsection 332\n of the Indian Penal Code but the\nMagistrate, instead of sentencing him to imprisonment,\napplies to him the provisions of \nsection 4\n of the Probation\nof Offenders Act, 1958, and after such conviction the\ndisciplinary authority, taking the above facts into\nconsideration, by way of punishment compulsorily retires the\ndelinquent civil servant under clause (i) of \nsection 19\n of\nthe Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and\nAppeal) Rules, 1965, it cannot be said that the punishment\ninflicted upon the civil servant was excessive or\narbitrary. [267 F-G]\n XI. Clause (b) of the Second Proviso.\n 1. There are two conditions precedent which must be\nsatisfied before clause (b) of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n can be applied. These conditions are (i) there must\nexist a situation which makes the holding of an inquiry\ncontemplated by \nArticle 311(2)\n not reasonably practicable,\nand (ii) the disciplinary authority should record in writing\nits reason for its satisfaction that it is not reasonably\npracticable to hold such inquiry.[269 D-E]\n149\n 2. Whether it was practicable to hold the inquiry or\nnot must be judged in the context of whether it was\nreasonably practicable to do so. [269 F]\n 3. It is not a total or absolute impracticability which\nis required by clause (b) of the second proviso. What is\nrequisite is that the holding of the inquiry is not\npracticable in the opinion of a reasonable man taking a\nreasonable view of the prevailing situation. [270 B]\n 4. The reasonable practicability of holding an inquiry\nis a matter of assessment to be made by the disciplinary\nauthority and must be judged in the light of the\ncircumstances then prevailing. The disciplinary authority is\ngenerally on the spot and knows what is happening. It is\nbecause the disciplinary authority is the best judge of the\nprevailing situation that clause (3) of \nArticle 311\n makes\nthe decision of the disciplinary authority on this question\nfinal. [270 C]\n 5. It is not possible to enumerate the cases in which\nit would not be reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry.\n Illustrative cases would be\n (a) Where a civil servant, particularly through or\ntogether with his associates, so terrorizes, threatens or\nintimidates witnesses who are going to give evidence against\nhim with fear of reprisal as to prevent them from doing so,\nor [270 A]\n (b) Where the civil servant by himself or together with\nor through others threatens, intimidates and terrorizes the\nofficer who is the disciplinary authority or members of his\nfamily so that he is afraid to hold the inquiry or direct it\nto be held, or [270 B]\n (c) Where an atmosphere of violence or of general\nindiscipline and insubordination prevails, it being\nimmaterial whether the concerned civil servant is or is not\na party to bringing about such a situation. In all these\ncases, it must be remembered that numbers coerce and terrify\nwhile an individual may not. [270 C]\n 6. The disciplinary authority is not expected to\ndispense with a disciplinary inquiry lightly or arbitrarily\nor out of\n150\nulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding of\nan inquiry or because the Department's case against the\ncivil servant is weak and must fail. [270 C]\n 7. The word \"inquiry\" in clause (b) of the second\nproviso includes a part of an inquiry. It is, therefore, not\nnecessary that the situation which makes the holding of an\ninquiry not reasonably practicable should exist before the\ninquiry is instituted against the civil servant. Such a\nsituation can also come into existence subsequently during\nthe course of the inquiry, for instance, after the service\nof a charge-sheet upon the civil servant or after he has\nfiled his written statement thereto or even after evidence\nhas been led in part. [271 D-E]\n 8. When at the commencement of the inquiry or pending\nit, the civil servant abscards and cannot be served or will\nnot participate in the inquiry it will not be reasonably\npracticable to afford to the civil servant and opportunity\nof a hearing or further hearing. In such cases, the matter\nmust proceed ex parte and on the materials before the\ndisciplinary authority. [271 E]\n 9. The recording of the reason for dispensing with the\ninquiry is a condition precedent to the application of\nclause (b) of the second proviso. This is a Constitutional\nobligation and if such reason is not recorded in writing,\nthe order dispensing with the inquiry and the other of\npenalty following thereupon would both be void and\nunconstitutional. It is, however, not necessary that the\nreason should find a place in the final order but it would\nbe advisable to record it in the final order in order to\navoid an allegation that the reason was not recorded in\nwriting before passing the final order but was subsequently\nfabricated. [271 G]\n 10. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not\ncontain details particulars but it cannot be vague or just a\nrepetition of the language of clause (b) of the second\nproviso. [272 C]\n 11. It is also not necessary to communicate the reason\nfor dispensing with the inquiry to the concerned civil\nservant but it would be better to do so in order to\neliminate the possibility of an allegation being made that\nthe reason was subsequently fabricated. [272 B]\n 12. The obligation to record the reason in writing is\nprovided in clause (b) of the second proviso so that the\n151\nsuperiors of the disciplinary authority may be able to judge\nwhether such authority had exercised its power under clause\n(b) properly or not.[272 F]\n 13. It is, however, better for the disciplinary\nauthority to communicate to the concerned civil servant its\nreason for dispensing with the inquiry because such\ncommunication would eliminate the possibility of an\nallegation being made that the reason had been subsequently\nfabricated. It would also enable the civil servant to\napproach the High Court under \nArticle 226\n or, in a fit case,\nthe Supreme Court under \nArticle 32.\n [272 H]\n 14. It would be illogical to hold that administrative\nwork carried out by senior officers should be paralysed by\nsending them to other stations to hold the inquiry just\nbecause a delinquent civil servant either by himself or\nalong with or through others makes the holding of an inquiry\nby the designated disciplinary authority or inquiry officer\nnot reasonably practicable. [273 C]\n 15. In a case falling under clause (b) of the second\nproviso it is not necessary that the civil servant should be\nplaced under suspension until such time as the situation\nimproves and it becomes possible to hold the inquiry because\nin such cases neither public interest nor public good\nrequires that salary or subsistence allowance should be\ncontinued to be paid out of the public exchequer to the\nconcerned civil servant. In certain cases, the exigencies of\na situation would require that prompt action should be taken\nand suspending a civil servant would not serve the purpose,\nand sometimes not taking prompt action might result in the\ntrouble spreading and the situation worsening and at times\nbecoming uncontrolable. Not taking prompt action may also be\nconstrued by the trouble-makers as a sign of weakness on the\npart of the authorities and thus encourage them to step up\ntheir activities or agitation. Where such prompt action is\ntaken there is an element of deterrence in it but this is\nunavoidable and a necessary concomitance of such an action.\n[273 D]\n 16. If an inquiry into the charges against a civil\nservant is not reasonably practicable, it stands to reason\nthat an inquiry into the question whether the disciplinary\ninquiry should be dispensed with or not is equally not\nreasonably practicable. [273 D]\n 17. In situations where a large group of members of the\nCentral Industrial Security collectively indulge in several\nof acts of insubordination indiscipline and intimidation\nwith the\n152\ncommon object of coercing those in charge of the\nadministration of the Force and the Government to compel\nthem to grant recognition to their Association and to\nconcede their demands, it is not possible to particularise\nin the orders of dismissal the acts of each individual\nmember who participated in the commission of these acts. The\nparticipation of each individual might be of a greater or\nlesser degree but the acts of each individual contributed to\nthe creation of a situation in which the security force\nitself had become a security risk. [291 C-E]\n 18. The quantum and extent of the penalty to be imposed\nin each case would depend upon the gravity of the situation\nand the extent to which the acts said to be committed by the\npraticular civil servants, even though not serious in\nthemselves, in conjunction with acts committed by others,\ncontributed to bringing about the situation. The fact, that\nat a particular centre certain civil servants were dismissed\nfrom service while at some other centres they were only\nremoved from service does not mean that the penalties were\narbitrarily imposed. [292 A-B]\n XII. Clause (c) of the Second Proviso.\n The expression \"security of the State\" in clause (c) of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n does not mean security\nof the entire country or a whole State but includes security\nof a part of a State. [275 E]\n 2. Security of the State cannot be confined to an armed\nrebellion or revolt for there are various ways in which the\nsecurity of the State can be affected such as by State\nsecrets or information relating to defence production or\nsimilar matters being passed on to other countries, whether\ninimical or not to India, or by secret links with\nterrorists. [275 E]\n 3. The way in which the security of the State is\naffected may be either open or clandestine. [275 F]\n 4. Disaffection in the armed forces or paramilitary\nforces or the police force would affect the security of the\nState. The importance of the proper discharge of the duties\nby members of these Forces and the maintenance of discipline\namong them is emphasised in \nArticle 33\n of the Constitution.\n[275 G]\n 5. Disaffection in any armed force or para-military\nforce or police force is likely to spread because\ndissatisfaction and\n153\ndisaffected members of such a Force spread dissatisfaction\nand disaffection among other members of the Force and thus\ninduce them not to discharge their duties properly and to\ncommit acts of indiscipline, insubordination or disobedience\nto the orders of their superiors. Such a situation cannot be\na matter affecting only law and order or public order but is\na matter vitally affecting the security of the State. [276\nA-B]\n 6. The interest of the security of the State can be\naffected by actual acts or even by the likelihood of such\nacts taking place. [277 D]\n 7. In an inquiry into acts affecting the interest of\nthe security of the State, several matters not fit or proper\nto be made public, including the source of information\ninvolving a civil servant in such acts, would be disclosed\nand thus in such cases an inquiry into acts prejudicial to\nthe interest of the security of the State would as much\nprejudice the interest of the security of the State as those\nacts themselves would. [279 D]\n 8. The condition for the application of clause (c) of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n is the satisfaction of\nthe President or the Governor, as the case may be, that it\nis not expedient in the interest of the security of the\nState to hold a disciplinary inquiry. [277 D]\n 9. Such satisfaction is not required to be that of the\nPresident or the Governor personally but of the President or\nthe Governor, as the case may be, acting in the\nConstitutional sense. [278 A]\n State of Rajasthan and Others etc. etc. v. Union of\nIndia etc. etc. [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1, 82., referred to.\n 10. \"Expedient\" means \"Advantageous, fit, proper\nsuitable. Where, therefore, the President of the Governor,\nas the case may be, is satisfied that it will not be\nadvantageous or fit or proper or suitable or politic in the\ninterest of the security of the State to hold an inquiry, he\nwould be entitled to dispense with it under clause (c) of\nthe second proviso. [277 F]\n 11. Under clause (c) of the second proviso the\nsatisfaction reached by the President or the Governor, as\nthe case may be, must necessarily be a subjective\nsatisfaction because expediency involves matters of policy.\n[278 G]\n154\n 12. Satisfaction of the President or the Governor under\nclause (c) of the second proviso may be arrived at as a\nresult of secret information received by the Governor about\nthe brewing danger to the security of the State and like\nmatters. There are other factors which are also required to\nbe considered, weighed and balanced in order to reach the\nrequisite satisfaction whether holding an inquiry would be\nexpedient or not. If the requisite satisfaction has been\nreached as a result of secret information received by the\nGovernment, making known such information may very often\nresult in disclosure of the source of such information and\nonce known, the particular source would no more be available\nto the Government. The reason for the satisfaction reached\nby the President or the Governor under clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso cannot, therefore, be required to be recorded\nin the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank nor\ncan it be made public. [279 E, 280 B]\n 13. When a number of members of the Madhya Pradesh\nDistrict Police Force and the Madhya Pradesh Special Armed\nForce, in order to obtain the release on bail of two of\ntheir colleagues who had been refused bail and remained into\njudicial custody because of an incident which took place at\nthe annual Mela attacked the police station at the Mela\nground, ransacked it and forced the wireless operator to\nclose down the wireless set and the situation became so\ndangerous that senior district and police officers had to\napproach the judicial Magistrate at night to get the two\narrested constables released on bail and, after discussion\nat a Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken and the advice of\nthe Council of Ministers was tendered to the Governor of\nMadhya Pradesh who accepted it and issued orders of\ndismissal of these persons by applying clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso to them it cannot be said that the provisions\nof the said clause (c) were not properly applied. [295 E-296\nC]\n 14. Similarly, when after these members of the Madhya\nPradesh District Police Force and the Madhya Pradesh Special\nArmed force were dismissed, some other members of these\nForces began carrying on an active propaganda against the\nGovernment, visiting various places in the State of Madhya\nPradesh, holding secret meetings, distributing leaflets and\ninciting the constabulary in these places to rise against\nthe administration as a body in protest against the action\ntaken by the Government and, on such information being\nreceived, there were also dismissed by applying clause (c)\nof the second proviso to them, it cannot be said that the\nsaid clause (c) was not properly applied. [296 F-297 B]\n155\n A civil servant who has been dismissed, removed or\nreduced in rank by applying to his case one of the clauses\nof the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or an analogour\nservice rule has two remedies available to him. These\nremedies are;\n (i) The appropriate departmental remedy provided for\n in the relevant service rules, and\n (ii) if still dissatisfied, invoking the court's power\n of judicial review. [216 A-B]\n XIV. Departmental Remedies.\n Service rules generally provide for departmental\nremedies by way of an appeal, revision and review in the\ncase of disciplinary action taken against a civil servant.\n 2. Sub-clause (ii) of clause (c) of the first proviso\nto Rule 25(1) of the Railway Servants (Discipline and\nAppeal) Rules, 1968, provides that where an inquiry has not\nbeen held, the revising authority shall itself hold such\ninquiry or indirect such inquiry to be held. A railway\nservant has therefore a right to demand in revision an\ninquiry into the charges against him subject to a situation\nenvisaged in Rule 14 of the said Rules not prevailing at\nthat time. [248 G-H]\n 3. Although a provision similar to sub-clause (ii) of\nclause (c) of the first proviso of the first proviso to Rule\n25(1) of the Railways Servants (Discipline and Appeal)\nRules, 1968, does not exist in the rules relating to\nappeals, having regard to the factors set out in Rule 22 (2)\nwhich are to be considered by the appellate authority in\ndeciding an appeal, a provision similar to the said sub-\nclause (ii) of clause (c) of the first proviso to Rules\n25(1) should be read and imported into the provisions\nrelating to appeals in the said Rules. [249 D-F]\n 4. Even in a case where at the time of the hearing of\nthe appeal or revision, as the case may be, a situation\nenvisaged by the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n exists, as\nthe civil servants, if dismissed or removed, is not\ncontinuing in service and, if reduced in rank, is continuing\nin service with the reduced rank, the hearing of the appeal\nor revision, as the case may be, should be postponed for a\nreasonable length of time to enable the situation to return\nto normal. [273 G]\n156\n 5. An order imposing penalty passed by the President or\nthe Governor, as the case may be, cannot be challenged in a\ndepartmental appeal or revision. [265 D]\n 6. A civil servant who has been dismissed or removed\nfrom service or reduced in rank by applying to his case one\nof the clauses of the second proviso of \nArticle 311(2)\n or of\nan analogous service rule has, therefore, the right in a\ndepartmental appeal or revision to a full and complete\ninquiry into the allegations made against him subject to a\nsituation envisaged in the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\nnot existing at the time of the hearing of the appeal or\nrevision application. Even in a case where such a situation\nexists, he has the right to have the hearing of the appeal\nor revision application postponed for a reasonable length of\ntime for the situation to become normal. [273 F]\n 7. In an appeal, revision or review by a civil servant\nwho has been dismissed or removed from service or reduced in\nrank by applying to his case clause (a) of the second\nproviso or an analogous service rule, it is not open to the\ncivil servant to contend that he was wrongly convicted by\nthe criminal court. He can, however, contend that the\npenalty imposed upon him is to severe or excessive or was\none not warranted by the facts and circumstances of the\ncase. If he is in fact not the civil servant who was\nactually convicted on a criminal charge, he can contend in\nappeal, revision or review against such order of penalty\nthat it was a case of mistaken identity. [264 E]\n 8. A civil servant who has been dismissed or removed\nfrom service or reduced in rank by applying to his case\nclause (b) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or an\nanalogous service rule can claim in appeal or revision that\nin inquiry should be held with respect to the charges on\nwhich such penalty has been imposed upon him unless a\nsituation envisaged by the second proviso is prevailing at\nthe hearing of the appeal or revision application. Even in\nsuch a case the hearing of the appeal or revision\napplication should be postponed for a reasonable length of\ntime for the situation to return to normal. [264 B]\n 9. In a case where a civil servant has been dismissed\nor removed from service or reduced in rank by applying\nclause (b) of the second proviso or an analogous service\nrule to him, by reason of clause (3) of \nArticle 311\n, it is\nnot open to him contend in appeal, revision or review that\nthe inquiry was wrongly dispensed with. [264 G]\n157\n 10. In a case where a civil servant has been dismissed\nor removed from service or reduced in rank by applying\nclause (c) of the second proviso or an analogous service\nrule to him, no appeal or revision will lie if the order of\npenalty was passed by the President or the Governor. If\nhowever, the inquiry has been dispensed with by the\nPresident or the Governor and the order of penalty has been\npassed by the disciplinary authority (a position envisaged\nby clause (iii) of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants\n(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968, and clause (iii) of\nRule 19 of the Central Civil Services (Classification,\nControl and Appeal) Rules, 1965) a departmental appeal or\nrevision will lie. In such an appeal or revision, the civil\nservant can ask for an inquiry to be held into his alleged\nconduct unless at the time of the hearing of the appeal or\nrevision a situation to envisaged by the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n is prevailing. Even in such a situation the\nhearing of the appeal or revision application should be\npostponed for a reasonable length of time for the situation\nto become normal. The civil servant, however, cannot contend\nin such appeal or revision that the inquiry was wrongly\ndispensed with by the President or the Governor. [265 B-E]\n XV. Judicial Review.\n 1. Where a clause of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n or an analogous service rule is applied on an\nextraneous ground or a ground having no relation to the\nsituation envisaged in such clause or rule, the action of\nthe disciplinary authority in applying that clause or rule\nwould be mala fide and, therefore, bad in law and the court\nin exercise of its power of judicial review would strike\ndown both the order dispensing with the inquiry and the\norder of penalty following thereupon. [273 C-D]\n 2. Where a civil servant has been dismissed or removed\nfrom service or reduced in rank by applying clause (a) of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or an analogous service\nrule and he invokes the court's power of judicial review, if\nthe court finds that the penalty imposed by the impugned\norder is arbitrary or grossly excessive or out of all\nproportion to the offence committed or was not warranted by\nthe facts and circumstances of the case or the requirements\nof the particular government service to which the concerned\ncivil servant belonged, the court will strike down the\nimpugned order. In such a case, it is, however, not\nnecessary that the court should always order reinstatement.\nThe court can instead substitute a penalty which in its\nopinion would be just and proper in the circumstances of the\ncase. If\n158\nhowever, the court finds that he was not in fact the civil\nservant who was convicted, it will strike down the impugned\norder of penalty and order his reinstatement. [267 G-268 A,\n273 F]\n 3. In the case of a civil servant who has been\ndismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank by\napplying clause (b) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\nor an analogous service rule, the High Court under \nArticle\n226\n of this Court under \nArticle 32\n will interfere on grounds\nwell-established in law for the exercise of its power of\njudicial review in matters where administrative discretion\nis exercised. [274 A]\n 4. The finality given by clause (3) of \nArticle 311\n to\nthe disciplinary authority's decision that it was not\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry is not binding\nupon the court and the court would consider whether clause\n(b) of the second proviso or an analogous service rule had\nbeen properly applied or not. [274 B]\n 5. In examining the relevancy of the reasons given for\ndispensing with the inquiry, the court will consider the\ncircumstances which, according to the disciplinary\nauthority, made it come to the conclusion that it was not\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry. If the court\nfinds that the reason are irrelevant, the order dispensing\nwith the inquiry and the order of penalty following upon it\nwould be void and the court will strike them down. In\nconsidering the relevancy of the reasons given by the\ndisciplinary authority, the court will not, however, sit in\njudgment over the reasons like a court of first appeal in\norder to decide whether or not the reasons are germane to\nclause (b) of the second proviso or an analogous service\nrule. The court must put itself in the place of the\ndisciplinary authority and consider what in the then\nprevailing situation a reasonable man acting in a reasonable\nmanner would have done. It will judge the matter in the\nlight of the then prevailing situation. Where two view are\npossible, the court will decline to interfere. [274 C-D]\n 6. Where it is alleged that clause (b) of the second\nproviso or an analogous service rule was applied mala fide,\nthe court will examine the charge of mala fides. A mere bare\nallegations of mala fides without any particulars of mala\nfides will not, however, amount to a plea of mala fides and\nrequires to be ignored. [280 H]\n 7. If the reasons for dispensing with the inquiry are\nnot\n159\ncommunicated to the concerned civil servant and the matter\ncomes to court, the court can direct the reasons to be\nproduced and furnished to the civil servant and if still no\nproduced, a presumption should be drawn the reasons were not\nrecorded in writing and the impugned order would then stand\ninvalidated. Such presumption can, however, be rebutted by a\nsatisfactory explanation for the non-production of the\nwritten reasons. [272 H-273 A]\n 8. Where a civil servant is dismissed or removed from\nservice or reduced in rank by applying clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso or an analogous service rule to his case, the\nsatisfaction of the President or the Governor that it is not\nexpedient in the interest of the security of the State to\nhold an inquiry being a subjective satisfaction would not be\na fit matter for judicial review. [278 F]\n 9. It is not necessary for the court to decide the\nquestion whether the satisfaction of the President or the\nGovernor can be challenged on the ground that it has been\nreached mala fide or is based on wholly extraneous or\nirrelevant grounds in a case where all the materials\nincluding the advice of the Council of Ministers have been\nproduced and such materials show that the satisfaction of\nthe President or the Governor was neither reached mala fide\nnor was it based on any extraneous or irrelevant ground.\n[279 E]\n 10. By reason of the express provision of \nArticle 74(2)\n\nand \nArticle 163(3)\n of the Constitution the question whether\nany, any if so what, advice was tendered by the Ministers to\nthe President or the Governor, as the case may be, cannot be\ninquired into by any court. [279 F]\n 11. Whether the court should order production of the\nmaterials upon which the advice of the Council of Ministers\nto the President or the Governor, as the case may be, was\nbased in order to determine whether the satisfaction of the\nPresident or the Governor was arrived at mala fide or was\nbased on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds would\ndepend upon whether the documents fall within the class of\nprivileged documents and whether in respect of them\nprivilege has been properly claimed or not. [277 G-278 B]\n In re Tulsiram Patel\n160\n The Respondent-Tulsiram Patel was a permanent auditor\nin the Regional Audit Office. Orders were issued for\nstopping his increment for one year, where-upon he went to\nthe Regional Audit Officer demanded an explanation from him\nas to why he had stopped his increment, and not satisfied\nwith the reply of the auditor officer struck him with an\niron rod, whereupon the officer fell down, his head\nbleeding. The Respondent was tried and convicted under \nSec.\n332\n of the Indian Penal Code but the Magistrate instead of\nsentencing the respondent to imprisonment, invoked the\nprovisions \nSec. 4\n of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958\nand released him for a period of one year on executing a\nbond of good behaviour. The Respondent's appeal against his\nconviction was dismissed. [281 F-H]\n The Controller General of Defence Accounts, the\ndisciplinary authority, imposed upon the Respondent the\npenalty of compulsory retirement under clause (1) of Rule 19\nof the Civil Service Rules. The respondent's departmental\nappeal was dismissed. [282 A, D]\n The Respondent thereafter filed a Writ Petition, and\nthe High Court relying upon Challappan's Case held that no\nopportunity had been afforded to the Respondent before\nimposing the penalty of compulsory retirement on him and\nthat the impugned order was defective inasmuch as it did not\nindicate the circumstances which were considered by the\ndisciplinary authority except the fact of conviction of the\nRespondent. [282 E-F]\n The appeal of the Union of India was allowed, the\njudgment and order appealed against were reversed and set\naside and the writ petition filed by the Respondent in the\nHigh Court is dismissed. [284 A]\n CISF MATTERS\n The respondents who were members of the CIS Force Unit\nat Bokaro Steel Plant and were dismissed from service. The\nmembers of this CIS'F Unit at Bokaro had formed an All-India\nassociation and one of the dismissed person was elected it\nGeneral Secretary. Thereafter a country-wide agitation was\ncarried on for recognition of the association. In June 1979\nsome of the members went to Delhi to meet the Home Minister.\nA demonstration was staged and some of the demonstrators\nwere arrested. At Bokaro Steel Plant the agitation which was\ngoing became aggravated and out of 1900 persons belonging to\nCISF Unit Bokaro, about 1000\n161\npersons participated in processions and violent\ndemonstrations. They indulged in several acts of violence\nand created serious in-discipline. The agitation and the\nviolent activity reached serious proportion in the last week\nof June 1979 with the result that the Army that to be called\nby the State Authorities on 23.6.1979, took up positions\nround the CISF Lines and called upon the agitators to give\nup charge of the Aroury. The agitators refused and started\nfiring at the Army, who returned the fire, and the exchange\nof fire resulted in the instant death of one Army Major. The\noffending CISF members were over powered, and arrested. [284\nF-285 D]\n The authorities were of the opinion, that having regard\nto the violent and disturbed situation which prevailed in\nthe Bokaro Steel Plant, the collective action of violence,\nmass terror and intimidation and threats to the supervisory\nand loyal staff, any inquiry in accordance with Rules 34, 35\nand 36 of CISF Rules 1969 or in accordance with the\nrequirements of \nArticle 311(2)\n would be dangerous counter-\nproductive and would aggravate the existing dangerous\nsituation, the delinquent personnel were dismissed in\nexercise of the powers conferred by sub-rule (b) of rule 37\nof the CISF Rules 1969 read with clause (b) of the second\nproviso of clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution.\n[288 C-289 A]\n The CIS Force has been constituted under the \nCISF Act\n\nfor the better protection and security of industrial\nundertakings owned by the government. The CIS Force is an\narmed Force and the security duties to be performed by the\nCIS Force are of vital importance to the industrial\nproduction of the country. [289 B, G]\n All the acts indulged in by the members of the Force\nvirtually amounted to a mutiny and how grave the situation\nwas can be judged from the fact that the army had to be\ncalled out and a pitched battle took place between the army\nand the members of the Force. [291 A]\n No person with any reason or sense of responsibility\ncan say that in such a situation the holding of an inquiry\nwas reasonable and practicable. [291 B]\n The appellate authority under the Central Industrial\nSecurity Force Rules 1969 was directed to dispose of an\nexpeditiously as possible such appeals of the members of the\nForce as might still be pending. Such of those members who\nhad\n162\nnot filled any appeal, in view of their reliance on\nChallappan's case, time was granted to them to file a\ndepartmental appeal, and the concerned authority was\ndirected to condone the delay in the filing of the appeal\nand to dispose it of on merits.[291 H-292 C]\n RAILWAY SERVICE MATTERS\n Railway Servants were either dismissed or removed from\nservice by applying to their cases either clause (ii) of\nRule 14 of the Railways Servants Rules or clause (ii) of\nRule 14 read with clause (b) of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n, as they were alleged to have been concerned\nin incidents which took place in the all-India strikes of\nrailway employees. Many of these employees belonged to the\nall-India loco-running staff. The railway servants went on\nthese strikes with the object of forcing the Government to\nmeet their demands. [292 E-F]\n Railway service is a public utility service within the\nmeaning of clause (a) of \nsection 2\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 and the proper running of the railway\nservice is a vital to the country. Where, therefore, the\nrailway employees went on an illegal strike without\ncomplying with the provisions of \nsection 22\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act 1947, and thereby committed an\noffence punishable with imprisonment and fine under \nsection\n26(1)\n of the said Act, and the railway services were\nparalysed, loyal workers and superior officers assaulted and\nintimidated, the country held to ransom, the economy of the\ncountry and public interest and public good prejudicially\naffected, prompt and immediate action was called for in\norder to bring the situation to normal. In these\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that an inquiry was\nreasonably practicable or that clause (b) of the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311\n was not properly applied. [294 C-F,\n295 C]\nMADHYA PRADESH POLICE FORCES MATTERS\n Members of the M.P. District Police Force or M.P.\nSpecial Armed Force were dismissed by orders of the Governor\nof Madhya Pradesh by applying clause (c) of the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n [295 E]\n An incident took place on January 18, 1981 at the\nannual Mela held at Gwalior in which one man was burnt\nalive. Some persons including a constable from each of these\ntwo forces, were arrested and remanded to judicial custody.\nOn January 20, 1981\n163\nseveral members of these two Forces indulged in violent\ndemonstration and rioted at the Mela ground demanding the\nrelease of their colleagues. They attacked the police\nstation at the Mela Grounds, ransacked it and forced the\noperator to close down the wireless set. [296 D]\n The police are the guardians of Law and order, and if\nthese guards turn law-breakers and create violent public\ndisorder and incite others to do the same, prompt and urgent\naction becomes necessary and the holding of an inquiry into\nthe conduct of each individual member of the police force\nwould not be expedient in the interest of the security of\nthe State.[297 A-B]\n(Per M.P. Thakkar J-dissenting)\n 'Challappan's has been rightly decided. And there is no\ncompulsion to overrule it - Even if the other point of view\nwere to appear to be more 'attractive' it is neither a good\nnor a sufficient ground to overrule 'Challappan'. The\ndecision, does no more than enjoin in the context of Rule\n14(1) (a) and therefore, as a logical corollary, also in the\ncontext of Rule 14 (a) (b) of the Railways servants\n(Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968, that an employee must\natleast be heard on one question of quantum of punishment\nbefore he is dismissed or removed from service without\nholding any inquiry. The ratio of the decision is so\ninnocuous that there is hardly any need to overturn it. [299\nF-G]\n Concurrence with the consequential orders being passed\nin these cases and association with the exposition of law in\nregard to the true meaning and content of the 'pleasure\ndoctrine' and its implications and impact is not possible.\n[300 B]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 6814\nof 1981 etc.\n From the Judgment and Order dated 23.6.1982 of the\nMadhya Pradesh High Court in M.

Nair for the\nintervener.\n\n The following Judgments were delivered :\n\n164\n\n MADON, J. The above Appeals by Special Leave granted by\nthis Court and the above Writ Petitions filed either in this\nCourt under \narticle 32\n of the Constitution of India or in\ndifferent High Courts under \nArticle 226\n and transferred to\nthis Court raise a substantial question of law as to the\ninterpretation of \nArticles 309\n, 310\n and \n311\n of the\nConstitution and in particular of what is now, after the\namendment of clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n by the \nConstitution\n(Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n, the second proviso to\nthat clause.\n\n The Genesis of the Appeals and Writ Petitions\n To understand what questions fall for determination by\nthis Court in these Appeals and Writ Petitions, it is first\nnecessary to sketch briefly how they have come to be heard\nby this Constitution Bench.\n\n \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution confers certain\nsafeguards upon persons employed in civil capacities under\nthe Union of India or a State. The first safeguard (which is\ngiven by clause (1) of \nArticle 311\n) is that such person\ncannot be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate\nto that by which he was appointed. The second safeguard\n(which is given by clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n) is that he\ncannot be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank except after\nan inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges\nagainst him and given a reasonable opportunity of being\nheard in respect of those charges. The second safeguard is,\nhowever, not available to him when he is dismissed, removed\nor reduced in rank in any of the three cases mentioned in\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n These three cases are\nset out in clauses (a) to (c) of the second proviso. Under\nclause (a), such person can be dismissed, removed or reduced\nin rank without any inquiry on the ground of conduct which\nhas led to his conviction on a criminal charge. Under Clause\n\n(b), any of these three penalties can be imposed upon him\nwhere the authority empowered to impose any of these\npenalties is satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded\nby that authority in writing, it is not reasonably\npracticable to hold such inquiry. Under clause (c), any of\nthe above penalties can be imposed upon him where the\nPresident or the Governor of a state, as the case may be, is\nsatisfied that in the interest of the security of the State\nit is not expedient to hold such inquiry.\n\n All the government servants in the above Appeal and\nWrit Petitions have been either dismissed or removed from\nservice without holding any inquiry. They have not been\ninformed of the charges against them nor been given any\nopportunity of being\n\n165\n\nheard in respect of those charges. The penalty of dismissal\nor removal, as the case may be, has been imposed upon them\nunder one or the other of the three clauses of the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or under similar provision in\nrules made under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n or in rules made\nunder an Act referable to \nArticle 309\n, for instance, Rule 19\nof the Central Civil Services Classification, Control and\nAppeal) Rules, 1965, Rule 14 of the Railway Servants\n(Discipline and Appeal) Rule 1968, and Rule 37 of the\nCentral Industrial Security Force Rules, 1969, or under such\na rule read with one of the clauses of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2).\n\n Aggrieved by these orders of dismissal and removal,\nseveral government servants filed writ petitions under\n\nArticle 226\n of the Constitution in different High Courts.\nSome of these writ petitions were allowed, mainly on the\nbasis of a decision of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in\nDivisional Personnel Officer, Southern Railway & Anr. v.\nT.R. Challappan, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 783, given on September 15,\n1975, while a few were dismissed. Appeals by Special Leave\nagainst those judgments were filed in this Court. In three\nother similar appeals, namely, Civil Appeals Nos. \n1088, 1089\nand 1120 of 1975, another three-Judge Bench of this Court\nfelt that there was a conflict between Challappan's case and\nan earlier decision of another three-Judge Bench of this\nCourt, namely, \nM. Gopala Krishan Naidu v. State of Madhya\nPradesh\n, [1968] 1 S.C.R. 355, and directed on November 18,\n1976, that the papers in those three appeals be placed\nbefore the learned Chief Justice to enable him to refer\nthose appeals to a larger Bench. The said appeals were thus\nreferred to the Constitution Bench. Because of the said\norder all the above Appeals and Writ Petitions were also\nplaced before this Constitution Bench. During the course of\nthe hearing of all these matters by this Constitution Bench,\nthe said Civil Appeals Nos. 1088, 1089 and 1120 of 1975\nwere, however, got dismissed on March 29, 1984, but the\nabove Appeals and Writ Petitions were fully heard and are\nbeing disposed of by this Judgment.\n\n Civil Servants\n Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in his book \"The Common\nLaw\", consisting of lectures delivered by him while teaching\nlaw at Harvard and published just one year before he was\nappointed in 1882 an Associate Justice of the Massachusetts\nSupreme Judicial Court, said :\n\n166\n\n \"The Law embodies the story of a nation's development\n through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as\n if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a\n book of a mathematics. In order to know what it is we\n must know what it has been and what it tends to\n become.\"\n\nIt will not, therefore, be out of place to begin this\nJudgment with a brief historical sketch of the civil service\nin India as also of the law applicable to civil servants and\nthe changes which have taken place in it from time to time.\n\n Civil servants, that is, persons who are members of a\ncivil service of the Union of India or an all-India service\nor a civil service of a State or who hold a civil post under\nthe Union or a State, occupy in law a special position. The\nordinary law of master and servant does not apply to them.\nUnder that law, whether the contract of service is for a\nfixed period or not. If it contains a provision for its\ntermination by notice, it can be so terminated. If there is\nno provision for giving a notice and the contract is not for\na fixed period, the law implies an obligation to give a\nreasonable notice. Where no notice in the first case or no\nreasonable notice in the second case is given, the contract\nis wrongfully terminated and such wrongful termination will\ngiven rise to a claim for damages. This is subject to what\nmay otherwise be provided in industrial and labour laws\nwhere such laws are applicable. The position of civil\nservants both in England and in India is, however, vastly\ndifferent.\n\n The Civil Service in England\n Our civil services are modelled upon the British\npattern though in some respects there are important\ndifferences between the two. In England, except where\notherwise provided by statute, all public officers and\nservants of the Crown hold their appointments at the\npleasure of the Crown or durante bene placito (\"during good\npleasure\" or \"during the pleasure of the appoint or\") as\nopposed to an office held dum bene se gesserit (\"during good\nconduct\"), also called quadiu se bene gesserit (\"as long as\nhe shall behave himself well\"). When a person holds office\nduring the pleasure of the Crown, his appointment can be\nterminated at any time without assigning cause. The exercise\nof pleasure by the Crown can, however, be restricted by\nlegislation enacted by Parliament because in the United\nKingdom Parliament is sovereign and has the right to make or\nunmake any law whatever\n\n167\n\nand all that a court of law can do with an Act passed by\nParliament is to interpret its meaning but not to set it\naside or declare it void Blackstone in his Commentaries has\nthus described the unlimited legislative authority of\nParliament(1 Bl., Comm. pp. 160,161):\n\n \"It hath sovereign and uncontrollable authority in\n the making confirming, enlarging, restraining\n abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding\n laws, concerning matters of all possible\n denominations, ecclesiastical or temporal, civil,\n military, maritime, or criminal\" this being the\n place where that absolute despotic power, which\n must in all governments reside somewhere, is\n entrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms.\n All mischiefs and grievances, operations and the\n laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary\n tribunal. It can regulate or new-model the\n succession to the Crown; as was done in the reign\n of Henry VIII, and William III. It can alter the\n established religion of the land; as was done in a\n variety of instances, in the reigns of king Henry\n VIII and his three children. It can change and\n create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom\n and of parliaments themselves; as was done by the\n act of union, and the several statutes for\n triennial and septennial elections. It can, in\n short, do everything that is not naturally\n impossible; and therefore some have no scrupled to\n call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the\n omnipotence of Parliament. True it is, that what\n the Parliament doth, no authority upon earth can\n undo.\"\n\nJean Louis De Lolme, the eighteenth-century Swiss\nconstitutionalist in his \"Constitution de 1 'Angleterre\"\n\n(\"Constitution of England\"), which gave many on the\ncontinent their ideas of one British Constitution, summed up\nthe position of Parliament in the English constitutional law\nin the following apophthegm quoted in Dicey's Introduction\nto the Study of the Law of the Constitution (see 10th\nEdition, p.43):\n\n \"It is a fundamental principle with English\n lawyers, that Parliament can do everything but\n make a woman a man, and a man a woman.\"\n\n168\n\n So far as the pleasure doctrine in England is\nconcerned, Lord Diplock in Chelliah Kodeeswaran v. Attorney-\nGeneral of Ceylon, L.R. [1970] A.C. 1111, 1118, P.C., has\nsuccinctly stated its position in English law as follows:\n\n \"It is now well established in British\n Constitutional theory, at any rate as it has\n developed since the eighteenth century, that any\n appointment as a Crown servant, however\n subordinate, is terminable at will unless it is\n expressly otherwise provided by legislation.\"\n\nIn practice, however, a dismissal would take place only as\nthe result of well-established disciplinary processes.\n\n In recent years, though the Crown still retains the\nright to dismiss at pleasure, the legal position of civil\nservants has radically changed as a result of legislation,\nand legally binding collective agreements can be entered\ninto between the Crown and representative of its staff and\nthose representatives can sue for breach of any conditions\nof service covered by these agreement. Further, a civil\nservant can bring an action for unfair dismissal or sue on\nhis conditions of service. But just as an ordinary employee\ncannot insist on continuing in employment, so also a civil\nservant cannot insist on continuing in employment. The\nremedy in both cases is to recover damages for wrongful\ndismissal. (See Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition,\nVolume 8, Paras 1106 and 1303).\n\n The Pre-Constitution Civil Services in India\n It is unnecessary to go back more than two centuries to\ntrace the origin and development of the Civil Service in\nIndia. The East India Company sent out to India its own\nservants and so did the Crown, and from the earliest times,\nunder the various Charters given to the East India Company,\nthe Crown could at its pleasure remove any person holding\noffice, whether civil or military, under the East India\nCompany. The Court of Directors of the East India Company\nhad also the power to remove or dismiss any of its officers\nor servants not appointed by the Crown. \nSection 35\n of the\nAct of 1793 (33 Geo. III. c.52) made it lawful to and for a\nKing's Majesty, his heirs and successors, by any writing or\ninstrument under his or their sign manual, countersigned by\nthe President of the Board of Commissioners for the affairs\nof\n\n169\n\nIndia, to remove or recall any person holding any office,\nemployment or commission, civil or military, under the East\nIndia Company; while \nsection 36\n of that Act provided that\nnothing contained in that Act should extend, or be construed\nto extend, to preclude or take away the power of the Court\nof Directors of the East India Company from removing or\nrecalling any of its officers or servants and that the Court\nof Directors shall and may at all times have full liberty to\nremove, recall or dismiss any of such officers or servants\nat their will and pleasure in the like manner as if that Act\nhad not been passed. Similar provisions were made in the Act\nof 1833 (3 & 4 will IV, c.85) by sections 74 and 75 of that\nAct. Section 74 made it lawful \"for His Majesty by any\nWriting under His Sign Manual, countersigned by the\nPresident of the said Board of Commissioners, to remove or\ndismiss any person holding any office, employment or\ncommission, civil or military, under the said Company in\nIndia, and to vacate any Appointment or Commission of any\nperson to any such office or employment.\" Section 75\nprovided that nothing contained in that Act would take away\nthe power of the Court of Directors to remove or dismiss any\nof the officers or servants of the Company \"but that the\nsaid Court shall and may at all Times have full Liberty to\nremove or dismiss any of such officers or servants at their\nwill and pleasure.\"\n\n By the end of the nineteenth century a well-organized\ncivil service had developed in India, the control over it\nbeing vested in the executive, and the members of the \"civil\nservice of the Crown in India\" were governed in the matter\nof their appointments as also the regular of the conditions\nof their service, such as, classification methods of\nrecruitment, pay and allowances, and discipline and conduct,\nby rules made by the executive.\n\n The Government of India Act, 1858 (21 & 22 Vict.,\nc.106), which vested in the British Crown the territories\nunder the government of East India\" Company, repeated\ncertain sections of the Government of India Act, 1853 (16 &\n17 Vict., c.95), in so far as they applied to or provided\nfor the admission or appointment of persons to the Civil\nService of the East India Company and conferred upon the\nSecretary of State in Council the power to make regulations\nfor the admission of candidates to the Civil Service of\nIndia as also with respect to other matters connected\ntherewith. Three years later the Indian Civil Service so\nenvisaged received statutory recognition by the enactment of\nthe Indian Civil Service Act, 1861 (24 & 25 Vict., c.54).\n\n170\n\n The above Acts were repealed by the \nGovernment of India\nAct\n of 1915 (5 & 6 Geo. V, c.61). Part VIII of the 1915 Act\nconferred upon the Secretary of State in Council, with the\naid and advice of the Civil Service Commissioners, the power\nto make rules for the Indian Civil Service examination.\n\n None of the above nor the Government of India\n(Amendment) Act, 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. V. c.37) made any\nreference to the tenure of members of the civil service in\nIndia. This was for the first time done by the Government of\nIndia Act, 1919 (9 & 10 Geo. v, c.101), which introduced\nseveral amendments in the 1915 Act including the insertion\nof Part VIIA consisting of section 96 B to 96 E.\n Section 96 B provided as follows:-\n\n 96 B. The civil services in India.-\n\n (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of\n rules made thereunder, every person in the civil\n service of the Crown in India holds office during\n His Majesty's pleasure, and may be employed in any\n manner required by a proper authority within the\n scope of his duty but no person in that service\n may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to\n that by which he was appointed, and the Secretary\n of State in Council may (except so far as he may\n provide by rules to the contrary) reinstate any\n person in that service who has been dismissed.\n\n If any such person appointed by the Secretary of\n State in Council thinks himself wronged by an\n order of an official superior in a governor's\n province, and on due application made to that\n superior does not receive the redress to which he\n may consider himself entitled, he may, without\n prejudice to any other right of redress, complain\n to the governor of the province in order to obtain\n justice, and the governor is hereby directed to\n examine such complaint and require such action to\n be taken thereon as may appear to him to be just\n and equitable.\n\n (2) The Secretary of State, in Council may make\n rules for regulating the classification of the\n civil services in India, the methods of their\n recruitment,\n\n171\n\n their conditions of services, pay and allowances,\n and discipline and conduct. Such rules may, to\n such extent and in respect of such matters as may\n be prescribed, delegate the power of making rules\n to the Governor-General in Council or to local\n governments, or authorise the Indian legislature\n or local legislatures to make laws regulating the\n public services:\n\n Provided that every person appointed before the\n commencement of the Government of India act, 1919,\n by the Secretary of State in Council to the civil\n service of the Crown in India shall retain all his\n existing or accruing rights, or shall receive such\n compensation, for the loss of any of them as the\n Secretary of State in Council may consider just\n and equitable.\n\n (3) The right to pensions and the scale and\n conditions of pensions of all persons in the civil\n service of the Crown in India appointed by the\n Secretary of State in Council shall be regulated\n in accordance with the rules in force at the time\n of the passing of the Government of India Act,\n 1919. Any such rules may be varied or added to by\n the Secretary of State in Council and shall have\n effect as so varied or added to, but any such\n variation or addition shall not adversely affect\n the pension of any member of the service appointed\n before the date thereof.\n\n Nothing in this section or in any rule thereunder\n shall prejudice the rights to which any person\n may, or may have, become entitled under the\n provisions in relation to pensions contained in\n the East India Annuity Funds Act, 1874.\n\n (4) For the removal of doubts it is hereby\n declared that all rules or other provisions in\n operation at the time of the passing of the\n Government of India Act, 1919, whether made by the\n Secretary of State in Council or by any other\n authority, relating to the civil service of the\n Crown in India, were duly made in accordance with\n the powers in that behalf, and are confirmed, but\n any such rules or provisions may be revoked,\n varied or added to by rules or laws made under\n this section.\"\n\n172\n\nThe Fundamental Rules, the Civil Service (Classification,\nControl and Appeal) Rules of 1930 and the Civil Service\n(Governors Provinces Classification) Rules are instances of\nrules made under authority conferred by section 96B. Section\n96C provided for the establishment of a Public Service\nCommission. Sub-section (1) of section 96D provided for an\nAuditor-General to be appointed by the Secretary of State in\nCouncil who was to hold office during \"His Majesty's\npleasure\", and conferred upon the Secretary of State in\nCouncil the power to make rules providing for the Auditor-\nGeneral's pay, powers, duties and conditions of employment.\nSub-section (2) of section 96D provided that, subject to any\nrules made by the Secretary of State in Council, no officer\ncould be added to or withdrawn from the public service and\nthe emoluments of no post could be varied except after\nconsultation with such finance authority as might be\ndesignated in the rules being an authority of the Province\nor of the Government of India, according as the post was or\nwas not under the control of a local Government. Under\nsection 96E rules under Part VIIA could not be made except\nwith the concurrence of the majority of votes at a meeting\nof the Council of India.\n\n Thus, after the 1919 Act, the civil services of India\ncontinued to be under the control of the Secretary of State\nin Council who was to regulate by rules the classification\nof the civil services, the methods of recruitment, the\nconditions of services, pay and allowances, and discipline\nand conduct. Such rules could also provide for delegation of\nthe rule-making power to the Governor-General in Council or\nthe local Governments or authorize the Indian Legislature or\nLocal Legislatures to make laws regulating the public\nservices but only to the extent and in respect of matters as\nwere prescribed by the rules. Thus, even the power of making\nrules as also the authority to the Indian Legislature and\nthe Local Legislatures to enact Acts regulating the public\nservices was derived by delegation of power made by the\nSecretary of State in Council.\n\n What is really material for the purposes of the present\nAppeals and Writ Petitions is that section 96B of the\nGovernment of India Act, 1919, for the first time expressly\nstated that every person in the civil service of the Crown\nin India held office \"during His Majesty's pleasure.\" This\nwas, however, made subject to three safeguards, namely-\n (1) a civil servant could not be dismissed by any\n authority subordinate to that by which he was\n appointed;\n\n173\n\n (2) the Secretary of State in Council had the\n power, unless he provided to the contrary in the\n rules, to reinstate any person in service who had\n been dismissed; and\n (3) if a civil servant appointed by the Secretary\n of State in Council thought himself wronged by an\n order of an official superior in a Governor's\n Province and on due application made to that\n superior did not receive the redress to which he\n considered himself entitled, he could, without\n prejudice to any other right of redress, complain\n to the Governor of the Province in order to obtain\n justice and the Governor had to examine such\n complaint and require such action to be taken\n thereon as might appear to him to be just and\n equitable.\n\n The position which prevailed with respect to the civil\nservices in India during the intervening period between the\nGovernment of India Act, 1919, and the \nGovernment of India\nAct, 1935\n (25 & 26 Geo. V, c.42) was that the top echelons\nof the important services, especially those working under\nthe provincial Governments, consisted of what were known as\nthe \"all India services,\" which governed a wide variety of\ndepartments. There were, in the first place, the Indian\nCivil Service and the Indian Police Service, which provided\nthe framework of the administrative machinery. In addition,\nthere were the Indian Forest Service, the Indian Educational\nService, the Indian Agricultural Service, the Indian Service\nof Engineers (consisting of an Irrigation Branch and a Roads\nand Buildings Branch), the Indian Veterinary Service, the\nIndian Forest Engineering Service and the Indian Medical\nService (Civil). The initial appointments and conditions of\nservice for all these services were made by the Secretary of\nState and each officer executed a covenant with the\nSecretary of State containing the terms under which he was\nto serve. In addition to the all-India services there were\nthe central services under the Government of India and the\nProvincial services in the Provinces; and lastly the\nsubordinate services. (See Indian Statutory (Simon)\nCommission Report(1930), Vol.I, para 290 ff.). During the\nyears following the 1919 Act it was decided that, as a\nconsequence of the decision to effect progressive transfer\nof power to Governments in India, the number of all-India\nservices under the direct control of the Secretary of State\nshould be progressively reduced especially in those fields\nof administration that were transferred to ministerial\ncontrol. It was now to\n\n174\n\nbe left to the Provincial Governments to reorganize in\ngradual stages the higher cadres of their services in the\ntransferred subjects, and recruitment and control of the\nSecretary of State in Council were accordingly discontinued.\nThis policy resulted by the early thirties in the Indian\nCivil Service, the Indian Police Service, the Ecclesiastical\nService and the civil branch of the Indian Medical Service\nbeing retained by the Secretary of State and the rest being\nconverted into Provincial services, safeguards being\nprovided to secure the rights and privileges guaranteed to\nofficers recruited earlier to the all-India services. (See\nReport of the Joint Select Committee on Indian\nConstitutional Reform, (1934), para 277.)\n The above position received legislative recognition and\nsanction under the \nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n (25 & 26\nGeo. v, c.42), often cited with the year and chapter of the\nAct in pursuance of which it was reprinted, namely, the\nGovernment of India (Reprinting) Act, 1935 (26 Geo. V & 1\nEdw, VIII, c.1). Part X of the 1935 Act dealt with the\nservices of the Crown in India. Chapter II of Part X made\nprovisions with respect of the civil services. \nSection 240\n\nprovided for the tenure of office of persons employed in\ncivil capacities in India and conferred upon them certain\nstatutory safeguards as regards dismissal or reduction in\nrank. \nSection 241\n dealt with their recruitment and\nconditions of service. Under that section power to make\nappointments was vested in respect of central services in\nthe Governor-General and in respect of the Provincial\nservices in the respective Governors. In the same manner the\npower to regulate conditions of service of the members of\nthese services was conferred upon the Governor- General or\nthe Governor, as the case may be. The Governor-General as\nalso the Governor could authorize such person as he might\ndirect to make appointments and rules with respect to the\nconditions of service. Provision was also made for enactment\nof Acts by appropriate Legislatures to regulate the\nconditions of service of persons in the civil services. It\nis unnecessary to look into the details of these provisions\nas the federal structure envisaged by the 1935 Act never\ncame into existence as it was optional for the Indian States\nto join the proposed Federation and they did not give their\nconsent thereto. Chapter III of Part X provided for the\nsetting up of a Federal Public Service Commission and a\nPublic Service Commission for each province. A provision was\nalso made for two or more Provinces to agree to have a joint\nPublic Service Commission or for the Public Service\nCommission of one of these Provinces to serve the needs of\nthe other provinces.\n\n175\n\n In the context of the present Appeals and Writ\nPetitions, it is \nsection 240\n of the 1935 Act which is\nrelevant. \nSection 240\n provided as follows:\n\n \"240. Tenure of office of persons employed in\n civil capacities in India.-\n\n (1) Except as expressly provided by this Act,\n every persons who is a member of a civil service\n of the Crown in India, or holds any civil post\n under the Crown in India holds office during His\n Majesty's pleasure.\n\n (2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed\n from the service of His Majesty by any authority\n subordinate to that by which he was appointed.\n (3) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed\n or reduced in rank until he has been given a\n reasonable opportunity of showing cause against\n the action proposed to be taken in regard to him:\n Provided that this sub-section shall not be apply-\n\n (a) where a person is dismissed or reduced in rank\n on the ground of conduct which has led to his\n conviction on a criminal charge; or\n\n (b) where an authority empowered to dismiss a\n person or reduce him in rank is satisfied that for\n some reason, to be recorded by that authority in\n writing, it is not reasonably practicable to give\n to that person an opportunity of showing cause.\n (4) Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil\n post under the Crown in India holds office during\n His Majesty's pleasure, any contract under which a\n person, not being a member of a civil service of\n the Crown in India is appointed under this Act to\n hold such a post may, if the Governor-General, or,\n as the case may be, the Governor, deems it\n necessary in order to secure the service of a\n person having special qualifications, provide for\n the payment to him of compensation, if before the\n expiration of an agreed\n\n176\n\n period that post is abolished or he is, for\n reasons not connected with any misconduct on his\n part, required to vacate that post.\"\n\n While under the 1935 Act, as under the 1919 Act, every\nperson who was a member of the civil service of the Crown in\nIndia or held any civil post under the Crown in India held\noffice \"during His Majesty's pleasure\", greater safeguards\nwere provided for him under the 1935 Act than under the 1919\nAct. Those safeguards were:\n\n (1) under sub-section (2) of \nsection 240\n, such a\n person could not be dismissed from service by any\n authority subordinate to that by which he was\n appointed, and\n (2) under sub-section (3) of \nsection 240\n, such a\n person could not be dismissed or reduced in rank\n until he had been given a reasonable opportunity\n of showing cause against the action proposed to be\n taken in regard to him.\n\nThe safeguard as regards a reasonable opportunity of showing\ncause provided for in \nsection 240(3)\n did not exist in the\n1919 Act. The proviso to sub-section (3) of \nsection 240\n,\nhowever, took away this safeguard in the two cases set out\nin clauses (a) and (b) of the said proviso. These two cases\nwere:\n\n (a) where a civil servant was dismissed or reduced\n in rank on ground of conduct which had led to his\n conviction on a criminal charge, and\n\n (b) where an authority empowered to dismiss him or\n reduce him in rank was satisfied that for some\n reason, to be recorded by that authority in\n writing, it was not reasonably practicable to give\n to that person an opportunity of showing cause.\n\n The Civil Services under the Constitution\n Provisions with respect to services under the Union and\nthe states are made in Part XIV of the Constitution of\nIndia. This Part consists of two Chapters, Chapter I delaing\nwith services and Chapter II dealing with Public Service\nCommission for the Union and the State. \nArticle 308\n, as\noriginally enacted, defined\n\n177\n\nthe expression \"State\" occurring in Part XIV as meaning,\nunless the context otherwise required, \"a State specified in\nPart A or B of the First Schedule.\" This Article was amended\nby the \nConstitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956\n, which was\npassed in order to implement the scheme for reorganization\nof States. The amended \nArticle 308\n provides, \"In this Part,\nunless the context otherwise requires, the expression\n'State' does not include the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\"\n\nArticle 309\n provides for recruitment and conditions of\nservice of persons serving the Union or a State, \nArticle 310\n\nfor the tenure of office of such persons, and \nArticle 311\n\nfor the mode of dismissal removal or reduction in rank of\npersons employed in civil capacities under the Union or a\nState. \nArticle 312\n deals with all-India services and inter\nalia provides that where the Council of State has declared\nby resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the\nmembers present and voting that it is necessary or expedient\nin the national interest so to do, Parliament might by law\nprovide for the creation of one or more all-India services\ncommon to the Union and the States and subject to the other\nprovisions of Chapter I regulate the recruitment and\nconditions of service of persons appointed to any such\nservice; and it further provides that the Indian\nAdministrative Service and the Indian Police Service shall\nbe deemed to be services created by Parliament under Article\n\n312. \nArticle 313\n provides for the continuance in force, so\nfar as consistent with the provisions of the Constitution,\nof all the laws in force immediately before the commencement\nof the Constitution and applicable to any public service or\nany post which continued to exist after the commencement of\nthe Constitution as an all-India service or as service or\npost under the Union or a State until other provision was\nmade in this behalf under the Constitution. Under clause\n(10) of \nArticle 366\n the expression \"existing law\" means \"any\nlaw, Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule or regulation passed or\nmade before the commencement of this Constitution by any\nLegislature, authority or person having power to make such a\nlaw, Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule or regulation. Thus,\nall Acts, rules and regulations applicable to different\nservices immediately before the commencement of the\nConstitution continue to apply to such services in so far as\nthey were consistent with the provisions of the Constitution\nuntil amended, varied, revoked or replaced by Acts, rules or\nregulations made in accordance with the provisions of the\nConstitution.\n\n From what has been stated above it will be seen that\nthe provisions with respect to civil services in the\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n, were taken as the basis for\nChapter I of Part XIV of the Constitution.\n\n178\n\n Articles 309,310 and 311\n It is necessary for the purpose of these Appeals and\nWrit Petitions to set out in extenso the provisions of\n\nArticles 309\n, 310\n and \n311.\n\n \nArticles 309\n and \n310\n were amended by the \nConstitution\n(Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956\n, to omit from these Articles\nthe reference to the Rajpramukh. \nArticles 309\n and \n310\n, as so\namended, read as follows:\n\n \"309. Recruitment and conditions of service of\n persons serving the Union or a State.-\n Subject to the provisions of this Constitution,\n Acts of the appropriate Legislature may regulate\n the recruitment, and conditions of service of\n persons appointed, to public services and posts in\n connection with the affairs of the Union or of any\n State:\n\n Provided that it shall be competent for the\n President or such person as he may direct in the\n case of services and posts in connection with the\n affairs of the Union, and for the Governor of a\n State or such person as he may direct in the case\n of services and posts in connection with the\n affairs of the State to make rules regulating the\n recruitment, and the conditions of service of\n persons appointed, to such services and posts\n until provision in that behalf is made by or under\n an Act of the appropriate Legislature under this\n article, and any rules so made shall have effect\n subject to the provisions of any such Act.\n \"310. Tenure of office of persons serving the\n Union or a State.-\n\n (1) Except as expressly provided by this\n Constitution, every person who is a member of a\n defence service or of a civil service of the Union\n or of an all-India service or holds any post\n connected with defence or any civil post under the\n Union holds office during the pleasure of the\n President, and every person who is a member of a\n civil service of a State or holds any civil post\n under a state holds office during the pleasure of\n the Governor of the State.\n\n179\n\n (2) Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil\n post under the Union or a State holds office\n during the pleasure of the President or, as the\n case may be, of the Governor of the State any\n contract under which a person, not being a member\n of a defence service or of an all-India service or\n of a civil service of the Union or a State, is\n appointed under this Constitution to hold such a\n post may, if the President or the Governor, as the\n case may be, deems it necessary in order to secure\n the services of a person having special\n qualifications, provide for the payment to him of\n compensation, if before the expiration of an\n agreed period that post is abolished or he is, for\n reasons not connected with any misconduct on his\n part, required to vacate that post.\"\n\n \nArticle 311\n as originally enacted was in the\n following terms:\n\n \"311. Dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of\n persons employed in civil capacities under the\n Union or a State.-\n\n (1) No person who is a member of a civil service\n of the Union or an all-India service or a civil\n service of a State or holds a civil post under the\n Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by\n an authority subordinate to that by which he was\n appointed.\n\n (2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed\n or removed or reduced in rank until he has been\n given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause\n against the action proposed to be taken in regard\n to him:\n\n Provided that this clause shall not apply-\n\n (a) where a person is dismissed or removed or\n reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has\n led to his conviction on a criminal charge;\n\n (b) where an authority empowered to dismiss or\n remove a person or to reduce him in rank is\n satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by\n that authority in writing it is not reasonably\n practicable to give to that person an opportunity\n of showing cause; or\n\n180\n\n (c) where the President or Governor or Rajpramukh,\n as the case may be, is satisfied that in the\n interest of the security of the State it is not\n expedient to give to that person such an\n opportunity.\n\n (3) If any question arises whether it is\n reasonably practicable to give to any person an\n opportunity of showing cause under clause (2), the\n decision thereon of the authority empowered to\n dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in\n rank, as the case may be, shall be final.\"\n\nThe words \"or Rajpramukh\" in clause (c) of the proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n were omitted by the \nConstitution (Seventh\nAmendment) Act, 1956\n.\n\n \nBy the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963\n.\nClauses (2) and (3) of \nArticle 311\n were substituted by the\nfollowing clauses:\n\n \"(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be\n dismissed or removed or reduced in rank except\n after an inquiry in which he has been informed of\n the charges against him and given a reasonable\n opportunity of being heard in respect of those\n charges and where it is proposed, after such\n inquiry, to impose on him any such penalty, until\n he has been given a reasonable opportunity of\n making representation on the penalty proposed, but\n only on the basis of the evidence adduced during\n such inquiry:\n\n Provided that this clause shall not apply-\n\n (a) where a person is dismissed or removed or\n reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has\n led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or\n\n (b) where the authority empowered to dismiss or\n remove a person or to reduce him in rank is\n satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by\n that authority in writing, it is not reasonably\n practicable to hold such inquiry; or\n\n (c) where the President or the Governor, as the\n case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of\n the\n\n181\n\n security of the State it is not expedient to hold\n such inquiry.\n\n (3) If, in respect of any such person as\n aforesaid, a question arises whether it is\n reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry as is\n referred to in clause (2), the decision thereon of\n the authority empowered to dismiss or remove such\n person or to reduce him in rank shall be final.\"\n\n \nThe Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n,\nmade certain amendments in the substituted clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n with effect from January 3, 1977. \nArticle 311\n as\nso amended reads as follows :\n\n \"311. Dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of\n persons employed in civil capacities under the\n Union or a state. -\n\n (1) No persons who is a member of a civil service\n of the Union or an all-India service or a civil\n service of a State or holds a civil post under the\n Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by\n an authority subordinate to that by which he was\n appointed.\n\n (2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed\n or removed or reduced in rank except after an\n inquiry in which he has been informed of the\n charges against him and given a reasonable\n opportunity of being heard in respect of those\n charges :\n\n Provided that where it is proposed after such\n inquiry, to impose upon him any such penalty, such\n penalty may be imposed on the basis of the\n evidence adduced during such inquiry and it shall\n not be necessary to give such person any\n opportunity of making representation on the\n penalty proposed :\n\n Provided further that this clause shall not apply\n\n -\n\n (a) where a person is dismissed or removed or\n reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has\n led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or\n\n182\n\n (b) where the authority empowered to dismiss or\n remove a person or to reduce him in rank is\n satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by\n that authority in writing, it is not reasonably\n practicable to hold such inquiry; or\n\n (c) where the President or the Governor, as the\n case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of\n the security of the State it is not expedient to\n hold such inquiry.\n\n (3) If, in respect of any such person as\n aforesaid, a question arises whether it is\n reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry as is\n referred to in clause (2), the decision thereon of\n the authority empowered to dismiss or remove such\n person or to reduce him in rank shall be final.\"\n\nFrom the original and amended \nArticle 311\n set out above it\nwill be noticed that of the original \nArticle 311\n only clause\n(1) remains unaltered, while both the other clauses have\nbecome the subject of Constitutional amendments. No\nsubmission was founded by either party on the substitution\nof the present clause (3) for the original by the\n\nConstitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963\n, for the\nobvious reason that such substitution was made only in order\nto bring clause (3) in conformity with clause (2) as\nsubstituted by the said Amendment Act.\n\n A comparison of \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution with\n\nsection 240\n of the Government of India Act, 1935, shows that\nthe safeguards provided to civil servants by \nArticle 311\n are\nvery much the same as those under \nsection 240\n with this\ndifference that while \nArticle 311\n also affords safeguards\nagainst removal from service \nsection 240\n did not. Further,\nthough the proviso to \nsection 240(3)\n is reproduced in what\noriginally was the only proviso and is now the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311 (2)\n, an additional clause, namely,\nclause (c) has been added thereto. A provision similar to\nclause (3) of \nArticle 311\n was also absent from the\n\nGovernment of India Act, 1935\n. Thus, while on the one hand\n\nArticle 311\n enlarges the protection afforded to civil\nservants, on the other hand it increases by one the number\nof cases in which that protection can be withdrawn.\n\n With the above historical background and bearing in\nmind the relevant provisions of the Constitution, it will be\nnow convenient to turn to the submissions made at the Bar\nwith respect to\n\n183\n\nthe pleasure doctrine and the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n and test the correctness of these submissions.\n\n The Second Proviso - Rival Submissions\n The arguments advanced on behalf of the government\nservants on the pleasure doctrine and the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311 (2)\n may be sketched in broad outlined as under :\n\n (1) The pleasure doctrine in England is a part of\n the special prerogative of the Crown and has been\n inherited by India from England and should,\n therefore, be construed strictly, that is,\n strictly against the Government and liberally in\n favour of government servants.\n\n (2) The second proviso which withdraws from\n government servants the safeguards provided by\n clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n must be also similarly\n construed for, unless a liberal construction were\n placed upon it, great hardship would result to\n government servants as they could be arbitrarily\n thrown out of employment and they and their\n dependents would be left without any means of\n subsistence.\n\n (3) There are several stages before a government\n servant can be dismissed or removed or reduced in\n rank, namely, serving upon him of a show cause\n notice or a charge-sheet, giving him inspection of\n documents, examination of witnesses, arguments and\n imposition of penalty. An inquiry starts only\n after a show cause notice is issued and served\n upon a government servant. A show cause notice is\n thus preparatory to the holding of an inquiry and\n even if the entire inquiry is dispensed with, the\n giving of a show cause notice and asking for the\n explanation of the government servant with respect\n there to are not excluded.\n\n (4) It is not obligatory upon the disciplinary\n authority to dispense with the whole of the\n inquiry. Depending upon the circumstances of the\n case, the disciplinary authority can dispense with\n only a part of the inquiry.\n\n184\n\n (5) Imposition of penalty is not a part of the\n inquiry and once an inquiry is dispensed with,\n whether in whole or in part, it is obligatory upon\n the disciplinary authority to give an opportunity\n to the government servant to make a representation\n with respect to the penalty proposed to be imposed\n upon him.\n\n (6) \nArticle 311\n is subject to \nArticle 14.\n\n Principles of natural justice and the audi alteram\n partem rule are part of \nArticle 14\n and, therefore,\n a show cause notice asking for the explanation of\n the government servant with respect to the charges\n against him as also a notice to show cause with\n respect to the proposed penalty are required to be\n given by \nArticle 14\n and the not giving of such\n notices or either of them renders the order of\n dismissal, removal or reduction in rank invalid.\n The submissions on behalf of the Union of India can be\nthus summarized :\n\n (1) The second proviso must be construed according\n to its terms. It is unambiguous and does not admit\n of any such interpretation as canvassed for on\n behalf of the government servants.\n\n (2) Where under the second proviso, clause (2) of\n \nArticle 311\n is made inapplicable, there is no\n scope for holding any partial inquiry.\n (3) In any event, the very contents of the three\n clauses of the second proviso show that it is not\n necessary or not practicable or not expedient that\n any partial inquiry could be or should be held,\n depending upon which clause applies.\n (4) \nArticle 14\n does not govern or control Article\n\n 311. The Constitution must be read as a whole.\n\n \nArticle 311(2)\n embodies the principles of natural\n justice including the audi alteram partem rule. It\n thus expressly states what is required under\n \nArticle 14\n as a result of the interpretation\n placed upon it by recent decisions of this Court.\n Once the application of clause(2) is expressly\n excluded by the Constitution\n\n185\n\n itself, there can be no question of making\n applicable what has been so excluded by seeking\n recourse to \nArticle 14.\n\n (5) Consideration of sympathy for the government\n servants who may be dismissed or removed or\n reduced in rank are irrelevant to the construction\n of the second proviso. The doctrine of tenure at\n pleasure in \nArticle 310\n and the safeguards given\n to a government servant under clauses (1) and (2)\n of \nArticle 311\n as also the withdrawal of the\n safeguard under clause (2) by the second proviso\n are all enacted in public interest and where\n public interest conflicts with private interest,\n the latter must yield to the former.\n\n The Pleasure Doctrine\n The concept of civil service is not now or of recent\norigin. Governments - whether monarchial, dictatorial or\nrepublican - have to function; and for carrying on the\nadministration and the varied functions of the government a\nlarge number of persons are required and have always been\nrequired, whether they are constituted in the form of a\ncivil service or not. Every kingdom and country of the world\nthroughout history had a group of persons who helped the\nruler to administer the land, whether according to modern\nnotions we may call that group a civil service or not,\nbecause it is not possible for one man by himself to rule\nand govern the land and look after and supervise all the\ndetails of administration. As it was throughout history, so\nit has been in England and in India.\n\n In England, all public officers and servants of the\nCrown hold their appointments at the pleasure of the Crown\nand their services can be terminated at will without\nassigning any cause. By the expression \"the pleasure\ndoctrine\" is conveyed this right of the Crown. This right\nis, however, subject to what may be provided otherwise by\nlegislation passed by Parliament because in the United\nKingdom, Parliament has legislative sovereignty.\n\n The Foundations of modern European civil services were\nlaid in Prussia in the late seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies and by Napoleon's development of highly organized\nhierarchy (a model copied by many countries in the\nnineteenth century); and they are the basis of modern\nEuropean civil services. In England civil servants were\noriginally the monarch's personal servants and\n\n186\n\nmembers of the King's household. Clive's creation from 1765\nof a civil service to govern such parts of India as were\nunder the dominion of the East India Company and Macaulay's\nreport on recruitment to the Indian Civil Service provided\nthe inspiration for the report of 1854 on the organization\nof the permanent civil service in Britain which recommended\nrecruitment by open competitive examination, the selection\nof higher civil servants on the basis of general\nintellectual attainment, and the establishment of a Civil\nService Commission to ensure proper recruitment.\n\n In the United Kingdom, until about the middle of\nNovember 1981, the Civil Service Department, which was set\nup in 1968 with the Prime Minister, as Minister for the\nCivil Service, as its Head, looked after the management and\npersonnel functions in connection with the Civil Service\nwhich were until then being looked after by the Treasury.\nThese functions included the organization and conduct of the\nCivil Service and the remuneration, conditions of service,\nexpenses and allowances of persons serving in it; mode of\nrecruitment of persons to the Civil Service; the pay and\nallowances of, and the charges payable by, members of the\narmed forces; with certain exceptions, superannuation and\ninjury payments, compensation for loss of employment or loss\nor diminution of emoluments or pension rights applicable to\ncivil servants and others in the public sector and to\nmembers of the armed forces; the exercise by other persons\nand bodies of powers to determine, subject to the minister's\nsanction, the pay or conditions of service of members of\npublic bodies (excluding judicial bodies), or the numbers,\npay or conditions of service of staff employed by such\nbodies or by the holders of certain non-judicial offices;\nand the appointment or employment and the remuneration,\nconditions of service, personal expenses or allowances of\njudges and judicial staff (See Halsbury's Laws of England,\nFourth Edition, Volume 8, para 1162).\n\n The Permanent Secretary to the Civil Service Department\nwas the Head of the Home Civil Service and gave advice to\nthe Prime Minister as to civil service appointments,\ndecorations, etc. The Civil Service Departments was\nabolished on November 12, 1981, and its functions, instead\nof reverting to the Treasury, were divided between the\nTreasury and the newly created Management and Personnel\nOffice.\n\n In India, the pleasure doctrine has received\nconstitutional sanction by being enacted in \nArticle 310(1).\n\nUnlike in the United Kingdom in India it is not subject to\nany law made by Parliament\n\n187\n\nbut is subject only to what is expressly provided by the\nConstitution.\n\n The pleasure doctrine relates to the tenure of a\ngovernment servant. \"Tenure\" means \"manner, conditions or\nterm of holding something\" according to Webster's Third New\nInternational Dictionary, and \"terms of holding; title;\nauthority\" according to the Oxford English Dictionary. It,\ntherefore, means the period for which an incumbent of office\nholds it. It is for this reason that the statement of law\nrelating to the pleasure doctrine in England is given in\nHalsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, Volume 8, Para\n1106, under the heading \"Tenure of office\".\n\n The first time that a statute relating to the\ngovernment of India provided that civil servants hold office\nduring His Majesty's pleasure was the \nGovernment of India\nAct\n of 1919 in section 96B of that Act. The marginal note to\nsection 96B did not, however, refer to the tenure of civil\nservants but stated \"The Civil Services of India\". This was\nbecause section 96B in addition to dealing with the tenure\nof civil servants also dealt with matters relating to their\nrecruitment, conditions of service, pay, allowances,\npensions, etc. The marginal note to \nsection 240\n of the\nGovernment of India Act, 1935, however, was \"Tenure of\noffice of persons employed in civil capacities in India\".\nThe marginal note to \nArticle 310\n of the Constitution also\nrefers to \"tenure\" and states \"Tenure of office or persons\nserving the Union or a State\". Thus, it is the tenure of\ngovernment servants which \nArticle 310(1)\n makes subject to\nthe pleasure of the President or the Governor of a State,\nexcept as expressly provided by the Constitution.\n\n While it was vehemently contended on behalf of the\ngovernment servants that the pleasure doctrine is a relic of\nthe feudal age - a part of the special prerogative of the\nCrown - which was imposed upon India by an Imperial power\nand thus is an anachronism in this democratic, socialist age\nand must, therefore, be confined within the narrowest\nlimits, it was submitted on behalf of the Union of India\nthat this doctrine was a matter of public policy, and it was\nin public interest and for public good that the right to\ndismiss at pleasure a government servant who has made\nhimself unfit to continue in office, albeit subject to\ncertain safeguards, should exist and be exercisable in the\nConstitutional sense by the Crown in England and by the\nPresident or the Governor of a State in India. It is not\npossible to accept the arguments advanced on behalf of the\ngovernment servants for\n\n188\n\nall the authoritative judicial dicta are to the contrary. As\npointed out by Lord Hobhouse in Shenton v. Smith, L.R.[1895]\nA.C. 229 J.C., the pleasure doctrine is founded upon the\nprinciple that the difficulty which would otherwise be\nexperienced in dismissing those whose continuance in office\nis detrimental to the State would be such as seriously to\nimpede the working of the public service. In Dunn v. The\nQueen, L.R. [1896] Q.B.D. 116; s.c. [1895-96] 73 L.T.R. 695\nand sub nomine Dunn v. Regem in [1895-99] All E.R. Rep. 907,\nthe Court of Appeal in England held that it was an implied\nterm of every contract of service that servants of the\nCrown, civil as well as military, except in special case\nwhere it is otherwise provided by law, hold their offices\nonly during the pleasure of the Crown. In that case Lord\nHerschell observed (pages 119-120) :\n\n It seems to me that it is the public interest\n which has led to the term which I have mentioned\n being imported into contracts for employment in\n the service of the Crown. The cases cited shew\n that, such employment being for the good of the\n public, it is essential for the public good that\n it should be capable of being determined at the\n pleasure of the Crown, except in certain\n exceptional cases where it has been deemed to be\n more for the public good that some restrictions\n should be imposed on the power of the Crown to\n dismiss its servants.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n In the same case Kay, L.J., said (page 120)\n \"It seems to me that the continued employment of a\n civil servant might in many cases be `as\n detrimental to the interests of the State as the\n continued employment of a military officer.\"\n In this case as reported in the Law Times Reports\nseries the judgments of the three learned judges who decided\nthe case (Lord Esher, M.R., being the third judge), though\nin substance the same, are given in very different language\nand the passages extracted above do not appear in that\nreport. The report of the case in the All England Law\nReports Reprint series is with very minor variations the\nsame as the report in the Times Law Reports series but\nsomewhat abridged. This is because the All England Law\nReports Reprint series is a revised and annotated reprint of\na selection from the Law Times Reports for the years 1843 to\n\n189\n\n1935. The report from which the above extracts are given is\nthe one in the Law Reports series published by the\nIncorporated Council of Law Reporting which was established\nin 1865 and which report is, therefore, more authoritative.\nIn Gould v. Stuart, L.R. [1896] A.C. 575,578-9 J.C., the\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council further held that\nwhere by regulations a civil service is established\nprescribing qualifications for its members and imposing some\nrestriction on the power to dismiss them, such regulations\nshould be deemed to be made for the public good. \nThe\nposition that the pleasure doctrine is not based upon any\nspecial prerogative of the Crown but upon public policy has\nbeen accepted by this Court in \nThe States of Uttar Pradesh &\nOrs. v. Babu Ram Upadhya\n, [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679, 696 and Moti\nRam Deka etc. v. General Manager, N.E.F. Railways, Maligaon,\nPandu etc., [1964] 5 S.C.R. 683, 734-5. This Court has also\naccepted the principle that society has an interest in the\ndue discharge of their duties by government servants.\n \nIn\n\nRoshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India\n, [1968] 1 S.C.R. 185,\nRamaswami, J., speaking for the Court said (at page 195) :\n\n \"It is true that the origin of Government service\n is contractual. There is an offer and acceptance\n in every case. But once appointed to his post or\n office the Government servant acquires a status\n and his rights and obligations are no longer\n determined by consent of both parties, but by\n statute or statutory rules which may be framed and\n altered unilaterally by the Government. In other\n words, the legal position of a Government servant\n is more one of status that of contract. The Hall-\n mark of status is the attachment to a legal\n relationship of rights and duties imposed by the\n public law and not by mere agreement of the\n parties. The emolument of the Government servant\n and his terms of service are governed by statute\n or statutory rules which may be unilaterally\n altered by the Government without the consent of\n the employee. It is true that \nArticle 311\n imposes\n constitutional restrictions upon the power of\n removal granted to the President and the Governor\n under \nArticle 310.\n But it is obvious that the\n relationship between the Government and its\n servant is not like an ordinary contract of\n service between a master and servant. The legal\n relationship is something entirely different,\n something in the nature of status. It is much more\n than a\n\n190\n\n purely contractual relationship voluntarily\n entered into between the parties. The duties of\n status are fixed by the law and in the enforcement\n of these duties society has an interest. In the\n language of jurisprudence status is a condition of\n membership of a group of which powers and duties\n are exclusively determined by law and not by\n agreement between the parties concerned.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n Ministers frame policies and legislatures enact laws\nand lay down the mode in which such policies are to be\ncarried out and the object of the legislation achieved. In\nmany cases, in a Welfare State such as ours, such policies\nand statutes are intended to bring about socioeconomic\nreforms and the uplift of the poor and disadvantaged\nclasses. From the nature of things the task of efficiently\nand effectively implementing these policies and enactments,\nhowever, rests with the civil services. The public is,\ntherefore ; vitally interested in the efficiency and\nintegrity of such services. Government servants are after\nall paid from the public exchequer to which everyone\ncontributes either by way of direct or indirect taxes. Those\nwho are paid by the public and are charged with public and\nadministration for public good must, therefore, in their\nturn bring to the discharge of their duties a sense of\nresponsibility. The efficiency of public administration does\nnot depend only upon the top echelons of these services. It\ndepends as much upon all the other members of such services,\neven on those in the most subordinate posts. For instance,\nrailways do not run because of the members of the Railway\nBoard or the General Managers of different railways or the\nheads of different departments of the railway\nadministration. They run also because of engine-drivers,\nfireman, signalmen, booking clerks and those holding hundred\nother similar posts. Similarly, it is not the administrative\nheads who alone can set to the proper functioning of the\npost and telegraphs service. For a service to run\nefficiently there must, therefore, be a collective sense of\nresponsibility. But for a government servant to discharge\nhis duties faithfully and conscientiously, he must have a\nfeeling of security of tenure. Under our Constitution this\nis provided for by the Acts and rules made under \nArticle 309\n\nas also by the safeguards in respect of the punishments of\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank provided in clauses\n(1) and (2) of \nArticle 311.\n It is, however, as much in\npublic interest and for public good that government servants\nwho are inefficient, dishonest or corrupt or have become a\nsecurity risk\n\n191\n\nshould not continue in service and that the protection\nafforded to them by the Acts and rules made under \nArticle\n309\n and by \nArticle 311\n be not abused by them to the\ndetriment of public interest and public good. When a\nsituation as envisaged in one of the three clauses of the\nsecond proviso to clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n arises and the\nrelevant clause is properly applied and the disciplinary\ninquiry dispensed with, the concerned government servant\ncannot be heard to complain that he is deprived of his\nlivelihood. The livelihood of an individual is a matter of\ngreat concern to him and his family but his livelihood is a\nmatter of his private interest and where such livelihood is\nprovided by the public exchequer and the taking away of such\nlivelihood is in the public interest and for public good,\nthe former must yield to the latter. These consequences\nfollow not because the pleasure doctrine is a special\nprerogative of the British Crown which has been inherited by\nIndia and transposed into our Constitution adapted to suit\nthe Constitutional set up of our Republic but because public\npolicy requires, public interest needs and public good\ndemands that there should be such a doctrine.\n\n It is thus clear that the pleasure doctrine embodied in\n\nArticle 310 (1)\n, the protection afforded to civil servants\nby clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n and the withdrawal of\nthe protection under clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n by the second\nproviso thereto are all provided in the Constitution on the\nground of public policy and in the public interest and are\nfor public good.\n\n The Scope of the Pleasure Doctrine.\n\n While under \nsection 96B(1)\n of the Government of India\nAct of 1919 the holding of office in the civil service of\nthe Crown in India during His Majesty's pleasure was\n\"Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules made\nthereunder\", under \nsection 240(1)\n of the Government of India\nAct, 1935, the holding of such office during His Majesty's\npleasure was \"Except as expressly provided by this Act\".\nSimilarly, the pleasure doctrine as enacted in \nArticle\n310(1)\n is not an absolute one and is not untrammeled or free\nof all fetters, but operates \"Except as expressly provided\nby this Constitution.\" The constitutional restrictions on\nthe exercise of pleasure under \nArticle 310(1)\n other than\nthose contained in \nArticle 311\n will be considered later but\nwhat is immediately relevant is the group of Articles\nconsisting of \nArticles 309\n, 310\n and \n311.\n These three\nArticles are interlinked and form an integrated whole. There\nis an organic and thematic\n\n192\n\nunity running through them and it is now necessary to see\nthe interplay of these three Articles.\n\n These Articles occur in Chapter I of Part XIV of the\nConstitution. Part XIV is entitled \"Services under the Union\nand the States\" and Chapter I thereof is entitled\n\"Services\". While \nArticle 309\n deals with the recruitment and\nconditions of service of persons appointed to the public\nservices and posts in connection with the affairs of the\nUnion or a State, \nArticle 310\n deals with the tenure of\noffice or members of the defence services and of civil\nservices of the Union and the States and \nArticle 311\n\nprovides certain safeguards to persons employed in civil\ncapacities under the Union or a State but not to members of\nthe defence services. The first thing which is required to\nbe noticed about \nArticle 309\n is that it itself makes no\nprovision for recruitment or conditions of service of\ngovernment servants but confers power upon the appropriate\nLegislature to make laws and upon the President and the\nGovernor of a State to make rules in respect of these\nmatters. The passing of these Acts and the framing of these\nrules are, however, made \"Subject to the provisions of this\nConstitution.\" This phrase which preceeds and qualifies the\npower conferred by \nArticle 309\n is significantly different\nfrom the qualifying phrase in \nArticle 310(1)\n which is\n\"Except as expressly provided by this Constitution\".\n\n With reference to the words \"conditions of service\"\n\noccurring in \nsection 243\n of the Government of India Act,\n1935, under which the conditions of service of the\nsubordinate ranks of the various police forces in India were\nto be determined by or under Acts relating to those forces,\nthe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held in \nNorth-\nWest Frontier Province v. Suraj Narain Anand, L.R.\n [1947-48]\n75 I.A., 342, 352-3, that this expression included\nprovisions which prescribed the circumstances under which\nthe employer would be entitled to terminate the service of\nan employee, whether such provisions were constitutional or\nstatutory.\n\n \nIn \nState of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. v. Shardul Singh\n,\n[1970] 3 S.C.R. 302, 305-6, this Court held that the\nexpression \"conditions of service\" means all those\nconditions which regulate the holding of a post by a person\nright from the time of his appointment until his retirement\nand even beyond it in matters like pension etc. and would\ninclude the right to dismiss such persons from service.\n\nThus, as pointed out in \nSardari Lal v. Union of India &\nOrs.\n, [1971] 3 S.C.R. 461, 465, a law can be\n\n193\n\nmade by the appropriate Legislature or a rule by the\nappropriate executive under \nArticle 309\n prescribing the\nprocedure and the authority by whom disciplinary action can\nbe taken against a government servant. Thus the functions\nwith respect to the civil service which in England until\n1968 were being performed by the Treasury and thereafter by\nthe Civil Service Department and from mid-November 1981 are\nbeing performed partly by the Treasury and partly by the\nManagement & personnel Office are in India under \nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution to be performed with respect to not only\npersons employed in civil capacities but with respect to all\npersons appointed to public services and posts in connection\nwith the affairs of the Union or any State by authorities\nappointed under or specified in Acts made under \nArticle 309\n\nor rules made under such Acts or made under the proviso to\nthat Article.\n\n \nAs the making of such laws and the framing of such\nrules are subject to the provisions of the Constitution, if\nany such Act or rule, violates any of the provisions of the\nConstitution, it would be void. Thus, as held in \nMoti Ram\nDeka\n's case (supra), if any such Act or rule trespasses upon\nthe rights guaranteed to government servants by \nArticle 311\n,\nit would be void. Similarly, such Acts and rules cannot\nabridge or restrict the pleasure of the President or the\nGovernor of a State exercisable under \nArticle 310(1)\n further\nthan what the Constitution has expressly done. In the same\nway, such Act or rule would be void if it violates any\nFundamental Right guaranteed by Part III of the\nConstitution. Two instances of this may be given by way of\nillustration.\n \nIn \nKameshwar Prasad & Ors. v. The State of\nBihar & Anr.\n, [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 369, Rule 4A of the\nBihar Government Servants' Conduct Rules, 1956, insofar as\nit prohibited any form of demonstration was struck down by\nthis Court as being violative of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of\nclause (1) of \nArticle 19.\n \nIn \nG.K.Ghose and another v.\nE.X.Joseph\n, [1963] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 789, this court struck\ndown Rule 4A of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules,\n1955, on the ground that it violated sub-clause (c) of\nclause (1) of \nArticle 19\n of the Constitution and that\nportion of Rule 4A which prohibited participation in any\ndemonstration as being violative of Sub-Clauses (a) and (b)\nof clause (1) of \nArticle 19.\n Further, the application of\n\narticle 309\n is excluded by certain provisions of the\nConstitution itself which empower authorities other than\nthose specified in \nArticle 309\n to make appointments or to\nmake rules relating to the conditions of service of certain\nclasses of public service, such as, \nArticle 146(1)\n with\nrespect to the officers and servants of the Supreme\n\n194\n\nCourt, \nArticle 148(5)\n with respect to persons serving in the\nIndian Audit and Accounts Department, \nArticle 229\n with\nrespect to the officers and servants of the High Court, and\n\nArticle 324(5)\n with respect of Election Commissioners and\nRegional Commissioners.\n\n \nWhich would be the appropriate Legislature to enact\nlaws or the appropriate authority to frame rules would\ndepend upon the provisions of the Constitution with respect\nto legislative competence and the division of legislative\npowers. Thus, for instance, under Entry 70 in List I of the\nSeventh Schedule to the Constitution, Union Public Services,\nall-India Services and Union Public Service Commission are\nsubjects which fall within the exclusive legislative field\nof Parliament, while under Entry 41 in List II of the\nSeventh Schedule to the Constitution, State Public Services\nand State Public Service Commission fall within the\nexclusive legislative field of the State Legislatures. The\nrules framed by the President or the Governor of a State\nmust also, therefore, conform to these legislative powers.\nIt is, however, not necessary that the Act of an appropriate\nLegislature should specifically deal with a particular\nservice. It is sufficient if it is an Act as contemplated by\n\nArticle 309\n by which provision is made regulating the\nrecruitment and conditions in a service (see \nRam Pal\nChaturvedi v. State of Rajasthan and others\n.), [1970] 2\nS.C.R. 559,564.\n\n It was at one time thought that the right of a\ngovernment servant to recover arrears of salary fell within\nthe ambit of the pleasure doctrine and a servant of the\nCrown, therefore, cannot sue for his salary, it being a\nbounty of the Crown and not a contractual debt. This was so\nstated in the judgment of Lord Blackburn in the Court of\nSession (the supreme civil court of Scotland) in the case of\nMulvenna v. The Admiralty., [1926] S.C. (i.e. Sessions\nCases) 842. \nRelying heavily upon this decision, the Judicial\nCommittee of the Privy Council in High Commissioner for\nIndia and High Commissioner for \nPakistan v. I.M. Lall,, L.R.\n\n[1947-48] 75 I.A. 225, 243-4, though it held that Lall's\ndismissal was contrary to \nsection 240(3)\n of the Government\nof India Act, 1935, negatived his claim for arrears of pay.\n\nIn \nThe State of Bihar v. Abdul Majid\n, [1954] S.C.R. 786, a\nConstitution Bench of this Court pointed out that the\nattention of the Judicial Committee was not drawn to \nsection\n60\n and the other relevant provisions \nof the Code of Civil\nProcedure\n, 1908, and that the rule of English law that a\nCrown servant cannot maintain a suit against the Crown for\nrecovery of arrears of salary did not\n\n195\n\nprevail in India as it had been negatived by the provisions\nof statutory law in India.\n It may be mentioned that in its\nsubsequent decision in Chellaih Kodeeswaran v. Attorney-\nGeneral of Ceylon in appeal from the Supreme Court for\nCeylon, the Judicial Committee held that Lord Blackburn's\nreasoning in Mulvenna's case had not been concurred in by\nthe other two members of the Scottish Court of Session,\nnamely, Lord Sands and Lord Ashmore, and had not been\nsubsequently treated in Scotland as correctly laying down\nthe law and that it was defective and the conclusion reached\nby Lord Blackburn was contrary to authority and was wrong.\nIt further pointed out that there was a current of authority\nfor a hundred years before 1926 (that being the year in\nwhich Mulvenna's case was decided) to the effect that the\narrears of salary of a civil servant of the Crown, as\ndistinguished from a member of the armed services,\nconstituted a debt recoverable by a petition of right.\nAccording to the Privy Council, as the relevant and\nprestigious authorities to the contrary, did not appear to\nhave been cited before the Judicial Committee in Lall's\ncase, this part of the judgment is that case must be\nregarded as given per incuriam.\n\n As seen earlier, in India for the first time a fetter\nwas imposed upon the pleasure of the Crown to terminate the\nservice of any of its servant by section 96B of the\nGovernment of India Act, 1919, but that was only with\nrespect to the authority which could dismiss him. In that\nsection the holding of office \"during His Majesty's\npleasure\" was made subject to both the provisions of that\nAct and the rules made thereunder. \nUnder the Government of\nIndia Act\n 1935, the reference to the rules to be made under\nthe Act was omitted and the tenure of office of a civil\nservant was to be \"during His Majesty's pleasure except as\nexpressly provided\" by that Act. \nArticle 310(1)\n adopts the\nsame phraseology as in \nsection 240\n of the 1935 Act. Under it\nalso the holding of an office is during the pleasure of the\nPresident or the Governor \"Except as expressly provided by\nthis Constitution\". Therefore the only fetter which is\nplaced on the exercise of such pleasure is when it is\nexpressly so provided in the Constitution itself, that is,\nwhen there is an express proviso in that behalf in the\nConstitution. Express provisions in that behalf are to be\nfound in the case of certain Constitutional functionaries in\nrespect of whose tenure special provision is made in the\nConstitution as, for instance, in clauses (4) and (5) of\n\nArticle 124\n with respect to Judges of the Supreme Court,\n\nArticle 218\n with respect to Judges of the High Court,\n\nArticle 148(1)\n with respect to the Comptroller and Auditor-\nGeneral of India, \nArticle 324(1)\n\n196\n\nwith respect to the Chief Election Commissioner, and \nArticle\n324(5)\n with respect to the Election Commissioners and\nRegional Commissioners.\n\n \nClauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n impose restrictions\nupon the exercise by the President or the Governor of a\nState of his pleasure under \nArticle 310(1).\n These are\nexpress provisions with respect to termination of service by\ndismissal or removal as also with respect to reduction in\nrank of a civil servant and thus come within the ambit of\nthe expression \"Except as expressly provided by this\nConstitution\" qualifying \nArticle 310(1).\n \nArticle 311\n is thus\nan exception to \nArticle 310\n and was described in \nParshottam\nLal Dhingra v. Union of India\n, [1958] S.C.R. 820,829, as\noperating as a proviso to \nArticle 310(1)\n though set out in a\nseparate Article. \nArticle 309\n is, however, not such an\nexception. It does not lay down any express provision which\nwould derogate from the amplitude of the exercise of\npleasure under \nArticle 310(1).\n It merely confers upon the\nappropriate Legislature or executive the power to make laws\nand frame rules but this power is made subject to the\nprovisions of the Constitution. Thus, \nArticle 309\n is subject\nto \nArticle 310(1)\n and any provision restricting the exercise\nof the pleasure of the President or Governor in an Act or\nrule made or frame under \nArticle 309\n not being an express\nprovision of the Constitution, cannot fall within the\nexpression \"Except as expressly provided by this\nConstitution\" occurring in \nArticle 310(1)\n and would be in\nconflict with \nArticle 310(1)\n and must be held to be\nunconstitutional. Clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n\nexpressly restrict the manner in which a Government servant\ncan be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank and unless an\nAct made or rule framed under \nArticle 309\n also conforms to\nthese restrictions, it would be void. The restriction placed\nby clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n are two : (1) with\nrespect to the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a\ngovernment servant provided for in clause (1) of \nArticle\n311;\n and \n(2)\n with respect to the procedure dismissal,\nremoval or reduction in rank of a government servant\nprovided for in clause(2). The second priviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n, which is the central point of controversy in these\nAppeals and Writ Petitions, lifts the restriction imposed by\n\nArticle 311(2)\n in the cases specified in the three clauses\nof that proviso.\n\n None of these three Articles (namely, Articles 309,310\nand \n311)\n sets out the grounds for dismissal, removal or\nreduction in rank of a government servant or for imposition\nof any other penalty upon him or states what those other\npenalties are.\n\n197\n\nThese are matters which are left to be dealt with by Acts\nand rules made under \nArticle 309.\n There are two classes of\npenalties in service jurisprudence, namely, minor penalties\nand major penalties. Amongst minor penalties are censure,\nwith holding of promotion and with holding of increments of\npay. Amongst major penalties are dismissal or removal from\nservice, compulsory retirement and reduction in rank. Minor\npenalties do not affect the tenure of a government servant\nbut the penalty of dismissal or removal does because these\ntwo penalties bring to an end the service of a government\nservant. It is also now well established that compulsory\nretirement by way of penalty amounts to removal from\nservice. So this penalty also affects the tenure of a\ngovernment servant. Reduction in rank does not terminate the\nemployment of a government servant, and it would, therefore,\nbe difficult to say that it affects the tenure of a\ngovernment servant. It may however, be argued that it does\nbring to an end the holding of office in a particular rank\nand from that point of view it affects the government\nservant's tenure in the rank from which he is reduced. It is\nunnecessary to decide this point because \nArticle 311(2)\n\nexpressly gives protection as against the penalty of\nreduction in rank also.\n\n Exercise of Pleasure\n A question which arises in this connection is whether\nthe pleasure of the President or the Governor under \nArticle\n310(1)\n is to be exercised by the President or the Governor\npersonally or it can be exercised by a delegate or some\nother authority empowered under the Constitution or by an\nAct or Rules made under \nArticle 309.\n This question came up\nfor consideration before a Constitution Bench of this Court\nin Babu Ram Upadhya's case. The majority of the Court\n(speaking through Subba Rao, J., as he then was) stated (at\npage 701) the conclusions it had reached in the form of\nseven propositions. These propositions are :\n\n (1) In India every person who is a member of a\n public service described in \nArticle 310\n of the\n Constitution holds office during the pleasure of\n the President or the Governor, as the case may be,\n subject to the express provisions therein.\n (2) The power to dismiss a public servant at\n pleasure is outside the scope of \nArticle 154\n and,\n therefore, cannot be delegated by the Governor to\n a subordinate officer, and can be exercised by him\n only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.\n\n198\n\n (3) This tenure is subject to the limitations or\n qualifications mentioned in \nArticle 311\n of the\n Constitution.\n\n (4) The Parliament or the Legislatures of States\n cannot make a law abrogating or modifying this\n tenure so as to impinge upon the overriding power\n conferred upon the President or the Governor under\n \nArticle 310\n, as qualified by \nArticle 311.\n\n (5) The Parliament or the Legislatures of States\n can make a law regulating the conditions of\n service of such a member which includes\n proceedings by way of disciplinary action, without\n affecting the powers of the President or the\n Governor under \nArticle 310\n of the Constitution\n read with \nArticle 310\n of the Constitution read\n with \nArticle 311\n thereof.\n\n (6) The Parliament and the Legislatures also can\n make a law laying down and regulating the scope\n and content of the doctrine of `reasonable\n opportunity' embodies in \nArticle 311\n of the\n Constitution; but the said law would be subject to\n judicial review.\n\n (7) If a statute could be made by Legislatures\n within the foregoing permissible limits the rules\n made by an authority in exercise of the power\n conferred there-under would likewise be\n efficacious within the said limits.\n\nThe question came to be reconsidered by a larger Bench of\nSeven Judges in \nMoti Ram Deka\n's case.\n \nWhile referring to the\njudgment of the majority in \nBabu Ram Upadhya\n's case the\nCourt observed as follows (at pp.731-2) :\n\n What the said Judgment has held is that while\n \nArticle 310\n provides for a tenure at pleasure of\n the President or the Governor, \nArticle 309\n enables\n the legislature or the executive, as the case may\n be, to make any law or rule in regard inter alia,\n to conditions of service without impinging upon\n the overriding power recognised under \nArticle 310.\n\n In other words, in exercising the power conferred\n by \nArticle 309\n, the extent of the pleasure\n recognised by \nArticle 310\n cannot be affected, or\n impaired. \nIn fact, while stating the conclusions\n\n199\n\n in the form of propositions\n, \nthe said judgment\n has\n observed that the Parliament or the Legislature\n can make a law regulating the conditions of\n service without affecting the powers of the\n President or the Governor under \nArticle 310\n read\n with \nArticle 311.\n It has also been stated at the\n same place that the power to dismiss a public\n servant at pleasure is outside the scope of\n \nArticle 154\n and, therefore, cannot be delegated by\n the Governor to a subordinate officer and can be\n exercised by him only in the manner prescribed by\n the Constitution. In the context, it would be\n clear that this latter observation is not intended\n to lay down that a law cannot be made under\n \nArticle 309\n or a Rule cannot be framed under the\n proviso to the said Article prescribing the\n procedure by which, and the authority by whom, the\n said pleasure can be exercised. This observation\n which is mentioned as proposition number(2) must\n be read along with the subsequent propositions\n specified as (3),(4),(5) & (6). The only point\n made is that whatever is done under \nArticle 309\n\n must be subject to the pleasure prescribed by\n \nArticle 310.\"\n\n \nWhile we are on this point we may as well advert to the\ndecision of this Court in \nSardari Lal v. Union of India &\nOrs. In\n that case it was held that where the President or\nthe Governor, as the case may be, if satisfied, makes an\norder under clause (c) of what is now the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n that in the interest of the security of the\nState it is not expedient to hold an inquiry for dismissal\nor removal or reduction in rank of an officer the\nsatisfaction of the President or the Governor must be his\npersonal satisfaction.\n \nThe correctness of this view was\nconsidered by a seven Judge Bench of this Court in \nShamsher\nSingh & Anr. v. State of Punjab\n, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 814, It was\ncategorically stated \nin that case\n(at page 835) that the\nmajority view in \nBabu Ram Upadhya\n's case was no longer goods\nlaw after the decision in \nMoti Ram Doka\n's case. Referring to\nthese two cases the Court observed (at pages 834-5)) :\n\n \nThis Court in \nState of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. v.\n Babu Ram Upadhya\n [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679 held that the\n power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure,\n subject to the provision of \nArticle 311\n, is not an\n executive power under \nArticle 154\n but a\n Constitutional power and is not capable of being\n delegated to officers subordinate\n\n200\n\n to him.\n \nThe effect of the judgment in \nBabu Ram\n Upadhya\n's case(supra) was that the Governor could\n not delegate his pleasure to any officer nor could\n any law provide for the exercise of that pleasure\n by an office with the result that pleasure by any\n officer with the result that statutory rules\n governing dismissal are binding on every officer\n though they were subject to the overriding\n pleasure of the Governor. This would mean that the\n officer was bound by the Rules but the Governor\n was not.\n\n \nIn \nBabu Ram Upadhya\n's case(supra) the majority\n view stated seven propositions at page 701 of the\n report. Proposition No. 2 is that the power to\n dismiss a public servant at pleasure is outside\n the scope of \nArticle 154\n and therefore cannot be\n delegated by the Governor to a subordinate officer\n and can be exercised by him only in the manner\n prescribed by the Constitution. Propositions No. 3\n and 4 are these. The tenure of a public servant is\n subject to the limitations or qualifications\n mentioned in \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution. The\n Parliament or the Legislatures of States cannot\n make a law abrogating or modifying this tenure so\n as to impinge upon the overriding power conferred\n upon the President or the Governor under \nArticle\n 310\n as qualified by \nArticle 311.\n Proposition No. 5\n is that the Parliament or the Legislatures of\n States can make a law regulating the conditions of\n service of such a member which includes\n proceedings by way of disciplinary action, without\n affecting the powers of the President or the\n Governor under \nArticle 310\n of the Constitution\n read with \nArticle 311.\n Proposition No. 6 is that\n the Parliament and the Legislatures also can make\n a law laying down and regulating the scope and\n content of the doctrine of `reasonable\n opportunity' embodied in \nArticle 311\n, but the said\n law would be subject to judicial review.\n\n \nAll these propositions were reviewed by the\n majority opinion of this Court in Moti Ram Deka's\n case (supra) and this Court restated that\n proposition No. 2 must be read along with the\n subsequent propositions specified as propositions\n No. 3,4,5 and 6. The ruling in Moti Ram Deka's\n case (supra) is that a law can be framed\n prescribing the procedure by which and the\n\n201\n\n authority by' whom the said pleasure can be\n exercised. The pleasure of the President or the\n Governor to dismiss can therefore not only be\n delegated but is also subject to \nArticle 311.\n The\n true position as \nlaid down in\n \nMoti Ram Deka\n's case\n (supra) is that \nArticles 310\n and \n311\n must no doubt\n be read together but once the true scope and\n effect of \nArticle 311\n is determined the scope of\n \nArticle 310(1)\n must be limited in the sense that\n in regard to cases falling under \nArticle 311(2)\n\n the pleasure mentioned in \nArticle 310(2)\n must be\n exercised in accordance with the requirements of\n \nArticle 311.\n\n \nThe majority view in Babu Ram Upadhya's case\n (supra) is no longer good law after the decision\n in \nMoti Ram Deka\n's case (supra). The theory that\n only the President or the Governor is personally\n to exercise pleasure of dismissing or removing a\n public servant is repelled by express words on\n \nArticle 311\n that no person who is a member of the\n civil service or holds a civil post under the\n Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by\n authority subordinate to that by which he was\n appointed. The words 'dismissed or removed by an\n authority subordinate to that by which he was\n appointed' indicate that the pleasure of the\n President or the Governor is exercised by such\n officers on whom the President or the Governor\n confers or delegates power.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n The Court then stated its conclusion as follows\n (at page 836) :\n\n \"For the foregoing reasons we hold that the\n President or the Governor acts on the aid and\n advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime\n Minister as the head in the case of the Union and\n the Chief Minister at the head in the case of\n State in all matters which vest. in the executive\n whether those functions are executive or\n legislative in character. Neither the President\n nor the Governor is to exercise the executive\n functions personally.\"\n\n The position, therefore, is that the pleasure of the\nPresident or the Governor is not required to be exercised by\neither of\n\n202\n\nthem personally, and that is indeed obvious from the\nlanguage of \nArticle 311.\n Under clause (1) of that Article a\ngovernment servant cannot be dismissed or removed by an\nauthority subordinate to that by which he was appointed. The\nquestion of an authority equal or superior in rank to the\nappointing authority cannot arise if the power to dismiss or\nremove is to be exercised by the President or the Governor\npersonally. Clause (b) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311\n\nequally makes this clear when the power to dispense with an\ninquiry is conferred by it upon the authority empowered to\ndismiss, remove or reduce in rank a government servant in a\ncase where such authority is satisfied that for some reason,\nto be recorded by that authority in writing, it is not\nreasonably practicable to hold such inquiry, because if it\nwas the personal satisfaction of the President or the\nGovernor, the question of the satisfaction of any authority\nempowered to dismiss or remove or reduce in rank a\ngovernment servant would not arise. Thus, though under\n\nArticle 310(1)\n the tenure of a government servant is at the\npleasure of the President or the Governor, the exercise of\nsuch pleasure can be either by the President or the Governor\nacting with the aid and on the advice of the Council of\nMinisters or by the authority specified in Acts made under\n\nArticle 309\n or in rules made under such Acts or made under\nthe proviso to \nArticle 309;\n and in the case of clause (c) of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n, the inquiry to be\ndispensed with not on the personal satisfaction of the\nPresident or the Governor but on his satisfaction arrived at\nwith the aid and on the advice of the Council of Ministers.\n\n The Second Proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\n Clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n gives a constitutional\nmandate to the principles of natural justice and audi\nalteram partem rule by providing that a person employed in a\ncivil capacity under the Union or a State shall not be\ndismissed or removed from service or reduced in rank until\nafter an inquiry in which he has been informed of the\ncharges against him and has been given a reasonable\nopportunity of being heard in respect of those charges. To\nthis extent, the pleasure doctrine enacted in \nArticle 310(1)\n\nis abridged because \nArticle 311(2)\n is a express provision of\nthe Constitution. This safeguard provided for a government\nservant by clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n is, however, taken away\nwhen the second proviso to that clause becomes applicable.\nThe safeguard provided by clause(1) of \nArticle 311\n, however,\nremains intact and continues to be available to the\ngovernment servant. The second\n\n203\n\nproviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n becomes applicable in the three\ncases mentioned in clauses (a) to (c) of that proviso. These\ncases are\n\n (a) where a person is dismissed or removed or\n reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has\n led to his conviction on a criminal charge; or\n\n (b) where the authority empowered to dismiss or\n remove a person or to reduce him in rank is\n satisfied that for some reason, to be recorded by\n that authority in writing, it is not reasonably\n practicable to hold such inquiry; and\n\n (c) where the President or the Governor, as the\n case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of\n the security of the State it is not expedient to\n hold such inquiry.\n\n The Construction to be placed upon the second proviso\nand the scope and effect of that proviso were much debated\nat the Bar. In Hira Lal Rattan Lal etc. v. State of U.P. &\nAnr., [1973] 2 S.C.R. 502 this Court observed (at page 512)\n;\n\n \"In construing a statutory provision, the first\n and the foremost rule of construction is the\n literary construction. All that we have to see at\n the very outset is what does that provision say?\n If the provision is unambiguous and if from that\n provision, the legislative intent is clear, we\n need not call into aid the other rules of\n construction of statutes. The other rules of\n construction of statutes are called into aid only\n when the legislature intention is not clear.\n Ordinarily a proviso to a section is intended to\n take out a part of the main section for special\n treatment. It is not expected to enlarge the scope\n of the main section. But cases have arisen in\n which this Court has held that despite the fact\n that a provision is called proviso, it is really a\n separate provision and the so called proviso has\n substantially altered the main section.\"\n\n \nIn \nCommissioner of Income Tax, Madras v. Madurai Mills\nCo. Ltd.\n, [1973] 3 S.C.R. 662, this Court said (at page 669)\n:\n\n204\n\n \"A proviso cannot be construed as enlarging the\n scope of an enactment when it can be fairly and\n properly construed without attributing to it that\n effect. Further, if the language of the enacting\n part of the statute is plain and unambiguous and\n does not contain the provisions which are said to\n occur in it, one cannot derive those provisions by\n implication from a proviso.\"\n\n The language of the second proviso is plan and\nunambiguous. The key-words in the second proviso are \"this\nclause shall not apply\". By \"this clause\" is meant\nclause(2). As clause(2) requires an inquiry to be held\nagainst a government servant, the only meaning attributable\nto these words is that this inquiry shall not be held. There\nis no scope for any ambiguity in these words and there is no\nreason to given them any meaning different from the plain\nand ordinary meaning which they bear. The resultant effect\nof these words is that when a situation envisaged in any of\nthe three clauses of the proviso arises and that clause\nbecomes applicable, the safeguard provided to a government\nservant by clause (2) is taken away. As pointed out earlier,\nthis provision is as much in public interest and for public\ngood and a matter of public policy as the pleasure doctrine\nand the safeguards with respect to security of tenure\ncontained in clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311.\n\n Before, however, any clause of the second proviso can\ncome into play the condition \nlaid down in\n it must be\nsatisfied. The condition for the application of each of\nthese clauses is different. In the case of clause (a) a\ngovernment servant must be guilty of conduct deserving the\npenalty of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank which\nconduct has led to him being convicted on a criminal charge.\nIn the case of clause (b) the disciplinary authority must be\nsatisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to hold an\ninquiry. In the case of clause (c) the President or the\nGovernor of a State, as the case may be, must be satisfied\nthat in the interest of the security of the State, it is not\nexpedient to hold an inquiry. When these conditions can be\nsaid to be fulfilled will be discussed later while dealing\nseparately with each of the three clauses. The paramount\nthing, however, to bear in mind is that the second proviso\nwill apply only where the conduct of a government servant is\nsuch as he deserves the punishment of dismissal, removal or\nreduction in rank. If the conduct is such as to deserve a\npunishment different from those mentioned above, the second\nproviso cannot come into play at all,\n\n205\n\nbecause \nArticle 311 (2)\n is itself confined only to these\nthree penalties. Therefore, before denying a government\nservant his constitutional right to an inquiry, the first\nconsideration would be whether the conduct of the concerned\ngovernment servant is such as justifies the penalty of\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank. Once that\nconclusion is reached and the condition specified in the\nrelevant clause of the second proviso is satisfied, that\nproviso becomes applicable and the government servant is not\nentitled to an inquiry. The extent to which a government\nservant can be denied his right to an inquiry formed the\nsubject-matter of considerable debate at the Bar and we,\ntherefore, now turn to the question whether under the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n even though the inquiry is\ndispensed with, some opportunity at least should not be\nafforded to the government servant to that he is not left\nwholly without protection. As most of the arguments on this\nPart of the case were common to all the three clauses of the\nsecond proviso, it will be convenient at this stage to deal\nat one place with all the arguments on this part of the\ncase, leaving aside to be separately dealt with the other\narguments pertaining only to a particular clause of the\nsecond proviso.\n\n The Extent of Denial of Opportunity under the Second\nProviso\n It was submitted on behalf of the government servants\nthat an inquiry consists of several stages and, therefore,\neven where by the application of the second proviso the full\ninquiry is dispensed with, there is nothing to prevent the\ndisciplinary authority from holding at least a minimal\ninquiry because no prejudice can because by doing so. It was\nfurther submitted that even though the three clauses of the\nsecond proviso are different in their content, it was\nfeasible in the case of each of the three clauses to give to\nthe government servant an opportunity of showing cause\nagainst the penalty proposed to be imposed so as to enable\nhim to convince the disciplinary authority that the nature\nof the misconduct attributed to him did not call for his\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank. For instance, in a\ncase falling under clause (a) the government servant can\npoint out that the offence of which he was convicted was a\ntrivial or a technical one in respect of which the criminal\ncourt had taken a lenient view and had sentenced him to pay\na nominal fine or had given him the benefit of probation.\nSupport for this submission was derived from Challappan's\ncase. It was further submitted that apart from the\nopportunity to show cause against the proposed penalty it\nwas also feasible to give a further opportunity in the case\nof each of the three clauses though such opportunity in each\n\n206\n\ncase may not be identical. Thus, it was argued that the\ncharge-sheet or at least a notice informing the government\nservant of the charges against him and calling for his\nexplanation thereto was always feasible. It was further\nargued that though under clause (a) of the second proviso an\ninquiry into the conduct which led to the conviction of the\ngovernment servant on a criminal charge would not be\nnecessary, such a notice would enable him to point out that\nit was a case of mistaken identity and he was not the person\nwho had been convicted but was an altogether different\nindividual. It was urged that there could be no practical\ndifficulty in serving such charge-sheet to the concerned\ngovernment servant because even if he were sentenced to\nimprisonment, the charge-sheet or notice with respect to the\nproposed penalty can always be sent to the jail in which he\nis serving his sentence. So far as clause (b) is concerned,\nit was argued that even though it may not be reasonably\npracticable to hold an inquiry, the explanation of the\ngovernment servant can at least be asked for with respect to\nthe charges made against him so that he would have an\nopportunity of showing in his written reply that he was not\nguilty of any of those charges. It was also argued that\nassuming such government servant was absconding, the notice\ncould be sent by registered post to his last known address\nor pasted there. Similar arguments as in case of clause (b)\nwere advanced with respect to clause (c). It was submitted\nthat the disciplinary authority could never make up its mind\nwhether to dismiss or remove or reduce in rank a government\nservant unless such minimal opportunity at least was\nafforded to the government servant. Support for these\ncontentions was sought to be derived from (1) the language\nof \nArticle 311(2)\n and the implications flowing therefrom,\n(2) the principle of natural justice including the audi\nalteram partem rule comprehended in \nArticle 14\n, and \n(3)\n the\nlanguage certain rules made either under Acts referable to\nthe \nArticle 309\n or made under the proviso to that Article.\nWe will consider the contentions with respect to each of\nthese basis separately.\n\n So far as \nArticle 311(2)\n was concerned, it was said\nthat the language of the second proviso did not negative\nevery single opportunity which could be afforded to a\ngovernment servant under different situations though the\nnature of such opportunity may be different depending upon\nthe circumstances of the case. It was further submitted that\nthe object of the \nArticle 311(2)\n was that no government\nservant should be condemned unheard and dismissed or removed\nor reduced in rank without affording him at least some\nchance of either showing his innocence or convincing\n\n207\n\nthe disciplinary authority that the proposed penalty was too\ndrastic and was uncalled for in his case and a lesser\npenalty should, therefore, be imposed upon him. These\narguments, though attractive at the first blush, do not bear\nscrutiny.\n\n The language of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n\nread in the light of the interpretation placed upon clause\n(2) of \nArticle 311\n as originally enacted and the legislative\nhistory of that clause wholly rule out the giving of any\nopportunity. While construing Rule 55 of the Civil Services\n(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules and the phrase \"a\nreasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action\nproposed to be taken in regard to him\" occurring in sub-\nsection (3) of \nsection 240\n of the Government of India Act,\n1935, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Lall's\ncase stated as follows (at page 242-3) :\n\n \"... sub-s. 3 of s. 240 was not intended to be,\n and was not, a reproduction of rule 55, which was\n left unaffected as an administrative rule. Rule 55\n is concerned that the civil servant shall be\n informed 'of the grounds on which it is proposed\n to take action,' and to afford him an adequate\n opportunity of defending himself against charges\n which have to be reduced to writing; this is in\n marked contrast to the statutory provision of 'a\n reasonable opportunity of showing cause against\n the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.'\n In the opinion of their Lordships, no action is\n proposed within the meaning of the sub-section\n until a definite conclusion has been come to on\n the charges, and the actual punishment to follow\n is provisionally determined on. Before that stage,\n the charges are unproved and the suggested\n punishments are merely hypothetical. It is on that\n stage being reached that the statute gives the\n civil servants the opportunity for which sub-s.3\n makes provision. Their Lord ships would only add\n that they see no difficulty in the statutory\n opportunity being reasonably afforded at more that\n one stage. If the civil servant has been through\n an inquiry under rule 55, it would not be\n reasonable that he should ask for a repetition of\n that stage, if duly carried out, but that would\n not exhaust his statutory right, and he would\n still be entitled to represent against the\n punishment proposed as the result of the findings\n of the inquiry. On this view of the proper\n construction of sub-s.3 of\n s.240\n, it is\n\n208\n\n not disputed that the respondent has not been\n given the opportunity to which he is entitled\n thereunder, and the purported removal of the\n respondent on August 10,1940, did not conform to\n the mandatory requirements of sub-s.3 of s.240,\n and was void and inoperative.\"\n\n \nThe very phrase \"a reasonable opportunity of showing\ncause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to\nhim\" in sub-section(3) of \nsection 240\n of the Government of\nIndia Act, 1935, was repeated in clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n\nas originally enacted, that is in the said clauses prior too\nits amendment by the \nConstitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act,\n1963\n. Approving the construction placed by the Judicial\nCommittee upon this phrase, this Court in \nKhem Chand v. The\nUnion of India & Ors.\n [1958] S.C.R. 1080, held as follows\n(at page 1095-97) :\n\n \"It is true that the provision does not, in terms,\n refer to different stages at which opportunity is\n to be given to the officer concerned. All that it\n says is that the government servant must be given\n a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against\n the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.\n He must not only be given an opportunity but such\n opportunity must be a reasonable one. In order\n that the opportunity to show cause against the\n proposed action may be regarded as a reasonable\n one, it is quite obviously necessary that the\n government servant should have the opportunity, to\n say, if that be his case, that he has not been\n guilty of any misconduct to merit any punishment\n at all and also that the particular punishment\n proposed to be given is much more drastic and\n server than he deserves. Both these pleas have a\n direct bearing on the question of punishment and\n may well be put forward in showing cause against\n the proposed punishment. If this is the correct\n meaning of the clause, as we think it is, what\n consequences follow? If it is open to the\n government servant under this provision to\n contend, if that be the fact, that he is not\n guilty of any misconduct then how can he take that\n plea unless he is told what misconduct is alleged\n against him? If the opportunity to show cause is\n to be a reasonable one it is clear that he should\n be informed about the charge or charges levelled\n against him and the evidence by which it is sought\n to be established, for it is only then that he\n will be able\n\n209\n\n to put forward his defence. If the purpose of this\n provision is to give the government servant an\n opportunity to exonerate himself from the charge\n and if this opportunity is to be a reasonable one\n he should be allowed to show that the evidence\n against him is not worthy of credence or\n consideration and that he can only do if he is\n given a chance to cross-examine the witnesses\n called against him and to examine himself or any\n other witness in support of his defence. All this\n appears to us to be implicit in the language used\n in the clause, but this does not exhaust his\n rights. In addition to showing that he has not\n been guilty of any misconduct so as to merit any\n punishment, it is reasonable that he should also\n have an opportunity to contend that the charges\n proved against him do not necessarily require the\n particular punishment proposed to be meted out to\n him. He may say for instance, that although he has\n been guilty of some misconduct it is not of such a\n character as to merit the extreme punishments of\n dismissal or even of removal or reduction in rank\n and that any of the lesser punishments ought to be\n sufficient in his case.\n\n To summarise : the reasonable opportunity\n envisages by the provision under consideration\n includes -\n\n (a) An opportunity to deny his guilt and establish\n his innocence, which he can only do if he is told\n what the charges levelled against him are and the\n allegations on which such charges are based;\n\n (b) an opportunity to defend himself by cross-\n\n examining the witnesses produced against him and\n by examining himself or any other witnesses in\n support of his defence ; and finally\n\n (c) an opportunity to make his representation as\n to why the proposed punishment should not be\n inflicted on him, which he can only do if the\n competent authority, after the enquiry is over and\n after applying his mind to the gravity or\n otherwise of the charges proved against the\n government servant tentatively proposes to inflict\n one of the three punishments and communicates the\n same to the government servant. In short the\n substance of the protection provided by rules,\n like\n\n210\n\n rule 55 \nreferred to above\n, was bodily lifted out\n of the rules and together with an additional\n opportunity embodied in\n s.240(3)\n of the Government\n of India Act, 1935 so as to give a statutory\n protection to the government servants and has now\n been incorporated in \nArticle 311(2)\n so as to\n convert the protection into a constitutional\n safeguard.\"\n\n \nWhile the Judicial Committee in \nLall\n's case held that\ntwo opportunities were required - one under rule 55 of the\nCivil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules to\nshow cause against the charges of misconduct made against a\ngovernment servant, and the other under sub-section (3) of\n\nsection 240\n of the Government of India Act, 1935, to show\ncause against the proposed penalty, this Court in \nKhem\nChand\n's case held that \nArticle 311(2)\n bodily lifted the said\nrule 55 and the additional opportunity provided for in\n\nsection 240(3)\n of the 1935 Act and incorporated these\nprovisions in \nArticle 311(2)\n so as to convert the protection\nafforded to government servants into a constitutional\nsafeguard. This conclusion was reached by this Court even\nthough \nArticle 311(2)\n used the same language as \nsection\n240(3)\n. \nThe Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963\n,\nsubstituted the whole of clause (2). The substituted clause\nspecifically provided for two opportunities to be given to a\ngovernment servant :(1) to be informed of the charges\nagainst him and to be given a reasonable opportunity of\ndefending himself against those charges, and (2) a\nreasonable opportunity of making representation on the\npenalty proposed where after such inquiry it was proposed to\nimpose on him the penalty of dismissal, removal or reduction\nin rank. No additional rights were, however, conferred upon\ngovernment servants by the above amendment because it merely\ndeclared the rights which a government servant already\npossessed under the original clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n as\ninterpreted by this Court in Khem Chand's case. This\namendment, therefore, was merely declaratory, but in a way\nit was also clarificatory because it restricted the right of\nrepresentation on the proposed penalty to a representation\nonly on the basis of the evidence adduced during the\ninquiry.\n \nThis clarification perhaps became necessary\nbecause, as pointed out by this Court in \nSuresh Koshy George\nv. The University of Kerala & Ors.\n [1969] 1 S.C.R. 317,\n\n326., there prevailed an erroneous impression in certain\nquarters, evidently influenced by the provisions of the\nunamended \nArticle 311(2)\n that every disciplinary proceeding\nmust consist of two inquiries, one before issuing a show\ncause notice to be followed by another inquiry thereafter.\nThis amendment, therefore, made it expressly clear that the\ninquiry to be held against\n\n211\n\na government servant was to be one in which a charge-sheet\nor a show-cause notice was to be issued to him informing him\nof the charges against him and giving him a reasonable\nopportunity of being heard in respect of those charges and a\nfurther opportunity of making representation on the penalty\nproposed to be imposed on him but only on the basis of the\nevidence adduced during such inquiry. The substituted\nclause, therefore, showed that the issue of a charge-sheet\nor a show-cause notice in respect of the charges framed\nagainst a government servant and a notice to show cause\nagainst the proposed penalty were part of the inquiry\ncontemplated by \nArticle 311 (2).\n Even assuming for the sake\nof argument that because \nArticle 311(2)\n, as substituted by\nthe \nConstitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act\n, spoke of \"a\nreasonable opportunity of making representation on the\npenalty proposed\" in a case \"where it is proposed, after\nsuch inquiry, to impose on him any such penalty\", the show\ncause notice with respect to penalty was not a part of the\ninquiry, the opening words of the proviso to clause (2) (now\nthe second proviso to that clause) namely, \"Provided further\nthat this clause shall not apply\", would, where any of the\nthree clauses of the said proviso applies, take away both\nthe right to have an inquiry held in which the government\nservant would be entitled to a charge-sheet as also the\nright to make a representation on the proposed penalty. As\nmentioned above, the words \"this clause shall not apply\" are\nthe key-words in the second proviso and govern each and\nevery clause thereof and by reason of these words not only\nthe holding of an inquiry but all the provisions of clause\n(2) have been dispensed with.\n\n \nThe question which then arises is, \"\nWhether the\nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n, which\nfurther amended the substituted clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n\nwith effect from 1st January 1977, has made any change in\nthe law?\" The amendments made by this Act are that in clause\n(2) that portion which required a reasonable opportunity of\nmaking representation on the proposed penalty to be given to\na government servant was deleted and in its place the first\nproviso was inserted, which expressly provides that it is\nnot necessary to give to a delinquent government servant any\nopportunity of making representation on the proposed\npenalty. Does this affect the operation of the original\nproviso which, by the \nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment)\nAct\n, became the second proviso? Such obviously was not and\ncould not have been the intention of Parliament. The opening\nwords of the second proviso remain the same except that the\nword 'further' was inserted after the word 'Provided',\nbecause the original proviso by reason of the insertion of\nanother proviso before it became\n\n212\n\nthe second proviso. It should be borne in mind that the show\ncause notice at the punishment stage was originally there as\na result of the interpretation placed by the Judicial\nCommittee in \nLal\n's case and by this Court in Khem Chand's\ncase upon the phrase \"a reasonable opportunity of showing\ncause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to\nhim\".\n \nClause (2) as substituted by the \nConstitution\n(Fifteenth Amendment) Act\n merely reproduced the substance of\nwhat was held in \nKhem Chand\n's case. The words which\noriginally found a place in clause (2), \"a reasonable\nopportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to\nbe taken in regard to him\", do not any more feature in\nclause (2). All that clause (2) now provides is an inquiry\nin which the government servant is informed of the charges\nagainst him and given a reasonable opportunity of being\nheard in respect of those charges. Clause (2) taken by\nitself even without the first proviso does not provide,\nexpressly impliedly, for any opportunity to make a\nrepresentation against the proposed penalty. \nAfter the\nConstitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act\n this second\nopportunity formed a separate part of clause (2), which part\nwas deleted by the \nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment)\nAct\n. Thus, when the second proviso states in its opening\nwords that \"Provided further that this clause shall not\napply\" it means that whatever safe-guards are to be found in\nclause (2) are wholly taken away in a case where any of the\nthree clauses of the second proviso is attracted.\n \nIn this\nconnection, the following observations of this Court in the\n\nCase of Suresh Koshy George v. The University of Kerala &\nOrs.\n(at page 326-7) are pertinent :\n\n \"There seems to be an erroneous impression in\n certain quarters evidently influenced by the\n provisions in \nArticle 311\n of the Constitution\n particularly as they stood before the amendment of\n that article that every disciplinary proceeding\n must consist of two inquiries, one before issuing\n the show cause notice to be followed by another\n inquiry thereafter. Such is not the requirement of\n the principles of natural justice. Law may or may\n not prescribe such a course.\"\n\nIn \nAssociated Cement Companies Ltd. v. T.C.Shrivastava &\nOrs.\n, [1984] 3 S.C.R. 361,369, this Court held that \"neither\nunder the ordinary law of the land nor under industrial law\na second opportunity to show cause against the proposed\npunishment is necessary\". Since a right to such opportunity\ndoes not exist in law, it follows that the only right which\nthe government servant had to make a representation on the\nproposed penalty was to be found\n\n213\n\nin clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n prior to its amendment by the\n\nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act\n. This right having\nbeen taken away by the \nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment)\nAct\n, there is no provision of law under which a government\nservant can claim this right.\n\n As for the argument that in a case under clause (a) of\nthe second proviso a government servant could be wrongly\ndismissed, removed or reduced in rank mistaking him for\nanother with the same name unless he is given an opportunity\nof bringing to the notice of the disciplinary authority that\nhe is not the individual who has been convicted, it can only\nbe described as being too fanciful and far-fetched for\nthough such a case of mistaken identity may be\nhypothetically possible, it is highly improbable. As in all\nother organization, there is in government service an\nextremely active grapevine, both departmental and inter-\ndepartmental, which is constantly active, humming and\nbuzzing with service news and office gossip, and it would\nindeed be strange if the news that a member of a department\nwas facing prosecution or had been convicted were to remain\na secret for long. Assuming such a case occurs, the\ngovernment servant is not without any remedy. He can prove\nin a departmental appeal which service rules provide for,\nsave in exceptional cases, that he has been wrongly mistaken\nfor another. Similarly, it is not possible to accept the\nargument that unless a written explanation with respect to\nthe charges is asked for from a government servant and his\nside of the case known, the penalty which would be imposed\nupon him, could be grossly out of proportion to his actual\nmisconduct. The disciplinary authorities are expected to act\njustly and fairly after taking into account all the facts\nand circumstances of the case and if they act arbitrarily\nand impose a penalty which is unduly excessive, capricious\nor vindictive, it can be set aside in a departmental appeal.\nIn any event, the remedy by way of judicial review is always\nopen to a government servant.\n\n \nThe position which emerges from the above discussion is\nthat the key-words of the second proviso govern each and\nevery clause of that proviso and leave no scope for any kind\nof opportunity to be given to a government servant. The\nphrase \"this clause shall not apply\" is mandatory and not\ndirectory. It is in the nature of a Constitutional\nprohibitory injunction restraining the disciplinary\nauthority from holding an inquiry under \nArticle 311(2)\n or\nfrom giving any kind of opportunity to the concerned\ngovernment servant. There is thus no scope for introducing\ninto\n\n214\n\nthe second proviso some kind of inquiry or opportunity by a\nprocess of inference or implication. The maxim \"expressum\nfacit cessare tacitum\" (\"when there is express mention of\ncertain things, then anything not mentioned is excluded\")\napplies to the case. As pointed out by this Court in \nB.\nShankara Rao Badam & Ors. v. State of Mysore & Anr.\n, [1969]\n3 S.C.R. 1, 12, this well-known maxim is a principle of\nlogic and common sense and not merely a technical rule of\nconstruction. The second proviso expressly mentions that\nclause (2) shall not apply where one of the clauses of that\nproviso becomes applicable. This express mention excludes\neverything that clause (2) contains and there can be no\nscope for once again introducing the opportunities provided\nby clause (2) or any one of them into the second proviso.\n In\nAtkinson v. United States of America Government, L.R. [1971]\nA.C. 197, Lord Reid said (at page 232) :\n\n \"It is now well recognised that the court has\n power to expand procedure laid down by statute if\n that is necessary to prevent infringement of\n natural justice and is not plainly contrary to the\n intention of Parliament.\"\n\nHere, however, the attempt is not merely to do something\ncontrary to the intention of \"Parliament\", that is, in our\ncase, the Constituent Assembly, but to do something contrary\nto an express prohibition contained in the Constitution. The\nconclusion which flows from the express language of the\nsecond proviso is inevitable and there is no escape from it.\nIt may appear harsh but, as mentioned earlier, the second\nproviso has been inserted in the Constitution as a matter of\npublic policy and in public interest and for public good\njust as the pleasure doctrine and the safeguards for a\ngovernment servant provided in clause (1) and (2) of \nArticle\n311\n have been. It is in public interest and for public good\nthat government servant who has been convicted of a grave\nand serious offence or one rendering him unfit to continue\nin office should be summarily dismissed or removed from\nservice instead of being allowed to continue in it at public\nexpense and to public detriment. It is equally in public\ninterest and for public good that where his offence is such\nthat he should not be permitted to continue to hold the same\nrank, that he should be reduced in rank. Equally, where a\npublic servant by himself or in concert with others has\nbrought about a situation in which it is not reasonably\npracticable to hold an inquiry and his conduct is such as to\njustify his dismissal, removal or reduction in rank, both\npublic interest and public good demand that such\n\n215\n\npenalty should forthwith and summarily be imposed upon him;\nand similarly, where in the interest of the security of the\nState it is not expedient to hold an inquiry, it is in the\npublic interest and for public good that where one of the\nthree punishments of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank\nis called for, it should be summarily imposed upon the\nconcerned government servant. It was argued that in a case\nfalling under clause (b) or (c), a government servant ought\nto be place under suspension until the situation improves or\nthe danger to the security of the State has passed, as the\ncase may be, and it becomes possible to hold an inquiry.\nThis argument overlooks the fact that suspension involves\nthe payment at least of subsistence allowance and such\nallowance is paid at public expense, and that neither public\ninterest would be benefited nor public good served by\nplacing such government servant under suspension because it\nmay take a considerable time for the situation to improve or\nthe danger to be over. Much as this may seem harsh and\noppressive to a government servant, this Court must not\nforget that the object underlying the second proviso is\npublic policy, public interest and public good and the Court\nmust, therefore, repel the temptation to be carried away by\nfeelings of commiseration and sympathy for those government\nservants who have been dismissed, removed or reduced in rank\nby applying the second proviso. Sympathy and commiseration\ncannot be allowed to out weigh considerations of public\npolicy, concern for public interest, regard for public good\nand the peremptory dictate of a Constitutional prohibition.\nThe Court must bear in mind that the second proviso has been\nin the Constitution since it was originally enacted. It was\nnot blindly or slavishly copied from \nsection 240(3)\n of the\nGovernment of India Act, 1935. \nArticle 311\n was article 282-B\nof the draft Constitution of India and the draft Article\n282-B was discussed and a considerable debate took place on\nit in the Constituent Assembly (see the Official Report of\nthe Constituent Assembly Debates, vol.IX, page 1099 to\n1116). The greater part of this debate centred upon the\nproviso to clause (2) of the draft article 282-B, which is\nnow the second proviso to \nArticle 311.\n Further, the Court\nshould also bear in mind that clause (c) of the second\nproviso and clause (3) of \nArticle 311\n did not feature in\n\nsection 240\n of the Government of India Act, 1935, but were\nnew provisions consciously introduced by the Constituent\nAssembly in \nArticle 311.\n Those who formed the Constituent\nAssembly were not the advocates of a despotic or dictatorial\nform of government. They were the persons who enacted into\nour Constitution the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. The\nmajority of them had fought for freedom and had suffered\nimprisonment in the cause of liberty\n\n216\n\nand they, therefore, were not likely to introduce into our\nConstitution any provision from the earlier Government of\nIndia Acts which had been intended purely for the benefit of\na foreign imperialistic power. After all, it is not as if a\ngovernment applied to him. There are two remedies open to\nhim, servant is without any remedy when the second proviso\nhas been applied to him. There are two remedies open to him,\nnamely, departmental appeal and judicial review. The scope\nand extent of these remedies will be considered later in the\ncourse of this judgment.\n\n \nArticle 14\n and the Second Proviso\n The next question which false to be considered is,\n\"Does \nArticle 14\n make any difference to the consequences\nwhich flow from the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)?\"\n It\nwas submitted on behalf of the government servants that\n\nArticle 14\n in which the principle of natural justice are\ncomprehended permeates the entire Constitution and,\ntherefore, \nArticle 14\n must be read into the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2)\n and according if not under that proviso\nread by itself, under it read with \nArticle 14\n a government\nservant is entitled to an opportunity both of showing cause\nagainst the charges made against him as also against the\npenalty proposed to be imposed upon him, though such\nopportunity may not extend to the holding of a complete and\nelaborate inquiry as would be the case where clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n applies. According to learned Counsel this is\nwhat is required by the audi alteram partem rule which is\none of the two main principles of natural Justice. In the\nalternative it was submitted that though an order may be\nvalid and supportable under the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n, it could none the less be void under \nArticle 14\n on\nthe ground that the principles of natural justice have been\nwholly disregarded. These arguments are based upon an\nimperfect understanding of the principles of natural justice\nin their application in courts of law to the adjudication of\ncauses before them and the function of \nArticle 14\n vis-a-vis\nthe other provisions of the Constitution and particularly\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n\n The principles of natural justice are not the creation\nof \nArticle 14.\n \nArticle 14\n is not their begetter but their\nConstitutional guardian. Principles of natural justice trace\ntheir ancestry to ancient civilizations and centuries long\npast. Until about two centuries ago the term \"natural\njustice\" was often used interchangeably with \"natural law\"\n\nand at times it is still so used. The expression \"natural\nlaw\" has been variously defined.\n\n217\n\nIn Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law (Second Edition, page\n1221) it is defined as \"rules derived from God, reason or\nnature, as distinct from man-made law.\" Black's Law\nDictionary (Fifth Edition, page 925) states :\n\n \"This expression, 'natural law', or jus natural,\n was largely used in the philosophical speculations\n of the Roman jurists of the Antonine age, and was\n intended to denote a system of rules and\n principles for the guidance of human conduct\n which, independently of enacted law or of the\n systems peculiar to any one people, might be\n discovered by the rational intelligence of man,\n and would be found to grow out of an conform to\n his nature, meaning by that word his whole mental,\n moral, and physical constitution. The point of\n departure for this conception was the stoic\n doctrine of a life ordered 'according to nature',\n which in its turn rested upon the purely\n supposititious existence, in primitive times, of a\n 'state of nature;' that is, a condition of society\n in which men universally were governed solely by a\n rational and consistent obedience to the needs,\n impulses, and promptings of their true nature,\n such nature being as yet underacted by dishonesty,\n falsehood, or indulgence of the baser passions. In\n ethics it consists in practical universal\n judgments which man himself elicits. These express\n necessary and obligatory rules of human conduct\n which have been established by the author or human\n nature as essential to the divine purposes in the\n universe and have been promulgated by God solely\n through human reason\".\n\n There are certain basic values which man has cherished\nthroughout the ages. But man looked about him and found the\nways of men to be cruel and unjust and so also their laws\nand customs. He saw men flogged, tortured, mutilated, made\nslaves, and sentenced to row the galleys or toil in the\ndarkness of the mines or to fight in an arena with wild an\nhungry beasts of the Jungle or to die in other ways a cruel,\nhorrible and lingering death. He found judges to be venal\nand servile to those in power and the laws they administered\nto be capricious, changing with the whims of the ruler to\nsuit his purpose. When, therefore, he found a system of law\nwhich did not so change, he praised it. Thus, the old\nTestament in the Book of Esther (I,19) speaks\n\n218\n\nadmiringly of legal system of the Achaemenid dynasty (the\nFirst Persian Empire) in which \"a royal commandment\" was\n\"written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that\nit be not altered.\" Man saw cities and towns sacked and\npillaged, their populace dragged into captivity and\ncondemned to slavery - the men to labour, the women and the\ngirls to concubinage, and the young boys to be castrated\ninto eunuches - their only crime being that their ruler had\nthe misfortune to be defeated in battle and to lose one of\nhis cities or towns to the enemy. Thus, there was neither\nhope nor help in man-made laws or man-established customs\nfor they were one-sided and oppressive, intended to benefit\narmed might and monied power and to subjugate the down-\ntrodden poor and the helpless needy. If there was any help\nto be found or any hope to be discovered, it was only in a\nlaw based on justice and reason which transcended the laws\nand customs of men, a law made by some one greater and\nmightier than those men who made these laws and established\nthese customs. Such a person could only be a divine being\nand such a law could only be \"natural law\" or \"the law of\nnature\" meaning thereby \"certain rules of conduct supposed\nto be so just that they are binding upon all mankind.\" It\nwas not \"the law of nature \"in the sense of \"the law of the\njungle\" where the lion devours the lamb and the tiger feeds\nupon the antelope because the lion is hungry and the tiger\nfamished but a higher law of nature or \"the natural law\"\n\nwhere the lion and the lamb lie down together and the tiger\nfrisks with the antelope.\n\n Most, if not all, jurists are agreed that \"reason\" and\n\"the nature of man\" constitute the fountain-head of natural\nlaw but there is a considerable divergence of opinion\namongst them as also amongst philosophers about the nature\nand meaning of that law and its relation to positive law.\nAmong the ancients Greeks the Sophists, Artistotle in his\ntreatises on \"Logic\" and Ethics\", and the Stoics developed\ndifferent theories. The theory propounded by Aristotle in\nhis \"Logic\" adhered substantially to the point of view of\nthe Sophists, namely, that man is a natural creature but is\nalso endowed with reason. Later, in his \"Ethics\", Aristotle\ncame to distinguish between natural and legal or\nconventional justice and postulated that natural law had\nauthority everywhere and was discoverable by the use of\nreason. The ancient Romans were not given to philosophical\nspeculations or creative orignality in Art. They preferred\nto borrow these from the Greeks. The Romans were a hard-\nheaded, practical race of conquerors, administrators and\nlegislators. Roman jurists, therefore, used the concept of\nnatural law, that is jus naturale (or ius naturale as the\nRomans wrote it because Roman alphabet had no\n\n219\n\nletter \"J\" or \"J\" in it) to introduce into the body of law\nthose parts of laws and customs of foreigners, that is, non-\nRoman people with whom they came in commercial contract or\nwhom they subjugated. The Rules which the Romans borrowed\nfrom these laws and customs were those which were capable of\ngeneral application and they developed then into general\nlegal principles, which came to form jus gentium or the law\nof nations. In doing so they acted upon the principle that\nany rule of law which was common to the nations (gentes)\nthey knew of must be basically in consonance with reason\nand, therefore, fundamentally just. They applied jus gentium\nto those to whom ius civile (civil law) did not apply, that\nis, in cases between foreigners or between a Roman citizen\nand a foreigner. On this basic formulation that what was\ncommon to all known nations must be in consonance with\nreason and justice, the Roman jurists and magistrates\nproceeded to the theory that any rule which instinctively\ncommanded itself to the sense of justice and reason would be\npart of the jus gentium. The jus gentium of the Romans was\ndifferent from what we call international law and should not\nbe confused with it, for the scope of the jus gentium was\nmuch wider than our international law. Because of the theory\nof its identity with justice and reason, the term \"jus\ngentium\" came at times to be used for aequitas, that is,\nequity as understood by the Romans, which was the basis of\npraetorian law or the power of the praetors to grant\nremedies where non existed under the jus civile. In the Dark\nAges the expression \"natural law\" acquired a theological\nbase and the Fathers of the Church, particularly St.\nAmbrose, St. Augustine and St. Gregory, held the belief that\nit was the function of the Church to bring about the best\npossible approximation of human laws to Christian\nprinciples. As Europe emerged from the Dark Ages in about\nthe ninth century, Christianity became substituted for\nreason as the supreme force in the universe, and this led to\nthe development of a theory of law in which Christianity had\nthe supreme spiritual and legal force and was superior to\nall other laws, with the Church as the authentic expositor\nof the law of nature. Gratian (Francisco Graziano) in the\ntwelfth century in his \"Decretum\" or \"Concordies\ndiscordantium canonum\" consider the law of nature as part of\nthe law of God. According to St. Thomas Aquinas (1226-74),\nnatural law was derived from the law of God which was\nsupreme and such of it as was intelligible to men was\nrevealed through Church law as the incorporation of divine\nwisdom. Thus, according to this Theory, natural law was that\npart of divine law which revealed itself in natural reason,\nand man as a reasonable being applied this part of divine\nlaw to human affairs. This theory, though it upheld\n\n220\n\nthe supreme authority of the Church, made some concession to\nthe authority of the Emperor, that is, the Holy Roman\nEmperor. Dante in his \"De Monarchia\" championed the\nsupremacy of the Holy Roman Empire as against the Church on\nthe ground that the Emperor was the legitimate successor of\nthe Roman people and was chosen by God to rule the world.\nThe authority of the law of nature or natural law was\nrepeatedly sought support from during the centuries which\nsaw the struggle for supremacy between the Popes and the\nGeneral Councils of the Church and between the Popes and the\nEmperors and later in the struggle between the Catholics and\nthe Protestants. Both sides in these conflicts found in\nnatural law the interpretation of scriptural texts which\nsupported their respective views and were, therefore,\naccording to them, the true interpretation. Braction, in the\nthirteenth century, however, considered natural law as that\nwhich nature, that is, God, teaches to all animals, and\nthough he tried to reconcile natural law with human law, he\nacknowledged the difficulty of doing so because he found\nrules of positive law which could hardly be so reconciled.\n\n Natural law was also seized upon as furnishing\narguments in the struggle between the judges and Parliament\nfor supremacy which took place in the seventeenth century.\nCoke in Dr, Bonham's case [1610] 8 Co. Rep. 113b, 118, said\nby way of obiter, \"when an Act of Parliament is against\ncommon right or reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be\nperformed, the common law will control it, and adjudge such\nAct to be void.\" There were later assertions to the same\neffect until the supremacy of Parliament and the legislation\nenacted by it became firmly established in 1688. However, in\nBritish Railways Board v. Pickin sub nomine Pickin v.\nBritish Railways Board, L.R. [1974] A.C. 765, the argument\nwas once again advanced before the House of Lords that a\ncourt was entitled to disregard a provision in an Act of\nParliament and a distinction was sought be drawn for this\npurpose between a public Act and a private Act. Referring to\nthe arguments to this point, Lord Reid observed (at page\n\n782) :\n\n \"In earlier times many learned lawyers seem to\n have believed that an Act of Parliament could be\n disregarded in so far as it was contrary to the\n law of God or the law of nature of natural\n justice, but since the supremacy of Parliament was\n finally demonstrated by the Revolution of 1688 any\n such idea has become obsolete.\"\n\n221\n\nRejecting the above argument, the House of Lords unanimously\nheld that the function of the court was to consider and\napply the enactments of Parliament, and accordingly, in the\ncourse of litigation, it was not lawful to impugn the\nvalidity of a statute by seeking to establish that\nParliament, in passing it, was misled by fraud or otherwise,\nnor might a litigant seek to establish a claim in equity by\nshowing that the other party, by fraudulently misleading\nParliament, had inflicted damage on him; for any\ninvestigation into the manner in which Parliament had\nexercised its function would or might result in an\nadjudication by the courts, bringing about a conflict with\nParliament.\n\n As a result of the infusion of new ideas during the\nRenaissance and the Reformation, the intellectual authority\nof reason again came to be substituted for the spiritual\nauthority of divine law as the basis of natural law. This\nnew or rather resuscitated basis of natural law was laid by\nGrotius (Huigh de Groot) in his \"De jure belli ac Pacis\" -\nthe precursor or of modern public international law.\n\n Reason as the theoretical basis for natural law,\nhowever, once again suffered a reversal at the hand of David\nHume. According to Hume, only knowledge obtained by\nmathematical reasoning was certain; knowledge obtained from\nother sciences being only probable. His theory of justice\nwas that it served both an ethical and a sociological\nfunction. He contended that public utility was the sole\norigin of legal justice and the sole foundation of its\nmerit, and that for a legal system to be useful, it must\nadhere to its rules even though it may cause injustice in\nparticular cases. He did not make a formal analysis of law\nbut distinguished equity or the general system of morality,\nthe legal order, and law, as a body of precepts. According\nto him, the authority of civil law modified the rules of\nnatural justice according to the particular convenience of\neach community.\n\n Blackstone, however, in his \"Commentaries on the Laws\nof England\" had this to say about natural law :\n\n \"This law of nature, being coeval with mankind,\n and dictated by God himself, is of course superior\n in obligation to any other. It is binding over all\n the glove in all countries, and at all times; no\n human laws are of any validity, if contrary to\n this; and such of them as are valid derive all\n their force and all their authority, mediately or\n immediately, from this original.\"\n\n222\n\n In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was a\nreaction against natural law as the basis of law. The French\nRevolution had enthroned reason as a goddess. The excesses\nof the French Revolution, however, led to a reaction against\nthe theory that reason was the basis of law. The utilitarian\nview was that the basis for law was the practical inquiry as\nto what would most conduce to the general benefit. The\nspirit of scientific inquiry which pre-dominated the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries could not favour\nhypotheses which were vague and unprovable. In the twentieth\ncentury, disillusionment with the theory that good could\ncome out of the power of the State and positive law has,\nhowever, once again brought about a revival of interest in\nnatural law.\n\n Apart from providing the subject-matter for\nphilosophical dissertations and speculative theories on the\norigin and attributes of natural law, the concept of natural\nlaw has made invaluable contribution to the development of\npositive law. It helped to transform the rigidity of the jus\ncivile of the Romans into a more equitable system based on\nthe theory of the jus gentium. It provided arguments to both\nsides in the struggle during the Middle Ages between the\nPopes and the Emperors. It inspired in the eighteenth\ncentury the movement for codification of law in order to\nformulate ideas derives from the concept of natural law into\ndetailed rules. England, the idea of natural law and natural\njustices has influenced its law in several respects. The\norigin and development of equity in England owed much to\nnatural law. It also served as the basis for the recognition\nor rejection of a custom. It was looked to for support in\nthe struggle for supremacy which took place between the\njudges and Parliament in the seventeenth century. The\nconcept of natural law and natural rights influenced the\ndrafting of the Constitution of the United States of America\nand many of the amendments made thereto as also the\nConstitutions of its various States. It has provide a basis\nfor much of modern international law and International\nConventions, Covenants and Declarations. Above all, it has\nenriched positive law by introducing into it the principles\nof natural justice, divested of all their philosophical,\nmetaphysical and theological trappings and disassociated\nfrom their identification with, or supposed derivation from,\nnatural law.\n\n Natural justice has been variously defined by different\njudges. A few instances will suffice. In Drew v. Drew and\nLeburn [1855] 2 Macq. 1,8, Lord Craworth defined it as\n\"universal justice\". In James Dunbar Smith v. Her Majesty\nThe Queen\n\n223\n\n[1877-78] 3 App. Cas. 614,623 J.C., Sir Robert P.Collier,\nspeaking for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,\nused the phrase \"the requirements of substantial Justice\",\nwhile in Arthur John Spacmkman v. The Plumstead District\nBoard of Works L.R. [1884-85] 10 App. Case. 229,240, Earl of\nSelborne, L.C., preferred the phrase \"the substantial\nrequirements of justice\". In Vionet and another v. Barrett\nand another [1885] 55 L.J. Q.B. 39,41, Lord Esher, M.R.,\ndefined natural justice as \"the natural sense of what is\nright and wrong\". While, however, deciding Hopkins and\nanother v. Smethwick Local Board of Health L.R.[1890] 24\nQ.B.D. 712,716, Lord Esher, M.R., instead of using the\ndefinition given earlier by him in Vionet and another v.\nBarret and another chose to define natural justice as\n\"fundamental justice\". In Ridge v. Baldwin and others L.R.\n[1963] 1. \nQ.B. 539,578, Harman, L.J., in the Court of Appeal\nequated natural justice with \"fair play of action\", a phrase\nfavoured by Bhagwati, J., in \nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n\n[1978] 2 S.C.R. 621,676. In re.H.K. (An Infant) L.R. [1967]\n2 Q.B. 617,630, lord Parker, C.J., preferred to describe\nnatural justice as a duty to act fairly\".\n In Fair-mount\nInvestment Ltd. v. Secretary of State for the Environment\n[1976] 1 W.L.R. 1255,1265-66, Lord Russell of Killowen\nsomewhat picturesquely described natural justice as \"a fair\ncrack of the whip\". While Geoffrey Lane L.J., in Regina v.\nSecretary of State for Home Affairs, Ex parte Hosenball\n[1977] 1 W.L.R. 766,784, preferred the homely phrase \"common\nfairness\".\n\n \nAs some judges, for instance, Ormond, L.J., in \nLewis v.\nHeffer and others\n [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1061,1076, have found the\nphrase \"natural justice\" to be a highly attractive and\npotent phrase\".\n it may not be out of place, in order to set\nthe balance right, to reproduce a passage, full of robust\ncommon sense and biting Irony, from the judgment of Maugham,\nJ.., in Maclean v. The Workers Union L.R. [1929] 1 Ch.\n602,624. That passage is as follows :\n\n \"Eminent judges have at times used the phrase 'the\n principles of natural justice'. The phrase is, of\n course, used only in a popular sense and must not\n be taken to mean that there is any justice natural\n among men. Among most savages there is no such\n thing as justice in the modern sense. In ancient\n days, a person wronged executed his own justice.\n Amongst our own ancestors, down to the thirteenth\n century, manifest felony, such as that of a\n manslayer taken with his weapon, or a thief with\n the stolen goods, might be\n\n224\n\n punished by summary execution without any form of\n trial. Again every student has heard or\n computation and of or deal; and it is hardly\n necessary to observe that (for example) a system\n of or deal by water in which sinking was the sign\n of innocence and floating the sign of guilt, a\n system which lasted in this country for hundreds\n of years, has little to do with modern ideas of\n justice. It is unnecessary to give further\n illustrations. The truth is that justice is a very\n elaborate conception, the growth of many centuries\n of civilization; and even now the conception\n differs widely in countries usually described as\n civilized.\"\n\n In the Supreme Court of Ireland, Black. J., in William\nGreen v. Isidore J. Blake and others [1948] I.R. 242, after\nreferring to the above passage from the judgment of Maugham,\nJ., proceeded to state (at page 268) :\n\n \"I agree, but what then does it mean? We may, if\n we choose, describe as 'natural' every\n evolutionary advance in our conception of justice.\n But for me, natural justice means no more that\n justice without any epithet. I take the essentials\n of justice to mean those desiderata which, in the\n existing stage of our mental and moral\n development, we regard as essential, in contra-\n distinction from the many extra precautions,\n helpful to justice, but not indispensable to it,\n which, by their rules of evidence and procedure,\n our Courts have made obligatory in actual trials\n before themselves. Many advanced peoples have\n legal systems which do not insist on all these\n extra precaution, yet we would hardly say that\n they disregard the essentials of justice.\"\n\nMegarry, J., also found it necessary to sound a note of\nwarning in Hounslow London Borough Council v. Twickenham\ngarden Developments Ltd. L.R. [1971] Ch. 233, wherein he\nsaid (at page 259) :\n\n \"The principles of natural justice are of wide\n application and great importance, but they must be\n confined within proper limits and not allowed to\n run wild.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n225\n\n Some judges have been faced with the contention as\nMaugham, L.J., was in Errington and others v. Minister of\nHealth L.R. [1935] 1 K.B. 249,280, that \"the principles of\nnatural justice are vague and difficult to ascertain\".\nReferred to such contentions Lord Reid said in Ridge v.\nBaldwin and others L.R. [1964] A.C. 40, on appeal from L.R.\n[1963] 1 Q.B. 539, (at page 64-65):\n\n \"In modern times opinions have sometimes been\n expressed to the effect that natural justice is so\n vague as to be practically meaningless. But I\n would regard these as tainted by the perennial\n fallacy that because something cannot be cut and\n dried or nicely weighed or measured therefore it\n does not exist. The idea of negligence is equally\n insusceptible of exact definition, but what a\n reasonable man would regard as fair procedure in\n particular circumstances and what he would regard\n as negligence in particular circumstances are\n equally capable of serving as tests in law, and\n natural justice as it has been interpreted in the\n courts in much more definite than that. It appears\n to me that one reason why the authorities on\n natural justice have been found difficult to\n reconcile is that insufficient attention has been\n paid to the great difference between various kinds\n of cases in which it has been sought to apply the\n principle.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n How then have the principles of natural justice been\ninterpreted in the courts and within what limits are they to\nbe confined? Over the years by a process of judicial\ninterpretation two rules have been evolved as representing\nthe principles of natural justice in judicial process,\nincluding therein quasi-judicial and administrative\nprocesses. They constitute the basic elements of a fair\nhearing, having their roots in the innate sense of man for\nfair play and justice which is not the preserve of any\nparticular race or country but is shared in common by all\nmen. The first rule is \"nemo judex in causa sua\" or \"nemo\ndebet esse judex in propria causa\" as stated in 12 Co. Rep.\n114, that is, no man shall be a judge in his own cause\".\nCoke used the form \"aliouis non debt esse judex in propria\ncausa quia non potest esse judex et pars\" (Co. Litt. 141a),\nthat is, \"no man ought to be a judge in his own cause,\nbecause he cannot act as a judge and at the same time be a\nparty\". The form \"nemo potest esse simul actor et judex\",\nthat is, \"no one can be at once suitor and judge\" is also at\ntimes used. The second rule - and\n\n226\n\nthat is the rule with which are concerned in these Appeals\nand Writ Petitions - is \"audi alteram partem\". that is,\n\"hear the other side\". At times and particularly in\ncontinental countries the form \"audietur et altera pars\" is\nused, meaning very much the same thing. A corollary has been\ndeduced from the above two rules and particularly the audi\nalteram partem rule, namely, \"qui alliquid statuerit parte\ninaudita altera, aequum licet dixerit, haud aequum fecerit\".\nthat is, \"he who shall decide anything without the other\nside having been heard, although he may have said what is\nright, will not have done what is right\" (see Boswell's\ncase) [1606] 6 Co. Rep. 48b,52a, or, in other words, as it\nis now expressed, \"justice should not only be done but\nshould manifestly be seen to be done.\"\n\n The above two rules and their corollary are neither new\nnor were they the discovery of English judges. They were\nrecognized in may civilizations and over many centuries.\nRoman law recognized the need for a judge to be impartial\nand not to have a personal interest in the case before him\n(Digest V.1.17) and Tacitus in his \"Dialogus\" referred to\nthis principle. Under Roman law a judge who heard a cause in\nwhich he had an interest was liable as on a quasi-delict to\nthe party prejudiced thereby (Justinian's Institutes IV, 5\npr.;as also Justinian's Codex III, 5, 1). Even the Kiganda\ntribesmen of Buganda have an old proverb which literally\ntranslated means \"a monkey does not decide an affair of the\nforest (see \"law and Justice in Buganda\" by E.S. Haydo,\np.333). The requirement of hearing both sides before\narriving at a decision was part of the judicial oath in\nAthens. It also formed the subject-matter of a proverb which\nwas often referred to or quoted by Greek playwrights, as for\ninstance, by Aritophanes in his comedy \"The Wasps\" and\nEuripides in his tragedies \"Heracleidae\" and \"Andromache\",\nand by Greek orators, for instance, Demosthenes in his\nspeech \"De Corona\". Among the Romans, Seneca in his tragedy\n\"Medea\" referred to the injustice of coming to a decision\nwithout a full hearing. In fact, the corollary drawn in\nBoswell's case is taken from a line in Seneca's \"Medea\". In\nthe Gospel according to St. John(vii,51), Nicodemus asked\nthe chief priests and the Pharisees, \"Doth our law judge any\nman, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\" Even the\nproverb and songs of African tribesmen, for instance, of the\nLozi tribe in Barotseland refer to this rule (see \"The\nJudicia Process Among the Barotse Northern Rhodesia\" by Max\nGluckman, p.102.)\n The two rules \"nemo judex in causa sua\" and \"audi\nalteram\n\n227\n\npartem\" and their corollary that justice should not only be\ndone but should manifestly be seen to be done have been\nrecognized from early days in English courts. References to\nthem are to be found in the Year Books - a title preferred\nto the alternative one of \"Books of Years and Terms\"- which\nwere a regular series, with a few gaps, of law reports in\nAnglo-norman or Norman-French or a mixture of English,\nNorman-French and French, which had then become the court\nlanguage, from the 1270s to 1535 or, as printed after the\ninvention of the printing press, from 1290 to 1535, that is,\nfrom the time of Edward II to Henry VIII. The above\nprinciples of natural justice came to be firmly established\nover the course of centuries and have become a part of the\nlaw of the land. Both in England and in India they apply to\ncivil as well as to criminal cases and to the exercise of\njudicial, quasi-judicial and administrative powers. The\nexpression \"natural justice\" is now so well understood in\nEngland that it has been used without any definition in\nstatutes of Parliament, for example, in section 3(10) of the\nForeign Compensation Act, 1969, and section 6(13) of the\nTrade Union and Labour Reforms Act, 1974, which was later\nrepealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment)\nAct, 1976. These rules of natural justice have been\nrecognized and given effect to in many countries and\ndifferent systems of law. They have now received\ninternational recognition by being enshrined in \nArticle 10\n\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted and\nproclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations by\nResolution 217A (III) of December 10,1948. \nArticle 6\n of the\nEuropean Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms which came into force on September 3,\n1953, and \nArticle 14\n of the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights adopted by the General Assembly\nResolution 2200A (XXI) of December 16, 1966, which came into\nforce on March 23, 1976.\n\n \nArticle 14\n does not set out in express terms either of\nthe above two well-established rules of natural justice. The\nquestion which then arises is \"Whether the rules of natural\njustice form part of \nArticle 14\n and, if so, how?\"\n\n \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution provides as\n follows:\n\n \"14. Equality before law. - The State shall not\n deny to any person equality before the law or the\n equal protection of the laws within the territory\n of India.\"\n\n228\n\nArticle 14\n thus contains an express Constitutional\ninjunction against the State as defined in \nArticle 12\n\nprohibiting the State from denying to any person(1) equality\nbefore the law, or (2) the equal protection of the laws.\nNeither of these two concepts are new. They are based upon\nsimilar provisions in other Constitutions. One instance is\n\nsection 40(1)\n of the Constitution of Eire of 1937, which\noccurs in the Chapter entitled Fundamental Rights in that\nConstitution. The Constitution of Eire begins on a strong\nreligious note. It starts by stating :\n\n \"In the name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom\n is all authority and to Whom, as our final end,\n all actions both of men and States must be\n referred.\n\n We, the people of Eire,\n Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our\n Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our\n fathers through centuries of tiral, ...... \".\n\n Section 40(1) of that Constitution provides as follows\n:\n\n \"All Citizens shall, as human persons, be held\n equal before the law.\n\n This shall not be held to mean that the State\n shall not in its enactments have due regard to\n differences of capacity, physical and moral, and\n of social functions.\"\n\nAnother instance is \nArticle 3(1)\n of the Constitution of the\nFederal Republic of Germany of 1948 which states:\n\n \"All persons shall be equal before the law.\" Yet\nanother instance is \nsection 1\n of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe Constitution of the United States of America which\nreads:\n\n \"All persons born or naturalized in the United\n States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\n are citizens of the United States and of the State\n wherein they reside. No State shall make or\n enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges\n or immunities of citizens of the United States,\n nor shall any State deprive any person of life,\n liberty, or property, without due process of law,\n nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\n equal protection of the laws.\"\n\n229\n\nConstitution of some other countries also have similar\nprovisions but as these Constitutions have suffered\npolitical vicissitudes, it is unnecessary to refer to them.\nProvisions similar to \nArticle 14\n are to be found in\nInternational Charters and Conventions. Thus, \nArticle 7\n of\nthe Universal Declaration Human Rights of 1948, provides as\nfollows:\n\n \"All are equal before the law and are entitled\n without any discrimination to equal protection of\n the law .....\"\n\n \nArticle 14\n is divided into two parts. In Re The\nSpecial Courts Bill, 1978 [1979] 2 S.C.R. 476, Chandrachud,\nC.J., describe the two parts of \nArticle 14\n as follows (at\npage 534):\n\n \"The first part of \narticle 14\n, which was adopted\n from the Irish Constitution, is a declaration of\n equality of the civil rights of all persons within\n the territories of India. It enshrines a basic\n principle of republicanism. The second part, which\n is a corollary of the first and is based on the\n last clause of the first section of the Fourteenth\n Amendment of the American Constitution enjoins\n that equal protection shall be secured to all such\n persons in the enjoyment of their rights and\n liberties without discrimination of favoritism. It\n is a pledge of the protection of equal laws, that\n is, laws that operate alike on all persons under\n like circumstances.\"\n\n \nArticle 14\n contains a guarantee of equality before the\nlaw to all persons and a protection to them against\ndiscrimination by any law. Sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of\n\nArticle 13\n defines law as follows:\n\n \"'law' includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law,\n rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage\n having in the territory of India the force of\n law\".\n\nWhat \nArticle 14\n forbids is discrimination by law, that is,\ntreating persons similarly circumstanced differently or\ntreating those not similarly circumstanced in the same way\nor, as has been pithily put, treating equals as unequals and\nunequals as equals. \nArticle 14\n prohibits hostile\nclassification by law and is directed against discriminatory\nclass legislation. The propositions deducible from decisions\nof this court on this point have\n\n230\n\nbeen set out in the form of thirteen propositions in the\njudgment of Chandrachud, C.J., in In Re The Special Courts\nBill, 1978. The first of these propositions which describes\nthe nature of the two parts of \nArticle 14\n has been extracted\nearlier. We are not concerned in these Appeals and Writ\nPetitions with the other propositions set out in that\njudgment. In early days, this Court was concerned with\ndiscriminatory and hostile class legislation and it was to\nthis aspect of \nArticle 14\n that its attention was directed.\nAs fresh thinking began to take place on the scope an anoint\nof \nArticle 14\n, new dimensions to this guarantee of equality\nbefore the law and of the equal protection of the laws\nemerged and were recognized by this Court. It was realized\nthat to treat one person differently from another when there\nwas no rational basis for doing so would be arbitrary act\nthus discriminatory. Arbitrariness can take many forms and\nshapes but whatever form or shape it takes, it is none the\nless discrimination. It also became apparent that to treat a\npersons or a class of persons unfairly would be an arbitrary\nact amounting to discrimination forbidden by \nArticle 14.\n\nSimilarly, this Court, recognized that to treat a person in\nviolation of the principles of natural justice would amount\nto arbitrary and discriminatory treatment and would violate\nthe guarantee given by \nArticle 14.\n\n \nIn \nState of Andhra Pradesh and another v. Nalla Raja\nReddy and others\n [1967] 3 S.C.R. 28, Subba Rao, C.J.,\nspeaking for the Court, said (at page 46):\n\n \"Official arbitrariness is more subversive of the\n doctrine of equality than statutory\n discrimination. In respect of a statutory\n discrimination one knows where he stands, but the\n wand of official arbitrariness can be waved in all\n directions indiscriminately.\"\n\n \nWhile considering \nArticle 14\n and \nArticle 16\n, Bhagwati,\nJ., in \nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu and another\n\n[1974] 2 S.C.R. 348, in a passage which has become a classic\nsaid (at page 386):\n\n \"\nArticle 14\n is the genus while \nArticle 16\n is a\n species, \nArticle 16\n gives effect to the doctrine\n of equality in all matters relating to public\n employment. The basic principle which, therefore,\n informs both \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n is equality and\n inhibition against discrimination. Now, what is\n the content and reach of this great equalizing\n principle? It is a founding\n\n231\n\n faith, to use the words of Bose, J., 'a way of\n life', and it must not be subjected to a narrow\n pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot\n countenance any attempt to truncate its all-\n embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be\n to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a\n dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions\n and it cannot be 'cribbed, cabined and confined'\n within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a\n positivistic point of view, equality is qutithetic\n to arbitrariness. In fact equality and\n arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to\n the rule of law in a republic while the other, to\n the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where\n an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it\n is unequal both according to political logic and\n constitutional law and is therefore violative of\n \nArticle 14\n, and if it effects any matter relating\n to public employment, it is also violative of\n \nArticle 16.\n \nArticle 14\n and \n16\n strike at\n arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness\n and equality of treatment. They require that State\n action must be based on valent relevant principles\n applicable alike to all similarly situate and it\n must not be guided by any extraneous or Irrelevant\n coordinations because that would be denial of\n equality. \nWhere the operative reason for State\n action, as distinguished from motive inducing from\n the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and\n relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of\n permissible considerations, it would amount of\n mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16.\n Mala fide exercise of power\n and arbitrariness are different lethal radiations\n emanating from the same vice : in fact the latter\n comprehends the former. Both are inhibited by\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16.\"\n (Emphasis supplied)\n Bhagwati, J., reaffirmed in \nManeka Gandhi\n's case what\nhe had said in \nRoyappa\n's case in these words (at page 673-\n\n74):\n\n \n\"Now, the question immediately arises as to what\n is the requirement of \nArticle 14 :\n what is the\n content and reach of the great equalising\n principle enunciated in this article? There can be\n no doubt that it is a founding faith of the\n Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which\n rests securely the foundation of our\n\n232\n\n democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not\n be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or\n lexicographic approach. No attempt should be made\n to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning\n for, to do so would be to violate its activist\n magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many\n aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned\n within traditional and doctrinaire limits. We must\n reiterate here what was pointed out by the\n majority in \nE.P.Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu &\n Another\n namely, that 'from a positivistic point of\n view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In\n fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies;\n one belongs to the rule of law in a republic,\n while the other, to the whim and caprice of an\n absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is\n implicit in it that it is unequal both according\n to political logic and constitutional law and is\n there fore violative of Article.' \nArticle 14\n\n strikes at arbitrariness in State action and\n ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The\n principle of reasonableness, which legally as well\n as philosophically, is a essential element of\n equality or non-arbitrariness pervades \nArticle 14\n\n like a brooding omnipresence.......\". (Emphasis\n supplied)\nIn the course of his judgment in the same case Bhagwati, J.,\nfurther said (at pages 676-7):\n\n \"Now, if this be the test of applicability of the\n doctrine of natural justice, there can be no\n distinction between a quasi-judicial function and\n an administrative function for this purpose. The\n aim of both administrative inquiry as well as\n quasi-judicial inquiry is to arrive at a just\n decision and if a rule of natural justice is\n calculated to secure justice, or to put it\n negatively, to prevent miscarriage of justice, it\n is difficult to see why it should be applicable to\n quasi-judicial inquiry and not to administrative\n inquiry. It must logically apply to both. On what\n principle can distinction be made between one and\n the other? Can it be said that the requirement of\n 'fair play in action' in any the less in an\n administrative inquiry than in a quasi-judicial\n one? Sometimes an unjust decision in\n administrative inquiry may have far more serious\n consequences than\n\n233\n\n a decision in a quasi-judicial inquiry and hence\n the rules of natural justice must apply equally in\n an administrative inquiry which entails civil\n consequences.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n In Ajay Hasia etc. v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi and\nothers etc. [1981] 2 S.C.R. 79, the same learned Judge,\nspeaking for the Court, said (at pages 100-101):\n \"The true scope and ambit of \nArticle 14\n has been\n the subject matter of numerous decisions and it is\n not necessary to make any detailed reference to\n them. It is sufficient to state that the content\n and reach of \nArticle 14\n must not be confused with\n the doctrine of classification. Unfortunately, in\n the early stages of the evolution of our\n constitutional law, \nArticle 14\n came to be\n identified with the doctrine of classification\n because the view taken was that Article forbids\n discrimination and there would be no\n discrimination where the classification making the\n differentia fulfils two conditions, namely, (i)\n that the classification is founded on an\n intelligible differentia which distinguishes\n persons or things that are grouped together from\n others left out of the group, and (ii) that\n differentia has a rational relation to the object\n sought to be achieved by the impugned legislative\n or executive action.\"\n\n The principles of natural justice have thus come to be\nrecognized as being a part of the guarantee contained in\n\nArticle 14\n because of the new and dynamic interpretation\ngiven by this Court to the concept of equality which is the\nsubject-matter of that Article. Shortly put, the syllogism\nruns thus violation of a rule of natural justice results in\narbitrariness which is the same as discrimination; where\ndiscrimination is the result of state action, it is a\nviolation of \nArticle 14:\n therefore, a violation of a\nprinciple of natural justice by a State action is a\nviolation of \nArticle 14.\n \nArticle 14\n, however, is not the\nsole repository of the principles of natural justice. What\nit does is to guarantee that any law or State action\nviolating them will be struck down. The principles of\nnatural justice, however, apply not only to legislation and\nState action but also where any tribunal, authority or body\nmen, not coming within the definition\n\n234\n\nof \"State\" in \nArticle 12\n, is charged with the duty of\ndeciding a matter. In such a case, the principles of natural\njustice require that it must decide such matter fairly and\nimpartially.\n\n \nThe rule of natural justice with which we are concerned\nin these Appeals and Writ Petitions, namely, the audi\nalteram partem rule, in its fullest amplitude means that a\nperson against whom an order to his prejudice may be passed\nshould be informed of the allegations and charges against\nhim, be given an opportunity of submitting his explanation\nthereto, have the right to know the evidence, both oral or\ndocumentary, by which the matter is proposed to be decided\nagainst him, and to inspect the documents which are relied\nupon for the purpose of being used against him, to have the\nwitnesses who are to give evidence against him examined in\nhis presence and have the right to cross-examine them, and\nto lead his own evidence, both oral and documentary, in his\ndefence. The process of a fair hearing need not, however,\nconform to the judicial process in a court of law, because\njudicial adjudication of causes involves a number of\ntechnical rules of procedure and evidence which are\nunnecessary and not required for the purpose of a fair\nhearing within the meaning of audi alteram partem rule in a\nquasi-judicial or administrative inquiry. If we look at\nclause (2) of \nArticle 311\n in the light of what is stated\nabove, it will be apparent that clause is merely an express\nstatement of the audi alteram partem rule which is\nimplicitly made part of the guarantee contained in \nArticle\n14\n as a result of the interpretation placed upon that\nArticle by recent decisions of this Court. Clauses (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n requires that before a government servant is\ndismissed, removed or reduced in rank, an inquiry must be\nheld in which he is informed of the charges against him and\ngiven a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of\nthose charges. The nature of the hearing to be given to a\ngovernment servant under clauses (2) of \nArticle 311\n has been\nelaborately set out by this Court in Khem chand's case in\nthe passages from the judgment extracted above. Though that\ncase related to the original clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n, the\nsame applies to the present clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n except\nfor the fact that now a government servant has no right to\nmake any representation against the penalty proposed to be\nimposed upon him but, as pointed out earlier, in the case of\n\nSuresh Koshy George v. The University of Kerala and others\n,\nsuch an opportunity is not the requirement of the principles\nof natural justice and as held in \nAssociated Cement\nCompanies Ltd. v. T. C. Shrivastava and others\n neither the\nordinary law of the land nor industrial law requires such an\nopportunity to be given.\n \nThe\n\n235\n\nOpportunity of showing cause against the proposed penalty\nwas only the result of the interpretation placed by the\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council in \nLall\n's Case upon\n\nsection 240(3)\n of the Government of India, 1935, which was\naccepted by this Court in \nKhem Chand\n's Case.\n If, therefore,\nan inquiry held against a government servant under clause\n(2) of Article 311 is unfair or biased or has been conducted\nin such a manner as not to give him a fair or reasonable\nopportunity to defend himself, undoubtedly, the principles\nof natural justice would be violated, but in such a case the\norder of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank would be\nheld to be bad as contravening the express provisions of\nclause (2) of Article 311 and there will be no scope for\nhaving recourse to Article 14 for the purpose of\ninvalidating it.\n\n Though the two rules of natural justice, namely,\nnemojudex in causa sua em audi alteram part, have now a\ndefinite meaning and connotation in law and their content\nand implications are well understood and firmly established\nthe are none the less not statutory rules. Each of these\nrules yields to and changes with the exigencies of different\nsituations. They do not apply in the same manner to\nsituations which are not alike. These rules are not case in\na rigid mould nor can they be put in a legal strait-jacket.\nThey are not immutable but flexible. These rules can be\nadapted and modified by statutes and statutory rules and\nalso by the Constitution of the Tribunal which has to decide\nparticular matter and rules by which such Tribunal is\ngoverned. There is no difference in this respect between the\nlaw in England and in India. It is unnecessary to refer to\nvarious English decisions which have held so. It will\nsuffice to reproduce what Ormond, L.J., said in Norwest\nHolst Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Trade and others L.R.\n[1978]1 Ch.201 (at page 227):\n\n \"The House of Lords and this Court have repeatedly\n emphasised that the ordinary principles of natural\n justice must be kept flexible and must be adapted\n to the circumstances prevailing in any particular\n case. One of the most important of these\n circumstances, as has been said throughout the\n argument, is, of course, the provisions of the\n statute in question: in this case \nsections 164\n and\n \n165\n of the Companies Act 1948.\"\n\n \nIn India, in \nSuresh Koshy George v. The University of\nKerala and others\n this Court observed (at page 322):\n\n236\n\n \"The question whether the requirements of natural\n justice have been met by the procedure adopted in\n a given case must depend to a great extent on the\n facts and circumstances of the case in point, the\n constitution of the Tribunal and the rules under\n which it functions.\"\n\n After referring to this case, in A.K. Kraipak and\nothers etc. v. Union of India and others [1970] 1 S.C.R.\n457, Hegde, J., observed (at page 469):\n\n \"What particular rule of natural justice should\n apply to a given case must depend to a great\n extent on the facts and circumstances of that\n case, the framework of the law under which the\n inquiry is held and the constitution of the\n Tribunal or body of persons appointed for that\n purpose. Whenever a complaint is made before a\n court that some principle of natural justice had\n been contravened the court has to decide whether\n the observance of that rule was necessary for a\n just decision on the facts of that case.\"\n\n \nAgain in \nUnion of India v. Col\n. J.N. Sinha and another\n[1971] 1 S.C.R. 791, it was said (at page 794-5):\n\n \n\"As observed by this Court in \nKraipak and Ors. v.\n Union of India\n the aim of rules of natural justice\n is to secure justice or to put it negatively to\n prevent miscarriage of justice. These rules can\n operate only in areas not covered by any law\n validly made. In other words they do not supplant\n the law but supplement it. It is true that if a\n statutory provision can be read consistently with\n the principles of natural justice, the courts\n should do so because it must be presumed that the\n legislatures and the statutory authorities intend\n to act in accordance with the principles of\n natural justice. But if on the other hand a\n statutory provision either specifically or by\n necessary implication excluded the application of\n any or all the principles of natural justice then\n the court cannot ignore the mandate of the\n legislature or the statutory authority and read\n into the concerned provision the principles of\n natural justice. Whether the exercise of a power\n conferred should be made in accordance with any of\n the principles of natural\n\n237\n\n justice or not depends upon the express words of\n the provision conferring the power, the nature of\n the power conferred, the purpose for which it is\n conferred and the effect of the exercise of that\n power\"\n\n \nIn \nSwadeshi Cotton Mills v. Union of India\n [1981] 2\nS.C.R. 533, Chinnappa Reddy, J., in his dissenting judgment\nsummarized the position in law on this point as follows (at\npage 591):\n\n \"The principles of natural justice have taken deep\n root in the judicial conscience of our people,\n nurtured by Binapani, Kraipak, Mohinder Singh\n Gill, Maneka Gandhi etc. etc. They are now\n considered so fundamental as to be 'implicit in\n the concept of ordered liberty' and, therefore,\n implicit in every decision making function, call\n it judicial, quasi judicial or administrative.\n Where authority functions under a statute and the\n statute provides for the observance of the\n principles of natural justice in a particular\n manner, natural justice will have to be observed\n in that manner and in no other. No wider right\n than that provided by statute can be claimed nor\n can the right be narrowed. Where the statute is\n silent about the observance of the principles of\n natural justice such statutory silence is taken to\n imply compliance with the principles of natural\n justice. The implication of natural justice being\n presumptive it may be excluded by express words of\n statute or by necessary intendment. Where the\n conflict is between the public interest and the\n private interest, the presumption rust necessarily\n be weak and may, therefore, be readily displaced.\"\n\n \n(Emphasis supplied.)\n Not only, therefore, can the principles of natural\njustice be modified but in exceptional cases they can even\nbe excluded. There are well-defined exceptions to the nemo\njudex in causa sua rule as also to the audi alteram partem\nrule. The nemo judex in causa sua rule is subject to the\ndoctrine of necessity and yields to it as pointed out by\nthis Court in \nJ.Mohapatra & Co. and another v. State of\nOrissa and another\n [1985] 1 S.C.R. 322,334-5. So far as the\naudi alteram partem rule is concerned, both in England and\nin India, it is well established that where a right to a\nprior notice and an opportunity to be heard before an order\nis passed would obstruct the taking of prompt action, such a\n\n238\n\nright can be excluded.\n \nThis right can also be excluded where\nthe nature of the action to be taken, its object and purpose\nand the scheme of the relevant statutory provisions warrant\nits exclusion; nor can the audi alteram partem rule be\ninvoked if importing it would have the effect of paralysing\nthe administrative process or where the need for promptitude\nor the urgency of taking action so demands, as pointed out\nin \nManeka Gandhi\n's case at page 681. If legislation and the\nnecessities of a situation can exclude the principles of\nnatural justice including the audi alteram partem rule, a\nfortiorari so can a provision or the Constitution, for a\nConstitutional provision has a far greater and all-pervading\nsanctity than a statutory provision. In the present case,\nclause (2) of \nArticle 311\n is expressly excluded by the\nopening words of the second proviso and particularly its\nkey-words this clause shall not apply. As pointed out above,\nclause (2) of \nArticle 311\n embodies in express words the audi\nalteram partem rule. This principle of natural justice\nhaving been expressly excluded by a Constitutional\nprovision, namely, the second proviso to clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n, there is no scope for reintroducing it by a\nside-door to provide once again the same inquiry which the\nConstitutional provision has expressly prohibited. Where a\nclause of the second proviso is applied on an extraneous\nground or a ground having no relation to the situation\nenvisaged in that clause, the action in so applying it would\nbe mala fide, and, therefore, void. In such a case the\ninvalidating factor may be referable to \nArticle 14.\n This is,\nhowever, the only scope which \nArticle 14\n can have in\nrelation to the second proviso. but to hold that once the\nsecond proviso is properly applied and clause (2) of \nArticle\n311\n excluded, \nArticle 14\n will step in to take the place of\nclause (2) would be to nullify the effect of the opening\nwords of the second proviso and thus frustrate the intention\nof the makers of the Constitution. The second proviso is\nbased on public policy and is in public interest and for\npublic good and the Constitution - makers who inserted it in\n\nArticle 311(2)\n were the best persons to decide whether such\nan exclusionary provision should be there and the situations\nin which this provision should apply.\n\n In this connection, it must be remembered that a\ngovernment servant is not wholly without any opportunity.\nRules made under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n or under Acts\nreferable to that Article generally provide for a right of\nappeal except in those cases where the order of dismissal,\nremoval or reduction in rank is passed by the President or\nthe Governor of a State because they being the highest\nConstitutional functionaries, there can be no\n\n239\n\nhigher authority to which an appeal can lie from an order\npassed by one of them. Thus, where the second proviso\napplies, though there is no prior opportunity to a\ngovernment servant to defend himself against the charges\nmade against him he has the opportunity to show in an\nappeal filed by him that the charges made against him are\nnot true. This would be a sufficient compliance with the\nrequirements of natural justice. \nIn \nManeka Gandhi\n's case and\nin \nLiberty Oil Mills and others v. Union of India and others\n\n[1984] 3 S.C.C. 465 the right to make a representation\nafter an action was taken was held to be a sufficient\nremedy, and an appeal is a much wider and more effective\nremedy than a right of making a representation.\n\n \nIn support of the contention that even though the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n excludes any right of\nhearing, such a right is none the less available under\n\nArticle 14\n, reliance was placed on behalf of the government\nservants upon the case of \nRustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of\nIndia\n [1970] 3 S.C.R. 530. In our opinion, this reliance is\nmisplaced.\n \nOne of the questions which arose \nin that case\n was\nthe correctness of the majority view in \nA.K.Gopalan v. The\nState of Madras\n [1950] S.C.R. 88.\n In Gopalan's case it was\nheld by the majority that the law of preventive detention\ndid not have to satisfy the combined test of Articles 19 and\n\n21. According to the majority view, it was the form of the\nState action which would determine which Article in the\nChapter on fundamental Rights would be attracted, and that\nin respect of preventive detention \nArticle 21\n protected\nsubstantive rights by requiring a procedure and \nArticle 22\n\nlaid down the minimum rules of procedure which even\nParliament could not abrogate or overlook. Fazal Ali, J., in\nhis dissenting judgment, however, took the view that\npreventive detention was a direct violation of a sub-clause\n\n(d) of clause (1) of \nArticle 19\n, even if a narrow\nconstruction were to be placed upon that sub-clause, and a\nlaw relating to preventive detention was, therefore. subject\nto such limited judicial review as was permitted by clause\n(5) of \nArticle 19.\n \nIn R.Cooper's case the majority view in\n\nGopalan\n's case was overruled.\n \nIn \nSambbu Nath Sarkar v. The\nState of West Bengal & Ors.\n [1974] 1 S.C.R. 1, after\nreferring to both these cases, this Court observed (at page\n\n24) :\n\n \"In R.C.Cooper v. Union of India the aforesaid\n premise of the majority in Gopalan was disapproved\n and therefore it no longer holds the field. \nThough\n Cooper\n's case dealt with the inter-relationship of\n \nArticle 19\n and \nArticle 31\n, the basic approach to\n construing the\n\n240\n\n fundamental rights guaranteed in the different\n provisions of the Constitution adopted in this\n case held the major premise of the majority in\n Gopalan to be incorrect.\"\n\n \nIn \nHardhan Saha and another v. The State of West Bengal\nand others\n [1975] 1 S.C.R. 832, this Court held that a law\nwhich provided for preventive detention was to be tested\nwith regard to its reasonableness with reference to Article\n\n19. This view was reaffirmed in \nKhudiram Das v. The State of\nWest Bengal and Others\n [1975] 2 S.C.R. 832.\n \nAll these\ndecisions were again examined in \nManeka Gandhi\n's Case. In\nthat case, an order under clause (c) of sub-section (3) of\n\nsection 10\n of the Passports Act, 1967, impounding the\npetitioner's passport was impugned inter alia on the ground\nthat it violated the petitioner's Fundamental Right under\nsub-clauses (a) and (g) of clause (1) of \nArticle 19\n and\n\nArticle 21\n and also under \nArticle 14\n because it was made in\nviolation of the principles of natural justice inasmuch as\nthe petitioner had not been heard before these impugned\norder was passed. After referring to various cases Beg,\nC.J., said (at page 648) :\n\n \"Articles dealing with different fundamental\n rights contained in Part III of the Constitution\n do not represent entirely separate streams of\n rights which do not mingle at many points. They\n are all parts of an integrated scheme in the\n Constitution. Their waters must mix to constitute\n that grand flow of unimpeded and impartial Justice\n (social, economic and political), Freedom (not\n only of thought, expression, belief, faith and\n worship, but also of association, movement,\n vocation or occupation as well as of acquisition\n and possession of reasonable property), of\n Equality (of status and of opportunity, which\n imply absence of unreasonable or unfair\n discrimination between individuals, groups and\n classes), and of Fraternity(assuring dignity of\n the individual and the unity of the nation), which\n our Constitution visualises. Isolation of various\n aspects of human freedom, for purposes of their\n protection, is neither realistic nor beneficial\n but would defeat the very objects of such\n protection.\"\n\nThe question in \nGopalan\n's case and \nCooper\n's case was whether\nparticular Articles guaranting certain Fundamental Rights\n\n241\n\noperated exclusively without having any inter-relation with\nany other Article in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. This\nis not the question before us. Neither \nArticle 19\n or 21\nexcludes the operation of the other Articles in Part III of\nthe Constitution.\n \nWhere however, an Article in the\nConstitution expressly excludes the application of certain\nFundamental Rights, the view taken in \nCooper\n's case and the\nother cases which followed it, namely, that the Articles in\nthe Chapter on Fundamental Rights do not operate in\nisolation, cannot apply. \nArticle 13\n invalidates any law\nwhich violates any of the Fundamental Rights. \nArticle 31A(1)\n\nprovides that \"Notwithstanding anything contained in \narticle\n13\n, no law providing for ..... shall be deemed to be void on\nthe ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or\nabridges any of the rights conferred by \narticle 14\n and\n\narticle 19\".\n Under \nArticle 31B\n, none of the Acts and\nRegulations specified in the Ninth schedule to the\nConstitution nor any of the provisions thereof are to be\ndeemed to be void on the ground that such Act, Regulation or\nprovision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any\nof the rights conferred by any provisions of Part III.\n\nArticle 31C\n provides that \"Notwithstanding anything\ncontained in \nArticle 13\n, no law giving effect to the policy\nof the State towards securing . . . shall be deemed to be\nvoid on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes\naway or abridges any of the rights conferred by \narticle 14\n\nor \narticle 19 .\n . . \". Gan it then be contended in face of\nthese express provisions in the Constitution that none the\nless \nArticle 14\n will apply to the provisions of a law\nspecified in \nArticle 31A(1)\n or 31B or 31C?\n Clause(2) of\n\nArticle 311\n is an express statement of what the right of a\nfair hearing guaranteed by \nArticle 14\n would require and by\nthe opening words of the second proviso to that clause that\nright is expressly taken away, and R.C.Cooper's case cannot\nbe invoked to reintroduce that right on the ground that it\nflows by implication from \nArticle 14.\n If the contention of\nthe petitioner that in all cases there must be a right of\nhearing before an order is made to a person's prejudice were\ncorrect, the result would be startling and anomalous. For\ninstance inspite of \nArticle 21\n \n& 22\n no person can be taken\nin preventive detention unless he has been first given an\nopportunity of showing cause against the proposed action.\nResults such as these would make a mockery of the provisions\nof the Constitution.\n\n The majority view in Gopalan's case was buried in\nK.C.Cooper's case; its burial service was read in Sambhu\nNath Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal and others, Hardhan\nSaha and another v.\n\n242\n\nThe State of West Bengal and others and Khudiram Das v. The\nState of West Bengal & Others. \nand its funeral oration was\ndelivered in \nManeka Gandhi\n's case. Let us hope and pray that\nthe ghost of that majority view does not at some future time\nrise from its grave and stand, clanking its chains, seeking\nto block the onward march of our country to progress,\nprosperity and the establishment of a Welfare State. But\nnone the less what was buried was the theory of\nexclusiveness of each Fundamental Right operating separately\nand without having any inter-relation with other Fundamental\nRights.\n The decisions in R.C.Cooper's case and the other\ncases which followed it, however, will not apply where a\nFundamental Rights (including the audi alteram partem rule\ncomprehended within the guarantee of \nArticle 14\n) is\nexpressly excluded by the Constitution itself. Here, we must\nnot forget the warning given by Megarry, J.,in Houslow\nLondon Borough Council v. Tickenhan Garden Developments Ltd.\nthat the principles of natural justice must be confined\nwithin their proper limits and not allowed to run wild. The\nconcept of natural justice is a magnificent thoroughbred on\nwhich this nation gallops forwards towards its proclaimed\nand let us pray its destines goal of \"JUSTICE, social,\neconomic and political.\" This thoroughbred must not be\nallowed to turn into a wild and unruly horse, careering off\nwhere it lists, unsaddling its rider, and bursting into\nfields where the sign \"no pasaran\" is put up.\n\n Service Rules and the Second Proviso - Challappan's\nCase\n Rules made under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n or under\nActs referable to that Article very often reproduced in\nwhole or in part the provisions of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n either in the same or substantially the same\nlanguage or with certain variations. Such variations at\ntimes confer or have been interpreted to confer an\nopportunity of hearing to a government servant which is\nexcluded by the second proviso. Three such rules are\ninvolved in the matters before us, namely, Rule 14 of the\nRailway Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968\n(hereinafter referred to in short as the \"Railway Servants\nRules ), Rule 19 of the Central Civil Services\n(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965\n(hereinafter referred to in short as the \"Civil Services\nRules\") and Rule 37 of the Central Industrial Security Force\nRules, 1969 (hereinafter referred to in short as \"the CISF\nRules\"). It was submitted on behalf of the government\nservants that though an Act or rule restricting or taking\naway any safe guard provided by clauses (1) and (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n would be void, different considerations would\napply when such an Act or rule liberalizes the exclusionary\neffect of the second proviso.\n\n243\n\n It is not possible to accept this submission. The\nopening words of \nArticle 309\n make that Article expressly\n\"Subject to the provisions of this Constitution\". Rules made\nunder the proviso to \nArticle 309\n or under Acts referable to\nthat Article must, therefore, be made subject to the\nprovisions of the Constitution if they are to be valid.\n\nArticle 310(1)\n which embodies the pleasure doctrine is a\nprovision contained in the Constitution. Therefore, rules\nmade under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n or under Acts\nreferable to that Article are subject to \nArticle 310(1)\n By\nthe opening words of \nArticle 310(1)\n the pleasure doctrine\ncontained therein operates \"Except as expressly provided by\nthis Constitution\". \nArticle 311\n is an express provision of\nthe Constitution. Therefore, rules made under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\n or under Acts referable to \nArticle 309\n would be\nsubject both to \nArticle 310(1)\n and \nArticle 311.\n This\nposition was pointed out by Subba Rao, J., as he then was,\nin his separate but concurring judgment in Moti Ram Deka's\ncase at page 734, namely, that rules under \nArticle 309\n are\nsubject to the pleasure doctrine and the pleasure doctrine\nis itself subject to the two limitations imposed thereon by\n\nArticle 311.\n Thus, as pointed out in that case, any rule\nwhich contravenes clause (1) or clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n\nwould be invalid. Where, however the second proviso applies,\nthe only restriction upon the exercise of the pleasure of\nthe President or the Governor of a State is the one\ncontained in clause(1) of \nArticle 311.\n For an Act or a rule\nto provide that in a case where the second proviso applies\nany of the safeguards excluded by that proviso will be\navailable to a Government servant would amount to such Act\nor rule impinging upon the pleasure of the President or\nGovernor, as the case may be, and would be void as being\nunconstitutional. It is, however, a well-settled rule of\nconstruction of statutes that where two interpretations are\npossible, one of which would preserve and save the\nconstitutionality of the particular statutory provision\nwhile the other would render it unconstitutional and void,\nthe one which saves and preserves its constitutionality\nshould be adopted and the other rejected. Such\nconstitutionality can be preserved by interpreting that\nstatutory provision as directory and not mandatory. It is\nequally well-settled that where a statutory provision is\ndirectory, the courts cannot interfere to compel the\nperformance or punish breach of the duty created by such\nprovision and disobedience of such provision would not\nentail any invalidity - see Craies on Statute Law, Seventh\nEdition, at page 229. In such a case breach of such\nstatutory provisions would not furnish any cause of action\nor ground of challenge to a government servant for at the\nvery threshold, such cause of action or ground of challenge\nwould be barred by the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n\n244\n\n On behalf of the government servants support for the\nabove contention raised by them was sought to be derived\nfrom Challappan's case. Bearing in mind what has been stated\nabove, we will, therefore, now examine Challapan's case.\nBefore, however, we come to that case it would be convenient\nto refer to the observations in M. Gopala Krishna Naidu's\ncase, because it was by reason of the conflict between those\nobservations and what was held in Challappan's case that\nthese matters have all some to be decided by this\nConstitution Bench. \nM.Gopala Krishna Naidu\n's case was not\ndirectly a case under the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n\nIn that case the appellant, who was an overseer in the\nPublic Works Department of the Central Provinces and Berar\nGovernment, was suspended from service in 1947 and\nprosecuted under \nsection 161\n of the Indian Penal Code.\nUltimately, on orders from the High Court, the prosecution\nwas dropped. The appellant was also exonerated in a\ndepartmental inquiry held against him. Thereafter the\nGovernment by an order held that the charges against the\nAppellant had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and\nthe suspension of the appellant and the departmental inquiry\n\"were not wholly unjustified\". It accordingly directed that\nthe appellant should be reinstated in service with effect\nfrom the date of the said order and retired from that date,\nhe having already attained the age of superannuation, and\nthat the entire period of absence from duty should be\ntreated as period spent on duty under rule 54(5) of the\nFundamental Rules for purposes of pension only, but that he\nshould not be allowed any pay beyond what he had actually\nreceived or what was allowed to him by way of subsistence\nallowance during the period of suspension. The appellant's\nwrit petition was dismissed by the High Court. In appeal a\nthree Judge Bench of this Court allowed the appeal. The\ncourt held that rule 54 of the Fundamental Rules\ncontemplated a duty to act in accordance with the basic\nconcept of justice and fair play, and the authority,\ntherefore had to afford a reasonable opportunity to the\nappellant to show cause why clauses (3) and (5) of rule 54\nshould not be applied and at this not having been done, the\norder was invalid. While discussing the scope of rule 54 of\nthe Fundamental Rules the Court observed as follows (at\npage, 358-59) :\n\n \"It is true that the order under F.R.54 is in a\n sense a consequential order in that it would be\n passed after an order of reinstatement is made.\n But the fact that it is a consequential order does\n not determine the question whether the government\n servant has to be\n\n245\n\n given an opportunity to show cause or not. It is\n also true that in a case where reinstatement is\n ordered after a departmental inquiry the\n government servant would ordinarily have had an\n opportunity to show cause. In such a case, the\n authority no doubt would have before him the\n entire record including the explanation given by\n the government servant from which all the facts\n and circumstances of the case would be before the\n authority and from which he can form the opinion\n as to whether he has been fully exonerated or not\n and in case of suspension whether such suspension\n was wholly unjustified or not. In such a case the\n order passed under a rule such as the present\n Fundamental Rule might be said to be a\n consequential order following a departmental\n inquiry. But there are three classes of cases as\n laid down by the proviso in Article 311 where a\n departmental inquiry would not be held, viz., (a)\n where a person is dismissed, removed or reduced in\n rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his\n conviction on a criminal charge; (b) where the\n authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person\n or to reduce him in rank is satisfied for reasons\n to be recorded in writing that it is not\n reasonably practicable to hold such an inquiry and\n\n (c) where the President or the Governor as the\n case may be is satisfied that in the interest of\n security of the State it is not expedient to hold\n such inquiry. Since there would be no inquiry in\n these classes of cases the authority would not\n have before him any explanation by the government\n servant. The authority in such cases would have to\n consider and pass the order merely on such facts\n which might be placed before him by the department\n concerned. The order in such a case would be ex\n parte without the authority having the other side\n of the picture. In such cases the order that such\n authority would pass would not be a consequential\n order as where a departmental inquiry has been\n held. Therefore, an order passed under Fundamental\n Rule 45 is not always a consequential order nor is\n such order a continuation of the departmental\n proceeding taken against the employee.\"\n\n Challapan's case decided three appeals against a common\njudgment of the High Court of Rajasthan allowing the writ\npetitions filed by three railway servants. Challappan, the\nrespondent\n\n246\n\nin one of these appeals, was a railway-pointsman. He was\narrested at Olavakkot Railway Station platform for\ndisorderly, drunken and indecent behaviour and was\nprosecuted and convicted under \nsection 51(a)\n of the Kerala\nPolice Act. Instead of sentencing him, the sub-magistrate,\nPalghat, released him on probation under section of the\n\nProbation of Offenders Act, 1958\n. Thereafter he was removed\nfrom service by the disciplinary authority of the\nDepartment, without holding any inquiry, on the basis of his\nconviction in the said criminal case. The order of removal\nfrom service was made under clause (i) of rule 14 of the\nRailway Servants Rules. The Kerala High Court held that as\nno penalty was imposed upon him, clause (i) of rule 14 did\nnot in terms apply, and allowed his writ petition. So far as\nthe other two railway employees were concerned, one was\nconvicted under \nsection 3\n of the Railway Property (Unlawful\nPossession) Act, 1966, and the other under \nsection 420\n of\nthe Indian Penal Code. Both of them were released on\nprobation and were similarly removed from railway service.\n\n The Railway Servants Rules have been made by the\nPresident in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso\nto \nArticle 309.\n Rule 6 specifies the penalties which can be\nimposed upon a railway servant. These penalties are divided\ninto minor penalties and major penalties. Major penalties\ninclude removal from service which is not to be a\ndisqualification for future employment under the Government\nor railway administration and dismissal from service which\nis ordinarily to be a disqualification for future employment\nunder the Government or railway administration. Under sub-\nrule (1) of Rule 7, the President may impose any of the\npenalties specified in Rule 6 on any railway servant. Sub\nrule (2) of Rule 7 states that without prejudice to the\nprovisions of sub-rule (1), any of the penalties specified\nin Rule 6 may be imposed on a railway servant by the\nauthorities specified in Schedules, I, II and III to the\nRailway Servants Rules. Rules 9 and 10 prescribe a detailed\nprocedure for imposing major penalties while Rule 11\nprescribes the procedure for imposing minor penalties.\nOriginally, sub-rule (5) of Rule 10 required that a notice\nbe given to a railway servant informing him of the penalty\nproposed to be imposed upon him and giving him an\nopportunity of making a representation on the proposed\npenalty on the basis of the evidence adduced during the\ninquiry held under Rule 9. The whole of that sub-rule was\nsubstituted by the Railway Servants (Discipline and Appeal)\n(Third Amendment) Rules, 1978, to bring sub-rule (5) in\nconformity with clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n as amended by the\n\nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n. It may be\nmentioned that on the respective dates of the orders\n\n247\n\nimpugned in Challappan's case the original sub-rule (5) of\nRule 10 formed part of the Railway Servants Rules and clause\n(2) of \nArticle 311\n in force was that clause as amended by\nthe \nConstitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963\n. This\nHowever, does not make any difference to the point which\nfalls to be decided.\n\n Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules provides as\n follows :\n\n \"14. Special procedure in certain cases.\n Notwithstanding anything contained in rules 9 to\n 13 :\n\n (i) where any penalty is imposed on a railway\n servant on the ground of conduct which has led to\n his conviction on a criminal charge; or\n\n (ii) where the disciplinary authority is\n satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by it in\n writing, that it is not reasonably practicable to\n hold an inquiry in the manner provided in these\n rules ; or\n\n (iii) where the President is satisfied that in the\n interest of the security of the State, it is not\n expedient to hold an inquiry in the manner\n provided in these rules ;\n\nthe disciplinary authority may consider the circumstances of\nthe case and make such orders thereon as it deems fit;\n Provided that the Commission shall be consulted,\n where such consultation is necessary, before any\n orders are made in any case under this rule.\"\nClause (b) of Rule 2 of the Railway Servants Rules defines\nthe word \"Commission\" as meaning the \"Union Public Service\nCommission.\"\n\n Rule 17 of the Railway Servants Rules sets out the\norders against which no appeal lies. Under that rule, no\nappeal inter alia lies against any order made by the\nPresident. Under Rule 18, subject to the provisions of Rule\n17, an appeal inter alia lies against an order imposing any\nof the penalties specified in Rule 6, whether made by the\ndisciplinary authority or by any appellate or reviewing\nauthority. Rule 20 prescribes a period of limitation\n\n248\n\nfor filing an appeal. The appellate authority is, however,\nconferred the power to condone the delay in filing the\nappeal if it is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient\ncause for not preferring the appeal. Rule 22 (2) provides as\nfollows :\n\n \"(2) In the case of an appeal against an order\n imposing any of the penalties specified in Rule 6\n or enhancing any penalty imposed under the said\n rule, the appellate authority shall consider\n\n (a) whether the procedure laid down in these rules\n has been complied with, and if not, whether such\n non-compliance has resulted in the violation of\n any provisions of the Constitution of India or in\n the failure of justice;\n\n (b) whether the findings of the disciplinary\n authority are warranted by the evidence on the\n record; and\n\n (c) whether the penalty or the enhanced penalty\n imposed is adequate, inadequate or severe; and\n pass orders\n\n (i) confirming, enhancing, reducing or setting\n aside the penalty: or\n\n (ii) remitting the case to the authority which\n imposed or enhanced the penalty or to any other\n authority with such directions as it may deem fit\n in the circumstances of the case.\n\n X X X X X X X\"\n\nRule 25 confers power upon (i) the President, (ii) Railway\nBoard, (iii) the General Manager of a Zonal Railway or an\nauthority of that status in any other Railway Unit or\nAdministration in the case of a railway servant serving\nunder him or its control, (iv) the appellate authority not\nbelow the rank of a Deputy Head of Department or a\nDivisional Railway Manager in cases where no appeal has been\npreferred, or (v) any other authority not below the rank of\na Deputy Head of Department or a Divisional Railway Manager\nin the case of a railway servant serving under its control,\nat anytime, either on his or its own motion or otherwise, to\ncall for records of any inquiry and revise any order made\nunder the Railway Servants Rules. Clause (c) of the first\nproviso to Rule 25(1) inter alia provides as follows :-\n\n249\n\n \"Provided that-\n\n X X X X X X\n\n (c) subject to the provisions of Rule 14, the\n revising authority shall-\n\n X X X X X X X\n\n (ii) where an inquiry in the manner laid down in\n Rule 9 has not already been held in the case,\n itself hold such inquiry or direct that such\n inquiry be held in accordance with the provisions\n of Rule 9 and there- after on a consideration of\n the proceedings of such inquiry, pass such orders\n as it may deem fit.\"\n\n The second proviso to Rule 25(1) provides for a period\nof limitation for initiating any revisional proceedings by\nan appellate authority other than the President or a\nrevising authority mentioned in item (v) xxxxx in that list\nof authorities set out above. In the case of other\nauthorities, the power of revision is not subject to any\ntime-limit. Rule 25-A confers power upon the President at\nany time either on his own motion or otherwise to review any\norder passed under the Railway Servants Rules when any new\nmaterial or evidence which could not be produced or was not\navailable at the time of passing the order under review and\nwhich has the effect of changing the nature of the case has\ncome or has been brought to his notice. Rules 25 and 25-A\nwere substituted by the Railway Servants (Discipline and\nAppeal)(First Amendment) Rules, 1983, for the original Rule\n25 which provided for a view in somewhat similar terms as\nthe present Rule 25.\n\n In Challappan's case the Kerala High Court allowed the\nwrit petitions filed before it solely on the ground that the\norders of the Magistrate releasing the concerned railway\nservants on probation did not amount to imposition of\npenalty as contemplated by Rule 14 of the Railway Servants\nRules. Reversing that view this Court held that the word\n\"penalty\" in clause (i) of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants\nRules does not refer to a sentence awarded by the Court to\nthe accused on his conviction but it merely indicates the\nnature of the penalty impossible by the disciplinary\nauthority if the delinquent employee has been found guilty\nof conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal\ncharge. The Court observed (at pages 789-790) :\n\n250\n\n \"The view of the Kerala High Court, therefore,\n that as the Magistrate released the delinquent\n employee on probation no penalty was imposed as\n contemplated by rule 15 (i) of the Rules of 1968\n does not appear to us to be legally correct and\n must be overruled. Nevertheless we would uphold\n the order of the Kerala High Court, on the ground,\n that the last part of rule 14 of the rules of 1968\n which requires the consideration of the\n circumstances not having been complied with by the\n disciplinary authority, the order of removal from\n service of the delinquent employee was rightly\n quashed.\"\n\nThe Court pointed out that clause (i) of Rule 14 merely\nsought to incorporate the principle embodied in clause (a)\nof the second proviso. The Court in the course of its\njudgment reproduced the provisions of clause (2) of \nArticle\n311\n alongwith clause (a) to the proviso thereto, at that\ntime clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n in force being that clause as\namended by the \nConstitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963\n,\nthat is, clause (2) prior to its amendment by the\n\nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976\n, and the\nproviso thereto being the same as the second proviso to\nclause (2) as amended by the \nConstitution (Forty-second\nAmendment) Act\n. The Court then pointed out that there were\nthree stages in a departmental inquiry under \nArticle 311(2)\n\nthe third being the stage before actually imposing the\npenalty in which final notice to the delinquent employee\nshould be given to show cause why the penalty proposed\nagainst him be not imposed on him. It then stated that\nclause (a) of the proviso (now the second proviso) \nArticle\n311(2)\n, however, completely dispensed with all the three\nstages of a departmental inquiry when an employee was\nconvicted on a criminal charge because the employee already\nhad in the criminal trial a full and complete opportunity to\ncontest the allegations against him and to make out his\ndefence. The Court pointed out that clause (a) of the\nproviso (now the second proviso) is merely an enabling\nprovision and does not enjoin or confer a mandatory duty on\nthe disciplinary authority to pass an order of dismissal,\nremoval or reduction in rank the moment and employee is\nconvicted. The Court then considered the extent and ambit of\nthe last part of Rule 14, namely, the phrase \"the\ndisciplinary authority may consider the circumstances of the\ncase and make such orders there on as it deems fit\" and\nstated its conclusions as follows (at pages 795-97) :\n\n251\n\n \"The word `consider' has been used in\n contradiction to the word `determine'. The rule-\n making authority deliberately used the word\n `consider' and not `determine' because the word\n `determine' has a much wider scope. The word\n `consider' merely connotes that there should be\n active application of the mind by the disciplinary\n authority after considering the entire\n circumstances of the case in order to decide the\n nature and extent of the penalty to be imposed on\n the delinquent employee on his conviction on a\n criminal charge. This matter can be objectively\n determined only if the delinquent employee is\n heard and is given a chance to satisfy the\n authority regarding the final orders that may be\n passed by the said authority. In other words, the\n term `consider' postulates consideration of all\n the aspects, the pros and cons of the matter after\n hearing the aggrieved person. Such an inquiry\n would be a summary inquiry to be held by the\n disciplinary authority after hearing the\n delinquent employee. It is not at all necessary\n for the disciplinary authority to order a fresh\n departmental inquiry which is dispensed with under\n rule 14 of the Rules of 1968 which incorporates\n the principle contained in \nArticle 311(2)\n proviso\n\n (a). This provision confers power on the\n disciplinary authority to decide whether in the\n facts and circumstances of a particular case what\n penalty, if at all should be imposed on the\n delinquent employee. It is obvious that in\n considering this matter the disciplinary authority\n will have to take into account the entire conduct\n of the delinquent employee, the gravity of the\n misconduct committed by him, the impact which his\n misconduct is to have on the administration and\n other extenuating circumstances or redeeming the\n features if any present in the case and so on and\n so forth. It may be that the conviction of an\n accused may be for a trivial offence as in the\n case of the respondent T.R. Challappan in Civil\n Appeal No. 1664 of 1974 where a stern warning or a\n fine would have been sufficient to meet the\n exigencies of service. It is possible that the\n delinquent employee may be found guilty of some\n technical offence, for instance, violation of the\n transport rules or the rules under the \nMotor\n Vehicles Act\n and so on, where no major penalty may\n be attracted. It is difficult to lay down any hard\n and fast rules as to\n\n252\n\n the factors which the disciplinary authority would\n have to consider, but I have mentioned some of\n these factors by way of instances which are merely\n illustrative and not exhaustive. In other words,\n the position is that the conviction of the\n delinquent employee would be taken as sufficient\n proof of misconduct and then the authority will\n have to embark upon a summary inquiry as to the\n nature and extent of the penalty to be imposed on\n the delinquent employee and in the course of the\n inquiry if the authority is of the opinion that\n the offence is too trivial or of a technical\n nature it may refuse to impose any penalty inspite\n of the conviction. This is a very salutary\n provision which has been enshrined in these Rules\n and one of the purposes for conferring this power\n is that in cases where the disciplinary authority\n is satisfied that the delinquent employee is a\n youthful offender who is not convicted of any\n serious offence and shows poignant penitence or\n real repentance he may be dealt with as lightly as\n possible. This appears to us to be the scope and\n ambit of this provision. We must, however, hasten\n to add that we should not be understood as laying\n down that the last part of rule 14 of the Rules of\n 1968 contains a licence to employees convicted of\n serious offences to insist on reinstatement. The\n statutory provision referred to above merely\n imports a rule of natural justice in enjoining\n that before taking final action in the matter the\n delinquent employee should be heard and the\n circumstances of the case may be objectively\n considered. This is in keeping with the sense of\n justice and fair-play. The disciplinary authority\n has the undoubted power after hearing the\n delinquent employee and considering the\n circumstances of the case to inflict any major\n penalty on the deinquent employee without any\n further departmental inquiry if the authority is\n of the opinion that the employee has been guilty\n of a serious offence involving moral turpitude\n and, therefore, it is not desirable or conducive\n in the interests of administration to retain such\n a person in service.\n\n Mr. S.N.Prasad appearing for the appellants\n submitted that it may not be necessary for the\n disciplinary authority to hear the accused and\n consider the matter where no provision like rule\n 14 exists, because in\n\n253\n\n such cases the Government can, in the exercise of\n its executive powers, dismiss, remove or reduce in\n rank any employee who has been convicted of a\n criminal charge by force of proviso (a) to \nArticle\n 311(2)\n of the Constitution. In other words, the\n argument was that to cases where proviso (a) to\n \nArticle 311(2)\n applies a departmental inquiry is\n completely dispensed with and the disciplinary\n authority can on the doctrine of pleasure\n terminate the services of the delinquent\n employee. We however, refrain from expression any\n opinion on this aspect of the matter because the\n cases of all the three respondents before us are\n cases which clearly fall within rule 14 of the\n rules of 1968 where they have been removed from\n service without complying with the last part of\n rule 14 of the Rules of 1968 as indicated above.\n In none of the cases has the disciplinary\n authority either considered the circumstances or\n heard the delinquent employees on the limited\n point as to the nature and extent of the penalty\n to be imposed if at all. On the other hand in all\n these cases the disciplinary authority has\n proceeded to pass the order of removal from\n service straightaway on the basis of the\n conviction of the delinquent employees by the\n criminal courts.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n So far as Challappan's Case is concerned, it is not\npossible to find any fault either with the view that neither\nclause (a) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n nor\nclause (i) of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules is\nmandatory or with the considerations which have been set out\nin the judgment as being the considerations to be taken into\naccount by the disciplinary authority before imposing a\npenalty upon a delinquent government servant. Where a\nsituation envisaged in one of the three clauses of the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or of an analogous service\nrule arises, it is not mandatory that the major penalty of\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank should be imposed\nupon the concerned government servant. The penalty which can\nbe imposed may be some other major penalty or even a minor\npenalty depending upon the facts and circumstances of the\ncase. In order to arrive at a decision as to which penalty\nshould be imposed, the disciplinary authority will have to\ntake into consideration the various factors set out in\nChallappan's case. It is, however, not possible to agree\nwith approach adopted in Challappan's case in considering\nRule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules in isolation\n\n254\n\nand apart from the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n, nor\nwith the interpretation placed by it upon the word\n\"consider\" in the last part of Rule 14. Neither Rule 14 of\nthe Railways Servants Rules nor a similar rule in other\nservice rules can be looked at apart from the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2).\n The authority of a particular officer to\nact as a disciplinary authority and to impose an penalty\nupon a government servant is derived from rules made under\nthe proviso to \nArticle 309\n or under an Act referable to that\nArticle. As pointed out earlier, these rules cannot impinge\nupon the pleasure of the President or the Governor of a\nState, as the case may be, because they are subject to\n\nArticle 310(1).\n Equally, they cannot restrict the safeguards\nprovided by clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 311\n as such a\nrestriction would be in violation of the provisions of those\nclauses. In the same way, they cannot restrict the\nexclusionary impact of the second proviso to \nArticle 311 (2)\n\nbecause that would be to impose a restriction upon the\nexercise of pleasure under \nArticle 310(1)\n which has become\nfree of the restrictions placed upon it by clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n by reason of the operation of the second proviso\nto that clause. The only cases in which a government servant\ncan be dismissed, removed or reduced in rank by way of\npunishment without holding an inquiry contemplated by\nclause(2) of \nArticle 311\n are the three cases mentioned in\nthe second proviso to that clause. A rule which provides for\nany other case in which any of these three penalties can be\nimposed would be unconstitutional. Service rules may\nreproduce the provisions of the second proviso authorizing\nthe disciplinary authority to dispense with the inquiry\ncontemplated by clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n in the three cases\nmentioned in the second proviso to that clause or any one or\nmore of them. Such a rule, however, cannot be valid and\nconstitutional without reference to the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n and cannot be read apart from it. Thus, while\nthe source of authority of a particular officer to act as a\ndisciplinary authority and to dispense with the inquiry is\nderived from the service rules, the source of his power to\ndispense with the inquiry is derived from the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311 (2)\n and not from any service rules. There is\na well-established distinction between the source of\nauthority to exercise a power and the source of such power.\nThe Court in Challappan's case was, therefore, in error in\ninterpreting Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules by itself\nand not in conjunction with the second proviso (at that time\nthe only proviso) to \nArticle 311(2).\n It appears that in\nChallappan's case the Court felt that the addition of the\nwords \"the disciplinary authority may consider the\ncircumstances of the case and make such orders\n\n255\n\nthereon as it deems fit\" warranted an interpretation of Rule\n14 different from that to be placed upon the second proviso.\nThis is also not correct. It is true that the second proviso\ndoes not contain these words but from this it does not\nfollow that when acting under the second proviso, the\ndisciplinary authority should not consider the facts and\ncircumstances of the case or make an order not warranted by\nthem. It is also not possible to accept the interpretation\nplaced upon the word \"consider\" in Challappan's case.\nAccording to the view taken in that case, a consideration of\nthe circumstances of the case cannot be unilateral but must\nbe after hearing the delinquent government servant. If such\nwere the correct meaning of the word \"consider\", it would\nrender this part of Rule 14 unconstitutional as restricting\nthe full exclusionary operation of the second proviso. The\nword \"consider\", however, does not bear the meaning placed\nupon it in Challappan's case. The word \"consider\" is used in\nRule 14 as a transitive verb. The meaning of the word\n\"consider\" as so used is given in the Oxford English\nDictionary as \"To contemplate mentally, fix the mind upon;\nto think over, meditate or reflect on, bestow attentive\nthought upon, given heed to, take note of.\" The relevant\ndefinition of the word \"consider\" given in Webster's Third\nNew International Dictionary is \"to reflect on: think about\nwith a degree of care of caution\". Below this definition are\ngiven the synonyms of the word \"consider\", these synonyms\nbeing \"contemplate, study, weigh, revolve, excogitate\".\nWhile explaining the exact different shades of meaning in\nthis group of words, Webster's Dictionary proceeds to state\nas under with respect to the word \"consider\".\n\n \"CONSIDER often indicates little more than think\n about. It may occasionally suggest somewhat more\n conscious direction of thought, somewhat greater\n depth and scope, and somewhat greater\n purposefulness.\"\n\nIt is thus obvious that the word \"consider\" in its ordinary\nand natural sense is not capable of the meaning assigned to\nit in Challappan's case. The consideration under Rule 14 of\nwhat penalty should be imposed upon a delinquent railway\nservant must, therefore, be ex parte and where the\ndisciplinary authority comes to the conclusion that the\npenalty which the facts and circumstances of the case\nwarrant is either of dismissal or removal or reduction in\nrank, no opportunity of showing cause against such penalty\nproposed to be imposed upon him can be afforded to the\ndelinquent government servant. Undoubtedly, the disciplinary\nauthority must have regard to all the facts and\ncircumstances of the case as set out in Challapan's case. As\npointed out\n\n256\n\nearlier, considerations of fair play and justice requiring a\nhearing to be given to a government servant with respect to\nthe penalty to be imposed upon him do not enter into the\npicture when the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n comes into\nplay and the same would be the position in the case of a\nservice rule reproducing the second proviso in whole or in\npart and whether the language used is identical with that\nused in the second proviso or not. There are a number of\norders which are of necessity passed without hearing the\nparty who may be affected by them. For instance, courts of\nlaw can and often do pass ex parte ad interim orders on the\napplication of a plaintiff, petitioner or appellant without\nissuing any notice to the other side or hearing him. Can it,\ntherefore, be contended that the judge or judges, as the\ncase may be, did not apply his or their mind while passing\nsuch an order?\n\n The Decision in Challappan's case is, therefore not\ncorrect with respect to the interpretation placed by it upon\nRule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules and particularly upon\nthe word \"consider\" occurring in the last part of that rule\nand interpreting Rule 14 by itself and not in conjunction\nwith the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n Before parting\nwith Challappan's case, we may, also point out that case\nnever held the field. The judgment in that case was\ndelivered on September 15, 1975, and it was reported in\n[1976] 1 S.C.R. at pages 783ff. Hardly was that case\nreported then in the next group of appeals in which the same\nquestion was raised, namely, the three Civil Appeals\nmentioned earlier, an order of reference to a larger Bench\nwas made on November 18, 1976. The correctness of\nChallappan's case was, therefore, doubted from the very\nbeginning.\n\n The next service rule which falls for consideration in\nthese matters is Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules. The\nCivil Services Rules are also made under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309.\n The scheme of these rules so far as\ndisciplinary proceedings are concerned is very similar to\nthat of the Railway Servants Rules. Rule 11 specifies the\npenalties which can be imposed on a government servant.\nThese penalties are divided into minor penalties and major\npenalties. Clauses (i) to (iv) of that rule specify what the\nminor penalties are while clauses (v) to (viii) specify what\nthe major penalties are. The major penalties include\ncompulsory retirement, removal from service which is not to\nbe a disqualification for future employment under the\nGovernment and dismissal from service which is ordinarily to\nbe a disqualification for future employment under the\nGovernment. Rules 14 and 15\n\n257\n\nprescribe the procedure to be followed where a major penalty\nis to be imposed while Rule 16 prescribes the procedure for\nimposing a minor penalty. Previously, under sub-rule (4) of\nRule 15 the government servant was also to be given a notice\nof the penalty proposed to be imposed upon him and an\nopportunity of making representation with respect to such\nproposed penalty. However, by Government of India, Ministry\nof Home Affairs (Deptt. of Personnel & Admn. Reforms)\nNotification No. 11012/2/77 - Ests. dated August 18, 1978,\nsub-rule (4) was substituted by a new sub-rule to bring it\nin conformity with the amendment made in clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n by the \nConstitution (Forty-second Amendment)\nAct\n, and the opportunity to show cause against the proposed\npenalty was done away with. Rule 19 Provides as follows\n \"19. Special procedure in certain cases.\n\n Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 14 to\n rule 18-\n\n (i) where any penalty is imposed on Government\n servant on the ground of conduct which has led to\n his conviction on a criminal charge, or\n\n (ii) where the disciplinary authority is satisfied\n for reasons to be recorded by it in writing that\n it is not reasonably practicable to hold an\n inquiry in the manner provided in these rules, or,\n\n (iii) where the President is satisfied that in the\n interest of the security of the State, it is not\n expedient to hold any inquiry in the manner\n provided in these rules,\n the disciplinary authority may consider the\n circumstances of the case and make such orders\n thereon as it deems fit;\n\n Provided that the Commission shall be consulted,\n where such consultation is necessary, before any\n orders are made in any case under this rule.\"\nThe word \"Commission\" is defined by clause (d) of Rule 2 as\nmeaning \"The Union Public Service Commission\". Under Rule\n22, no appeal is lies against any order made by the\nPresident or orders\n\n258\n\nof certain nature specified in that rule. Subject to the\nprovisions of Rule 22, Rule 23 provided for a right of\nappeal. Rule 25 provides for a period of limitation for\nfiling an appeal but the appellate authority is conferred\nthe power to condone the delay in filing the appeal if it is\nsatisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not\npreferring the appeal in time. Rule 27(2) provides as\nfollows:\n\n \"(2) In the case of an appeal against an order\n imposing any of the penalties specified in rule 11\n or enhancing any penalty imposed under the said\n rule, the appellate authority shall consider -\n\n (a) whether the procedure laid down in these rules\n has been complied with, and if not, whether such\n noncompliance has resulted in the violation of any\n provisions of the Constitution of India or in the\n failure of justice;\n\n (b) whether the findings of the disciplinary\n authority are warranted by the evidence on the\n record; and\n\n (c) whether the penalty or the enhanced penalty\n imposed is adequate, inadequate or severe; and\n pass orders -\n\n (i) confirming, enhancing, reducing or setting\n aside the penalty; or\n\n (ii) remitting the case to the authority which\n imposed or enhanced the penalty or to any other\n authority with such direction as it may deem fit\n in the circumstances of the case.\n\n X X X X X\nRule 29 provides for a right of revision. Under it an\napplication for revision is to be dealt with in the same\nmanner as if it were an appeal under the Civil Services\nRules. Rule 29-A confers upon the President a power of\nreview similar to Rule 25-A of the Railway Servants Rules.\n\n It will be noticed that the language of Rule 19 of the\nCivil Services Rules is identical with that of Rule 14 of\nthe Railway\n\n259\n\nServants Rules and the interpretation of Rule 19 of the\nCivil Services Rules would be the same as that placed by us\nupon Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules.\n\n The rule which now remains to be considered is Rule 37\nof the CISF Rules. The CISF Rules have been made by the\nCentral Government in pursuance of the power conferred by\n\nsection 22(1)\n of the Central Industrial Security Force Act,\n1968 (Act No. 50 of 1968) (hereinafter referred to in short\nas \"the \nCISF Act\n\"). \nSection 22(1)\n of the CISF Act confers\nupon the Central Government the power to make rules for\ncarrying out the purposes of that Act. Sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 22\n inter alia provides as follows:\n\n \"(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the\n generality of the foregoing powers, such rules may\n provide for-\n\n (a) regulating the classes, ranks, grades, pay and\n remuneration of supervisory officers and members\n of the Force and their conditions of service in\n the Force;\n\n X X X X X X\n\n (g) regulating the punishments and prescribing\n authorities to whom appeals shall be preferred\n from orders of punishment or remission of fines or\n other punishments, and the procedure to be\n followed for the disposal of such appeals;\n\n X X X X X X\n Before we turn to the CISF Rules, it is necessary to\nrefer to certain other provisions of the \nCISF Act\n. \nSection 3\n\nof the CISF Act provides for the constitution and\nmaintenance by the Central Government of a Force to be\ncalled the Central Industrial Security Force (hereinafter\nreferred to in short as \"the CIS Force\") for the better\nprotection and security of Industrial undertakings owned by\nthe Government. Clause(i) of \nsection 2(1)\n of the CISF Act\ndefined \"supervisory officer\" as meaning \"any of the\nofficers appointed under \nSection 4\n and includes any other\nofficer appointed by the Central Government as a supervisory\nofficer of the Force\". \nSection 4\n provides for the\nappointment of supervisory officers and their powers and is\nin the following terms :\n\n260\n\n \"4. Appointment and powers of supervisory\n officers.\n\n (1) The Central Government may appoint a person to\n be the Inspector-General of the Force and may\n appoint other persons to be Deputy Inspectors-\n\n General, Chief Security Officers or Security\n Officers of the Force.\n\n (2) The Inspector-General and every other\n supervisory officer so appointed shall have, and\n may exercise, such powers and authority as is\n provided by or under this Act.\"\n\n \nSections 8\n and \n9\n provided as follows:\n\n \"8. Dismissal, removal, etc., of members of the\n Force.\n\n Subject to the provisions of \nArticle 311\n of the\n Constitution and to such rules as the Central\n Government may make under this Act, any\n supervisory officer may -\n\n (i) dismiss, suspend or reduce in rank any member\n of the Force whom he thinks remiss or negligent in\n the discharge of his duty, or unfit for the same;\n\n or\n X X X X.\"\n\n \"9. Appeal and revision. -\n\n (1) Any member of the Force aggrieved by an order\n made under \nSection 8\n may, within thirty days from\n the date on which the order is communicated to\n him, prefer an appeal against the order to such\n authority as may be prescribed, and subject to the\n provisions of sub-section(3), the decision of the\n said authority thereon shall be final :\n\n Provided that the prescribed authority may\n entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said\n period of thirty days, if it is satisfied that the\n appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from\n filing the appeal in time.\n\n (2) In disposing of an appeal, the prescribed\n authority shall follow such procedure as may be\n prescribed.\n\n261\n\n (3) The Central Government may call for and\n examine the record of any proceeding under \nSection\n 8\n or under sub-section(2) of this section and may\n make such inquiry or cause such inquiry to be made\n and subject to the provisions of this Act, may\n pass such order thereon as it thinks fit:\n\n Provided that no order imposing an enhanced\n penalty under sub-section(2) or sub-section(3)\n shall be made unless a reasonable opportunity of\n being heard has been given to the person affected\n by such order.\"\n\n We now turn to the relevant CISF Rules. Rule 29-A\nspecifies the disciplinary authorities. Rule 31 specifies\nthe penalties which may be imposed on a member of the CIS\nForce. Amongst these penalties are dismissal, removal,\ncompulsory retirement and reduction to a lower class or\ngrade or rank or to a lower time-scale or to a lower stage\nin the time-scale of pay. CIS Rules do not specify which out\nof the penalties specified in Rule 31 are the major\npenalties and which are minor penalties but as these terms\nare well understood in service jurisdiction the same\nclassification as in the Civil Services Rules and the\nRailway Servants Rules will apply here. Rule 34 prescribes\nthe detailed procedure for imposing major penalties and Rule\n35 prescribes the procedure for imposing minor penalties.\n\nRule 32 specifies what are described as \"petty punishments\"\n\nto be awarded ordinarily in Orderly Room for petty breaches\nof discipline and trifling cases of misconduct by members of\nthe CIS Force not above the rank of the Head Security Guard\nand Rule 36 prescribes the procedure for imposing these\npunishments. Rule 37 of the CIS Rules is as follows :\n\n \"37. Special Procedure in certain cases-\n Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 34,\n rule 35 or rule 36, where a penalty is imposed on\n a member of the force-\n\n (a) on the ground of conduct which had led to his\n conviction on a criminal charge; or\n\n (b) where the disciplinary authority is satisfied\n for reasons to be recorded in writing, that it is\n not reasonably practicable to follow the procedure\n prescribed in the said rules :\n\n262\n\n the disciplinary authority may consider the\n circumstances of the case and pass such orders\n thereon as it deems fit.\n\n A member of the force who has been convicted to\n rigorous imprisonment on a criminal charge shall\n be dismissed from service. In such cases, no\n evidence need be given to proved the charge. Only\n a notice shall be given to the party charged\n proposing the punishment of dismissal for his\n having been convicted to rigorous imprisonment and\n asking him to explain as to why the proposed\n punishment of dismissal should not be imposed\".\nRule 42 provides for a right of appeal in the case of an\norder imposing any of the penalties specified in Rule 31.\nRule 42-A prescribes the period of limitation for filing an\nappeal. The appellate authority, however, has the power to\ncondone the delay in filing an appeal if it is satisfied\nthat the appellant had sufficient cause for not submitting\nthe appeal in time. Sub- rule(2) of Rule 47 provides as\nfollows :\n\n \"47. Consideration of appeals -\n\n X X X\n (2) In the case of an appeal against an order\n imposing any of the penalties specified in rule\n 31, the appellate authority shall consider -\n\n (a) whether the procedure prescribed in these\n rules has been complied with, and if not, whether\n such non-compliance has resulted in violation of\n any provisions of the Constitution or in failure\n of justice;\n\n (b) whether the findings are justified; and\n\n (c) whether the penalty imposed is excessive,\n adequate or inadequate; and pass orders;\n\n (i) setting aside, reduction, confirming or\n enhancing the penalty;\n\n (ii) remitting the case to the authority which\n imposed the penalty; or to any other authority\n with such\n\n263\n\n direction as it may deem fit in the circumstances\n of the case :\n\n X X X\nRule 49 provides for suo motu revision. It inter alia\nenables the revising authority to take further evidence and\nprovides that the provisions of Rule 47 relating to appeals\nshall apply so far as may be to orders in revision.\n\n It will be noticed that Rule 37, except the last\nparagraph thereof, is in pari materia with Rule 14 of the\nRailway Servants Rules and Rule 19 of the Civil Services\nRules with this difference that a provision akin to clause\n\n(iii) of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules and clause\n\n(iii) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules is not to be\nfound in Rule 37 of the CISF Rules. The same interpretation\nas placed by us on the word \"consider\" occurring in Rule 14\nof the Railway Servants Rules and Rule 19 of the Civil\nServices Rules must, therefore, be placed upon the word\n\"consider\" in Rule 37 of the CISF Rules. The last paragraph\nof Rule 37 of the CISF Rules is peculiar to itself and does\nnot find a place either in the said Rule 14 or the said Rule\n\n19. It is clumsily worded and makes little sense. To provide\nthat a member of the CIS Force who has been convicted to\nrigorous imprisonment on a criminal charge \"shall be\ndismissed from service\" and at the same time to provide that\n\"only a notice shall be given to the party charged proposing\nthe punishment of dismissal for his having been convicted to\nrigorous imprisonment and asking him to explain as to why\nthe proposed punishment of dismissal should not be imposed\",\nis a contradiction in terms, If either of these provisions\nwere taken as mandatory, it would be void as violating the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n because the penalty\ncontemplated by the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n is not\nthe penalty of dismissal only but also of removal or\nreduction in rank, and to make it mandatory to issue a\nnotice to show cause against the proposed penalty of\ndismissal would equally violate the second proviso because\nit would whittle down the exclusionary effect of the second\nproviso. Therefore, both these provisions in the last\nparagraph of Rule 37 must be read as directory and not\nmandatory, not only to make sense out of them but also to\npreserve their constitutionality. So read, a breach of these\nprovisions would not afford any cause of action to a member\nof the CIS Force.\n\n264\n\n A conspectus of the above service rules and the \nCISF\nAct\n shows that a government servant who has been dismissed,\nremoved or reduced in rank without holding an inquiry\nbecause his case falls under one of the three clauses of the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or a provision of the\nservice rules analogous thereto is not wholly without a\nremedy. He has a remedy by way of an appeal, revision or in\nsome cases also by way of review. Sub-clause (ii) of clause\n\n(c) of the first proviso of Rule 25(1) of the Railway\nServants Rules expressly provides that in the case of a\nmajor penalty where an inquiry has not been held, the\nrevising authority shall itself hold such inquiry or direct\nsuch inquiry to be held. This is, however, made subject to\nthe provisions of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules. The\nother service rules referred to above not appear to have a\nsimilar provision nor does the Railway Servants Rules make\nthe same provision in the case of an appeal. Having regard,\nhowever, to the factors to be taken into consideration by\nthe appellate authority which are set out in the service\nrules referred to above a provision similar to that\ncontained in sub-clause (ii) of clause(c) of the first\nproviso to Rule 25(1) of the Railway Servants Rules should\nbe read and imported into provisions relating to appeals in\nthe Railway Servants Rules and in the other service rules\nand also in the provisions relating to revision in the other\nservice rules. This would, of course, be subject to the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n, Rule 14 of the Railway\nServants Rules Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules and Rule\n37 of the CISF Rules. Thus, such a right to an inquiry\ncannot be availed of where clause (a) to the second proviso\nof \nArticle 311(2)\n or a similar provision in any service rule\napplies in order to enable a government servant to contend\nthat he was wrongly convicted by the criminal court. He can,\nhowever, contend that in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase, the penalty imposed upon him is too severe or is\nexcessive. He can also show that he is not in fact the\ngovernment servant who was convicted on a criminal charge\nand that it is a case of mistaken identity. Where it is a\ncase falling under clause(b) of the second proviso or a\nprovision in the service rules analogous thereto, the\ndispensing with the inquiry by the disciplinary authority\nwas the result of the situation prevailing at that time. If\nthe situation has changed when the appeal or revision is\nheard, the government servant can claim to have an inquiry\nheld in which he can establish that he is not guilty of the\ncharges on which he has been dismissed, removed or reduced\nin rank. He, however, cannot by reason of the provisions of\nclause(3) of \nArticle 311\n contend that the inquiry\n\n265\n\nwas wrongly dispensed with and it was reasonably practicable\nto hold an inquiry because by the said clause (3) the\ndecision on this point of the disciplinary authority has\nbeen made final. So far as clause (c) is concerned,\ndispensing with the inquiry depends upon the satisfaction of\nthe President or the Governor, as the case may be, that in\nthe interest of the security of the State it is not\nexpedient to hold an inquiry. In such a case, an order\nimposing penalty can, however be passed by a disciplinary\nauthority because in such a case the President or the\nGovernor, as the case may be, can direct the disciplinary\nauthority to consider the facts of the case and impose the\nappropriate penalty without holding any inquiry. Clause\n\n(iii) of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules and clause\n\n(iii) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules envisage this\nbeing done. In such a case the satisfaction that the inquiry\nshould be dispensed with as not being expedient in the\ninterest of the security of the State would be that of the\nPresident or the Governor, the selection of one of the three\npenalties mentioned in \nArticle 311(2)\n as being the proper\npenalty to be imposed would be of the disciplinary\nauthority. The satisfaction of the President or the Governor\ncannot be challenged in appeal or revision but the\ngovernment servant can in appeal or revision ask for an\ninquiry to be held into his alleged conduct unless even at\nthe time of the appeal or revision, the interest of the\nsecurity of the State makes it inexpedient to hold such an\ninquiry. Of course, no such right would be available to a\ngovernment servant where the order imposing penalty has been\nmade by the President or the Governor of a State, as the\ncase may be.\n\n Executive Instructions and the Second Proviso\n In the course of the arguments certain executive\ninstructions issued by the Government of India were referred\nto and relied upon on behalf of the government servants. It\nis unnecessary to deal with these instructions in detail. At\nthe highest they contain the opinion of the Government of\nIndia on the scope and effect of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n and cannot be binding upon the Court with\nrespect to the interpretation it should place upon that\nproviso. To the extent that they may liberalized the\nexclusionary effect of the second proviso they can only be\ntaken as directory. Executive instruction stand on a lower\nfooting than a statutory rule for they do not have the force\nof a statutory rule. If an Act or a rule cannot alter or\nliberalized the exclusionary effect of the second proviso,\nexecutive instructions can do so even much less.\n\n266\n\n Omission to Mention the Relevant Clause of the Second\nProviso or the Relevant Service Rule in the Impugned Orders\n Some of the orders impugned before us refer only to one\nor the other of the three clauses of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n for dispensing with an inquiry without\nreferring to the relevant service rule, some refer both to a\nclause of the second proviso and the relevant service rule,\nwhile the others refer only to the relevant service rule\nwithout making any mention of the particular clause of the\nsecond proviso which has been applied. The question is\nwhether the omission to mention the particular clause of the\nsecond proviso or the relevant service rule makes any\ndifference.\n\n As pointed out earlier, the source of authority of a\nparticular officer to act as a disciplinary authority and to\ndispense with the inquiry is derived from the service rules\nwhile the source of his power to dispense with the\ndisciplinary inquiry is derived from the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2).\n There cannot be an exercise of a power\nunless such power exists in law. If such power does not\nexist in law, the purported exercise of it would be an\nexercise of a non-existent power and would be void. The\nexercise of a power is, therefore, always referable to the\nsource of such power and must be considered in conjunction\nwith it. The Court's attention in Challappan's Case was not\ndrawn to this settled position in law and hence the error\ncommitted by it in considering Rule 14 of the Railway\nServants Rules by itself and without taking into account the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n It is also well settled\nthat where a source of power exists, the exercise of such\npower is referable only to that source and not some other\nsource under which were that power exercised, the exercise\nof such power would be invalid and without jurisdiction.\nSimilarly, if a source of power exists by reading together\ntwo provisions, whether statutory or constitutional, and the\norder refers to only one of them, the validity of the order\nshould be upheld by construing it as an order passed under\nboth those provisions. Further, even the mention of a wrong\nprovision or the omission to mention the provision which\ncontains the source of power will not invalidate an order\nwhere the source of such power exists. \n(See \nDr. Ram Manohar\nLohia v. State of Bihar and others\n [1966] 1 S.C.R. 709,721\nand \nThe Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad v.\nBen Hiraben Manilal\n [1983] 2 S.C.R. 676,681. The omission to\nmention in the impugned orders the relevant clause of the\nsecond proviso or the relevant service rule will not,\ntherefore, have the effect of invalidating\n\n267\n\nthe orders and the orders must be read as having been made\nunder the applicable clause of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n read with the relevant service rule.\n It may be\nmentioned that in none of the matters before us has it been\ncontended that the disciplinary authority which passed the\nimpugned order was not competent to do so.\n\n The Second Proviso - Clause (a)\n Not much remains to be said about clause (a) of the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n To recapitulate briefly,\nwhere a disciplinary authority comes to know that a\ngovernment servant has been convicted on a criminal charge,\nit must consider whether his conduct which has led to his\nconviction was such as warrants the imposition of a penalty\nand, if so, what that penalty should be. For that purpose it\nwill have to peruse the judgment of the criminal court and\nconsider all the facts and circumstances of the case and the\nvarious factors set out in Challappan's case. This, however,\nhas to be done by it ex parte and by itself. Once the\ndisciplinary authority reaches the conclusion that the\ngovernment servant's conduct was such as to require his\ndismissal or removal from service or reduction in rank he\nmust decide which of these three penalties should be imposed\non him. This too it has to do by itself and without hearing\nthe concerned government servant by reason of the\nexclusionary effect of the second proviso. The disciplinary\nauthority must, however, bear in mind that a conviction on a\ncriminal charge does not automatically entail dismissal,\nremoval or reduction in rank of the concerned government\nservant. Having decided which of these three penalties is\nrequired to be imposed, he has to pass the requisite order.\nA government servant who is aggrieved by the penalty imposed\ncan agitate in appeal, revision or review, as the case may\nbe, that the penalty was too severe or excessive and not\nwarranted by the facts and circumstances of the case. If it\nis his case that he is not the government servant who has\nbeen in fact convicted, he can also agitate this question in\nappeal, revision or review. If he fails in all the\ndepartmental remedies and still wants to pursue the matter,\nhe can invoke the court's power of judicial review subject\nto the court permitting it. If the court finds that he was\nnot in fact the person convicted, it will strike down the\nimpugned order and order him to be reinstated in service.\nWhere the court finds that the penalty imposed by the\nimpugned order is arbitrary or grossly excessive or out of\nall proportion to the offence committed or not warranted by\nthe facts and circumstances of the case or the requirements\nof that\n\n268\n\nparticular government service the court will also strike\ndown the impugned order. \nThus, in \nShankar Dass v. Union of\nIndia and another\n, [1985] 2 S.C.C. 358, this Court set aside\nthe impugned order of penalty on the ground that the penalty\nof dismissal from service imposed upon the appellant was\nwhimsical and ordered his reinstatement in service with full\nback wages. It is, however, not necessary that the Court\nshould always order reinstatement. The Court can instead\nsubstitute a penalty which in its opinion would be just and\nproper in the circumstances of the case.\n\n The Second Proviso - Clause (b)\n The main thrust of the arguments as regards clause (b)\nof the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n was that whatever\nthe situation may be minimal inquiry or at least an\nopportunity to show cause against the proposed penalty is\nalways feasible and is required by law. The arguments with\nrespect to a minimal inquiry were founded on the basis of\nthe applicability of \nArticle 14\n and the principles of\nnatural justice and the arguments with respect to an\nopportunity to show cause against the proposed penalty were\nin addition founded upon the decision in Challappan's case.\nThese contentions have already been dealt with and negatived\nby us and we have further held that Challappan's case in so\nfar as it held that a government servant should be heard\nbefore imposing a penalty upon him was wrongly decided.\n\n The next contention was that even if it is not\nreasonably practicable to hold an inquiry, a government\nservant can be placed under suspension until the situation\nimproves and it becomes possible to hold the inquiry. This\ncontention also cannot be accepted. Very often a situation\nwhich makes it not reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry\nis of the creation of the concerned government servant\nhimself or of himself acting in concert with others or of\nhis associates. It can even be that he himself is not a\nparty to bringing about that situation. In all such cases\nneither public interest nor public good requires that salary\nor subsistence allowance should be continued to be paid out\nof the public exchequer to the concerned government servant.\nIt should also be borne in mind that in the case of a\nserious situation which renders the holding of an inquiry\nnot reasonably practicable, it would be difficult to foresee\nhow long the situation will last and when normalcy would\nreturn or be restored. It is impossible to draw the line as\nto the period of time for which the suspension should\ncontinue and on the expiry of that period action should be\ntaken under clause (b) of the second proviso.\n\n269\n\nFurther, the exigencies of a situation may require that\nprompt action should be taken and suspending the government\nservant cannot serve the purpose. Sometimes not taking\nprompt action may result in the trouble spreading and the\nsituation worsening and at times becoming uncontrolable. Not\ntaking prompt action may also be construed by the trouble-\nmakers and agitators as sign of weakness on the part of the\nauthorities and thus encourage them to step up the tempo of\ntheir activities or agitation. It is true that when prompt\naction is taken in order to prevent this happening, there is\nan element of deterrence in it but that is an unavoidable\nand necessary concomitance of such an action resulting from\na situation which is not of the creation of the authorities.\nAfter all, clause (b) is not meant to be applied in\nordinary, normal situations but in such situations where is\nnot reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry.\n\n The condition precedent for the application of clause\n\n(b) is the satisfaction of the disciplinary authority that\n\"it is not reasonably practicable to hold\" the inquiry\ncontemplated by clause (2) of \nArticle 311.\n What is pertinent\nto note is that the words used are \"not reasonably\npracticable\" and not \"impracticable\". According to the\nOxford English Dictionary \"practicable\" means \"Capable of\nbeing put into practice, carried out in action, effected,\naccomplished, or done; feasible\". Webster's Third New\nInternational Dictionary defines the word \"practicable\"\ninter alia as meaning \"possible to practice or perform :\n\ncapable of being put into practice, done or accomplished :\n\nfeasible\". Further, the words used are not \"not practicable\"\nbut \"not reasonably practicable\". Webster's Third New\nInternational Dictionary defines the word \"reasonably\" as\n\"in a reasonable manner : to a fairly sufficient extent\".\nThus, whether it was practicable to hold the inquiry or not\nmust be judged in the context of whether it was reasonably\npracticable to do so. It is not a total or absolute\nimpracticability which is required by clause (b). What is\nrequisite is that the holding of the inquiry is not\npracticable in the opinion of a reasonable man taking a\nreasonable view of the prevailing situation. It is not\npossible to enumerate the cases in which it would not be\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry, but some\ninstances by way of illustration may, however, be given. It\nwould not be reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry where\nthe government servant, particularly through or together\nwith his associates, so terrorizes, threatens or intimidate\nwitnesses who are going to given evidence against him with\nfear of reprisal as to prevent them from doing so or where\nthe government servant by himself or\n\n270\n\ntogether with or through other threatens, intimidates and\nterrorizes the officer who is the disciplinary authority or\nmember of his family so that he is afraid to hold the\ninquiry or direct it to be held. It would also not be\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry where an\natmosphere of violence or of general indiscipline and\ninsubordination prevails, and it is immaterial whether the\nconcerned government servant is or is not a party to\nbringing about such an atmosphere. In this connection, we\nmust bear in mind that numbers coerce and terrify while an\nindividual may not. The reasonable practicability of holding\nan inquiry is a matter of assessment to be made by the\ndisciplinary authority. Such authority is generally on the\nspot and knows what is happening. It is because the\ndisciplinary authority is the best judge of this that\nclause(3) of \nArticle 311\n makes the decision of the\ndisciplinary authority on this question final. A\ndisciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a\ndisciplinary inquiry lightly or arbitrarily or out of\nulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding of\nan inquiry or because the Department's case against the\ngovernment servant is weak and must fail. The finality given\nto the decision of the disciplinary authority by \nArticle\n311(3)\n is not binding upon the court so far as its power of\njudicial review is concerned and in such a case the court\nwill strike down the order dispensing with the inquiry as\nalso the order imposing penalty. \nThe case of \nArjun Chaubey\nv. Union of India and others\n, [1984] 3 S.C.R. 302, is an\ninstance in point. In that case, the appellant was working\nas a senior clerk in the office of the Chief Commercial\nSuperintendent, Northern Railway, Varanasi. The Senior\nCommercial Officer wrote a letter to the appellant calling\nupon him to submit his explanation with regard to twelve\ncharges of gross indiscipline mostly relating to the Deputy\nChief Commercial Superintendent. The appellant submitted his\nexplanation and on the very next day the Deputy Chief\nCommercial Superintendent served a second notice on the\nappellant saying that his explanation was not convincing and\nthat another chance was being given to him to offer his\nexplanation with respect to those charges. The appellant\nsubmitted his further explanation but on the very next day\nthe Deputy Chief Commercial Superintendent passed an order\ndismissing him on the ground that he was not fit to be\nretained in service. This Court struck down the order\nholding that seven out of twelve charges related to the\nconduct of the appellant with the Deputy Chief Commercial\nSuperintendent who was the disciplinary authority and that\nif an inquiry were to be held, the principal witness for the\nDepartment would have been the Deputy Chief Commercial\nSuperintendent himself, resulting in the same person being\nthe main accuser, the chief witness and also the judge of\nthe matter.\n\n271\n\n It was submitted that where a delinquent government\nservant so terrorizes the disciplinary authority that\nneither that officer nor any other officer stationed at that\nplace is willing to hold the inquiry, some senior officer\ncan be sent from outside to hold the inquiry. This\nsubmission itself shows that in such a case the holding of\nan inquiry is not reasonably practicable. It would be\nillogical to hold that the administrative work carried out\nby senior officers should be paralysed because a delinquent\ngovernment servant either by himself or along with or\nthrough others makes the holding of an inquiry not\nreasonably practicable.\n\n It is not necessary that a situation which makes the\nholding of an inquiry not reasonably practicable should\nexist before the disciplinary inquiry is initiated against a\ngovernment servant. Such a situation can also come into\nexistence subsequently during he course of an inquiry, for\ninstance, after the service of a charge-sheet upon the\ngovernment servant or after he has filed his written\nstatement thereto or even after evidence has been led in\npart. In such a case also the disciplinary authority would\nbe entitled to apply clause (b) of the second proviso\nbecause the word \"inquiry\" in that clause includes part of\nan inquiry. It would also not be reasonably practicable to\nafford to the government servant an opportunity of hearing\nor further hearing, as the case may be, when at the\ncommencement of the inquiry or pending it the government\nservant absconds and cannot be served or will not\nparticipate in the inquiry. In such cases, the matter must\nproceed ex parte and on the materials before the\ndisciplinary authority. Therefore, even where a part of an\ninquiry has been held and the rest is dispensed with under\nclause (b) or a provision in the service rules analogous\nthereto, the exclusionary words of the second proviso\noperate in their full vigour and the government servant\ncannot complain that he has been dismissed, removed or\nreduced in rank in violation of the safeguards provided by\n\nArticle 311(2).\n\n The second condition necessary for the valid\napplication of clause (b) of the second proviso is that the\ndisciplinary authority should record in writing its reason\nfor its satisfaction that it was not reasonably practicable\nto hold the inquiry contemplated by \nArticle 311(2).\n This is\na Constitutional obligation and if such reason is not\nrecorded in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry\nand the order of penalty following thereupon would both be\nvoid and unconstitutional.\n\n272\n\n It is obvious that the recording in writing of the\nreason for dispensing with the inquiry must proceed the\norder imposing the penalty. The reason for dispensing with\nthe inquiry need not, therefore, find a place in the final\norder. It would be usual to record the reason separately and\nthen consider the question of the penalty to be imposed and\npass the order imposing the penalty. It would, however, be\nbetter to record the reason in the final order in order to\navoid the allegation that the reason was not recorded in\nwriting before passing the final order but was subsequently\nfabricated. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need\nnot contain detailed particular, but the reason must not be\nvague or just a repetition of the language of clause (b) of\nthe second proviso. For instance, it would be no compliance\nwith the requirement of clause (b) for the disciplinary\nauthority simply to state that he was satisfied that it was\nnot reasonably practicable to hold any inquiry. Sometimes a\nsituation may be such that it is not reasonably practicable\nto give detailed reasons for dispensing with the inquiry.\nThis would not, however, per se invalidate the order. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits and in the light of\nits own facts and circumstances.\n\n It was vehemently contended that if reasons are not\nrecorded in the final order, they must be communicated to\nthe concerned government servant to enable him to challenge\nthe validity of that reasons in a departmental appeal or\nbefore a court of law and the failure to communicate the\nreasons would invalidate the order. This contention too\ncannot be accepted. The constitutional requirement in clause\n\n(b) is that the reason for dispensing with the inquiry\nshould be recorded in writing. There is no obligation to\ncommunicate the reason to the government servant. As clause\n(3) of \nArticle 311\n makes the decision of the disciplinary\nauthority on this point final, the question cannot be\nagitated in a departmental appeal, revision or review. The\nobligation to record the reason in writing is provided in\nclause (b) so that the superiors of the disciplinary\nauthority may be able to judge whether such authority had\nexercised its power under clause (b) properly or not with a\nview to judge the performance and capacity of that officer\nfor the purposes of promotion etc. It would, however, be\nbetter for the disciplinary authority to communicate to the\ngovernment servant its reason for dispensing with the\ninquiry because such communication would eliminate the\npossibility of an allegation being made that the reasons\nhave been subsequently fabricated. It would also enable the\ngovernment servant to approach the High Court under \nArticle\n226\n or, in\n\n273\n\na fit case, this Court under \nArticle 32.\n If the reasons are\nnot communicated to the government servant and the matter\ncomes to the court, the court can direct the reasons to be\nproduced, and furnished to the government servant and if\nstill not produced, a presumption should be drawn that the\nreasons were not recorded in writing and the impugned order\nwould then stand invalidated. Such presumption can, however,\nbe rebutted by a satisfactory explanation for the non-\n\nproduction of the written reasons.\n\n It was next submitted that though clause (b) of the\nsecond proviso excludes an inquiry into the charges made\nagainst a government servant, it does not exclude an inquiry\npreceding it, namely, an inquiry into whether the\ndisciplinary inquiry should be dispensed with or not, and\nthat in such a preliminary inquiry the government servant\nshould be given an opportunity of hearing by issuing to him\na notice to show cause why the inquiry should not be\ndispensed with so as to enable him to satisfy the\ndisciplinary authority that it would be reasonably\npracticable to hold the inquiry. This argument is illogical\nand is a contradiction in terms. If an inquiry into the\ncharges against a government servant is not reasonably\npracticable, it stands to reason that an inquiry into the\nquestion whether the disciplinary inquiry should be\ndispensed with or not is equally not reasonably practicable.\n\n A government servant who has been dismissed, removed or\nreduced in rank by applying to his case clause (b) or an\nanalogous provisions of a service rule is not wholly without\na remedy. As pointed out earlier while dealing with the\nvarious service rules, he can claim in a departmental appeal\nor revision that an inquiry be held with respect to the\ncharges on which the penalty of dismissal, removal or\nreduction in rank has been imposed upon him unless the same\nor a similar situation prevails at the time of hearing of\nthe appeal or revision application. If the same situation is\ncontinuing or a similar situation arises, it would not then\nbe reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry at the time of\nthe hearing of the appeal or revision. Though in such a case\nas the government servant if dismissed or removed from\nservice, is not continuing in service and if reduced in\nrank, is continuing in service with such reduced rank, no\nprejudice could be caused to the Government or the\nDepartment if the hearing of an appeal or revision\napplication, as the case may be, is postponed for a\nreasonable time.\n\n Where a government servant is dismissed, removed or\nreduced\n\n274\n\nin rank by applying clause (b) or an analogous provision of\nthe service rules and the approaches either the High Court\nunder \nArticle 226\n or this Court under \nArticle 32\n, the court\nwill interfere on grounds well established in law for the\nexercise of power of judicial review in matters where\nadministrative discretion is exercised. It will consider\nwhether clause (b) or an analogous provision in the service\nrules was properly applied or not. The finality given by\nclause (3) of \nArticle 311\n to the disciplinary authority's\ndecision that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the\ninquiry is not binding upon the court. The court will also\nexamine the charge of mala fides, if any, made in the writ\npetition. In examining the relevancy of the reasons, the\ncourt will consider the situation which according to the\ndisciplinary authority made it come to the conclusion that\nit was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry. If\nthe court finds that the reasons are irrelevant, then the\nrecording of its satisfaction by the disciplinary authority\nwould be an abuse of power conferred upon it by clause (b)\nand would take the case out of the purview of that clause\nand the impugned order of penalty would stand invalidated.\nIn considering the relevancy of the reasons given by the\ndisciplinary authority the court will not, however, sit in\njudgment over them like a court of first appeal. In order to\ndecide whether the reasons are germane to clause (b), the\ncourt must put itself in the place of the disciplinary\nauthority and consider what in the then prevailing situation\na reasonable man acting in a reasonable way would have done.\nThe matter will have to be judged in the light of the then\nprevailing situation and not as if the disciplinary\nauthority was deciding the question whether the inquiry\nshould be dispensed with or not in the cool and detached\natmosphere of a court room, removed in time from the\nsituation in question. Where two views are possible, the\ncourt will decline to interfere.\n\n During the course of the argument a reference was made\nto certain High Court decisions and their citations were\ngiven. We have carefully gone through those decisions. It\nis, however, unnecessary to refer to them. In so far as what\nwas held in those decisions or any of them is contrary to or\ninconsistent with what has been held by us, those decisions\nare not correct and are to that extent hereby overruled.\n\n The Second Proviso - Clause (c)\n We now turn to the last clause of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n , namely, clause (c). Though its exclusionary\n\n275\n\noperation on the safeguards provided in \nArticle 311(2)\n is\nthe same as those of the other two clauses, it is very\ndifferent in content from them. While under clause (b) the\nsatisfaction is to be of disciplinary authority, under\nclause (c) it is to be of the President or the Governor of a\nState, as the case may be. Further, while under clause (b)\nthe satisfaction has to be with respect to whether it is not\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry, under clause (c)\nit is to be with respect to whether it will not be expedient\nin the interest of the security of the State to hold the\ninquiry. Thus, in one case the test is of reasonable\npracticability of holding the inquiry, in the other case it\nis of the expediency of holding the inquiry. While clause\n\n(b) expressly requires that the reason for dispensing with\nthe inquiry should be recorded in writing, clause (c) does\nnot so require it, either expressly or impliedly.\n\n The expressions \"law and order\", \"public order\" and\n\"security of the State\" have been used in different Acts.\nSituations which affect \"public order\" are graver than those\nwhich affect \"law and order\" and situations which affect\n\"security of the State\" are graver than those which affect\n\"public order\". Thus, of these situations these which affect\n\"security of the State\" are the gravest. Danger to the\nsecurity of the State may arise from without or within the\nState. The expression \"security of the State\" does not mean\nsecurity of the entire country or a whole State. It includes\nsecurity of a part of the State. It also cannot be confined\nto an armed rebellion or revolt. There are various ways in\nwhich security of the State can be affected. It can be\naffected by State secrets or information relating to defence\nproduction or similar matters being passed on to other\ncountries, whether inimical or not to our country, or by\nsecret links with terrorists. It is difficult to enumerate\nthe various ways in which security of the State can be\naffected. The way in which security of the State is affected\nmay be either open or clandestine. Amongst the more obvious\nacts which affect the security of the State would be\ndisaffection in the Armed Forces or para-military Forces.\nDisaffection in any of these Forces is likely to spread, for\ndisaffected or dissatisfied members of these Forces spread\nsuch dissatisfaction and disaffection among other members of\nthe Force and thus induce them not to discharge their duties\nproperly and to commit acts of indiscipline, insubordination\nand disobedience to the orders of their superiors. Such a\nsituation cannot be a matter affecting only law and order or\npublic order but is a matter affecting vitally the security\nof the State. In this respect, the Police Force\n\n276\n\nstands very much on the same footing as a military or a\nparamilitary force for it is charged with the duty of\nensuring and maintaining law and order and public order, and\nbreaches of discipline and acts of disobedience and\ninsubordination on the part of the members of the Police\nForce cannot be viewed with less gravity than similar acts\non the part of the members of the military or para-military\nForces. How important the proper discharge of their duties\nby members of these Forces and the maintenance of discipline\namong them is considered can be seen from \nArticle 33\n of the\nConstitution. \nPrior to the Constitution (Fiftieth Amendment)\nAct, 1984\n, \nArticle 33\n provided as follows :\n\n \"33. Power to Parliament to modify the rights\n conferred by this Part in their application to\n Forces.\n\n Parliament may by law determine to what extent any\n of the rights conferred by this Part shall, in\n their application to the member of the Armed\n Forces or the Forces charged with the maintenance\n of public order, be restricted or abrogated so as\n to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and\n the maintenance of discipline among them.\"\n\nBy the Constitution (Fiftieth Amendment) Act, 1984\n, this\nArticle was substituted. By the substituted Article the\nscope of the Parliament's power to so restrict or abrogate\nthe application of any of the Fundamental Rights is made\nwider. The substituted \nArticle 33\n reads as follows :\n\n \"33. Power to Parliament to modify the rights\n conferred by this Part in their application to\n Forces, etc.\n Parliament may, by law, determine to what extent\n any of the rights conferred by this Part shall, in\n their application to,\n\n (a) the members of the Armed Forces ; or\n\n (b) the members of the Forces charged with the\n maintenance of public order; or\n\n (c) persons employed in any bureau or other\n organisation established by the State for purposes\n of intelligence or counter intelligence; or\n\n277\n\n (d) persons employed in, or in connection with,\n the telecommunication systems set up for the\n purposes of any Force, bureau or organisation\n referred to in clauses (a) to (c),\n be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the\n proper discharge of their duties and the\n maintenance of discipline among them.\"\n\nThus, the discharge of their duties by the members of these\nForces and the maintenance of discipline amongst them is\nconsidered of such vital importance to the country that in\norder to ensure this the Constitution has conferred upon\nParliament to restrict or abrogate to them.\n\n The question under clause (c), however, is not whether\nthe security of the State has been affected or not, for the\nexpression used in clause (c) is \"in the interest of the\nsecurity of the State\". The interest of the security of the\nState may be affected by actual acts or even the likelihood\nof such acts taking place. Further, what is required under\nclause (c) is not the satisfaction of the President or the\nGovernor, as the case may be, that the interest of the\nsecurity of the State is or will be affected but his\nsatisfaction that in the interest of the security of the\nState, it is not expedient to hold an inquiry as\ncontemplated by \nArticle 311(2).\n The satisfaction of the\nPresident or Governor must, therefore be with respect to the\nexpediency or inexpediency of holding an inquiry in the\ninterest of the security of the State. The Shorter Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, Third Edition, defines the word\n\"inexpedient\" as meaning \"not expedient; disadvantageous in\nthe circumstances, unadvisable impolitic.\" The same\ndictionary defines \"expedient\" as meaning inter alia\n\"advantageous; fit, proper, or suitable to the circumstances\nof the case.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary\nalso defines the term \"expedient\" as meaning inter alia\n\"characterized by suitability, practicality, and efficiency\nin achieving a particular end : fit, proper, or advantageous\nunder the circumstances.\" It must be borne in mind that the\nsatisfaction required by clause (c) is of the Constitutional\nHead of the whole country or of the State. Under \nArticle\n74(1)\n of the Constitution, the satisfaction of the President\nwould be arrived at with the aid and advice of his Council\nof Ministers with the Prime Minister as the Head and in the\ncase of a State by reason of the provisions of \nArticle\n163(1)\n by the Governor acting with the aid and advice of his\nCouncil of\n\n278\n\nMinisters with the Chief Minister as the Head. Whenever,\ntherefore, the President or the Governor in the\nConstitutional sense is satisfied that it will not be\nadvantageous or fit or proper or suitable or politic in the\ninterest of the security of the State to hold an inquiry, he\nwould be entitled to dispense with it under clause (c). The\nsatisfaction so reached by the President or the Governor\nmust necessarily be a subjective satisfaction. Expediency\ninvolves matters of policy. Satisfaction may be arrived at\nas a result of secret information received by the Government\nabout the brewing danger to the security of the State and\nlike matters. There may be other factors which may be\nrequired to be considered, weighed and balanced in order to\nreach the requisite satisfaction whether holding an inquiry\nwould be expedient or not. If the requisite satisfaction has\nbeen reached as a result of secret information received by\nthe Government, making, known such information may very\noften result in disclosure of the source of such\ninformation. Once known, the particular source from which\nthe information was received would no more be available to\nthe Government. The reasons for the satisfaction reached by\nthe President or Governor under clause (c) cannot,\ntherefore, be required to be recorded in the order of\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank nor can they be made\npublic.\n\n In the case of clause (b) of the second proviso, clause\n(3) of \nArticle 311\n makes the decision of the disciplinary\nauthority that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the\ninquiry final. There is no such clause in \nArticle 311\n with\nrespect to the satisfaction reached by the President or the\nGovernor under clause (c) of the second proviso. There are\ntwo reasons for this. There can be no departmental appeal or\nother departmental remedy against the satisfaction reached\nby the President or the Governor; and so far as the Court's\npower of judicial review is concerned, the Court cannot sit\nin judgment over State policy or the wisdom or otherwise of\nsuch policy. The court equally cannot be the judge of\nexpediency or inexpediency. Given a known situation, it is\nnot for the Court to decide whether it was expedient or\ninexpedient in the circumstances of the case to dispense\nwith the inquiry. The satisfaction reached by the President\nor Governor under clause (c) is subjective satisfaction and,\ntherefore, would not be a fit matter for judicial review.\nRelying upon the observations of Bhagwati, J., in State of\nRajasthan and others etc. etc. v. Union of India etc.etc.,\n[1978] 1 S.C.R. 1, 82, it was submitted that the power of\njudicial review is not excluded where the satisfaction of\nthe President or the Governor\n\n279\n\nhas been reached mala fide or is based on wholly extraneous\nor irrelevant grounds because in such a case, in law there\nwould be no satisfaction of the President or the Governor at\nall. It is unnecessary to decide this question because in\nthe matters under clause (c) before us, all the materials\nincluding the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers,\nhave been produced and they clearly show that in those cases\nthe satisfaction of the Governor was neither reached mala\nfide nor was it based on any extraneous or irrelevant\nground.\n\n It was further submitted that what is required by\nclause (c) is that the holding of the inquiry should not be\nexpedient in the interest of the security of the State and\nnot the actual conduct of a government servant which would\nbe the subject-matter of the inquiry. This submission is\ncorrect so far as it goes but what it overlooks is that in\nan inquiry into acts affecting the interest of the security\nof the State, several matters not fit or proper to be made\npublic, including the source of information involving a\ngovernment servant in such acts, would be disclosed and thus\nin cases such as these an inquiry into acts prejudicial to\nthe interest of the security of the State would prejudice\nthe interest of the security of the State as much as those\nacts would.\n\n It was also submitted that the Government must produce\nbefore the court all materials upon which the satisfaction\nof the President or the Governor, as the case may be, was\nreached. So far as the advice given by the Council of\nMinisters to the President or the Governor is concerned,\nthis submission is negatived by the express provisions of\nthe Constitution. Article 74(2) of the Constitution provides\n:\n\n \"(2) The question whether any, and if so what,\n advice was tendered by Ministers to the President\n shall not be inquired into in any Court.\"\n\n Similarly, \nArticle 163(3)\n provides :\n\n \"(3) The question whether any, and if so what,\n advice was tendered by Ministers to the Governor\n shall not be inquired into in any Court.\"\n\n It was then submitted that leaving aside the advice\ngiven by the Ministers to the President or the Governor, the\nGovernment is bound to disclose at least the materials upon\nwhich the advice of\n\n280\n\nthe Council of Ministers was based so that the Court can\nexamine whether the satisfaction of the President or the\nGovernor, as the case may be, was arrived at mala fide or\nbased on wholly extraneous and irrelevant grounds so that\nsuch satisfaction would in law amount to no satisfaction at\nall. It was further submitted that if the Government does\nnot voluntarily disclose such materials it can be compelled\nby the Court to do so. Whether this should be done or not\nwould depend upon whether the documents in question fall\nwithin the class of privileged documents and whether in\nrespect of them privilege has been properly claimed or not.\nIt is unnecessary to examine this question any further\nbecause in the cases under clause (c) before us though at\nfirst privilege was claimed, at the hearing privilege was\nwaived and the materials as also the advice given by the\nMinisters to the Governor of Madhya Pradesh who had passed\nthe impugned orders in those cases were disclosed.\n\n The Nature of the Challenge to the Impugned orders\n In all matters before us the challenge to the validity\nof the impugned orders was confined only to legal grounds,\nthe main ground being based upon what was held in\nChallappan's case and the application of principles of\nnatural justice. The contentions with respect to these\ngrounds have been considered by us in the preceding part of\nthis Judgment and have been negatived. In most of the\nmatters the Writ Petitions contain no detailed facts.\nSeveral of the Petitioners have gone in departmental appeal\nbut that fact is not mentioned in the Writ Petitions nor the\norder of the appellate authority challenged where the\nappeals have been dismissed. Many government servants have\ncombine together to file one Writ Petition and in the case\nof such of them whose departmental appeals have been allowed\nand they reinstated in service, the Petitions have not been\namended so as to delete their names and they have continued\nto remain on the record as Petitioners. Several Petitions\nare in identical terms, if not, almost exact copies of other\nPetitions. No attempt has been made in such matters to\ndistinguish the case of one Petitioner from the other. Apart\nfrom contesting the legal validity of the impugned orders,\nhardly any one has even stated in his Petition that he was\nnot involved in the situation which has led to clause (b) or\nclause (c) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311\n being\napplied in his case. There is no allegation of mala fide\nagainst the authority passing the impugned orders except at\ntimes a more bare allegation that the order was passed mala\nfide. No particulars whatever of such alleged mala fides\nhave been given.\n\n281\n\nSuch a bare averment cannot amount to a plea of mala fides\nand requires to be ignored. In this unsatisfactory state of\naffairs go far as facts are concerned, the only course which\nthis Court can adopt is to consider whether the relevant\nclause of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or of an\nanalogous service rule has been properly applied or not. If\nthis Court finds that such provision has not been properly\napplied, the Appellant or the Petitioner, as the case may\nbe, is entitled to succeed. If, however, we find that it has\nbeen properly applied, the Appeal or Petition would be\nliable to be dismissed, because there are no proper\nmaterials before the Court to investigate and ascertain\nwhether any particular government servant was, in fact,\nguilty of the charges made against him or not. It is also\nnot the function of this Court to do so because it would\ninvolve an inquiry into disputed questions of facts and this\nCourt will not, except in a rare case, embark upon such an\ninquiry. For these reasons and in view of the directions we\npropose to give while disposing of these matters, we will\nwhile dealing with facts refrain from touching any aspect\nexcept whether the particular clause of the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2)\n or an analogous service rule was properly\napplied or not.\n\n C.A. No. 6814 of 1983\n\n Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983 is the only matter before\nus under clause (a) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2).\n\n The respondent, Tulsiram Patel, was a permanent auditor\nin the Regional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. It appears\nthat orders were issued by Headquarters, C.D.A. C.C.,\nMeerut, stopping the increment of the Respondent for one\nyear. One Raj Kumar Jairath was at the relevant time the\nRegional Audit Officer, M.E.S., Jabalpur. On July 27,1976,\nthe Respondent went to Raj Kumar's office and demanded an\nexplanation from him as to why he had stopped his increment\nwhereupon Raj Kumar replied that he was nobody to stop his\nincrement. The Respondent then struck Raj Kumar on the head\nwith an iron rod. Raj Kumar fell down, his head bleeding.\nThe Respondent was tried and convicted under \nsection 332\n of\nthe Indian Penal Code by the First Class Judicial\nMagistrate, Jabalpur. The Magistrate instead of sentencing\nthe Respondent to imprisonment applied to him the provisions\nof \nsection 4\n of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, and\nreleased him on his executing a bond of good behaviour for a\nperiod of one year. The Respondents appeal against his\nconviction was dismissed by the Sessions Judge, Jabalpur.\nThe Controller General of\n\n282\n\nDefence Accounts, who was the disciplinary authority in the\ncase, imposed upon the Respondent the penalty of compulsory\nretirement under clause (i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services\nRules. The said order was in the following terms :\n\n \"WHEREAS Shri T.R. Patel, Pt. Auditor (Account\n No.8295888) has been convicted on a criminal\n charge, to wit, under \nSection 332\n of I.P.C.,\n WHEREAS it is considered that the conduct of the\n said Shri T.R.Patel, Pt.Auditor,(Account No.\n 8295888) which has led to his conviction, is such\n as to render his further retention in the public\n service undesirable,\n Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers\n conferred by Rule 19(i) of the Central Civil\n Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)\n Rules, 1965, the undersigned hereby direct that\n the said Shri T.R. Patel, Pt. Auditor, (Account\n No.8295888) shall be compulsorily retired from\n service with effect from 25.11.1980.\"\n\nThe Respondent thereupon filed a departmental appeal which\nwas dismissed.\n\n Thereafter the Respondent filed in the Madhya Pradesh\nHigh Court a writ petition under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of the\nConstitution. Relying upon Challappan's Case the High Court\nheld that no opportunity had been afforded to the Respondent\nbefore imposing the penalty of compulsory retirement on him.\nIt further held that the impugned order was defective\ninasmuch as it did not indicate the circumstances which were\nconsidered by the disciplinary authority except the fact of\nconviction of the Respondent.\n\n We are unable to agree with either of the two reasons\ngiven by the High Court for setting aside the order of\ncompulsory retirement. So far as the first ground upon which\nthe High Court proceeded is concerned, as already pointed\nout that part of the judgment in Challapan's case is not\ncorrect and it was, therefore, not necessary to give to the\nRespondent any opportunity of hearing before imposing the\npenalty of compulsory retirement on him.\n\n It was, however, argued that the penalty imposed upon\nthe Respondent was not of dismissal or removal from service\nbut of\n\n283\n\ncompulsory retirement and, therefore, clause (a) of \nArticle\n311(2)\n did not apply. The argument cannot be accepted. The\ncompulsory retirement of the Respondent was not by reason of\nhis reaching the age of superannuation or under other rules\nwhich provide for compulsorily retiring a government servant\non his completing the qualifying period of service. The\norder of compulsory retirement in this case was under clause\n\n(i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules and was by way of\nimposing upon him one of the major penalties provided for in\nRule 11. It is now well settled by decisions of this Court\nthat where an order of compulsory retirement is imposed by\nway of penalty, it amounts to removal from service and the\nprovisions of \nArticle 311\n are attracted. (See \nState of U.P.\nv. Shyam Lal Sharma\n, [1972] 1 S.C.R. 184,189 and the cases\nreferred to therein).\n\n The second ground upon which the High Court rested its\ndecision is equally unsustainable. The circumstances which\nwere taken into consideration by the disciplinary authority\nhave been sufficiently set out in the order of compulsory\nretirement, they being that the Respondent's conviction\nunder \nsection 332\n of the Indian Penal Code and the nature of\nthe offence committed which led the disciplinary authority\nto the conclusion that the further retention of the\nRespondent in the public service was undesirable. The\nmention of \nsection 332\n of the Indian Penal Code in the said\norder itself shows that Respondent was himself a public\nservant and had voluntarily caused hurt to another public\nservant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant\nor in consequence of an act done by that person in the\nlawful discharge of his duty. The facts here are eloquent\nand speak for themselves. The Respondent had gone to the\noffice of his superior officer and had hit him on the head\nwith an iron rod. It was fortunate that the skull of Raj\nKumar was not fractured otherwise the offence committed\nwould have been the more serious one under section 333. The\nRespondent was lucky in being dealt with leniently by the\nMagistrate but these facts clearly show that his retention\nin public service was undesirable. In fact, the conduct of\nthe Respondent was such that he merited the penalty of\ndismissal from government service and it is clear that by\nimposing upon him only the penalty of compulsory retirement,\nthe disciplinary authority had in his mind the fact that the\nMagistrate had released him on probation. We accordingly\nhold that clause (i) of Rule 19 of the Civil Services Rules\nwas rightly applied to the case of the Respondent.\n\n284\n\n This Appeal, therefore, requires to be allowed and the\nwrit petition filed by the Respondent in the Madhya Pradesh\nHigh Court deserves to be dismissed.\n\n CISF Matters\n Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 - Union of India and\nothers v. Sada Nand Jha and others and Civil Appeal No. 3512\nof 1982 - Union of India and others v. G.P.Koushal- relate\nto the members of the CIS Force who were dismissed from the\nForce after dispensing with the disciplinary inquiry by\napplying clause (b) of Rule 37 of the CISF Rules read with\nclause (b) of the second proviso of \nArticle 311(2).\n All\nexcept one of them filed a writ petition in the Patna High\nCourt while the remaining one filed a writ petition in the\nMadhya Pradesh High Court. Both the High Courts allowed the\nwrit petitions relying upon the decisions in Challappan's\ncase. Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 is directed against the\njudgment of the Patna High Court while Civil Appeal No. 3512\nof 1982 is directed against the judgment of the Madhaya\nPradesh High Court.\n\n Before dealing with the relevant facts, we may mention\nthat the counter affidavit filed to the writ petition in\nboth the said High Courts were unsatisfactory. At the\nhearing of these Appeals an application was made on behalf\nof the Appellants for leave to file a supplementary return.\nThis application was granted by us in the interest of\njustice and the supplementary Return annexed to the said\napplication was taken on the record. We will now briefly set\nout the facts which led to the passing of the impugned\norders. The Respondents in Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 are\ndismissed members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro Steel Plant of\nthe Bokaro Steel Limited situate at Bokaro in the State of\nBihar temporary security guard in the CISF Unit posted at\nSecurity Paper Mill at Hoshangabad in the State of Madhya\nPradesh. We will first deal with the facts of Civil Appeal\nNo. 3484 of 1982. The members of the CISF Unit at Bokaro had\nformed an all-India association in March 1979 and one\nSadanand Jha, Respondent No. 1, was elected as its General\nSecretary. Thereafter, a country wide agitation was carried\non for recognition of the said association. In June 1979\nsome of the members of the said association were called upon\nto meet the Home Minister at Delhi. A delegation of the said\nassociation went to Delhi. While there they staged a\ndemonstration. Some of the demonstrators, including Sadanand\nJha, were arrested. What happened thereafter can best be\nrelated by extracting paragraphs 3 to 9 of the supplementary\nReturn filed by Shri Madan Gopal, the Deputy Inspector-\nGeneral, CISF Unit of Bokaro Steel Plant, Bokaro, pursuant\nto the leave granted by this Court. These paragraphs read as\nfollows :\n\n285\n\n \"3. The said persons were arrested at Delhi, but\n subsequently released on bail. At Bokaro Steel\n Plant, the agitation which was going on assumed\n aggravated from on and from 27th May, 1979. Out of\n 1900 persons belonging to CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel\n Plant, Bokaro about 1000 persons participated in\n the processions and violent demonstrations. The\n said employees indulged in agitational acts and\n violent indiscipline. The said personnel unleashed\n a reign of terror in the unit lines and openly\n incited others to disobey the lawful orders. The\n said persons indulged in several acts of violence\n and created a very serious law & order problem and\n an atmosphere of collective violence and\n intimidation. The said agitation and the violent\n activity reached a very serious proportion in the\n last week of June, 1979 with the result that Army\n had to be called by the State Authorities on\n 23.6.1979. Annexed hereto and marked Annexure AFD-\n I is the request from the Home Commissioner,\n Bihar Government to the Ministry of Defence,\n Government of India dated 23.6.1979 requesting for\n the deployment of the Army so as to restore\n normalcy in the area. The State Government had\n also deployed 9 Magistrates to assist the Army\n authorities as also the CRPF for restoring the\n normal conditions at the Bokaro Steel Plant. A\n copy of the order is enclosed herewith and market\n as Annexure AFD-II\n\n 4. On 24.6.1979, on seeing the arrival of the\n Army, the agitators started making preparations\n for armed resistance by putting up sand bags,\n flood lights and barricades in the CISF Lines.\n They had gained the control of CISF Lines and the\n Officers were not allowed to have any access to\n the Lines or to other ranks of CISF.\n\n 5. On 25.6.1979, the Army along with 9 Magistrates\n took up positions round the CISF Lines in the\n early hours and called upon the agitators to give\n up charge of the Armoury. Inspite of giving\n repeated warnings by the authorities to give up\n charge of the Armoury, the agitators did not give\n up arms, but, instead, resorted to violence. The\n agitators started firing at 0320 hours at the\n Army. The Army returned the fire. The said\n exchange of fire continued for 3 hours before the\n Army could spell out the violent retaliation of\n\n286\n\n the agitators. The said violent exchange of fire\n resulted in the instant death of one Army Major\n and 2 more Army personnel were also killed as a\n result of firing by the CISF personnel.\n\n 6. It may also be stated that there were 22 death\n in the course of the said pitched battle, which\n went on for three hours between the violent armed\n agitators and the Army.\n\n 7. In regard to the aforesaid violent activities\n and the commission of offences, about 800\n personnel were rounded up by the Army and later on\n arrested by the local police. It is pertinent to\n mention here that at the relevant time, about 1900\n personnel were deployed in CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel\n Plant, Bokaro. More than 1000 personnel\n participated in the aforesaid agitational\n activities. Besides the persons arrested by the\n authorities concerned, a substantial number of\n agitators were at large. Most of them either fled\n away or went underground and large number of arms\n and ammunitions were also with them. The search\n and seizure of arms and ammunition were going on\n and as a result thereof up till 1.7.1979, 65\n rifles along with large quantity of ammunitions,\n 11 Molotov cooktails, 20 kgs. of sulphur, 20 kgs\n of glass chips and other explosives and 1048\n empties of .303 ammunition were recovered from the\n area after the Army action. A copy of the FIR\n lodged in connection with aforesaid commission of\n offences is annexed herewith and marked as\n Annexure (AFD-III).\n\n 8. Notwithstanding the arrest of the said about\n 800 employees, as aforesaid, atmosphere at the\n Bokaro Steel Plant continued to be vitiated due to\n terror and collective fear and the functioning of\n the CISF Unit and its administration at Bokaro had\n completely broken down. It was only Army which\n could control the situation by its continued\n presence. The Army was withdrawn from the Bokaro\n Steel Plant only on or about 2.7.1979, however it\n may not be out of place to mention here that\n although the Army was withdrawn in the early July,\n 1979 but atmosphere of terror and tension\n continued for a couple of months. The CRPF\n continued performing security duties till Nov. 79.\n Besides this\n\n287\n\n Bihar Military Police took charge of armoury from\n army and continued to perform some of armed duties\n of CISF as CISF Unit was not in a position to\n function normally for a considerable time. Even\n the State authority apprehended a dangerous\n situation after the Army action including threat\n to lives of senior officers of CISF.\n\n 9. In the meanwhile, having regard to the violent\n and disturbed situation which prevailed in the\n Bokaro Steel Plant as also the collective actions\n of violence, mass terror and intimidation and\n threats to supervisory and loyal staff, it was\n reasonably believed that any inquiry in accordance\n with the provisions of the Rules 34, 35 and 36 of\n CISF Rules, 1969 or in accordance with the\n requirements of \nArticle 311(2)\n would be dangerous,\n counter productive and would aggravate the already\n existing dangerous situation. It was also\n reasonably believed that the circumstances were\n such as would make the holding of any inquiry\n self-defeating, subversive or would result in\n consequent detriment to public interest. It was in\n these circumstances that the concerned authorities\n formed reasonable nexus that any inquiry in\n accordance with the rules was reasonably\n impracticable and impugned orders were passed in\n view thereof.\"\n\n We see no reason to doubt the above statements made by\nShri Madan Gopal in the Supplementary Return for these\nstatements are supported by documents which have been\nannexed to the Supplementary Return. The facts set out in\nthe above paragraphs of the Supplementary Return are\neloquent and speak for themselves. They are also reflected\nin the impugned order. All the impugned orders are in the\nsame terms apart from the mention of the name and service\nnumber of the particular member of the said CISF Unit\nagainst whom the order is made. By way of a specimen we set\nout below the impugned order dated June 29, 1979, made in\nthe case of Sadanand Jha. The said order is as follows :\n\n \"Whereas a large group of members of Central\n Industrial Security Force (hereinafter referred to\n as the Force) of CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Ltd.,\n Bokaro have indulged and still continue to indulge\n in acts of insubordination and indiscipline,\n dereliction of duty, absenting from PT and parade,\n taking out processions\n\n288\n\n and raising slogans such as 'INQULAB ZINDABAD'.\n 'VARDI VARDI VARDI BHAI BHAI LARKE LENGE PAI PAI'\n 'JO HAMSE TAKRAYEGE CHOOR CHOOR HO JAYEGA'and\n 'PUNJAB KI JEET HAMARI HAI AAB CISF KI BARI HAI',\n participating in the gherao of Supervisory\n Officers, participating hunger strike and 'dharna'\n near the Quarter Guard and Administrative Building\n of CISF Unit, Bokaro Steel Ltd., since 27th May\n 1979 in violation of the provisions of \nCISF Act,\n 1968\n and instructions of the Superior Officers and\n in complete disregard of their duties as members\n of the Force;\n\n And whereas the aforesaid group also indulged in\nthreats of violence, bodily harm and other acts of\nintimation to Supervisory Officers and loyal members of the\nForce;\n\n And whereas by the aforesaid collective action, the\nmembers of the Force have created a situation whereby the\nnormal functioning of the Force at the aforesaid CISF Unit\nhas been rendered difficult and impossible;\n\n And whereas 7205199 Security Guard Sada Nand Jha as an\nactive participant of the aforesaid group has been extremely\nremiss and negligent in the discharge of his duty and has\nproved totally unfit for the same by absenting himself from\nparade unauthorisedly and indulging in various acts of\nextreme indiscipline and mis-conduct, as aforesaid;\n\n And whereas I am satisfied that in the facts and\ncircumstances, any attempt to hold departmental inquiry by\nserving a written charge-sheet and following other\nprocedures in the manner provided in rules 35 and 36 of the\nCISF Rules, 1969 will be frustrated by the collective action\non the part of the aforesaid group and hence it is not\nreasonably practicable to hold such inquiry;\n\n And whereas on a consideration of the facts and\ncircumstances of the case I am satisfied that the penalty of\ndismissal from service should be imposed on 7205199 Security\nGuard Sada Nand Jha;\n\n Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by\nsub-rule (b) of the rule 37 of the CISF Rules, 1969 read\nwith clause (b) of the second proviso to clause (2) of\n\nArticle 311\n of the\n\n289\n\nConstitution, I hereby order that 7205199 Security Guard\nSada Nand Jha be dismissed from service with immediate\neffect.\"\n\n The CIS Force has been constituted under the \nCISF Act\n\nfor the better protection and security of industrial\nundertakings owned by the Government. Under \nsection 14\n of\nthe Act, the Inspector-General of the CIS Force may on a\nrequest in that behalf from the Managing Director of an\nIndustrial undertaking in public sector, showing the\nnecessity thereof, depute such number of supervisory\nofficers and members of the CIS Force as the Inspector-\nGeneral may consider necessary for the protection and\nsecurity of that industrial undertaking and any installation\nattached thereto. The purpose of constituting the CIS Force\nis set out in the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the\nBill which when enacted became the \nCISF Act\n. The said\nStatement of Objects and Reasons is published in the Gazette\nof India Extraordinary dated August 2, 1966, Part II,\n\nSection 2\n, at page 435, and is as follows :\n\n \"At present security arrangements at important\n industrial undertakings in the public sector are\n handled by the Watch and Ward staff of the\n Organization concerned. The Watch and Ward staff\n is generally engaged in guarding the entrances or\n the perimeter of the industrial undertaking and in\n preventing entries of unauthorized persons.\n Unplanned recruitment, inadequate supervision,\n training and discipline have made the existing\n watch and ward staff ill equipped to discharge its\n responsibilities. It is considered necessary to\n strengthen the security arrangements in vital\n industrial undertakings. For that purpose it is\n proposed to constitute a centrally recruited,\n organised and trained Industrial Security Force.\n The Force will primarily be responsible for the\n watch and ward of industrial undertakings owned by\n the Central Government and may be deployed at the\n request and cost of managements, for security\n duties of industrial undertakings in public\n sector.\"\n\n The CIS Force is an Armed Force and the security duties\nto be performed by the CIS Force are of vital importance to\nthe industrial production of the country. The CIS Force has\nbeen conferred very wide powers. Under \nSection 11\n of the\nCISF Act, any supervisory officer or member of the Force\nmay, without any order\n\n290\n\nfrom a Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person\nwho has been concerned in or against whom a reasonable\nsuspicion exists of his having been concerned in or who is\nfound taking precautions to conceal his presence under\ncircumstances which afford reason to believe that he is\ntaking such precautions with a view to committing a\ncognizable offence relating to the property belonging to any\nindustrial undertaking or other installations. Similarly,\nunder \nsection 12\n for the same purpose a supervisory officer\nor member of the CIS Force, not below the prescribed rank,\nhas the power to search the person and belongings of any\nperson whom he has reason to believe to have committed any\nsuch offence as is referred to in \nsection 11\n. From what is\nstated above, it is obvious that in a Force entrusted with\nsuch large responsibility, maintenance of discipline is most\nessential and this is made clear by \nsection 18(1)\n of the\nCISF Act which provides as follows :\n\n \"18. Penalties for neglect of duty, etc.-\n\n (1) Without prejudice to the provisions contained\n in \nSection 8\n, every member of the Force who shall\n be guilty of any violation of duty or wilful\n breach or neglect of any rule or regulation or\n lawful order made by a supervisory officer, or who\n shall withdraw from the duties of his office\n without permission, or who, being absent on leave,\n fails, without reasonable cause, to report himself\n for duty on the expiration of the leave or who\n engages himself without authority in any\n employment other than his duty as a member of the\n Force, or who shall be guilty of cowardice, shall,\n on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a\n term which may extend to six months.\"\n\nUnder \nsection 19\n of the CISF Act, the Police (Incitement to\nDisaffection) Act, 1922, applies to supervisory officers and\nmembers of the CIS Force as it applies to members of a\nPolice Force. Under \nsection 20\n, neither the \nPayment of Wages\nAct, 1936\n, nor the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n, nor the\n\nFactories Act, 1948\n, nor any corresponding State Act applies\nto the member of the CIS Force.\n\n The facts set out in the Supplementary Return of Shri\nMohan Gopal and in the impugned orders show that there was a\ntotal breakdown of discipline in the CIS Force. There was a\nwilful and deliberate disobedience of orders of the\nsupervisory officers and 'gherao' of such officers. There\nwas a hunger strike, dharna,\n\n291\n\nshouting of revellious slogans and threats of violence and\nbodily harm to supervisory officers and acts tending to\nintimidate the supervisory officers and loyal members of the\nstaff. There were acts of insubordination and deliberate\nneglect and wilful violation of their duties by a very large\nsection of the members of the CIS Force stationed at Bokaro.\nAll these acts virtually amounted to a mutiny and how grave\nthe situation was can be judge from the fact that the army\nhad to be called out and a pitched battle took place between\nthe army and the members of the Force. No person with any\nreason or sence of responsibility can say that in such a\nsituation the holding of an inquiry was reasonably\npracticable.\n\n It was said that the impugned orders did not set out\nthe particular acts done by each of the members of the CIS\nForce in respect of whom the dismissal orders was made, and\nthese were merely cyclostyled orders with the names of\nindividual members of the CIS Force filled in. Here was a\ncase very much like a case under \nsection 149\n of the Indian\nPenal Code. The acts alleged were not of any particular\nindividual acting by himself. These were acts of a large\ngroup acting collectively with the common object of coercing\nthose in charge of the administration of the CIS Force and\nthe Government in order to obtain recognition for their\nassociation and to concede their demands. It is not possible\nin a situation such as this to particularize the acts of\neach individual members who participated in the commission\nof these acts. The participation of each individual may be\nof greater or lesser degree but the acts of each individual\ncontributed to the creation of a situation in which a\nsecurity force itself became a security risk.\n\n It was submitted at the Bar that the real reason for\npassing the orders impugned in Civil Appeal No. 1484 of 1982\nwas the encounter with the army on June 25, 1979, and this\nreal reason as not mentioned in the impugned order because\nthe Respondents had been arrested and were being prosecuted\nand, therefore, before passing the impugned orders, the\ndisciplinary authority would have had to wait till the\nprosecutions were over. Such an allegation has not been made\nin the writ petition filed in the High Court. In fact, there\nis no mention in the writ petition of the help of the army\nbeing sought or of the encounter with the army. The impugned\norders mentioned the reasons why they were passed. Then\nSupplementary Returns bears out these reasons. We have,\ntherefore, no hesitation in accepting what is stated in the\n\n292\n\nimpugned orders. In our opinion, clause (b) of Rule 37 of\nthe CISF Rules and clause (b) of the second proviso to\n\nArticle 311(2)\n were properly applied to the cases of the\nRespondents.\n\n Finally, a grievance was made at the Bar that the\ndismissed members of the CIS Force had filed departmental\nappeals and the appeals of those who had been discharged by\nthe Magistrate were allowed and these appellants were\nreinstated. We do not know how far this is correct nor the\nreasons for allowing such appeals, but if what is stated is\nture, it is not fair and the remaining appeals should be\ndisposed of as early as possible.\n\n The impugned order in Civil Appeal No. 3512 of 1982 is\nin the same terms as the impugned orders in Civil Appeal No.\n3484 of 1982. The situation at Hoshangabad was very much the\nsame as at Bokaro and in our opinion clause (b) of Rule 37\nof the CISF Rules and clause (b) of the second proviso to\nclause (2) of \nArticle 311\n were properly applied to the case\nof the Respondent.\n\n Both these Appeals, therefore, require to be allowed.\n Railway Service Matters\n Civil Appeals Nos. 3231 of 1981 and 4067 of 1983 and\nall the writ petitions filed in this Court (except Writ\nPetitions Nos. 1953 of 1981, 7393,1392 and 2022 of 1981) and\nall Transferred Cases, that is, writ petitions filed in High\nCourts and transferred to this Court, relate to railway\nservants who were either dismissed or removed from service\nby applying to their cases either clause (ii) of Rule 14 of\nthe Railway Servants Rules or clause (b) of the second\nproviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or clause (ii) of Rule 14 read\nwith clause (b) of the second proviso.\n\n We have carefully gone through the facts of each of\nthese cases. The majority of the railway employees who were\ndismissed or removed are alleged to have been concerned in\nincident which took place in all-India strikes of railway\nemployees. Many of these employees belonged to the all-India\nloco-running staff.\n\n The proper running of the railway service is vital to\nthe country. Railway trains carry not only those going for a\nholiday but also those who commute to work or business. In\ncertain cities, for instance - Bombay, Lakhs commute daily\nby train for\n\n293\n\nthis purpose. The railway trains also carry those going to\nattend the funeral or obsequiel ceremonies of near and dear\nones and equally they carry marriage parties. They carry\nthose who are in urgent need of medical treatment or have\nbeen seriously injured and not having proper medical aid in\nthe places where they reside, have to be rushed to the\nnearest town, city or district headquarter where such\nmedical aid is available. They carry essential commodities\nlike foodgrains, oil, etc. They carry equipment and\nmachinery vital for the needs of the country. In times of\ndisturbances they carry members of the Defence Forces and\nthe Central Reserve Police Force. \nIn this connection, it is\npertinent to note what Shah,J., as he then was, had to say\nin \nMoti Ram Dekh\n's case (at pages 795-6) about the railway\nadministration and employment in railway service:\n\n \"... employment in the Railways is in a vitally\n important establishment of the Union in which the\n employees are entrusted with valuable equipment\n and a large measure of confidence has to be\n reposed in them and on the due discharge of the\n duties the safety of the public and the efficient\n functioning of the governmental duties depend. Not\n only the travelling public, but the Union and the\n States have in a considerable measure to depend\n upon rail transport for the functioning of the\n governmental machinery and its welfare activities.\n\n It would be possible even for one or a few\n employees of the Railway to paralyse\n communications and movement of essential supplies\n leading to disorder and confusion. The Railway\n service has therefore a special responsibility in\n the smooth functioning of our body politic....\"\n\n \nAs pointed out in \nKameshwar Prasad and others v. The\nState of Bihar and another\n (at page 385) there is no\nFundamental Right to resort to a strike. A strike is only\nlegal if an Act permits it and only if it is called in\ncompliance with the conditions prescribed by the Act. The\ndefinition of \"public utility service\" in clause (n) of\n\nsection 2\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, includes and\nrailway service. The term \"strike\" is defined in clause (q)\nof \nsection 2\n of the said Act. The said clause (q) is as\nfollows :\n\n \"strike' means a cessation of work by a body of\n persons employed in any industry acting in\n combination\n\n294\n\n or a concerted refusal, or a refusal under a\n common understanding, of any number of persons who\n are or have been so employed to continue to work\n or to accept employment\".\n\nUnder sub-section (1) of \nsection 22\n of the said Act, no\nperson employed in a public utility service can go no strike\nin breach of contract without giving to his employer a\nnotice of strike as prescribed by that section. Under\n\nsection 24\n a strike is illegal if it is commenced or\ndeclared in contravention of \nsection 22\n. Under \nsection 26(1)\n\nany workman who commences, continues or otherwise acts in\nfurtherance of a strike which is illegal under the said Act,\ncommits an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term\nwhich may extend to one month or with a fine which may\nextend to fifty rupees or with both. The railway strikes\nwere all commenced without complying with the provisions of\n\nsection 22\n. These strikes were, therefore, illegal and each\nof the railway servants who participated in these strikes\ncommitted an offence punishable under \nsection 26(1)\n of the\nsaid Act.\n\n It may be that the railway servants went on these\nstrikes with the object of forcing the Government to meet\ntheir demands. Their demands were for their private gain and\nin their private interest. In seeking to have these demands\nconceded they caused untold hardship to the public and\nprejudicially affected public good and public interest and\nthe good and interest of the nation.\n\n It was contended that the conduct charged against all\nemployees was not of equal gravity. This is true for in the\ncase of some of the railway servants the acts alleged to\nhave been committed by them would not if committed in normal\ntimes, merit the penalty of dismissal or removal from\nservice, but when committed in furtherance of an all-India\nstrike which has paralysed a public utility service they\ncannot be viewed in the same light.\n\n It was also contended that the punishments were\narbitrarily meted out because in some centres the railway\nservants were dismissed from service while in some other\ncentres they were removed from service. The quantum and\nextent of penalty would depend upon the gravity of the\nsituation at a particular centre and the extent to which the\nalleged acts, though not serious in themselves, in\nconjunction with acts committed by others, contributed to\nthe bringing about of this situation.\n\n295\n\n In the context of an all-India strike where a very\nlarge number of railway servants had struck work, the\nrailway services paralysed, loyal workers and superior\nofficers assaulted and intimidated, the country held to\nransom, the economy of the country and public interest and\npublic good prejudicially affected, prompt and immediate\naction was called for to bring the situation to normal. In\nthese circumstances, it cannot be said that an inquiry was\nreasonably practicable.\n\n On a careful examination of the facts of these cases\nand the impugned orders, we find that in each of these cases\nclause (ii) Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules or clause\n\n(b) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or both, as the\ncase may be, were properly applied. All these matter\ntherefore require to be dismissed.\n\n The Madhya Pradesh Police Forces Matters\n The matters which now remain to be dealt with are Writ\nPetitions Nos. 1953,7393,1392 and 2022 of 1981. The\nPetitioners belonged either to the Madhya Pradesh District\nPolice Force or the Madhya Pradesh special Armed Force. The\nPetitioners were dismissed by orders of the Governor of\nMadhya Pradesh by applying clause (c) of the second proviso\nto \nArticle 311(2)\n to them. All the orders are in the same\nterms except for the same and designation of the concerned\npoliceman. One of the orders may be reproduced as a\nspecimen. That order is as follows:\n\n \"As the Governor of M.P. Under \narticle 311(2)\n C\n clause 2, sub-clauses (c) of the proviso of\n Constitution is satisfied, that it is not\n expedient in the interest of the security of State\n that in case of Shri Karan Singh const. no. 602,\n 2nd Bn. SAF the alleged charges to be told,\n enquiry to be conducted, or opportunity to show\n cause is to be provide as per provisions of clause\n (2) of the above article,\n And, as Governor of M.P. is satisfied that the\n conduct, which appears from his actions or\n omissions, is such that it is sufficient ground\n for his dismissal/termination,\n As such, the Governor of M.P. on the ground of\n powers vested to him under \narticle 311(2)\n C read\n with \narticle\n\n296\n\n 310\n of the Constitution dismisses/terminates Shri\n Karan singh Const. no. 602, 2nd B.n. SAF, under\n said power, from the services, which will apply\n with immediate effect.\n\n On behalf and under orders of\n the Governor of M.P.\n Sd/- (Indira Mishra)\n Under Secretary\n Govt. of M.P., Home (Police) Deptt.\"\n\n We have already held that in applying clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso the Governor of a State acts on his\nsubjective satisfaction taking into consideration facts and\nfactors which are not proper matters for judicial review.\nHowever, the claim of privilege was waived by the Government\nand all the materials produced at the hearing and inspection\ngiven to the other side. These materials disclose that an\nincident took place on January 18, 1981, at the annual Mela\nheld at Gwalior in which one man was burnt alive. Some\npersons, including a constable from each of these two\nForces, were arrested. These persons were remanded into\njudicial custody. On January 20, 1981, several members of\nthese two Forces indulged in violent demonstrations and\nrioted at the Mela ground, demanding the release of their\ncolleagues. They attacked the police station at the Mela\nground, ransacked it and forced the operator to close down\nthe wireless set. The situation became so dangerous that\nsenior district and police officers had to approach the\nJudicial Magistrate at night and get the two arrested\nconstables released on bail. The incident was discussed at a\nCabinet meeting, a decision was taken and the advice of the\nCouncil of Ministers was tendered to the Governor of Madhya\nPradesh who accepted it and issued the impugned orders. On\nfurther scrutiny some names were deleted from the list of\ndismissed personnel and some others included. As a result of\nthis, some other members of these Forces began carrying on\nan active propaganda against the Government, visiting\nJabalpur and other places in the State of Madhya Pradesh,\nholding secret meetings, distributing leaflets, and inciting\nthe constabulary in these places to rise against the\nadministration as a body in protest against the action taken\nby the Government. On this information being received, they\ntoo were similarly dismissed. These facts speak for\nthemselves. The police normally oppose the grant of bail to\nan accused but here we have the paradoxical situation of\nsome of the highest police and district officers going at\nmidnight to the Magistrate's house to apply for bail for\n\n297\n\nthe accused. The police are the guardians of law and order.\nThey stand guard at the border between the green valleys of\nlaw and order and the rough and hilly terrain of lawlessness\nand public disorder. If these guards turn law-breakers and\ncreate violent public disorder and incite others to do the\nsame, we can only exclaim with Juvenal, \"Quis custodiet\nipsos' Custodes?\"- who is to guard the guards themselves?\"\n\n(Satires, VI,347). These facts leave no doubt that the\nsituation was such that prompt and urgent action was\nnecessary and the holding of a inquiry into the conduct of\neach of the Petitioners would not have been expedient in the\ninterest of the security of the State. All these four\nPetitions, therefore deserve to be dismissed.\n\n Final Orders in the Appeals and Writ Petitions\n For the reasons set out above, we pass the following\norders in the above matters :\n\n (1) Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983 is allowed and\n the judgment and order appealed against are\n reversed and set aside and the writ petition filed\n by the Respondent in the High Court is hereby\n dismissed.\n\n (2) Writ Petitions Nos. 1953,7393,1392 and 2022 of\n 1981 are hereby dismissed.\n\n (3) All the remaining Writ Petitions and all the\n Transferred Cases and Civil Appeals Nos. 3231 of\n 1981 and 4067 of 1983 are dismissed while Civil\n Appeals Nos. 3484 and 3512 of 1982 are allowed and\n the judgments and orders appealed against are\n reversed and set aside and the writ petitions\n filed by the Respondents in the High Courts are\n hereby dismissed. We direct the appellate\n authority under the Central Industrial Security\n Force Rules, 1969, to dispose of as expeditiously\n as possible such appeals of the members of the\n Central Industrial Security Force as may still be\n pending. In the case of those government servants\n in this particular group of matters who have not\n filed any appeal, in view of the fact that they\n were relying upon the decision of this Court in\n Chalappan's case, we give them time till September\n 30, 1985, to file a departmental appeal, if so\n advised, and we direct the concerned appellate\n authority to condone in the exercise of its power\n under the relevant service rule\n\n298\n\n the delay in filing the appeal and, subject to\n what is stated in this Judgment under the headings\n \"Service Rules and the Second Proviso -\n Challappan's case and \"The Second Proviso - Clause\n\n (b)\", to hear the appeal on merits.\n\n (4) All interim orders made in the above matters\n are vacated but the government servants will not\n be liable to refund any amount so far paid to\n them.\n\n (5) There will be no order as to costs in all the\n above matters.\n\n (6) All other matters pending in this Court in\n which a question of the interpretation of the\n second proviso to clause (2) of \nArticle 311\n or of\n an analogous service rule is involved will stand\n disposed of in accordance with this Judgment.\n\n THAKKAR, J. A benevolent and justice-oriented decision\nof a three-Judge Bench of this Court, rendered ten years\nback in a group of service matters, (D.P.O. Southern Railway\nv. T.R. Challappan), [1976] 1 S.C.R. 783, is sought to be\noverruled by the judgment proposed to be delivered by my\nlearned Brother Madon, J, with which, the majority appear to\nagree. \"Challappan\" having held the field for such a long\ntime, it would have been appropriate if a meeting of the\nJudges Constituting the Bench had been convened to seriously\ndeliberate and evolve a consensus as to whether or not to\noverrule it. A 'give' and 'take' of ideas, with due respect\nfor the holders of the opposite point of view (in a true\ndemocratic spirit of tolerance), with willingness to accord\ndue consideration to the same, would not have impaired the\nsearch for the true solution or hurt the cause of justice.\nThe holders of the rival view points could have, perhaps,\nsuccessfully persuaded and converted the holders of the\nopposite point of view or got themselves persuaded and\nconverted to the other point of view.\n\n Brother Madon, J, to whom the judgment was assigned by\nthe learned Chief Justice, also appears to suffer heart-ache\non the same score, for, in his covering letter dated July 6,\n1985 forwarding the first instalment of 142 pages he says :\n\n \"...... I regret to state that the draft judgment\n could not be sent to you earlier. The reason was\n that\n\n299\n\n as we did not have a meeting to discuss this\n matter, I did not know what would be the view of\n my other Brothers on the large number of points\n which fall to be determined in these cases, except\n partly in the case of two of my Brothers with whom\n by chance I got an opportunity to discuss certain\n broad aspects......\".\n\nIf only there had been a meeting in order to have a\ndialogue, there might have been a meeting of minds, and we\nmight have spoken in one voice. Failing which, the holders\nof the dissenting view point could have prepared their\ndissenting opinions. That was not to be. On the other hand,\nit has so transpired that, the full draft judgment running\ninto 237 pages has come to be circulated in the morning of\nJuly 11, 1985, less than 3 hours before the deadline for\npronouncing the judgment. There is a time-compulsion to\npronounce the judgment, on 11th July, 1985, as the learned\nChief Justice who has presided over the Constitution Bench\nis due to retire on that day, and the judge-time invested by\nthe five Judges would be wasted if it is not pronounced\nbefore his retirement. The judge-time would be so wasted\nbecause the entire exercise would have to be done afresh.\nThe neck-to-neck race against time and circumstances is so\nkeen that it is impossible to prepare an elaborate judgment\npresenting the other point of view within hours and\ncirculate the same amongst all the Judges constituting the\nBench in this important matter which was heard for months,\nmonths ago. I am, therefore, adopting the only course open\nto me in undertaking the present exercise.\n\n 'Challappan', in my opinion, has been rightly decided.\nAnd there is no compulsion to overrule it - Even if the\nother point of view were to appear to be more 'attractive',\nit is neither a good nor a sufficient ground to overrule\n'Challappan'. After all what does 'Challappan' do? It does\nno more than enjoin in the context of Rule 14(1) (a) and\ntherefore, as a logical corollary, also in the context of\nRule 14(a) (b) of the Railway Servants (Discipline and\nAppeal) Rules, 1968, that an employee must at least be heard\non the question of quantum of punishment before he is\ndismissed or removed from service without holding any\ninquiry. The ratio of the decision is so innocuous that\nthere is hardly any need to overturn it. Apart from the\nweighty reasons articulated by the three-Judge Bench, there\nare some more which can be called into aid. But while the\n'will' is very much there, not the 'time', to elaborate the\nreasons to buttress 'Challappan' and to counter the\ncriticism levelled against the thesis\n\n300\n\npropounded therein. Or to expound my point of view in regard\nto propositions in respect of which I have reservations. I\npropose to do so later if deemed necessary.\n\n For the present, therefore, suffice it to say, I am\nunable to persuade myself to fall in line with the majority\nin overruling 'Challappan' and unable to concur with the\nconsequential orders being passed in that context. I am also\nunable to associate myself with the exposition of law in\nregard to the true meaning and content of the 'pleasure\ndoctrine' and its implications and impact.\n\n The sphere in which I am able to agree with the\nproposed judgment is in regard to the matters arising out of\norders passed in exercise of powers under \nArticle 311(2) (c)\n\nof the Constitution of India and the orders proposed to be\npassed therein.\n\n In the result:\n\n I\n Following the law laid down in 'Challappan' the under\nmentioned appeals are dismissed with no order as to costs:-\n\n Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983\n\n Union of India & Anr. v. Tulsiram Patel\n\n Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982\n\n Union of India & Ors. v. Sadanand Jha & Ors.\n\n Civil Appeal No. 3512 of 1982\n\n Union of India & Ors. v. G.P. Koushal\n II\n Following the law laid down in 'Challappan', the Writ\nPetitions and allied appeals and the companion matters\nhereafter mentioned are allowed and the impugned orders\nagainst the Petitioners are declared to be void and quashed\nwith no order as to costs:-\n\n Writ Petitions Nos. 2267, 2268, 2269, 2273, 3349,\n 3350, 3351, 3352, 3353, 6500, 8120 of 1982 & 562\n of 1983.

Achinita Biswas etc. v.\n Union of India & Ors. etc. and other allied\n Transferred cases and matters arising out of\n Railway Service matters.\n\n301\n\n III\n The same orders dismissing the Writ Petitions coupled\nwith the same directions as per the majority judgment in :\n Writ Petition No. 1953 of 1981,7393,1392, 2202 of\n 1981 and other allied M.P.

The pleasure doctrine relates to the tenure of a\ngovernment servant, that is, his right to continue to hold\noffice. All public officers and servants of the Crown in the\nUnited Kingdom hold their appointments at the pleasure of\nthe Crown and their services can be terminated at will\nwithout assigning any cause. [166 F]\n 2. The pleasure doctrine is not based upon any special\nprerogative of the Crown but is based on public policy and\nis in public interest and for public good. The basis of the\npleasure doctrine is that the public is vitally interested\nin the efficiency and integrity of civil services and,\ntherefore, public policy requires, public interest needs and\npublic good demands that civil servants who are inefficient,\ndishonest or corrupt or have become a security risk should\nnot continue in service. [166 G]\n 3. In the United Kingdom, Parliament is sovereign and\ncan make any law whatever and the courts have no power to\ndeclare it void. The pleasure doctrine is therefore subject\nto what may be expressly provided otherwise by legislation.\n[167 A-168 B]\n Halsbury's Laws of England. Fourth Edn. Volume 8 para\n1106;1162.\n Sbenton v.

[186 H, 187 E]\n137\n 2. In India, unlike in the United Kingdom, the pleasure\ndoctrine is not subject to any law made by Parliament or a\nState Legislature but is subject to only what is expressly\nprovided in the Constitution. In India, therefore, the\nexceptions to the pleasure doctrine can only be those which\nare expressly provided in the Constitution. [187 E]\n 3.

The corollary deduced from\nthe above two rules and particularly the audi alteram partem\nrule was \"qui aliquid statuerit parte inaudita altera,\nadguum licet dixerit, haud aequum fecerit\" (\"he who shall\ndecide anything without the other side having been heard,\nalthough he may have said what is right will not have done\nwhat is right\" or as is now expressed \"justice should not\nonly be done but should manifestly be seen to be done\").\nThese two rules and their corollary are neither new nor were\nthey the discovery of English judges but were recognised in\nmany civilizations and over many centuries.

Violation of a rule of natural justice results in\narbitrariness which is the same as discrimination, and where\ndiscrimination is the result of a State action, it is a\nviolation of \nArticle 14.\n Therefore, a violation of a\nprinciple of natural justice by a State action is a\nviolation of \nArticle 14.\n [229 F-G]\n 4. The principles of natural justice apply both to\nquasi judicial as well as administrative inquiries entailing\ncivil consequences. [233 H-234 A]\n 5. It is well established both in England and in India\nthat the principles of natural justice yield to and change\nwith the exigencies of different situations which are not\nalike. They are neither cast in a rigid mould nor can they\nbe put in a legal strait-jacket. They are not immutable but\nflexible and can be adapted, modified or excluded by statute\nand statutory rules as also by the Constitution of the\ntribunal which has to decide a particular matter and the\nrules by which such tribunal is governed.

The Scope of the Second Proviso\n 1. The three clauses of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311\n are not intended to be applied in normal and ordinary\nsituations. The second proviso is an exception to the normal\nrule and before any of the three clauses of that proviso is\napplied to the case of a civil servant, the conditions laid\ndown in that clause must be satisfied. [204 F-205 C]\n 2. Where a situation envisaged in one of the clauses of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n exists, it is not\nmandatory that the punishment of dismissal, removal of\nreduction in rank should be imposed upon a civil servant.\nThe disciplinary authority will first have to decided what\npunishment is warranted by the facts and circumstances of\nthe case. Such consideration would, however, be ex parte and\nwithout hearing the concerned civil servant. If the\ndisciplinary authority comes to the conclusion that the\npunishment which is called for is that of dismissal, removal\nor reduction in rank, it must dispense with the inquiry and\nthen decide for itself which of the aforesaid three\npenalties should be imposed.

It has thereafter to decide whether\nthe conduct which had led to the civil servant's conviction\non a criminal charge was such as to warrant the imposition\nof a penalty and, if so, what that penalty should be. For\nthis purpose it must peruse the judgment of the criminal\ncourt and take into consideration all the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and the various factors set out in\nChalappan's Case such as, the entire conduct of the civil\nservant of the gravity of the offence committed by him, the\nimpact which his misconduct is likely to have on the\nadministration, whether the offence for which he was\nconvicted was of a technical or trivial nature, and the\nextenuating circumstances, if any, present in the case.\nThis, however, has to be done by the disciplinary authority\nex parte and without hearing the concerned civil servant.\n[267 C-E]\n 2. The penalty imposed upon the civil servant should\nnot be arbitrary or grossly excessive or out of all\nproportion to the offence committed or one not warranted by\nthe facts and circumstances of the case. [267 H]\n 3. Where a civil servant goes to the office of his\nsuperior officer whom he believes to be responsible for\nstopping his increment and hits him on the head with an iron\nrod, so that the superior officer falls down with a bleeding\nhead, and the delinquent civil servant is tried and\nconvicted under \nsection 332\n of the Indian Penal Code but the\nMagistrate, instead of sentencing him to imprisonment,\napplies to him the provisions of \nsection 4\n of the Probation\nof Offenders Act, 1958, and after such conviction the\ndisciplinary authority, taking the above facts into\nconsideration, by way of punishment compulsorily retires the\ndelinquent civil servant under clause (i) of \nsection 19\n of\nthe Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and\nAppeal) Rules, 1965, it cannot be said that the punishment\ninflicted upon the civil servant was excessive or\narbitrary. [267 F-G]\n XI. Clause (b) of the Second Proviso.\n 1. There are two conditions precedent which must be\nsatisfied before clause (b) of the second proviso to \nArticle\n311(2)\n can be applied. These conditions are (i) there must\nexist a situation which makes the holding of an inquiry\ncontemplated by \nArticle 311(2)\n not reasonably practicable,\nand (ii) the disciplinary authority should record in writing\nits reason for its satisfaction that it is not reasonably\npracticable to hold such inquiry.[269 D-E]\n149\n 2. Whether it was practicable to hold the inquiry or\nnot must be judged in the context of whether it was\nreasonably practicable to do so. [269 F]\n 3. It is not a total or absolute impracticability which\nis required by clause (b) of the second proviso. What is\nrequisite is that the holding of the inquiry is not\npracticable in the opinion of a reasonable man taking a\nreasonable view of the prevailing situation. [270 B]\n 4. The reasonable practicability of holding an inquiry\nis a matter of assessment to be made by the disciplinary\nauthority and must be judged in the light of the\ncircumstances then prevailing. The disciplinary authority is\ngenerally on the spot and knows what is happening. It is\nbecause the disciplinary authority is the best judge of the\nprevailing situation that clause (3) of \nArticle 311\n makes\nthe decision of the disciplinary authority on this question\nfinal. [270 C]\n 5. It is not possible to enumerate the cases in which\nit would not be reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry.\n Illustrative cases would be\n (a) Where a civil servant, particularly through or\ntogether with his associates, so terrorizes, threatens or\nintimidates witnesses who are going to give evidence against\nhim with fear of reprisal as to prevent them from doing so,\nor [270 A]\n (b) Where the civil servant by himself or together with\nor through others threatens, intimidates and terrorizes the\nofficer who is the disciplinary authority or members of his\nfamily so that he is afraid to hold the inquiry or direct it\nto be held, or [270 B]\n (c) Where an atmosphere of violence or of general\nindiscipline and insubordination prevails, it being\nimmaterial whether the concerned civil servant is or is not\na party to bringing about such a situation. In all these\ncases, it must be remembered that numbers coerce and terrify\nwhile an individual may not. [270 C]\n 6. The disciplinary authority is not expected to\ndispense with a disciplinary inquiry lightly or arbitrarily\nor out of\n150\nulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding of\nan inquiry or because the Department's case against the\ncivil servant is weak and must fail. [270 C]\n 7. The word \"inquiry\" in clause (b) of the second\nproviso includes a part of an inquiry. It is, therefore, not\nnecessary that the situation which makes the holding of an\ninquiry not reasonably practicable should exist before the\ninquiry is instituted against the civil servant. Such a\nsituation can also come into existence subsequently during\nthe course of the inquiry, for instance, after the service\nof a charge-sheet upon the civil servant or after he has\nfiled his written statement thereto or even after evidence\nhas been led in part. [271 D-E]\n 8. When at the commencement of the inquiry or pending\nit, the civil servant abscards and cannot be served or will\nnot participate in the inquiry it will not be reasonably\npracticable to afford to the civil servant and opportunity\nof a hearing or further hearing. In such cases, the matter\nmust proceed ex parte and on the materials before the\ndisciplinary authority. [271 E]\n 9. The recording of the reason for dispensing with the\ninquiry is a condition precedent to the application of\nclause (b) of the second proviso. This is a Constitutional\nobligation and if such reason is not recorded in writing,\nthe order dispensing with the inquiry and the other of\npenalty following thereupon would both be void and\nunconstitutional. It is, however, not necessary that the\nreason should find a place in the final order but it would\nbe advisable to record it in the final order in order to\navoid an allegation that the reason was not recorded in\nwriting before passing the final order but was subsequently\nfabricated. [271 G]\n 10. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not\ncontain details particulars but it cannot be vague or just a\nrepetition of the language of clause (b) of the second\nproviso. [272 C]\n 11. It is also not necessary to communicate the reason\nfor dispensing with the inquiry to the concerned civil\nservant but it would be better to do so in order to\neliminate the possibility of an allegation being made that\nthe reason was subsequently fabricated. [272 B]\n 12. The obligation to record the reason in writing is\nprovided in clause (b) of the second proviso so that the\n151\nsuperiors of the disciplinary authority may be able to judge\nwhether such authority had exercised its power under clause\n(b) properly or not.[272 F]\n 13. It is, however, better for the disciplinary\nauthority to communicate to the concerned civil servant its\nreason for dispensing with the inquiry because such\ncommunication would eliminate the possibility of an\nallegation being made that the reason had been subsequently\nfabricated. It would also enable the civil servant to\napproach the High Court under \nArticle 226\n or, in a fit case,\nthe Supreme Court under \nArticle 32.\n [272 H]\n 14. It would be illogical to hold that administrative\nwork carried out by senior officers should be paralysed by\nsending them to other stations to hold the inquiry just\nbecause a delinquent civil servant either by himself or\nalong with or through others makes the holding of an inquiry\nby the designated disciplinary authority or inquiry officer\nnot reasonably practicable. [273 C]\n 15. In a case falling under clause (b) of the second\nproviso it is not necessary that the civil servant should be\nplaced under suspension until such time as the situation\nimproves and it becomes possible to hold the inquiry because\nin such cases neither public interest nor public good\nrequires that salary or subsistence allowance should be\ncontinued to be paid out of the public exchequer to the\nconcerned civil servant. In certain cases, the exigencies of\na situation would require that prompt action should be taken\nand suspending a civil servant would not serve the purpose,\nand sometimes not taking prompt action might result in the\ntrouble spreading and the situation worsening and at times\nbecoming uncontrolable. Not taking prompt action may also be\nconstrued by the trouble-makers as a sign of weakness on the\npart of the authorities and thus encourage them to step up\ntheir activities or agitation. Where such prompt action is\ntaken there is an element of deterrence in it but this is\nunavoidable and a necessary concomitance of such an action.\n[273 D]\n 16. If an inquiry into the charges against a civil\nservant is not reasonably practicable, it stands to reason\nthat an inquiry into the question whether the disciplinary\ninquiry should be dispensed with or not is equally not\nreasonably practicable. [273 D]\n 17. In situations where a large group of members of the\nCentral Industrial Security collectively indulge in several\nof acts of insubordination indiscipline and intimidation\nwith the\n152\ncommon object of coercing those in charge of the\nadministration of the Force and the Government to compel\nthem to grant recognition to their Association and to\nconcede their demands, it is not possible to particularise\nin the orders of dismissal the acts of each individual\nmember who participated in the commission of these acts. The\nparticipation of each individual might be of a greater or\nlesser degree but the acts of each individual contributed to\nthe creation of a situation in which the security force\nitself had become a security risk. [291 C-E]\n 18. The quantum and extent of the penalty to be imposed\nin each case would depend upon the gravity of the situation\nand the extent to which the acts said to be committed by the\npraticular civil servants, even though not serious in\nthemselves, in conjunction with acts committed by others,\ncontributed to bringing about the situation. The fact, that\nat a particular centre certain civil servants were dismissed\nfrom service while at some other centres they were only\nremoved from service does not mean that the penalties were\narbitrarily imposed. [292 A-B]\n XII. Clause (c) of the Second Proviso.\n The expression \"security of the State\" in clause (c) of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n does not mean security\nof the entire country or a whole State but includes security\nof a part of a State. [275 E]\n 2. Security of the State cannot be confined to an armed\nrebellion or revolt for there are various ways in which the\nsecurity of the State can be affected such as by State\nsecrets or information relating to defence production or\nsimilar matters being passed on to other countries, whether\ninimical or not to India, or by secret links with\nterrorists. [275 E]\n 3. The way in which the security of the State is\naffected may be either open or clandestine. [275 F]\n 4. Disaffection in the armed forces or paramilitary\nforces or the police force would affect the security of the\nState. The importance of the proper discharge of the duties\nby members of these Forces and the maintenance of discipline\namong them is emphasised in \nArticle 33\n of the Constitution.\n[275 G]\n 5. Disaffection in any armed force or para-military\nforce or police force is likely to spread because\ndissatisfaction and\n153\ndisaffected members of such a Force spread dissatisfaction\nand disaffection among other members of the Force and thus\ninduce them not to discharge their duties properly and to\ncommit acts of indiscipline, insubordination or disobedience\nto the orders of their superiors. Such a situation cannot be\na matter affecting only law and order or public order but is\na matter vitally affecting the security of the State. [276\nA-B]\n 6. The interest of the security of the State can be\naffected by actual acts or even by the likelihood of such\nacts taking place. [277 D]\n 7. In an inquiry into acts affecting the interest of\nthe security of the State, several matters not fit or proper\nto be made public, including the source of information\ninvolving a civil servant in such acts, would be disclosed\nand thus in such cases an inquiry into acts prejudicial to\nthe interest of the security of the State would as much\nprejudice the interest of the security of the State as those\nacts themselves would. [279 D]\n 8. The condition for the application of clause (c) of\nthe second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n is the satisfaction of\nthe President or the Governor, as the case may be, that it\nis not expedient in the interest of the security of the\nState to hold a disciplinary inquiry. [277 D]\n 9. Such satisfaction is not required to be that of the\nPresident or the Governor personally but of the President or\nthe Governor, as the case may be, acting in the\nConstitutional sense. [278 A]\n State of Rajasthan and Others etc. etc. v. Union of\nIndia etc. etc. [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1, 82., referred to.\n 10. \"Expedient\" means \"Advantageous, fit, proper\nsuitable. Where, therefore, the President of the Governor,\nas the case may be, is satisfied that it will not be\nadvantageous or fit or proper or suitable or politic in the\ninterest of the security of the State to hold an inquiry, he\nwould be entitled to dispense with it under clause (c) of\nthe second proviso. [277 F]\n 11. Under clause (c) of the second proviso the\nsatisfaction reached by the President or the Governor, as\nthe case may be, must necessarily be a subjective\nsatisfaction because expediency involves matters of policy.\n[278 G]\n154\n 12. Satisfaction of the President or the Governor under\nclause (c) of the second proviso may be arrived at as a\nresult of secret information received by the Governor about\nthe brewing danger to the security of the State and like\nmatters. There are other factors which are also required to\nbe considered, weighed and balanced in order to reach the\nrequisite satisfaction whether holding an inquiry would be\nexpedient or not. If the requisite satisfaction has been\nreached as a result of secret information received by the\nGovernment, making known such information may very often\nresult in disclosure of the source of such information and\nonce known, the particular source would no more be available\nto the Government. The reason for the satisfaction reached\nby the President or the Governor under clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso cannot, therefore, be required to be recorded\nin the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank nor\ncan it be made public. [279 E, 280 B]\n 13. When a number of members of the Madhya Pradesh\nDistrict Police Force and the Madhya Pradesh Special Armed\nForce, in order to obtain the release on bail of two of\ntheir colleagues who had been refused bail and remained into\njudicial custody because of an incident which took place at\nthe annual Mela attacked the police station at the Mela\nground, ransacked it and forced the wireless operator to\nclose down the wireless set and the situation became so\ndangerous that senior district and police officers had to\napproach the judicial Magistrate at night to get the two\narrested constables released on bail and, after discussion\nat a Cabinet meeting, a decision was taken and the advice of\nthe Council of Ministers was tendered to the Governor of\nMadhya Pradesh who accepted it and issued orders of\ndismissal of these persons by applying clause (c) of the\nsecond proviso to them it cannot be said that the provisions\nof the said clause (c) were not properly applied. [295 E-296\nC]\n 14. Similarly, when after these members of the Madhya\nPradesh District Police Force and the Madhya Pradesh Special\nArmed force were dismissed, some other members of these\nForces began carrying on an active propaganda against the\nGovernment, visiting various places in the State of Madhya\nPradesh, holding secret meetings, distributing leaflets and\ninciting the constabulary in these places to rise against\nthe administration as a body in protest against the action\ntaken by the Government and, on such information being\nreceived, there were also dismissed by applying clause (c)\nof the second proviso to them, it cannot be said that the\nsaid clause (c) was not properly applied. [296 F-297 B]\n155\n A civil servant who has been dismissed, removed or\nreduced in rank by applying to his case one of the clauses\nof the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or an analogour\nservice rule has two remedies available to him. These\nremedies are;\n (i) The appropriate departmental remedy provided for\n in the relevant service rules, and\n (ii) if still dissatisfied, invoking the court's power\n of judicial review. [216 A-B]\n XIV. Departmental Remedies.\n Service rules generally provide for departmental\nremedies by way of an appeal, revision and review in the\ncase of disciplinary action taken against a civil servant.\n 2. Sub-clause (ii) of clause (c) of the first proviso\nto Rule 25(1) of the Railway Servants (Discipline and\nAppeal) Rules, 1968, provides that where an inquiry has not\nbeen held, the revising authority shall itself hold such\ninquiry or indirect such inquiry to be held. A railway\nservant has therefore a right to demand in revision an\ninquiry into the charges against him subject to a situation\nenvisaged in Rule 14 of the said Rules not prevailing at\nthat time. [248 G-H]\n 3. Although a provision similar to sub-clause (ii) of\nclause (c) of the first proviso of the first proviso to Rule\n25(1) of the Railways Servants (Discipline and Appeal)\nRules, 1968, does not exist in the rules relating to\nappeals, having regard to the factors set out in Rule 22 (2)\nwhich are to be considered by the appellate authority in\ndeciding an appeal, a provision similar to the said sub-\nclause (ii) of clause (c) of the first proviso to Rules\n25(1) should be read and imported into the provisions\nrelating to appeals in the said Rules. [249 D-F]\n 4. Even in a case where at the time of the hearing of\nthe appeal or revision, as the case may be, a situation\nenvisaged by the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n exists, as\nthe civil servants, if dismissed or removed, is not\ncontinuing in service and, if reduced in rank, is continuing\nin service with the reduced rank, the hearing of the appeal\nor revision, as the case may be, should be postponed for a\nreasonable length of time to enable the situation to return\nto normal.

At Bokaro Steel Plant the agitation which was\ngoing became aggravated and out of 1900 persons belonging to\nCISF Unit Bokaro, about 1000\n161\npersons participated in processions and violent\ndemonstrations.

The agitation and the\nviolent activity reached serious proportion in the last week\nof June 1979 with the result that the Army that to be called\nby the State Authorities on 23.6.1979, took up positions\nround the CISF Lines and called upon the agitators to give\nup charge of the Aroury.

Similarly, it is not possible to accept the\nargument that unless a written explanation with respect to\nthe charges is asked for from a government servant and his\nside of the case known, the penalty which would be imposed\nupon him, could be grossly out of proportion to his actual\nmisconduct.

The Rules which the Romans borrowed\nfrom these laws and customs were those which were capable of\ngeneral application and they developed then into general\nlegal principles, which came to form jus gentium or the law\nof nations. In doing so they acted upon the principle that\nany rule of law which was common to the nations (gentes)\nthey knew of must be basically in consonance with reason\nand, therefore, fundamentally just. They applied jus gentium\nto those to whom ius civile (civil law) did not apply, that\nis, in cases between foreigners or between a Roman citizen\nand a foreigner. On this basic formulation that what was\ncommon to all known nations must be in consonance with\nreason and justice, the Roman jurists and magistrates\nproceeded to the theory that any rule which instinctively\ncommanded itself to the sense of justice and reason would be\npart of the jus gentium. The jus gentium of the Romans was\ndifferent from what we call international law and should not\nbe confused with it, for the scope of the jus gentium was\nmuch wider than our international law. Because of the theory\nof its identity with justice and reason, the term \"jus\ngentium\" came at times to be used for aequitas, that is,\nequity as understood by the Romans, which was the basis of\npraetorian law or the power of the praetors to grant\nremedies where non existed under the jus civile. In the Dark\nAges the expression \"natural law\" acquired a theological\nbase and the Fathers of the Church, particularly St.\nAmbrose, St. Augustine and St. Gregory, held the belief that\nit was the function of the Church to bring about the best\npossible approximation of human laws to Christian\nprinciples. As Europe emerged from the Dark Ages in about\nthe ninth century, Christianity became substituted for\nreason as the supreme force in the universe, and this led to\nthe development of a theory of law in which Christianity had\nthe supreme spiritual and legal force and was superior to\nall other laws, with the Church as the authentic expositor\nof the law of nature. Gratian (Francisco Graziano) in the\ntwelfth century in his \"Decretum\" or \"Concordies\ndiscordantium canonum\" consider the law of nature as part of\nthe law of God. According to St. Thomas Aquinas (1226-74),\nnatural law was derived from the law of God which was\nsupreme and such of it as was intelligible to men was\nrevealed through Church law as the incorporation of divine\nwisdom.

Among the Romans, Seneca in his tragedy\n\"Medea\" referred to the injustice of coming to a decision\nwithout a full hearing. In fact, the corollary drawn in\nBoswell's case is taken from a line in Seneca's \"Medea\".

In other words,\n the position is that the conviction of the\n delinquent employee would be taken as sufficient\n proof of misconduct and then the authority will\n have to embark upon a summary inquiry as to the\n nature and extent of the penalty to be imposed on\n the delinquent employee and in the course of the\n inquiry if the authority is of the opinion that\n the offence is too trivial or of a technical\n nature it may refuse to impose any penalty inspite\n of the conviction. This is a very salutary\n provision which has been enshrined in these Rules\n and one of the purposes for conferring this power\n is that in cases where the disciplinary authority\n is satisfied that the delinquent employee is a\n youthful offender who is not convicted of any\n serious offence and shows poignant penitence or\n real repentance he may be dealt with as lightly as\n possible. This appears to us to be the scope and\n ambit of this provision. We must, however, hasten\n to add that we should not be understood as laying\n down that the last part of rule 14 of the Rules of\n 1968 contains a licence to employees convicted of\n serious offences to insist on reinstatement. The\n statutory provision referred to above merely\n imports a rule of natural justice in enjoining\n that before taking final action in the matter the\n delinquent employee should be heard and the\n circumstances of the case may be objectively\n considered. This is in keeping with the sense of\n justice and fair-play. The disciplinary authority\n has the undoubted power after hearing the\n delinquent employee and considering the\n circumstances of the case to inflict any major\n penalty on the deinquent employee without any\n further departmental inquiry if the authority is\n of the opinion that the employee has been guilty\n of a serious offence involving moral turpitude\n and, therefore, it is not desirable or conducive\n in the interests of administration to retain such\n a person in service."

In other words, the\n argument was that to cases where proviso (a) to\n \nArticle 311(2)\n applies a departmental inquiry is\n completely dispensed with and the disciplinary\n authority can on the doctrine of pleasure\n terminate the services of the delinquent\n employee. We however, refrain from expression any\n opinion on this aspect of the matter because the\n cases of all the three respondents before us are\n cases which clearly fall within rule 14 of the\n rules of 1968 where they have been removed from\n service without complying with the last part of\n rule 14 of the Rules of 1968 as indicated above.\n In none of the cases has the disciplinary\n authority either considered the circumstances or\n heard the delinquent employees on the limited\n point as to the nature and extent of the penalty\n to be imposed if at all. On the other hand in all\n these cases the disciplinary authority has\n proceeded to pass the order of removal from\n service straightaway on the basis of the\n conviction of the delinquent employees by the\n criminal courts.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n So far as Challappan's Case is concerned, it is not\npossible to find any fault either with the view that neither\nclause (a) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n nor\nclause (i) of Rule 14 of the Railway Servants Rules is\nmandatory or with the considerations which have been set out\nin the judgment as being the considerations to be taken into\naccount by the disciplinary authority before imposing a\npenalty upon a delinquent government servant. Where a\nsituation envisaged in one of the three clauses of the\nsecond proviso to \nArticle 311(2)\n or of an analogous service\nrule arises, it is not mandatory that the major penalty of\ndismissal, removal or reduction in rank should be imposed\nupon the concerned government servant. The penalty which can\nbe imposed may be some other major penalty or even a minor\npenalty depending upon the facts and circumstances of the\ncase. In order to arrive at a decision as to which penalty\nshould be imposed, the disciplinary authority will have to\ntake into consideration the various factors set out in\nChallappan's case.

For that purpose it\nwill have to peruse the judgment of the criminal court and\nconsider all the facts and circumstances of the case and the\nvarious factors set out in Challappan's case. This, however,\nhas to be done by it ex parte and by itself. Once the\ndisciplinary authority reaches the conclusion that the\ngovernment servant's conduct was such as to require his\ndismissal or removal from service or reduction in rank he\nmust decide which of these three penalties should be imposed\non him. This too it has to do by itself and without hearing\nthe concerned government servant by reason of the\nexclusionary effect of the second proviso. The disciplinary\nauthority must, however, bear in mind that a conviction on a\ncriminal charge does not automatically entail dismissal,\nremoval or reduction in rank of the concerned government\nservant. Having decided which of these three penalties is\nrequired to be imposed, he has to pass the requisite order.\nA government servant who is aggrieved by the penalty imposed\ncan agitate in appeal, revision or review, as the case may\nbe, that the penalty was too severe or excessive and not\nwarranted by the facts and circumstances of the case. If it\nis his case that he is not the government servant who has\nbeen in fact convicted, he can also agitate this question in\nappeal, revision or review. If he fails in all the\ndepartmental remedies and still wants to pursue the matter,\nhe can invoke the court's power of judicial review subject\nto the court permitting it. If the court finds that he was\nnot in fact the person convicted, it will strike down the\nimpugned order and order him to be reinstated in service.\nWhere the court finds that the penalty imposed by the\nimpugned order is arbitrary or grossly excessive or out of\nall proportion to the offence committed or not warranted by\nthe facts and circumstances of the case or the requirements\nof that"

What is\nrequisite is that the holding of the inquiry is not\npracticable in the opinion of a reasonable man taking a\nreasonable view of the prevailing situation. It is not\npossible to enumerate the cases in which it would not be\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry, but some\ninstances by way of illustration may, however, be given. It\nwould not be reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry where\nthe government servant, particularly through or together\nwith his associates, so terrorizes, threatens or intimidate\nwitnesses who are going to given evidence against him with\nfear of reprisal as to prevent them from doing so or where\nthe government servant by himself or"

It would also not be\nreasonably practicable to hold the inquiry where an\natmosphere of violence or of general indiscipline and\ninsubordination prevails, and it is immaterial whether the\nconcerned government servant is or is not a party to\nbringing about such an atmosphere. In this connection, we\nmust bear in mind that numbers coerce and terrify while an\nindividual may not. The reasonable practicability of holding\nan inquiry is a matter of assessment to be made by the\ndisciplinary authority. Such authority is generally on the\nspot and knows what is happening. It is because the\ndisciplinary authority is the best judge of this that\nclause(3) of \nArticle 311\n makes the decision of the\ndisciplinary authority on this question final. A\ndisciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a\ndisciplinary inquiry lightly or arbitrarily or out of\nulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding of\nan inquiry or because the Department's case against the\ngovernment servant is weak and must fail. The finality given\nto the decision of the disciplinary authority by \nArticle\n311(3)\n is not binding upon the court so far as its power of\njudicial review is concerned and in such a case the court\nwill strike down the order dispensing with the inquiry as\nalso the order imposing penalty. \nThe case of \nArjun Chaubey\nv. Union of India and others\n, [1984] 3 S.C.R. 302, is an\ninstance in point. In that case, the appellant was working\nas a senior clerk in the office of the Chief Commercial\nSuperintendent, Northern Railway, Varanasi. The Senior\nCommercial Officer wrote a letter to the appellant calling\nupon him to submit his explanation with regard to twelve\ncharges of gross indiscipline mostly relating to the Deputy\nChief Commercial Superintendent. The appellant submitted his\nexplanation and on the very next day the Deputy Chief\nCommercial Superintendent served a second notice on the\nappellant saying that his explanation was not convincing and\nthat another chance was being given to him to offer his\nexplanation with respect to those charges. The appellant\nsubmitted his further explanation but on the very next day\nthe Deputy Chief Commercial Superintendent passed an order\ndismissing him on the ground that he was not fit to be\nretained in service. This Court struck down the order\nholding that seven out of twelve charges related to the\nconduct of the appellant with the Deputy Chief Commercial\nSuperintendent who was the disciplinary authority and that\nif an inquiry were to be held, the principal witness for the\nDepartment would have been the Deputy Chief Commercial\nSuperintendent himself, resulting in the same person being\nthe main accuser, the chief witness and also the judge of\nthe matter."

The contentions with respect to these\ngrounds have been considered by us in the preceding part of\nthis Judgment and have been negatived. In most of the\nmatters the Writ Petitions contain no detailed facts.\nSeveral of the Petitioners have gone in departmental appeal\nbut that fact is not mentioned in the Writ Petitions nor the\norder of the appellate authority challenged where the\nappeals have been dismissed. Many government servants have\ncombine together to file one Writ Petition and in the case\nof such of them whose departmental appeals have been allowed\nand they reinstated in service, the Petitions have not been\namended so as to delete their names and they have continued\nto remain on the record as Petitioners. Several Petitions\nare in identical terms, if not, almost exact copies of other\nPetitions. No attempt has been made in such matters to\ndistinguish the case of one Petitioner from the other. Apart\nfrom contesting the legal validity of the impugned orders,\nhardly any one has even stated in his Petition that he was\nnot involved in the situation which has led to clause (b) or\nclause (c) of the second proviso to \nArticle 311\n being\napplied in his case. There is no allegation of mala fide\nagainst the authority passing the impugned orders except at\ntimes a more bare allegation that the order was passed mala\nfide. No particulars whatever of such alleged mala fides\nhave been given."

If\nthis Court finds that such provision has not been properly\napplied, the Appellant or the Petitioner, as the case may\nbe, is entitled to succeed. If, however, we find that it has\nbeen properly applied, the Appeal or Petition would be\nliable to be dismissed, because there are no proper\nmaterials before the Court to investigate and ascertain\nwhether any particular government servant was, in fact,\nguilty of the charges made against him or not. It is also\nnot the function of this Court to do so because it would\ninvolve an inquiry into disputed questions of facts and this\nCourt will not, except in a rare case, embark upon such an\ninquiry.

The\nmention of \nsection 332\n of the Indian Penal Code in the said\norder itself shows that Respondent was himself a public\nservant and had voluntarily caused hurt to another public\nservant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant\nor in consequence of an act done by that person in the\nlawful discharge of his duty.

It was fortunate that the skull of Raj\nKumar was not fractured otherwise the offence committed\nwould have been the more serious one under section 333. The\nRespondent was lucky in being dealt with leniently by the\nMagistrate but these facts clearly show that his retention\nin public service was undesirable. In fact, the conduct of\nthe Respondent was such that he merited the penalty of\ndismissal from government service and it is clear that by\nimposing upon him only the penalty of compulsory retirement,\nthe disciplinary authority had in his mind the fact that the\nMagistrate had released him on probation.

For that purpose it is\n proposed to constitute a centrally recruited,\n organised and trained Industrial Security Force.\n The Force will primarily be responsible for the\n watch and ward of industrial undertakings owned by\n the Central Government and may be deployed at the\n request and cost of managements, for security\n duties of industrial undertakings in public\n sector.\""

Failing which, the holders\nof the dissenting view point could have prepared their\ndissenting opinions. That was not to be. On the other hand,\nit has so transpired that, the full draft judgment running\ninto 237 pages has come to be circulated in the morning of\nJuly 11, 1985, less than 3 hours before the deadline for\npronouncing the judgment. There is a time-compulsion to\npronounce the judgment, on 11th July, 1985, as the learned\nChief Justice who has presided over the Constitution Bench\nis due to retire on that day, and the judge-time invested by\nthe five Judges would be wasted if it is not pronounced\nbefore his retirement. The judge-time would be so wasted\nbecause the entire exercise would have to be done afresh.\nThe neck-to-neck race against time and circumstances is so\nkeen that it is impossible to prepare an elaborate judgment\npresenting the other point of view within hours and\ncirculate the same amongst all the Judges constituting the\nBench in this important matter which was heard for months,\nmonths ago. I am, therefore, adopting the only course open\nto me in undertaking the present exercise."

After all what does 'Challappan' do? It does\nno more than enjoin in the context of Rule 14(1) (a) and\ntherefore, as a logical corollary, also in the context of\nRule 14(a) (b) of the Railway Servants (Discipline and\nAppeal) Rules, 1968, that an employee must at least be heard\non the question of quantum of punishment before he is\ndismissed or removed from service without holding any\ninquiry. The ratio of the decision is so innocuous that\nthere is hardly any need to overturn it. Apart from the\nweighty reasons articulated by the three-Judge Bench, there\nare some more which can be called into aid. But while the\n'will' is very much there, not the 'time', to elaborate the\nreasons to buttress 'Challappan' and to counter the\ncriticism levelled against the thesis"
