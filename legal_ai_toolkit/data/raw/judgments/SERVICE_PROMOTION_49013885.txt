Factual Matrix:

5. The brief facts of the case, as per the pleadings made in

the writ petitions, reads as under:

6. The erstwhile State of Bihar framed a Rule vide

notification dated 30.09.1991 known as „Bihar Prarambhik

Vidyalaya Niyukti Niyamavali, 1991‟ [Bihar Primary School

Teachers‟ Rules, 1991] in exercise of power conferred under

Article 309
of the Constitution of India. The Rule 11 of Rules,

1991 speaks that the candidate who possesses teachers

training certificate shall be entitled for matric trained scale

and who does not have teachers training certificate, at the

time of appointment, will be appointed on matric untrained

scale with certain conditions including the provision for

sending the said untrained teachers for in-service Teachers‟

- 10 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Training in the Government Colleges. There was further

provision that, immediately after passing of Teachers Training

Examination, the said untrained teachers will be entitled to

get the pay-scale and benefit as Matric Trained Scale.

7. Further, the State of Bihar framed a rule for promotion

of teachers of primary school, under proviso to
Article 309
of

the Constitution of India, for promotion of the teachers of

elementary schools taken over by the Government of Bihar in

the name of "Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers‟

Promotion Rules, 1993" (hereinafter referred to as "the Rules,

1993") to be effective from 01.01.1986. After bifurcation of

the State of Bihar, it has been adopted by the State of

Jharkhand by virtue of
Bihar Reorganization Act, 2000
.

8. The private respondents herein are the appointees

under the prevalent appointment rules of Rules, 1991 under

matric trained/untrained scale and governed by Promotion

Rules, 1993.

9. Thereafter, the Human Resource Development

Department, State of Jharkhand under proviso to
Article 309

of the Constitution of India, vide notification no. 1632 dated

05.09.2012, notified a rule in the name of „Jharkhand

Primary School Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012‟ (in short

referred to as 'Rule, 2012').

- 11 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

10. In consonance with the Rules, 2012 the State of

Jharkhand issued Notification contained in Memo No. 1533

dated 31.7.2014, whereby a decision was taken to appoint

trained graduate teachers for classes 6 to 8 in terms of
Right

of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
. It

was clarified that 50% of the said posts would be filled up by

direct recruitment and rest by way of promotion from

elementary school teachers.

11. Pursuant thereto, an advertisement was issued for

appointment of such teachers and the members of petitioner

no.1 and petitioner no.2 in W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021, as also

petitioners of W.P.(S) No.3365 of 2020 were appointed in

different districts in the year 2015 onwards in the quota

fixed for direct recruitment.

12. It is the case of the petitioners, after their appointment

in Grade IV to the post of „Trained Graduate Teacher‟

[Science/Arts/Language] contrary to the Promotion Rules,

1993, the State of Jharkhand granted promotion to the

private respondents vide order dated 28.12.2016 with

retrospective effect from 01.04.2015.

13. Further, the State issued the impugned decision in the

shape of order dated 26.08.2021 to grant notional promotion

to the teachers [private respondents], to Grade-III, IV and VII,

- 12 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
who were appointed in the year 1993 onwards, in terms of

Resolution No. 1145 dated 18.07.2019.

14. The petitioners contended that the same is illegal,

arbitrary and without application of mind. It has been

pleaded that promotion takes effect only with effect from the

date an employee joins on such post and not with

retrospective effect. In this context, reference has been made

to Resolution No. 2074 dated 04.04.1985 to fortify that

promotion takes effect from the date of joining and no

notional or retrospective promotion is permissible.

15. Further, reference has been made to letter as contained

in Memo No. 1985 dated 20.11.2016, as also Circular No.

151 of the year 2006 issued by Finance Department. Letter

dated 17.01.2019 issued by the School Education and

Literacy Department, Govt. of Jharkhand to fortify the stand

of the petitioners.

16. Referring to Rule 58 of Jharkhand Service Code and

Rule 74 of the Jharkhand Finance Rules, it has been pleaded

that it provides that promotion takes effect from the date on

which the employee assumes the charge of higher regular

post.

17. In the light of the above, the petitioners being aggrieved

with the promotion orders as contained in different memos

vide order dated 28.12.2016 with retrospective effect from

- 13 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
01.04.2015; and Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021, has

approached this Court by filing writ petitions, which were

dismissed. Hence, the present intra-court appeals.

18. It is evident from the factual aspect that for

appointment of primary teachers, the erstwhile State of Bihar

framed a rule vide notification dated 30.09.1991 known as

„Bihar Prarambhik Vidyalaya Niyukti Niyamavali, 1991‟ [Bihar

Primary School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991] in exercise of power

conferred under
Article 309
of the Constitution of India,

wherein provision of appointment of teachers, both trained

and untrained, was there. But untrained teachers were to

obtain Teachers Training Certificate by way of in-service

training and till then they will be entitled to get only

untrained matric pay-scale.

19. The State of Bihar further framed a rule, under the

power conferred under proviso to
Article 309
of the

Constitution of India, for promotion of the teachers of

elementary schools taken over by the Government in the

name of "Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers‟

Promotion Rules, 1993" to be effective from 01.01.1986. After

bifurcation, it has been adopted by the State of Jharkhand.

20. The private respondents herein are the teachers

appointed under Rules, 1991 and governed by the promotion

Rules of 1993.

- 14 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
21. Thereafter, the Human Resource Development

Department of the State of Jharkhand under proviso to

Article 309
of the Constitution of India, vide notification no.

1632 dated 05.09.2012, framed a rule, Jharkhand Primary

School Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012 (in short referred to

as 'Rule, 2012').

22. Accordingly, the State of Jharkhand issued Notification

contained in Memo No. 1533 dated 31.7.2014, whereby a

decision was taken to appoint teachers for classes 6 to 8 in

terms of
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education

Act, 2009
. It was clarified that 50% of the said posts would be

filled up by direct recruitment and rest by way of promotion

from elementary school teachers.

23. Pursuant thereto, an advertisement was issued for

appointment of such teachers and the members of petitioner

no.1 and petitioner no.2 in W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021, as also

petitioners of W.P.(S) No.3365 of 2020 were appointed in

different districts in the year 2015 onwards in the quota

fixed for direct recruitment.

24. At this juncture, it is admitted fact that private

respondents were initially appointed on Grade I pay-scale

whereas the petitioners herein are the direct appointees on

Grade IV in the year December, 2015 onwards.

- 15 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

25. It is the case of the petitioners that after their

appointment in the month of December, 2015 and January,

2016, the respondents-authorities vide office order as

contained in memo dated 28.12.2016 granted promotion to

large number of teachers, the private respondents herein,

with retrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015, thereby the

promotes have been made senior to the direct recruits, the

appellants herein, who were appointed in December, 2015.

26. Later on, a decision has been taken by the State-

authority, as contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated

26.8.2021 issued under the signature of Joint Secretary to

the Government, School Education and Literacy Department,

Govt. of Jharkhand, for giving promotion to the teachers, who

are working in Grade-3, 4 and 7, on notional basis and

further decision has been taken to grant promotion with

retrospective effect from the date of availability of vacancy.

27. The writ petitioners, being aggrieved with the promotion

orders as contained in different memos vide order dated

28.12.2016 and Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021, has

approached this Court by filing writ petitions.

28. Before the writ Court, the petitioners have taken the

ground that the writ petitioners/appellants were appointed in

the month of December, 2015 and January, 2016 but

although the impugned order of promotion was issued on

- 16 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
28.12.2016 i.e., much later point of time i.e., about more

than a year of their initial appointment, but surprisingly the

impugned office order of promotion dated 28.12.2016 has

been issued granting promotion to teachers under Science,

Arts and Language stream to Grade IV with retrospective

effect from 01.04.2015 only with a purpose to rank the

petitioners, who are the direct recruits, below the interveners-

respondents by granting notional promotion, which is in

violation of the Promotion Rules, 1993 as also the various

circulars of Finance Department and the parent Education

Department.

29. The writ petitioners-appellants further took the ground

that Rule 2 of Promotion Rules, 1993 provides altogether 8

(eight) hierarchy i.e., from Grade I to Grade VIII for promotion

of teachers in different pay-scales. It has further been stated

that Grade I means Matric Trained Pay-scale and Grade II

and Grade III are the senior scale and selection grade scale of

Matric Trained Scale. Grade IV means Graduate Trained Pay-

Scale with two Grade V and Grade VI, which are senior scale

and Selection Grade Scale of Graduate Pay Scale. Further,

Grade VII means Headmaster basic pay scale and Grade VIII

is senior scale of Headmaster pay-scale.

30. It is further case of the petitioner in Grade IV i.e., entry

grade of Graduate Pay-Scale, the petitioners were appointed

- 17 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
in the year December, 2015 and January, 2016 whereas the

private respondents were granted Graduate Pay-scale [Grade-

IV] by way of promotion vide impugned order dated

28.12.2016, as contained in different Memos.

31. It is the specific case of the writ petitioners-appellants

that they have borne in the cadre [Graduate Pay-scale] first

therefore, the impugned order dated 28.12.2016, by which

the respondents-authorities granted promotion to large

number of teachers including the private respondents, with

retrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015, thereby the promotees

have been made senior to the direct recruits, is bad in law.

32. The writ petitioners although initially had not impleaded

the promotes as party but during pendency of the writ

petitions the promotes have entered into the proceeding by

way of filing intervention petition, which was allowed by the

writ court to cut short the multiplicity of proceeding and

based upon they were provided opportunity of hearing.

33. In the writ proceeding, the State has appeared and

contested the case by filing counter affidavits.

34. The grounds have been taken by the respondents in the

counter affidavit that the promotion which has been granted

in favour of private respondents with retrospective effect

cannot be said to suffer from error, reason being that the said

promotion order was issued in consonance with the statutory

- 18 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
provision as contained under Promotion Rules, 1993 wherein

there is no bar to grant retrospective promotion/notional

promotion. The relevant Promotion Rules, 1993 provides that

the promotion is to be granted to one or other incumbent

subject to availability of vacancy and vacancy was there but

for one or the other reason, the private respondents could not

get promotion, hence, the promotion was granted with

retrospective effect i.e., from the date of their entitlement and

vacancy being available.

35. It has further been stated that the State of Jharkhand,

therefore, has taken a uniform decision to grant

retrospective/notional promotion with effect from the date of

entitlement of one or the other teachers vide notification as

contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021, to grant

retrospective/notional promotion with effect from the date of

entitlement of one or the other teachers. It has further been

averred that such decision was taken in compliance of

various judgment including the judgment rendered in the

case of
State of Jharkhand & Ors Vs. Arun Sinha [LPA

No.
214 of 2008 with analogous cases], which ha sbeen

affirmed by Hon‟ble Apex Court in S.L.A. (Civil) No. 5520-

5522 of 2013.

36. In addition to that the interveners-private respondents

have submitted that writ petitioners have been appointed

- 19 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
much after the appointment of private respondents-

interveners, as such the seniority of the private respondents-

interveners has to be counted from the date of initial

appointment. It has further been submitted that the

members of petitioner no. 1 and petitioner no. 2 were not

even born in the service/cadre, when the interveners were

appointed. It has further been submitted that once a person

became eligible and there is vacancy, he has a right to get

promotion and merely for the fault lies on the part of the

State no one can made to suffer and the State taking into

consideration these facts since has granted promotion to

interveners vide notification/order dated 28.12.2016 by

which the respondents-authorities granted promotion with

retrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015 cannot be said to suffer

from error.

37. Learned Single Judge, taking into consideration the

aforesaid fact and considering the fact that earlier there was

no concept of direct appointment of teachers in Grade-IV

when the interveners were appointed and the concept of

appointment of teachers for classes 6 to 8 (i.e. Grade-IV)

came only after enactment of
Right of Children to Free and

Compulsory Education Act, 2009
. As such merely because

the appointment of teachers in the year 2015 onwards, the

case of those who were already in service right from 1994

- 20 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
onwards cannot be allowed to suffer. Accordingly, the writ

petitions was dismissed with an observation that the State is

free to abide by the impugned decision and grant promotion

to the teachers entitled under the law, which is the subject

matter of instant intra-court appeals.

Argument on behalf of appellants-writ petitioners:

38. Mr. Bhanu Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the

appellants-writ petitioners has challenged the order passed

by learned writ Court on the following grounds:

I. That the learned Single Judge has not appreciated

the factual aspect in right prospective that by

granting promotion with retrospective effect to the

private respondents-promotees, they have also been

granted benefit in the seniority list while fixing the

inter se seniority of the direct recruits and the

promotes and without taking into consideration the

fact that the writ petitioners [direct appointees] have

taken birth in the cadre i.e., Grade IV [Graduate

Trained Pay-Scale] way back in the month of

December, 2015 and the interveners-private

respondents have been granted promotion in Grade

IV vide notification dated 28.12.2016 i.e., after about

a year entering into the cadre by the writ petitioners-

direct appointees but by granting such promotion

- 21 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
with retrospective effect from 01.04.2015, the inter se

seniority has been disturbed. As such the promotees

even though had not taken birth in the cadre have

been shown to be senior, which cannot be said to be

just and proper. But the aforesaid fact has not been

taken into consideration by the learned Single Judge

in the impugned order.

II. The learned Single Judge has also erred in passing

the impugned order while taken into consideration

the long length of service of the interveners, which led

the learned Single Judge in coming to the conclusion

that the private respondents are treated to be senior

to that of direct recruits, who have come in the

service/cadre by virtue of enactment of the provision

of Jharkhand Primary School Teacher Appointment

Rules, 2012.

III. It has been submitted that aforesaid finding

arrived at learned Single Judge cannot be said to be

just and proper reason being that in the matter of

promotion and for the aforesaid purpose, the fixation

of inter-se seniority amongst promotees and direct

recruits i.e., the entry in the feeder cadre is to be

considered and not date of the entry in the service.

Here, admittedly, the writ petitioners-appellants

- 22 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
entered in the feeder cadre of Grade IV much prior to

the private respondents. But the learned Single Judge

has considered the basis of seniority on the ground of

entry made in initial service in the different cadres i.e,

Matric trained scale, even though the private

respondents at the time of their initial appointment

were not having teachers training certificate, but

subsequently they got training and by virtue of order

passed by this Court, they have been given benefit of

matric trained scale from the date of their initial

appointment. But the aforesaid issue of granting

matric trained scale is having no adverse effect on

anybody.

IV. But while putting the private respondents

and alike senior to that of direct recruits by granting

retrospective promotion, merely on the ground that

the private respondents have been inducted in service

way back to that of direct recruits cannot be a ground

to put the private respondents [promotees] senior to

that of direct recruits/appointees [writ petitioners]

otherwise all time to come the direct recruits will

suffer and the same cannot be said to be the principle

for deciding the inter se seniority between the private

respondents [promotees] and the petitioners. But the

- 23 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
learned Single Judge did not appreciate these facts

into consideration while passing the impugned order.

V. It has been contended that crux of the matter

revolves around the inter se seniority between the

writ petitioners-appellants and the private

respondents, who have been impleaded in

representative capacity, but the learned Single Judge

without taking into consideration the settled principle

of law that seniority cannot be given on retrospective

basis when an employee was not even born in the

cadre and by doing so, it may adversely affect the

employees who have been appointed validly in the

meantime.

VI. It has further been submitted that judgment

rendered in the case of
Arun Sinha & Ors Vs. State

of Jharkhand [W.P.(S) No.
638 of 2006] affirmed in

L.P.A. No. 214 of 2008 and the matter travelled up-to

Hon‟ble Apex Court as also in W.P.(S) No.2547 of 2014

(
Sunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs. The State of

Jharkhand & Ors.
], upon which reliance has been

placed, is not applicable in the facts and

circumstances of the present case reason being that

both the judgments are individual claim of petitioners

which pertains to grant of Grade-I Matric Trained

- 24 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Scale from the date of initial appointment and it does

not in any way deals with the issue of granting

promotion to Grade IV [Graduate Trained Scale] with

retrospective effect or in particular dealing with the

issue of inter se seniority. Therefore, the judgments

rendered in the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra) and
Sunil

Kumar Bhagat
(supra), are of no help to the private

respondents [promotees] but the learned Single Judge

relying upon the same has passed the impugned

judgment, therefore, the same requires interference

by this Court.

VII. Ground has also been taken that the

promotion was granted on the basis of Bihar Taken

Over Elementary School Teachers‟ Promotion Rules,

1993 but after coming into effect of
Right of Children

to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
in

terms of which the Jharkhand Primary School

Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012 was framed for

making direct recruitment on the post of Graduate

Trained Teacher in Grade IV, the issue of inter se

seniority of the direct recruits vis-à-vis the promotees

[private respondents], was also required to be

considered by making out a policy decision to protect

the right of the parties. However, in absence of any

- 25 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
such policy decision/rule, consideration ought to

have been given by learned Single Judge that the

private respondents, who have been granted

promotion with retrospective promotion may have no

adverse effect on the seniority of the direct recruits on

the principle that the day when the direct recruits

were appointed in view of provisions of Rule, 2012 the

promotees were not even taken birth in the cadre but

by virtue of granting retrospective promotion they

have been shown to be taken birth in the cadre

without discharging the duty in the cadre.

VIII. Therefore, the impugned Memo dated

28.12.2016, whereby many teachers including private

respondents were granted promotion to Grade-IV with

retrospective effect from 01.04.2015 is fit to be

quashed and set aside.

IX. Further ground has been taken that in the

impugned order there is no whisper about the

determination of inter se seniority of the appellants

[direct recruits] and the private respondents

[promotes[ which is the main crux of the matter and

similarly the impugned order as contained in Memo

No. 619 dated 26.08.2021 which was issued

subsequent to the appointment of the

- 26 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
petitioners/appellants is completely silent regarding

the inter se seniority between the direct recruits and

the promotes on the post of Graduate Trained Pay

Scale, as such finding recorded by the learned Single

Judge is wholly erroneous and requires interference

by this Court.

X. Learned counsel for the writ petitioners,

questioning the order/decision of the State as

contained in Memo No. 619 dated 26.08.2021, has

submitted that the said order was passed by the

State on the strength of direction passed by learned

writ Court in
W.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017 [Nand Kishor

Nayak Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors
] disposed of

vide order dated 26.09.2018, wherein prayer has

been made for direction upon the respondents-State

to pay them monetary benefits upon grant of Grade-I

from the date of appointment and further Grade-II, as

per the decision of the Hon'ble Court, passed in

W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 (Arun Sinha & ors. vs. the

State of Jharkhand & ors.) and the direction was

passed upon the State to take a uniform decision for

extending the actual benefits of promotion to the

petitioners.

- 27 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
XI. It has been submitted that in the said

judgments since there is no issue of granting Grade

IV promotion taking into consideration inter se

seniority, as in the instant case, but the State based

upon the finding so given in
W.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017

[Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors
],

issued the impugned order/decision of the State as

contained in Memo No. 619 dated 26.08.2021 which

requires to be quashed and set aside.

39. Learned counsel for the writ petitioners-appellants

based on the aforesaid ground has submitted that the order

passed by learned Single Judge needs interference by this

Court.

Submission on behalf of respondents:

40. Learned counsel for the State and the respondents-

promotees have jointly defended the order passed by learned

Single Judge by raising the following grounds:

I. It has been contended that the contesting private

respondents have been appointed in the year 1993-

1994 and since then they were working in the scale of

matric trained scale however without any training

and subsequent to training, by virtue of order passed

by this Court they have been treated to be appointed

on Matric Trained Scale from the initial date of

- 28 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
joining and in consequence thereof, they have been

entitled for matric trained scale from the date of their

initial appointment.

II. It has further been contended that vacancies were

there but due to laches committed on the part of the

State-authorities, the private respondents were not

granted promotion to higher Grades, as such they

come to this Court by filing writ petition being W.P.

(S) No. 638 of 2006 [Arun Sinha & Ors Vs. State of

Jharkhand & Ors], which was disposed of directing

the State to grant Grade-I pay scale from the date of

initial appointment and to consider for further

promotion to Grade-IV i.e., Graduate Trained pay

scale after 8/12 years of completion of service. The

order passed by writ Court attained its finality up-to

Hon‟ble Supreme Court.

III. It has been submitted that in compliance

thereof, many teachers were promoted with

retrospective effect to one or other grades treating

them in Grade-I from the date of their

appointments/joining. In compliance of the aforesaid

judgments, the State of Jharkhand took a policy

decision vide Memo No. 3027 dated 14.12.2015 for

grant of Grade-I from the date of joining of the

- 29 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
respective teachers. The issue relating to grant of

Grade-I from the date of joining/appointment,

therefore, attained its finality. Once they were treated

in Grade-I from the date of appointment/joining, their

seniority has to be fixed accordingly with their

entitlement for promotion to respective Grades.

IV. It has further been submitted that once the

teachers attained the eligibility, they are entitled for

promotion with effect from the date they were eligible

and as such the State authority taking into

consideration these aspects of the matter has granted

promotion with retrospective effect i.e., from the date

of availability of vacancy i.e., 01.04.2015, which

cannot be faulted with.

V. It has been contended that the writ

petitioners/appellants have been appointed

subsequent to the date of promotion and as such at

the time of preparing the seniority list of private

respondents and the writ petitioners, based upon the

entry in the cadre the private respondents since have

entered in the cadre prior to writ petitioner by way of

granting retrospective promotion, they have rightly

been treated senior to that of writ petitioners.

- 30 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
VI. It has been contended that the private

respondents have been promoted taking into

consideration the relevant rules of promotion i.e.,

Promotion Rules, 1993 wherein specific provision has

been made that promotion as also the inter se

seniority, shall be determined on the basis of date of

entry in the cadre and admittedly by virtue of

promotion granted in favour of private respondents

with retrospective effect they have entered in the

cadre prior to that of writ petitioners, the direct

recruits, and as such based upon Rule 8 of Rules,

1993, the private respondents have been treated to be

senior to that of writ petitioners, the direct recruits.

VII. It has further been argued that there is no

fault on the part of the private respondents or

similarly situated teachers, as they were appointed as

untrained in terms of the appointment rules

applicable at the relevant point of time, which was

framed under the proviso to
Article 309
of the

Constitution of India. The promotions of teachers

were granted in terms of the said Promotion Rules,

1993, in which, there is no bar to grant retrospective

promotion/notional promotion, particularly in a case

where delay is caused at the instance of the State.

- 31 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Once a person became eligible and there is vacancy

available, he/she has a right to get promotion with all

consequential benefits. Merely for the fault on the

part of the State, no one can be denied promotion

from retrospective date.

VIII. The ground has also been taken that the

learned Single Judge has passed the order taking into

consideration the order passed by this Court in the

case of
Arun Sinha & ors
(Supra) and
Sunil

Kumar Bhagat
(supra) wherein the issue of

retrospectivity has been taken into consideration and

based upon the same the respondents-authorities

have been directed to pay all back wages of arrears of

salary. Meaning thereby this Court has come to the

conclusive finding by holding the petitioners therein

entitled for the back wages with retrospective

promotion, which itself suggests the retrospective

promotion is permissible.

IX. Learned counsel further submits that there is

nothing wrong in granting retrospective promotion

with effect from the date of entitlement and the

vacancy being available. Taking these facts into

consideration, the State of Jharkhand since has

taken a uniform decision to grant retrospective/

- 32 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
notional promotion with effect from the date of

entitlement of one or the other teachers vide decision

dated 26.08.2021, that cannot be faulted with.

41. Learned counsel for the respondents on the aforesaid

pretext has submitted that order passed by the learned Single

Judge suffers from no error and requires no interference by

this Court.

Analysis:

42. We have heard learned counsel for the parties, gone

across the finding recorded by learned Single Judge in the

impugned orders as also the relevant rules.

43. The writ petitioners herein are mainly aggrieved with

promotion order dated 28.12.2016, whereby many teachers

including private respondents have been granted promotion

to Grade-IV with retrospective effect from 01.04.2015, which

allegedly involves dispute of inter se seniority between two

sets of teachers.

44. First set of teachers are the private respondents who

were initially appointed in the year 1993-94 in Grade I Scale,

under Bihar Primary School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991, though

initially on untrained Trained Matric Pay-Scale but later on

completion of required Teachers‟ Training and the order

passed by this Court in different writ petitions they have been

- 33 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
made entitled for Grade I pay-scale since the date of their

appointment.

45. Whereas, the second set of teachers, the writ

petitioners-appellants herein, are the direct recruits

appointed under the Jharkhand Primary School Teacher

Appointment Rules, 2012 in Grade IV, i.e., the entry level of

Graduate Trained Scale appointed in the year December,

2015.

46. Meaning thereby the dispute is in between the inter se

seniority between the direct recruits and the promotees.

47. This Court, in order to come to adjudicate the dispute

between the parties, requires to refer the admitted fact

involved in the case.

Factual aspect with respect to promotees:

48. The erstwhile State of Bihar, for appointment of primary

teachers, framed a rule vide notification dated 30.09.1991

known as „Bihar Prarambhik Vidyalaya Niyukti Niyamavali,

1991‟ [Bihar Primary School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991]

(hereinafter referred to as "the Rules, 1991") in exercise of

power conferred under
Article 309
of the Constitution of

India, wherein there was provision of appointment of

teachers, both trained and untrained. But untrained teachers

were to obtain Teachers Training Certificate by way of in-

- 34 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
service training and till then they will be entitled to get only

untrained matric pay-scale.

49. The State of Bihar further framed a rule, under the

power conferred under proviso to
Article 309
of the

Constitution of India, for promotion of the teachers of

elementary schools taken over by the Government in the

name of "Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers‟

Promotion Rules, 1993" (hereinafter referred to as "the Rules,

1993") to be effective from 01.01.1986. After bifurcation, it

has been adopted by the State of Jharkhand. Rules 7 and 8

thereof deals with „draft of seniority list for promotion‟ and

„inter-se seniority in the same grade‟.

50. The private respondents herein are the teachers

appointed under Rules, 1991 and governed by the promotion

Rules of 1993.

51. However, some disputes arose with regard to

appointment of Elementary Teachers as to whether they

should be treated district-wise appointees or State wise

because their appointment were conducted by Bihar Public

Service Commission. The matter ultimately went up-to the

Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of
Ram Vijay Kumar & Ors.

Vs. State of Bihar & Ors
[(1998) 9 SCC 227], wherein at

paragraph 5, the Hon‟ble Apex Court took serious view of the

matter that no steps were taken by the State Government for

- 35 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
imparting training to the untrained teachers, as such

direction was given to take immediate steps to finalize

syllabus and commence the training of untrained teachers

w.e.f. 01.10.1997.

52. Pursuant thereto though training was completed but

benefit of Grade I was not given from the initial date of

appointment, as such the aggrieved teachers approached this

Court invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Court, one of the

leading case is
Arun Sinha & Ors Vs. State of Jharkhand

& Ors
[W.P. (S) No. 638 of 2006], in which direction was

passed to grant Grade-I pay scale from the date of initial

appointment and to consider for further promotion to Grade-

IV i.e., Graduate Trained pay scale after 8/12 years of

completion of service. Against that order, the State of

Jharkhand preferred appeal being LPA No. 214 of 2008 with

analogous cases, which was dismissed vide order dated

06.11.2012. The matter went up-to Hon‟ble Apex Court in

SLP(C) No. 5520-5522 of 2013, which was also dismissed

vide order dated 08.03.2011.

53. Similarly, in the case of Sunil Kumar Bhagat and ors.

Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors with analogous cases, in

W.P. (S) No. 2547 of 2014, this Court directed the

respondents-State to grant Grade I scale to the teachers from

the initial date of appointment.

- 36 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

54. In view of the judgments passed by this Court, the State

Government has come out with a decision as contained in

Resolution No. 3027 dated 14.12.2015, in which, a decision

was taken by the State Government to grant Grade I Matric

Trained Scale from the initial date of appointment of such

teachers in whose case there was delay in imparting training

and publication of results. However, in the aforesaid

resolution, it was clearly mentioned that it will not be treated

as precedent.

Factual aspect with respect to recruits (writ petitioners):

55. The Human Resource Development Department of the

State of Jharkhand under proviso to
Article 309
of the

Constitution of India, vide notification no. 1632 dated

05.09.2012, framed a rule, Jharkhand Primary School Teacher

Appointment Rules, 2012 (in short referred to as 'Rule, 2012').

56. Accordingly, the State of Jharkhand issued Notification

contained in Memo No. 1533 dated 31.7.2014, whereby a

decision was taken to appoint teachers for classes 6 to 8 in

terms of
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education

Act, 2009
. It was clarified that 50% of the said posts would be

filled up by direct recruitment and rest by way of promotion

from elementary school teachers.

57. Pursuant thereto, an advertisement was issued for

appointment of such teachers and the members of petitioner

- 37 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
no.1 and petitioner no.2 in W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021, as also

petitioners of W.P.(S) No.3365 of 2020 were appointed in

different districts in the year 2015 onwards in the quota

fixed for direct recruitment.

58. Admittedly, herein the private respondents were initially

appointed on Grade I pay-scale whereas the petitioners

herein are the direct appointees on Grade IV in the year

December, 2015 onwards.

59. Further admitted fact herein is that after the

appointment of the writ petitioners in the month of

December, 2015 and January, 2016 on the post of Graduate

Trained Teacher in Grade IV and while discharging duty as

such, the respondents-authorities vide office order as

contained in memo dated 28.12.2016 granted promotion to

large number of teachers, who were appointed as per the

Promotion Rules, 1993, in Graduate Trained Pay Scale of

Grade -IV [in Science, Arts and Language Stream] with

retrospective effect i.e., 01.04.2015, thereby the promotes

have been made senior to the direct recruits, the appellants

herein, who were appointed in December, 2015 and January,

2016.

60. Later on, decision has been taken by the State-

authority, as contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated

26.08.2021 issued under the signature of Joint Secretary to

- 38 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
the Government, School Education and Literacy Department,

Govt. of Jharkhand, for giving promotion to the teachers, who

are working in Grade-3, 4 and 7, on notional basis and

further decision has been taken to grant promotion with

retrospective effect from the date of availability of vacancy.

61. The writ petitioners, being aggrieved with the promotion

orders as contained in different memos vide order dated

28.12.2016 as also Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated 26.8.2021,

has approached this Court by filing writ petitions on the

ground that though their appointment on the post of Trained

Graduate Teachers in the stream of Science, Arts and

Language in Grade IV have been made in December, 2015

and January, 2016 but the respondents-authorities granted

promotion to the private respondents vide office order dated

28.12.2016 in Graduate Trained Pay Scale with retrospective

effect from 01.04.2015 i.e., much prior to the date of

appointment of the writ petitioners-appellants, which would

adversely affect the future promotion of the direct recruits

like that of writ petitioners and disturb the inter se seniority

of the writ petitioners/appellants and they would be ranked

lower to such teachers who have been granted promotion

with retrospective effect.

62. The learned Single Judge, taking into consideration the

relevant provisions of Appointment Rules, 1991; Promotion

- 39 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Rules, 1993 and Appointment Rules, 2012 and other

provisions of law as also the law
laid down by
Court of law in

the case of
Sunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs. State of

Jharkhand & Ors.
(supra) and
Arun Sinha
(supra)

dismissed the writ petitions being W.P. (S) No. 4115 of 2021

and W.P. (S) No. 3365 of 2020, which is the subject matter

of instant intra-court appeals.

63. Therefore, this Court deems it fit and proper to now go

through the relevant provision of Rules, 1991; Rules, 1993

and Rules, 2012 as also the case laws on which reliance has

been placed by the parties as also by learned Single Judge.

64. The private respondents were appointed on the basis of

appointment Rules of 1991, namely, Bihar Primary School

Teachers‟ Rules, 1991] wherein there was provision of

appointment of teachers, both trained and untrained. But

untrained teachers were to obtain Teachers Training

Certificate by way of in-service training and till then they will

be entitled to get only untrained matric pay-scale.

65. As per the provisions contained under Rule 11 of Rules,

1991, the private respondents without having Teachers

Training were appointed as such they were initially granted

Matric Untrained Scale.

66. The Rule 11 of Rules, 1991 speaks that the candidate

who possesses teachers training certificate shall be entitled

- 40 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
for matric trained scale and who does not have teachers

training certificate, at the time of appointment, will be

appointed on matric untrained scale. It was further averred

that immediately after passing of Teachers Training

Examination, the said untrained teachers will be entitled to

get the pay-scale and benefit as Matric Trained Scale.

67. For ready reference, Rule 11 of Rules, 1991 is quoted as

under:

68. But when no in-service Teachers‟ Training was

conducted, the aggrieved teachers approached this Court by

filing number of writ petitions. Further, the dispute with

regard to appointment of Elementary Teachers as to whether

they should be treated district-wise appointees or State wise

- 41 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
because their appointment were conducted by Bihar Public

Service Commission, the matter ultimately went up-to the

Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of
Ram Vijay Kumar & Ors.

Vs. State of Bihar & Ors
[(1998) 9 SCC 227], wherein at

paragraph 5, the Hon‟ble Apex Court took serious view of the

matter that no steps were taken by the State Government for

imparting training to the untrained teachers, as such a

direction was given to take immediate steps to finalize

syllabus and commence the training of untrained teachers

w.e.f. 01.10.1997.

69. For ready reference, the factual aspect and finding given

by Hon‟ble Apex Court at paragraph 1 and 5 respectively are

quoted as under:

"1. This special leave petition relates to recruitment of
Assistant Teachers in Elementary/Primary Schools in
the State of Bihar. The said recruitment was made on
the basis of an advertisement issued on 8-10-1991. The
petitioners in this special leave petition are persons who
possess teaching qualifications obtained from
Government/Private Teachers' Training Institutions. They
had filed a writ petition in the High Court assailing the
process of selection by the Bihar Public Service Commission
(hereinafter referred to as "the Commission"). The grievance
was that the selection was made on districtwise basis and
the persons who had applied from a particular district were
treated as applicants and aspirants for appointment to the
posts in that particular district only. The said writ petition
has been disposed of by the High Court by the impugned
judgment dated 26-9-1996. The High Court has held that the
eligible candidates have a right of consideration for their

- 42 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
appointment in any one or other district cadre of Assistant
Teachers and the State could not force a person to confine
his application for a particular district cadre at the time of
application. But keeping in view the facts and circumstances,
the High Court has not set aside the impugned selection and
the appointments made on the basis of such selection.

5. From the affidavit of Shri Deepak Kumar it appears that
although appointment of Assistant Teachers on the
basis of the impugned selection was made in August
1994 no steps have been taken so far by the State
Government for imparting training to the untrained
teachers. All that has been said in the affidavit of Shri
Deepak Kumar is that the training period of two years is
being reduced to one year and the syllabus for the one-year
course is yet to be prepared. This lackadaisical approach
in the matter of imparting training to persons who are
required to teach students is indefensible. It is,
therefore, directed that the State Government shall
take immediate steps to finalise the syllabus and that
the training courses for training of the untrained
teachers should commence from 1-10-1997. It must be
ensured that all the untrained teachers who have been
appointed as per the aforementioned selection are duly
trained within two years' time."

[Emphasis supplied]

70. It needs to refer herein that the some of the teachers

appointed in the year 1993-94 since at the time of entering

into service were a simple matriculate as such they were

inducted in service in the untrained matric scale.

71. Since, there was delay in deputing the untrained

teachers for in-service training, because of which they were

not getting Grade-I pay scale, as a result of which various

writ petitions were filed before the High Court and further

- 43 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
untrained teachers remained stagnant in the same scale for

long period of time without any up-gradation, the aggrieved

submitted representation before the respondents-authority,

which was rejected vide office order dated 03.05.2003 stating

that the untrained teachers would be entitled to Grade I only

from the date of attaining training.

72. Aggrieved thereof, similarly situated persons approached

this Court by filing writ petition being W.P. (S) No. 5465 of

2007 in the case of
Awadh Bihari Mishra & Ors. Vs. The

State of Jharkhand & Ors
seeking therein prayer for grant

of Grade I scale from the date of appointment and seniority

from the date of appointment with a further prayer to grant

promotion to Grade I to Grade VII. The said writ petition was

allowed vide order 18.06.2008 directing the State to grant

Grade I from the date of joining and not from the date of

completion of Teachers Training.

73. For ready reference, the relevant paragraph of the

judgment is quoted as under:

"In this writ petition the petitioners have prayed for
quashing the letter dated 3.5.03 (Annexure-13) whereby the
representation of the petitioners has been rejected holding
that the untrained teachers would not be entitled for
promotion from Grade-I scale onwards and that they would
be entitled for promotion to Grade-I scale only from the date
of obtaining the Teachers' Training.

The petitioners were appointed as untrained teachers by the
Human Resources Development Department, Government of Bihar

- 44 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
in accordance with its policy decision and resolution dated
5.3.1991. The Government of Bihar had also framed the Rules
known as the Bihar Primary School Teachers' Rule, 1991 In
exercise of its power under
Article 309
of the Constitution of India
wherein there was a provision for appointing the in-service
untrained teachers and after appointment, for sending the said
teachers for in-service Teachers Training in the Government
Colleges.

The petitioners were untrained Graduate and were
appointed in the year 1994 on the basis of the merit list prepared
after completing all the legal formalities. The Director, Primary
Education, Government of Bihar by Letter No.-998/95 dated 7.6.95
took a decision to grant Grade-1 scale of the Matric Trained to the
untrained teachers who ware Graduate. However, after the
appointment of teachers, they were not sent for training. The
appointment procedure was also challenged before the Patna High
Court. The matter went up to the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.LP
(Civil) No. 23187/1996 (Ram Vinay Kumar & Ors: Vs. State of
Bihar & Ors.). In the said S.LP, the Supreme Court gave certain
direction on the State of Bihar for sending the petitioners for service
training. The Finance Department, Government of Jharkhand by
letter No. 4568 dated 5.7.02 granted Grade-1 Matric Trained scale
to such untrained teachers w.e.f 1.1.1996. It was also decided that
the seniority position of the petitioners shall be maintained as per
the merit list prepared at the time of their appointment. However,
the petitioners have been stagnated in the same scale for more
than 12 years without any up-gradation. In the scale. Although the
persons appointed with the petitioners have been promoted from
Grade-1 scale to Grade-IV scale, the petitioners have not been
given even Grade-11 scale. They made representation though their
Association which was rejected by the Government of Jharkhand
Indicating that the untrained teachers would not be entitled for
promotion from Grade-1 scale to Grade-VIII scale and that they
would be entitled to Grade-1 scale only from the date of attaining
the Teachers Training. The petitioners are aggrieved by the said
order.

- 45 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Today when the case is taken up for hearing, It has been
submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that in the similar
fact situation, other writ petitions have been disposed of by this
Court holding that the petitioners' seniority is to be counted from
the date-of-their appointment and that the petitioners are entitled
for consideration of fixing their seniority from the date of their
appointment and also for consideration of giving the benefit of
Grade-IV scale after completion of 8/12 years of their service. Such
directions have already been given by this Court in W.P(S)
No.4235/2004 (
Balwant Sahay Vs. The State of Jharkhand & Ors.
)
and W.P(S) No. 638/2006 (
Arun Sinha Vs. The State of Jharkhand
& Ors.
).

The said legal position has hot been disputed by learned
counsel for the respondents.

I have perused the decisions/directions given by this Court
in the said cases. This case is squarely covered by the sald
decisions of this Court. In view thereof, the impugned order/letter
dated 3.5.2003 contained in Anenxure-13 is, herby, quashed. It is
held that the respondents are entitled to get Grade-I scale
from the date of their joining from i.e., on 29.10.1994 and
not from the date of completion of the Teachers' Training.

This writ petition is allowed in the said terms."

74. Similar issue was raised in the case of
Arun Sinha &

Ors. Vs. The State of Jharkhand & Ors
[W.P. (S) No. 638

of 2006] which was disposed of vide order dated 04.04.2008,

wherein also, it has been held that the petitioners‟ case

should be considered for holding their seniority from the date

of their appointment and it was further held that their case

should be considered for giving benefit of Grade IV scales

after completion of 8/12 years of their service.

75. For ready reference, the entire order passed by learned

Single Judge is quoted hereunder as since, much emphasis

- 46 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
has been laid on this judgment by the private respondents as

also the State:

"Heard the parties finally.

2. Mr. Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,
submitted as follows. The petitioner's were appointed in
September/October, 1994 as Assistant Primary Teachers on
the recommendation of the BPSC and on the basis of merit. The
minimum qualification for appointment of such teachers was matric
and weightage was to be given to trained, but as the petitioners
had higher qualifications namely graduation and above they were
given matric trained scale since their appointment, in the light of
the government circulars. They were given replacement scales
subsequently of Grade-1. Petitioners repeatedly requested for
sending them for training but they were sent only in 1998,
and that too only after the orders passed by the Supreme
Court on 5.9.1997. They completed the training in the year
1999 but the result was published in the year 2002 only
after the intervention of the Court. In the circumstances,
petitioners were not at fault in not acquiring training.
Therefore, the petitioners should be given grade IV scale as
they have also completed the requisite period Le. 8/12 years
in service. He also relied on clause 3 (Kha) of the Circular dated
25.6.1909, issued by the Finance Department, Government of
Bihar, in which, it is said that the seniority of the untrained
primary teachers will remain intact, in any case, even if they do not
pass the training examination or if they do not get training. He also
relied on the order dated 5.1.2007 passed in WPS No. 6264 of
2005 Jharkhand Police Association etc. and submitted that
petitioners cannot be made to suffer if they were not sent for
training and there was delay in completing the training.

3.Counsel for the State on the other hand submitted as follows. It
is true that on the basis of merit list and ranking list of the
petitioners, they were appointed against matric trained pay-scale
in accordance with different orders/directions of the State
Government, and that as per the said Circular dated 25.6.1999,
the seniority is to be counted from the date of appointment, but in

- 47 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
view of paragraph 13 of GSR 28 dated 9.7.1993, petitioners are
entitled for, grade 1 pay-scale from the date of passing Teachers
Training Examination ic. 3.5.2002. He lastly submitted that
seniority list is yet to be finalized.

4. It is not disputed that petitioners were appointed in
September/October 1994 in the matric trained scale and were
subsequently, given replacement scale of Grade-1 as per the
current Circular. It is also not disputed that only after the
intervention of the Court, petitioners were sent for training in 1998,
and the result was published only in 2002 on the intervention of
the Court. Therefore, it, cannot be said that petitioners were at fault
in not getting training.
In these circumstances
,
the said judgment
of

Jharkhand Police Association
(Supra) supports the case of the
petitioner. It is also not disputed that as per the Circular dated
25.6.1999, which is subsequent to the Circular dated 9.7.1993,
petitioner's seniority is to be counted from their dates of
appointment.

5. In the facts and circumstances of this case, as noticed
above, petitioners' case should be considered for having
their seniority from the date of their appointment. They
should also be considered for giving benefit of. Grade-IV
scales after completion of 8/12 years of their service.

Accordingly, the petitioners will be at liberty to file
individual representations, on which, the Director, Human
Resources Development Department ( Primary Education),
Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi ( respondent no. 2) will
pass necessary orders in terms of this order within four weeks
from the date of receipt/production of the representations.

With these observations and directions, this writ petition is
disposed of. No costs."

76. The State preferred intra-court appeal against the

order passed by learned Single Judge by filing L.P.A. No. 214

of 2008 and analogous cases [
The State of Jharkhand &

Ors. Vs. Arun Sinha & Ors.
], which was dismissed vide

common order dated 6th November, 2012.

- 48 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

77. For ready reference, the judgment passed in L.P.A. No.

214 of 2008 and analogous cases [
The State of

Jharkhand & Ors. Vs. Arun Sinha & Ors.
], is quoted as

under:

"Heard learned counsel for the parties.

These Letters Patent Appeals are decided by this common
order since identical question is involved in these appeals.

The writ petitioners-respondents are the appointees of the
year 1993-94. When they were appointed, they were untrained
teachers. The petitioners' contention is that they requested the
appellant-State to send them for training so that they may not be
put in the category of untrained teachers. However, they were sent
for training in the year 1998, and that too only in view of the order
passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 05.9.1997. The
petitioners completed the training in the year 1999 but the result
was published in the year 2002 only and that too after intervention
of the Court. The petitioners, therefore, claimed that they should be
given Grade IV scale as they have also completed the requisite
period i.e., 8/12 years in service from the date of their
appointment. The petitioners also submitted that in view of the
Circular of the Government dated 25.6.1999 of Finance
Department, Government of Bihar, it has been specifically clarified
that the seniority of the untrained primary teachers will remain
intact, in any case, even if they do not pass the training
examination or if they do not get training.

Learned Single Judge accepted the contention of the writ
petitioners in toto and observed that though they were initially
appointed as untrained teachers and they were entitled to training
which were provided to them by the Government in the year 1998
and that too in view of the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court. The petitioners took and completed the training in the year
1999 but their result was published in the year 2002 and that too
when the Court intervened. In these facts and circumstances of the
case, the petitioners were not at fault in not getting the training but
it was the fault of the State Government. In view of the above

- 49 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
reasons, the writ petition filed by the petitioners was allowed,
hence, the present L.P.As have been preferred by the State.

Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the
Circular dated 25.6.1999 though provided that seniority will not be
affected by training or nontraining as provided under Clause
3(Kha) of the said Circular, that Circular has been withdrawn
retrospectively by the decision of the Cabinet of Government, dated
16.9.2000 and, therefore, petitioners are entitled to any relief of
being untrained teachers at the time of appointment.

Learned counsel for the appellant-State submitted that so is
the position in Bihar Taken Over Elementary School Teachers
Promotion Rules, 1993 and relied upon Rule 13 of the said Rules
wherein it has been provided that untrained teachers shall not be
eligible for promotion to any of the Grade i.e. 1 to 8 and as per the
said sub-rule (3) of Rule 13, an untrained teacher may be given
Grade 1 from the date on which he becomes trained.

We have considered the submission of the learned counsel
for the parties and perused the reasons given in the impugned
Judgment.

Learned Single Judge has carefully considered all the issues
involved in the petition and found that the petitioners were though
appointed in the year 1993-94 but they were not provided training
by the fault of the State only and even the training was provided
only after passing of the order by Hon'ble Supreme Court on
05.9.1997. Even when the petitioners completed training in the
year 1999, their result was not published and after intervention of
the Court, that result was published in the year 2002. Therefore, in
that fact situation the petitioners are not at fault in obtaining
training. Not only this, but in our considered opinion also, once
seniority is required to be determined in view of the Circular dated
25.6.1999 and that stands determined because of that Circular
and the same could not be made ineffective by the subsequent
withdrawal of the said Circular by the State Cabinet with
retrospective effect. However, that was not the issue decided by
the learned Single Judge as it has been raised by the petitioners
but effect of that Circular, which has already been given, cannot be
taken away and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we are

- 50 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
of the considered opinion that there is no merit in these L.P.As.
which are, accordingly, dismissed."

78. Against the order passed in the said intra-court appeals

the State went to the Hon‟ble Apex Court by filing S.L.A.

(Civil) No. 5520-5522 of 2013 in the case of
State of

Jharkhand & Ors Vs. Arun Sinha & Ors
which was also

dismissed.

79. Similarly, the series of writ petitions, leading case is

Sunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs. State of Jharkhand &

Ors
[WPS No. 2547 of 2014] was filed with respect of claim

of individual petitioners for grant of Grade-I Scale and

seniority from the date of their initial joining as Assistant

Teachers in Elementary Schools within the State. These

petitioners have relied upon the judgment rendered by this

Court in the case of Arun Sinha & others Vrs. State of

Jharkhand & others passed in W.P.S. No. 638 of 2006 vide

order dated 4.4.2008. The batch of writ petitions was

disposed of vide order dated 17.12.2015. The relevant portion

of the judgment is quoted as under:

9. This issue relating to seniority from the date of initial joining and
grant of Grade-I scale to the Assistant Teacher in Primary school
has engaged the attention of this Court in several matters. The
respondent- State has in due deference to the
ratio
laid down in
the
case of
Arun Sinha & others
(supra) now taken a policy decision
to grant the said benefit as per the terms of the said resolution
quoted herein above to individual incumbents. It would now be
proper that the cases of individual petitioners who fall within the
terms of the resolution dated 14.12.2015, quoted herein above, be

- 51 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
considered by the respondents- District authorities. The District
Superintendent of Education of authority‟s respective districts
would examine the individual cases as per the procedure
laid
down by
placing the matter before the District Education
Establishment Committee for taking an informed decision in respect
of individual claims in accordance with law and the aforesaid
policy decision within a reasonable time, preferably 16 weeks from
the date of receipt of copy of this order.

10. It would not be out of place to record appreciation for the
efforts taken by the State counsels and the respondent-

Department in coming out with the policy resolution, which may
possibly reduce institution of large number of cases with similar
grievances in this Court.

11. All the writ petitions are accordingly disposed of with the
aforesaid observations and directions. Pending I.A.s also stand
closed."

80. The State taking into consideration the Bihar Primary

School Teachers‟ Rules, 1991; Promotion Rules, 1993 and

different circulars/resolutions passed by the State as also the

judicial pronouncements as enunciated in the case of
Arun

Sinha & Ors. Vs. The State of Jharkhand
(supra) has

after obtaining opinion from the Law Department of State,

has come out with resolution as contained in Memo No.3027

dated 14.12.2015.

- 52 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
"In my view and opinion there may be two important issues
for the department to consider now-

(i) Grant of Grade-1 Scale to the writ petitioners and similarly
situated others from the date of their appointment and not
from the date of completion of their training.

(ii) Grant of Grade-IV Scale to the writ petitioners and
similarly situated others from the date of completion of their
service of 8/12 years.

So far the issue no. I is concerned, in my view and
opinion the said issue may be treated to be conclusively
decided upto the level of the Hon'ble Apex Court and not only
the writ petitioners but all other similarly situated teachers
may be directed to be granted Grade-1 Scale from the date of
their appointment and not from the date of completion of their
training.

So for the issue no. Il is concerned, the Hon'ble High
Court had in the case of Arun Sinha and ors. directed
the State Government to consider for giving benefit of
Grade-4 Scale after completion of 8/12 years of their
service. The Hon'ble Division Bench did not although
discuss that issue and concentrated mainly on first
issue itself but in view of the dismissal of the LPA and SLP
that direction/judgment has attained finality.

It does not transpire from the records as to what
decision has been taken after the concerned order of the
Hon'ble Court dated 04.04.08 passed in the case of Arun
Sinha and ors in the matter of grant of Grade 4 Scale to
them.

However, I must point out that with respect to the
matter of grant of Grade-4 Scale to the writ petitioners
or other similarly situated teachers, the department
may very well consider all the aspects including the
various provisions i.e. Rule 5,6&7 of the concerned
1993 Rules, (except the condition no. 2 of Rule-4) and
find out as to whether the writ petitioners or other
similar situated teachers will be entitled to get Grade -
4 Scale after completion of their service of 8/12 years

- 53 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
if they are treated to be in Grade 1 Scale from the date
of their appointment.

86. Provision of establishment committee has also been

carved out therein for the purpose of promotion, which is

headed by District Magistrate and the committee is delegated

Grade 3-Trained Graduate and minimum 12 years of service

in Grade-2 or Matric Trained and minimum 18 years of

service in Grade-2 is required. For promotion to Grade-4-

- 60 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Trained Graduate and minimum 8 years of service in Grade-I

in the event of promotion from Grade-1 to the Grade-4 in

December of the previous year, shall be prepared according to

the standard
laid down in
Rule 8 by the District

Superintendent of Education.

90. Rule 8 provides inter-se seniority in the same grade,

upon which much emphasis has been laid down. It has been

stated as under Rule 8 Inter se seniority of teachers working

- 61 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
in the same grade shall be decided in the manner that - (1)

the date of getting the said grade shall be the basis for

determining the seniority. If the date of getting the grade is

the same, then date of getting lower grade shall be the basis

and accordingly date of getting lowest grade, whereever

required, shall be the basis; (2) In case of the date of getting

the grade is the same, date of birth shall be the basis; (3) In

case of date of birth being the same
,
in that case
inter-

se seniority shall be determined according to the alphabetical

order of their names in Roman script.‟

91. This Court needs to refer herein that the provision of

Rule 8 is with respect to inter se seniority in a Grade of the

promotes having no nexus of preparation of seniority list of

the „Direct Recruits‟ and the „Promotees‟, as the case herein.

Such observation is being made by this Court due to the

reason that when the Promotion Rule, 1993 was enacted

there was no mode of direct recruitment to the post of

„Trained Graduate Teacher‟ in Grade IV rather the decision

has been taken for fulfilling the post through direct

recruitment only after coming into effect of
Right of Children

to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
and in order to

achieve the intent and object of the said Act, the Jharkhand

Primary School Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012 was enacted

- 62 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
for making direct recruitment on the post of Graduate

Trained Teacher in Grade IV.

92. Rule 9 of Rules, 2012 thereof stipulates that all the

vacancies of Class 1 to 5 will be filled amongst Intermediate

Trained and for classed 6 to 8, 50% vacancies will be filled up

by Graduate Trained Teachers through direct recruitment

process.

93. The basic purpose of
Right of Children to Free and

Compulsory Education Act, 2009
, was of ensuring every

child‟s access to quality education. It is a legislative initiative

that seeks to make education a fundamental right for every

child aged 6 to 14 years in India.
The Act
emphasizes the

importance of free and compulsory education, focusing on

inclusivity, equity, and quality.

94. It is admitted case that the writ petitioners-appellants

have been appointed on the post of Graduate Trained Teacher

in Grade IV to fulfill the object and intent of
Right of Children

to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
pursuant to

which Jharkhand Primary School Teacher Appointment

Rules, 2012 was framed.

95. The private respondents have been inducted in the

service and thereafter, according to them, they are entitled to

be granted to promotion to different Grades from the date of

their entitlement, but the same has not been granted.

- 63 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

96. While on the other hand, the case of the appellants-writ

petitioners, is that they have been appointed through direct

mode of recruitment on the basis of 50% quota, in December,

2015 and January, 2016, as provided under the provisions of

Rule, 2012, as Graduate Trained Teacher in Grade IV.

97. We have already noted above that posts of primary

teachers are in three Cadres. At the cost of repetition, it is

again being referred herein that first cadre is of - Matric

Trained teachers; second cadre i.e., Grade IV to VI are of

Graduate Trained Teachers whereas third Cadre i.e., Grade

VII and VIII are said to be post of the Headmasters. All the

hierarchy of posts carries different pay-scales.

98. In Matric Trained Scale, Grade I is the basic cadre

Matric Trained Pay-scale whereas Grade II and Grade III are

the senior scale and selection grade scale respectively.

99. In Graduate Trained Scale, Grade IV is the basic cadre

whereas two Grade V and Grade VI, are senior scale and

Selection Grade Scale respectively of Graduate Pay Scale.

100. In Headmaster Cadre, Grade VII is the basic Grade

whereas Grade VIII is senior scale of Headmaster pay-scale.

101. Meaning thereby, entry Grade for Matric Trained Scale

is Grade I, for Graduate Trained Scale Grade IV is the basic

Grade whereas for Headmaster Cade Grade VII is the basic

Grade.

- 64 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

102. Prior to coming into effect of Rules, 2012, primary

teachers were to be appointed in Grade I and as per Rules,

1993 they were supposed to be granted promotion from

Grade I to Grade VIII, as per their entitlement and there was

no issue of inter se seniority between the promotes and direct

recruits. But after coming into effect of Rules, 2012, there

was direct appointment on the basic cadre of „Graduate

Trained Teacher‟ in Grade IV.

103. Admittedly, the private respondents were not promoted

the day when the writ petitioners were appointed and

inducted in service in Grade IV through direct mode i.e., in

December, 2015 and January, 2016, the basic post of

Graduate Trained Teacher. But, the private respondents have

been promoted vide order dated 28.12.2016 but with

retrospective effect from 01.04.2015.

104. Being aggrieved with such promotion of granting

promotion with retrospective effect, the writ petitioners have

approached this Court taking the ground that promotion with

retrospective effect has been granted to the private

respondents only with a purpose to make the directs recruits

like petitioners junior in the cadre though they borne in the

cadre prior to private respondents and have been inducted in

service when the private respondents did not borne in service.

- 65 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

105. But, the learned Single Judge taking into consideration

the long length of service of the interveners-private

respondents, came to the conclusion that the private

respondents are treated to be senior to that of direct recruits

and further learned Single Judge took note of the law
laid

down in
the case of
Arun Sinha & Ors Vs. State of

Jharkhand
(supra) and Sunil Kumar Bhagat & Ors. Vs.

The State of Jharkhand & Ors. (supra) and did not

interfere with the order of promotion which was given with

retrospective effect to the private respondents.

106. This Court, on the basis of aforesaid facts, submissions

and law laid down by Court of law, is of the view that

following issues are required to be answered for adjudication

of lis:

"(I).Whether grant of retrospective promotion w.e.f.

01.04.2015 vide office order dated 28.12.2016 to the private

respondents in Grade IV, based upon the provision of Rules,

1993, after appointment of direct recruits in December, 2015

in Grade IV, under Rules, 2012, can be said to be justified

which allegedly have adverse impact to the interest in

particular inter se seniority, on the direct recruits?"

(II).Whether merely because the private respondents have

been inducted in service in the year 1993-94, and as such by

taking their long length of service can they be extended the

benefit of retrospective promotion to Grade IV by treating them

- 66 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
to be senior, over and above, the direct recruits, who have

been appointed by virtue of enactment of new Rules, 2012

directly on Grade IV?

(III).Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, after

coming into effect of Rules, 2012, the retrospective promotion

granted under provisions of Rule 8 of Rules, 1993 to the

private respondents can be said to be justified without taking

care of inter se seniority of the direct recruits?

(IV).Whether grant of promotion in view of provision of Rule 8

of Rules, 1993 can be a rider upon the direct recruits for

considering them junior to that of promotees, the private

respondents?

(V).Whether the judgments rendered by this Court in the case

of the
Arun Sinha
(supra) and
Sunil Kumar Bhagat

(supra), reliance upon which has been placed by learned

Single Judge also while dismissing the writ petition, are

applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case, where

the core issue is of inter se seniority between the writ

petitioners [direct recruits] and the private respondents

[promotees]?

(VI).Whether the policy decision taken by the State vide

resolution 26.08.2021, without taking into consideration the

adverse impact of the same upon the direct recruits after

coming into effect of Rules, 2012, can be said to be justified

and sustainable in the eye of law?"

- 67 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

107. Since all the issues are inter-linked, and as such they

are taken up together to be answered.

108. The core issue involved in the lis is the retrospective

promotion granted to the private respondents without taking

care of the inter se seniority of the direct recruits.

109. So far the issue of grant of retrospective

promotion/notional promotion is concerned, there is no bar

to grant retrospective promotion/notional promotion with

effect from the date of one‟s entitlement and the vacancy

being available and particularly the fact when delay is caused

at the instance of the State. There is nothing wrong in

granting retrospective promotion. Therefore, the issue of

granting retrospective promotion, if such occasion arises, is

no more res integra.

110. But if the retrospective promotion is granted causing

any adversity to other similarly situated persons, then such

retrospective promotion cannot be said to be justified.

111. Here, the situation is otherwise as because of grant of

retrospective promotion to private respondents who have

been promoted by virtue of the Rules, 1993 is causing

adverse interest upon the inter se seniority of the direct

recruits, the writ petitioners herein, who have been appointed

as per new Rules, 2012.

- 68 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

112. At this juncture, the judgments rendered by this Court

rendered in the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra),
Sunil Kumar

Bhagat
(supra) and
Nand Kishor Nayak
(supra) are

required to be referred herein, as much reliance have been

placed by the parties upon these judgments and even while

framing the policy decision dated 26.08.2021, which is under

challenge also, the State has taken reference of judgment

rendered in the case of
Nand Kishor Nayak
(supra) and the

learned Single Judge while passing the judgment in
Nand

Kishor Nayak
(supra) has put reliance upon the judgment

rendered in the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra), which has been

affirmed up-to Hon‟ble Apex Court.

113. Therefore, this Court first deems it fit and proper to

again go to the judgment rendered in the case of
Arun Sinha

(supra), wherefrom it is evident that prayer has been made

for grant of Grade IV as they have also completed the

requisite/minimum period of 8/12 years in service.

Submission was made therein that since the petitioners were

not at fault in not acquiring training, therefore, the

petitioners should be given grade IV scale.

114. Learned counsel for the State on the other hand taken

the ground that it is true that on the basis of merit list and

ranking list of the petitioners, they were appointed against

matric trained pay-scale in accordance with different

- 69 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
orders/directions of the State Government, and that as per

the said Circular dated 25.6.1999, the seniority is to be

counted from the date of appointment, but in view of

paragraph 13 of GSR 28 dated 9.7.1993, petitioners are

entitled for, grade 1 pay-scale from the date of passing

Teachers Training Examination i.c. 3.5.2002.

115. The learned Single judge taking note of the fact that

petitioners were appointed in September/October 1994 under

the matric trained scale and were subsequently, sent for

training in 1998, and the result was published only in 2002

on the intervention of the Court, therefore, the petitioners

were not at fault in not getting training. Therefore, it was held

that the petitioners' case should be considered for having

their seniority from the date of their appointment. They

should also be considered for giving benefit of. Grade-IV

scales after completion of 8/12 years of their service.

Accordingly, the petitioners were granted liberty to file

individual representations, on which, the Director, Human

Resources Development Department (Primary Education),

Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi was directed to pass

necessary orders in terms of the order passed by writ Court.

116. The order passed by writ Court in the case of
Arun

Sinha
(supra) attained finality up-to Hon‟ble Supreme Court.

- 70 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

117. From perusal of judgment passed in
Arun Sinha

(supra), it is evident that learned Court has held that case of

the petitioners, who were appointed sometimes in the year

1993-94, may be considered for having their seniority from

the date of their initial appointment and not from the date of

completion of training, as it is the State because of which the

teachers training of the petitioners could not be completed in

time and result of which was also published after much

delay. It was further directed to consider the case of the

petitioners for giving benefit of. Grade-IV scales after

completion of 8/12 years of their service.

118. Similar prayer was made in batch of writ petitions

leading case is
Sunil Kumar Bhagat
(supra), wherein

allegedly the petitioners were appointed in the year

1987/1988/1994 or 1999-2000 and prayed for grant of

Grade-I Scale and seniority from the date of their initial

joining as Assistant Teachers in Elementary Schools within

the State relying upon the judgment rendered by this Court

in the case of Arun Sinha & others Vrs. State of

Jharkhand & others passed in W.P.S. No. 638 of 2006

dated 04.04.2008 on the ground that delay in obtaining the

Teachers' Training qualification was not on account of their

fault.

- 71 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

119. During pendency of the writ petition, the respondent-

Secretary, Human Resources Development Department,

Government of Jharkhand was also asked to take a call on

the necessity to issue general executive instructions/circulars

to all the District authorities laying down clear-cut guidelines

to deal with the matters, which are covered by the
ratio
laid

down in
the case of
Arun Sinha & others
(Supra).

120.
In terms thereof, the resolution bearing memo no. 3027

dated 14.12.2015 containing the policy decision of the State

on the aforesaid issue in terms of the
ratio
laid down in
the

case of
Arun Sinha & others
(Supra) was brought on

record, wherein taking note of the fact that
ratio
laid down in

the case of
Arun Sinha & others
(Supra) has been affirmed

up-to the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, laid down guidelines,

wherein it is decided that teachers appointed in the year

1987 and 1988 shall be entitled to Grade I from the date of

their initial appointment and inter se seniority shall be

counted from the date of their initial appointment. Further,

the teachers appointed in the year 1991, 1994, 1999-2000

shall be entitled to Grade I from the date of their initial

appointment and inter se seniority shall be counted from the

date of their initial appointment. It was further decided that

the inter se seniority amongst above category of teachers will

be decided on basis of the date of their initial appointment

- 72 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
and further promotion shall be granted on the basis of

Promotion Rules, 1993.

121. In terms of the aforesaid circular/resolution, the writ

petition was disposed of holding that the cases of individual

petitioners who fall within the terms of the resolution dated

14.12.2015 be considered by the respondents- District

authorities. The District Superintendent of Education of

respective districts would examine the individual cases as per

the procedure
laid down by
placing the matter before the

District Education Establishment Committee for taking an

informed decision in respect of individual claims in

accordance with law and the aforesaid policy decision within

a reasonable time, preferably 16 weeks from the date of

receipt of copy of this order.

122. There is no dispute about the aforesaid proposition of

law
laid down in
the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra),
Sunil

Kumar Bhagat
(supra) since no issue of adversity being

caused to the direct recruits was there, rather, the in the case

of
Arun Sinha
(supra) prayer was made to grant Grade IV as

they have also completed the requisite period 8/12 years in

service on the ground that petitioners were not at fault in not

acquiring training. State had taken the ground that the

seniority is to be counted from the date of appointment, but

in view of paragraph 13 of GSR 28 dated 9.7.1993,

- 73 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
petitioners are entitled for Grade 1 pay-scale from the date of

passing Teachers Training Examination i.c. 3.5.2002.

However, the learned Single judge considering the fact that

the petitioners were not at fault in not getting training held

that the petitioners' case should be considered for having

their seniority from the date of their appointment. They

should also be considered for giving benefit of. Grade-IV

scales after completion of 8/12 years of their service.

123. Similar prayer was made in batch of writ petitions

leading case is
Sunil Kumar Bhagat
(supra), wherein the

petitioners, who were appointed in the year 1987/1988/1994

or 1999-2000, made prayed for grant of Grade-I Scale and

seniority from the date of their initial joining as Assistant

Teachers by relying upon the judgment rendered by this

Court in the case of Arun Sinha & others Vrs.

State of

Jharkhand & others
(supra). During pendency of the case,

on the direction of the Court, resolution dated 14.12.2015

was brought on record by the State, wherein it has been

decided that teachers appointed in the year 1987 and 1988

shall be entitled to Grade I from the date of their initial

appointment and inter se seniority shall be counted from the

date of their initial appointment. In terms of the aforesaid

circular/resolution, the writ petition was disposed of.

- 74 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

124. Admittedly, the day when the judgment was passed, in

the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra) there was no existence of

Rules, 2012 carving out a provision for direct recruitment in

Grade IV on the post of Graduate Trained Teacher.

125. This Court, therefore, is of the view that the reliance

which has been placed and taken note of by the learned

Single Judge in the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra) stating that

the issue of retrospectivity has been dealt with in those cases,

and on the principle laid down therein the private

respondents have been granted retrospective promotion, is

not acceptable and we are not in agreement with such stand

reason being that either in the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra) or

in the case of
Sunil Kumar Bhagat
(supra) there was no

issue of adverse interest of the party concerned or the issue

of adverse interest of direct recruits, as the case herein.

126. But the authority concerned without taking note of

these facts granted promotion to private respondents vide

memo dated 28.12.2016 with retrospective effect from

01.04.2015.

127. It is settled position of law that the retrospective

promotion without taking into consideration the predicament

of the others is not permissible reason being that when a

third party interest is being jeopardized then the

- 75 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
circumspection is to be made so as not to infringe the right of

others.

128. While granting retrospective promotion, the matter

would have different if the right of none of the parties is being

infringed, then the retrospective promotion can be granted.

129. So far as the argument of emphasizing Rule 8 of the

Rules, 1993 is concerned the same has already been
referred

above
, which deals with the inter se seniority in the same

Grade, which speaks that date of getting the said grade shall

be the basis for determining the seniority. If the date of

getting the Grade is the same, then date of getting lower

Grade shall be the basis and accordingly date of getting

lowest grade, where-ever required, shall be the basis.

130. It is evident therefrom that the Rule 8 of Rules, 1993

only speaks with respect of interest of the promotes of inter se

seniority of same cadre and same is not related with the inter

se seniority of „promotees‟ from I to Grade IV vis-à-vis direct

recruits under Grade IV appointed on the post of „Graduate

Trained Teacher‟, since at the time when the Rules, 1993 was

formulated, there was no concept of direct recruits on the

post of Trained Graduate Teacher in Grade IV directly rather

the concept of direct appointment of Trained Graduate

Teacher in Grade IV comes only after coming into effect of

Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act
,

- 76 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
2009 in terms of which the Jharkhand Primary School

Teacher Appointment Rules, 2012 was framed by the State of

Jharkhand for making direct recruitment on the post of

Graduate Trained Teacher in Grade IV.

131. Therefore, the contention which has been raised that

whatever submission has been made that in terms of Rule 8

is having no bearing with respect to the present issue.

132. Furthermore, the Rule 8 of Rules, 1993 cannot be read

to be in isolation without taking into consideration the

interest of direct recruits, who have been appointed in terms

of provisions of Rules, 2012.

133. The issue of infirmity in Rules, 1993, in particular Rule

8 is also not there and based upon that if the promotion has

been granted is also not the issue but the concerned of this

Court is that while granting such promotion can it said to be

justified action on the part of the State in depriving the right

of the seniority of direct recruits, who admittedly have come

in the Cadre prior to that of promotes, and by giving

retrospective promotion the direct recruits [writ petitioners]

have been lowered down in seniority list which certainly

hamper the future promotion of direct recruits.

134. The law is also well settled with retrospective seniority

cannot be granted to an employee from a date when the

employee was not borne on a cadre. Seniority amongst

- 77 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
members of the same grade has to be counted from the date

of initial entry into the grade, reference in this regard be

made to the judgment rendered in the case of
Ganga Vishan

Gujarati & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.
[(2019) 16

SCC 28], wherein the Hon‟ble Apex Court in the background

of the factual aspect has laid down following proposition of

law, as under paragraph 45 which reads as under:

45. A consistent line of precedent of this Court follows the
principle that retrospective seniority cannot be granted to
an employee from a date when the employee was not
borne on a cadre. Seniority amongst members of the same
grade has to be counted from the date of initial entry into
the grade. This principle emerges from the decision of the
Constitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II
Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra [Direct
Recruit Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of
Maharashtra, (1990) 2 SCC 715 : 1990 SCC (L&S) 339] .
The
principle was reiterated by this Court in
State of
Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath [State of Bihar
v. Akhouri
Sachindra Nath, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 334 : 1991 SCC (L&S)
1070] and State of Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma [State
of Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma, (2007) 1 SCC 683 :

(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 594] .
In
Pawan Pratap Singh v. Reevan
Singh [Pawan Pratap Singh
v. Reevan Singh, (2011) 3 SCC 267 :
(2011) 1 SCC (L&S) 481] , this Court revisited the precedents on
the subject and observed : (SCC pp. 281-82, para 45)
"45. ... (i) The effective date of selection has to be understood in
the context of the Service Rules under which the appointment is
made. It may mean the date on which the process of selection
starts with the issuance of advertisement or the factum of
preparation of the select list, as the case may be.

(ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service has to be
determined as per the Service Rules. The date of entry in

- 78 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
a particular service or the date of substantive
appointment is the safest criterion for fixing seniority
inter se between one officer or the other or between one
group of officers and the other recruited from different
sources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory rules,
executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent with the
requirements of
Articles 14
and
of the Constitution.

(iii) Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be granted from
the backdate and if it is done, it must be based on
objective considerations and on a valid classification and
must be traceable to the statutory rules.

(iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of
occurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given
retrospectively unless it is so expressly provided by the
relevant Service Rules. It is so because seniority cannot
be given on retrospective basis when an employee has not
even been borne in the cadre and by doing so it may
adversely affect the employees who have been appointed
validly in the meantime."

This view has been re-affirmed by a Bench of three Judges of
this Court in
P. Sudhakar Rao v. U. Govinda Rao [P. Sudhakar
Rao
v. U. Govinda Rao, (2013) 8 SCC 693 : (2014) 1 SCC (L&S)
690] .

[Emphasis supplied]

135. The Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of
Ganga Vishan

Gujarati & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.
(supra)

taking reference of the judgment rendered by Constitution

Bench of Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of Direct Recruit

Class II Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of

Maharashtra [Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers'

Assn. v. State of Maharashtra, (1990) 2 SCC 715 : 1990

SCC (L&S) 339], in which, it has been held that inter se

- 79 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
seniority in a particular service has to be determined as per

the Service Rules. The date of entry in a particular service or

the date of substantive appointment is the safest criterion for

fixing seniority inter se between one officer or the other or

between one group of officers and the other recruited from

different sources. Any departure therefrom in the statutory

rules, executive instructions or otherwise must be consistent

with the requirements of
Articles 14
and
of the

Constitution. Ordinarily, notional seniority may not be

granted from the backdate and if it is done, it must be based

on objective considerations and on a valid classification and

must be traceable to the statutory rules.

136. The seniority cannot be reckoned from the date of

occurrence of the vacancy and cannot be given retrospectively

unless it is so expressly provided by the relevant Service

Rules. It is so because seniority cannot be given on

retrospective basis when an employee has not even been

borne in the cadre and by doing so it may adversely affect the

employees who have been appointed validly in the meantime.

137. Further reference in this regard be made to the

judgment rendered in the case of
Nani Sha & Ors. Vs. State

of Arunachal Pradesh & Ors.
[(2007) 15 SCC 406],

wherein in the similar fact situation, the appellants were

promoted from the post of Forest Rangers to Assistant

- 80 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Conservator of Forests in the year 2002 in accordance with

Arunachal Pradesh Forest Service Rules, but they were given

seniority retrospectively from 1994 which made them senior

to direct recruits who had been appointed in the year 1996.

Legal issue involved was whether the Rules prescribed any

quota for promotees, under which the promotees should get

retrospective seniority according to their quota. Rule 5(α)

provided that 50% of substantive "vacancies" which occur

from time to time in the authorised permanent strength of the

service shall be filled by direct recruitment. Similarly, Rule

5(b) provided that the remaining substantive "vacancies"

should be filled by promotion. Besides, Rule 25(c) provided

that "... relative seniority of direct recruits and of promotees

shall be determined according to rotation of vacancies

between direct recruits and promotees which shall be based

on the quotas of vacancies reserved for direct recruitment

and promotion under Rule 5.

138. From the above provision, the High Court inferred that

there was no quota between the promotes and direct recruits

in the un-amended Rule 5. The High Court therefore held

that promotes who were promoted in 2002, could not be

given seniority retrospectively from 1994 when they were still

working on the feeder post of Forest Ranger. Aggrieved

thereof, the appellant moved the Supreme Court. The Hon‟ble

- 81 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Supreme Court held that the High Court was right in holding

that promote appellants could not be given seniority from the

date they were not even borne in the cadre. The appellants

were working under the direct recruits right from 1996 till

2002. It would therefore, be unfair to allow appellants to steal

a march over direct appointees under whom they worked

practically for eight years. There is no justification in

upsetting the whole balance at this point of time.

139. For ready reference, the relevant paragraphs of the

judgment is quoted as under:

3. The appeal has been filed by five appellants challenging
the judgment of the Division Bench of the Gauhati High Court
whereby the judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High
Court was confirmed. The learned Single Judge had allowed
the writ petition filed by the respondents herein. In the writ
petition the respondents herein, who are the directly
appointed Assistant Conservator of Forests (hereinafter
referred to as "ACF", for short) had challenged an Order
passed by the State of Arunachal Pradesh dated 8-6-2004
vide No. FOR 376/E(A)/2001/4901-61 granting retrospective
effect promotions to the appellants herein with effect from 2-

11-1994. With that retrospective effect Respondents 3 to 7
herein became junior to the appellants since they were all
appointed in the year 1996 after direct examination to the
post of ACF. The learned Judge found that giving such
retrospective effect would be illegal and on the date
concerned they were not even borne on the cadre of ACF
and were only serving as Range Forest Officer. He also
found that in the unamended Rule 5 which provided for
method of recruitment, there was no 50:50 quota for the direct
recruits and the promotees, which quota came to be
introduced only by way of an amendment effected to the

- 82 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
Arunachal Pradesh Forest Rules vide Notification No.
FOR.391/E-A/90/32343 dated 24-9-1999 and as such even
if the respondents herein were given more than 50% posts in
the cadre of ACF, it was permissible and as such the
promotions made of the appellants herein for the first time in
the year 2001 could not be dated back by giving retrospective
effect from the year 1994.

4. In order to understand the controversy some facts would
be necessary. All the present appellants herein started their
career in the post of Forest Rangers and after their training in
the Forest Rangers College, Kurseong, they were appointed
as Forest Rangers with effect from 7-7-1984. The post of
Forest Rangers is the feeder post for the post of ACF. There
are service rules for governing the service conditions called
the Arunachal Pradesh Forest Service Rules. These Rules
provide, inter alia, that a Forest Ranger would have to put in
five years of service before being promoted to the post of ACF.
In that way the appellants herein had become entitled for
being considered for promotion by 1989. They were, however,
not promoted in the year 1989 and were in fact promoted on
10-6-2002. However, in the meantime the respondents herein
were selected after the competitive examination and were
appointed in the year 1996. Naturally, the respondents herein
were senior to the appellants in the cadre of ACF. The
Government on account of the representations made
constituted another Departmental Promotion Committee
(hereinafter referred to as "DPC", for short) and the present
appellants were awarded the notional promotion with
retrospective effect i.e. from December 1994. This Order was
passed on 20-5-2004. Because of this Order all the
appellants would become senior to all the directly appointed
respondents and for this precise reason the said Order came
to be challenged before the Gauhati High Court which
challenge was accepted by the learned Single Judge and the
judgment of the learned Single Judge was confirmed by the
Division Bench which has necessitated the present appellants
to come before us.

- 83 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

13. Reverting back to the effect of the proviso, we do not find
anywhere any such intention to apply the proviso with
retrospective effect. In order to make a provision
applicable with retrospective effect, it has to be
specifically expressed in the provision. We do not find
such an expression in the said proviso. Nothing had
stopped the Government before amending the Rule to
word it specifically, making it retrospective. That was
not done and we are not prepared to hold that the Rule
is retrospective. Secondly, we cannot countenance the
argument that the Rule has a clarificatory nature. The Rule,
for the first time, creates a quota and thus crystallises the
rights of the direct appointees and the promotees which was
not there earlier. It, therefore, cannot be viewed as a
clarificatory amendment. Again whether the amendment is
clarificatory or not would depend upon the language of the
provision as also the other Rules. We have examined the
Rules which did not suggest that there was any quota
existing as such. On the other hand we see Rule 25 which is
a Rule regarding seniority and more particularly Rule 25(c). It
is apparent from the language of the Rule that the
Government thought otherwise. Rule 25(c) is as under:

"25. (c) The relative seniority of direct recruits and of
promotees shall be determined according to the rotation of
vacancies between direct recruits and promotees which shall
be based on the quotas of vacancies reserved for direct
recruitment and promotion under Rule 5."

This language suggests that the only quota that was
contemplated was as per Rule 5 which we have already
explained in the earlier part of the judgment which suggests
the 50% quota only in the "substantive vacancies which
occurred from time to time" and not the whole vacancies in
the cadre. We are, therefore, unable to accept the argument of
the learned counsel for the appellants.

14. Therefore, one thing is certain that the appellants did not
have right to claim a retrospective seniority, particularly over

- 84 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
and above the respondents who had been working in the post
of ACF right from July 1996.

15. This Court in a reported judgment in
State of
Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar Sharma
[(2007) 1 SCC 683 :

(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 594] has clearly held that the seniority is
to be reckoned not from the day when the vacancy arose but
from the date on which the appointment is made to the post.

There this Court was interpreting Rules 17 and 21 of the U.P.
Agriculture Group B Service Rules, 1995 and Rule 8 of the
U.P. Government Servants' Seniority Rules, 1991. This Court
disapproved the stance taken by the High Court that the
directions should have been given not from the date of
appointment but with retrospective effect when the vacancy
arose. The following observations in para 34 are speaking
and would close the issue: (SCC pp. 691-92)
"34. Another issue that deserves consideration is whether the
year in which the vacancy accrues can have any relevance
for the purpose of determining the seniority irrespective of the
fact when the persons are recruited. Here the respondent's
contention is that since the vacancy arose in 1995-1996 he
should be given promotion and seniority from that year and
not from 1999, when his actual appointment letter was
issued by the appellant. This cannot be allowed as no
retrospective effect can be given to the order of appointment
order under the Rules nor is such contention reasonable to
normal parlance. This was the view taken by this Court
in
Jagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of Orissa
[(1998) 4 SCC 456 :

1998 SCC (L&S) 1156] ."

16. Lastly, the High Court has specifically rejected the claim
of the appellants on another ground, namely, that the
appellants were not borne in the cadre of ACF on the date
from which they have been given the seniority. We are in
complete agreement with the High Court, particularly in view
of the decision of this Court in
State of Bihar v. Akhouri
Sachindra Nath
[1991 Supp (1) SCC 334 : 1991 SCC (L&S)
1070 : (1991) 16 ATC 936] which decision was reiterated
in
State of Bihar v. Bateshwar Sharma
[(1997) 4 SCC 424 :

- 85 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
1997 SCC (L&S) 975] . We do not want to burden this
judgment with further reported decisions. However, the same
view has been taken in another reported decision of this
Court in
Uttaranchal Forest Rangers' Assn. (Direct
Recruit) v. State of U.P.
[(2006) 10 SCC 346 : (2007) 1 SCC
(L&S) 116 : JT (2006) 12 SC 513] where in para 18 this Court
has taken a view that no retrospective promotion or
seniority can be granted from a date when an employee
has not even been borne in the cadre so as to be
adversely affecting those who were appointed validly in
the meantime.

17. There is still one another reason for our concurring with
the High Court's judgments. There cannot be any dispute that
all through right from 1996 when the respondents were
appointed till 2002, the appellants were working under them
in capacity of the Range Forest Officers; the appellants came
in those posts and started exercising the powers and duties
of the post of ACF only from 2002. It would be, therefore,
very unfair to allow the appellants to steal a march
over the direct appointees under whom they worked
practically for eight years. On this ground we concur with
the High Court that at this point of time there would be no
justification in upsetting the whole balance.

[Emphasis supplied]

140.
In the case of
Sk. Abdul Rashid & Ors. Vs. State of

Jammu & Kashmir
[(2008) 1 SCC 722], the Hon‟ble Apex

Court taking note of catena of judgments passed by Hon‟ble

Apex Court held that retrospective promotion in this case

having effect of conferring higher seniority on private

respondents vis-à-vis appellants, such retrospective

promotion was against the statutory rules, therefore, set

aside the impugned judgment.

- 86 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023

141. For ready reference, the relevant paragraphs of the

judgment is quoted as under:

16.
In
State of Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath
[1991 Supp
(1) SCC 334 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 1070 : (1991) 16 ATC 936] this
Court held : (SCC p. 342, para 12)
"12. ... It is well settled that no person can be promoted
with retrospective effect from a date when he was not
born in the cadre so as to adversely affect others. It is
well settled by several decisions of this Court that amongst
members of the same grade seniority is reckoned from the
date of their initial entry into the service.

17.
In
Kaushal Kishore Singh v. Dy. Director of
Education
[(2002) 9 SCC 634 : 2002 SCC (L&S) 1090] this Court
stated the law, thus : (SCC p. 635, para 5)
"5. The claim of seniority of the employee is always
determined in any particular grade or cadre and it is not the
law that seniority in one grade or cadre would be dependent
on the seniority in another grade or cadre."

18.
In
State of Uttaranchal v. Dinesh Kumar
Sharma
[(2007) 1 SCC 683 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 594] it was
opined : (SCC pp. 691-92, para 34)
"34. Another issue that deserves consideration is whether
the year in which the vacancy accrues can have any
relevance for the purpose of determining the seniority
irrespective of the fact when the persons are recruited. Here
the respondent's contention is that since the vacancy arose
in 1995-1996 he should be given promotion and seniority
from that year and not from 1999, when his actual
appointment letter was issued by the appellant. This cannot
be allowed as no retrospective effect can be given to the
appointment order under the Rules nor is such contention
reasonable to normal parlance.

This was the view taken by
this Court in
Jagdish Ch. Patnaik v. State of Orissa
[(1998) 4
SCC 456 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1156] ."

19. Similarly, although the statute provides for grant of
officiating promotion, but the same is not conducive in the sense

- 87 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
that even after getting officiating promotion, one may be reverted
to the original post held by him. We do not mean to say that the
seniority would be reckoned from the date of confirmation but we
only intend to point out that the Rules having been provided for
officiating promotion, the learned Single Judge was correct in
taking that factor also into consideration for the purpose of
determining the validity of the impugned order before the High
Court. The said order dated 3-12-1985 even otherwise appears
to be mala fide having been passed for unauthorised purpose. If
the said order dated 3-12-1985 is read with the earlier one being
dated 1-8-1985, the intention of the Government to favour the
private respondents herein becomes explicit. It is not expected of
a Government to brazenly favour one set of employees so as to
defeat the bona fide claim of the other set of employees. We,
therefore, are of the opinion, that the impugned judgment cannot
be sustained which is set aside accordingly. The appeals are
allowed.

142. It is, thus, evident by going through the aforesaid

judgment that retrospective promotion is permissible but if

the same is causing adverse impact upon the others, the

same is not permissible and further the retrospective

promotion cannot be granted from the date when the

concerned employee has not taken birth in the cadre.

143. Adverting to the factual aspect of the present case, it is

admitted case of the private respondents that they have been

promoted vide issuance of notification dated 28.12.2016 with

retrospective effect from 01.04.2015 but in the meanwhile,

the writ petitioners-appellants have been appointed through

direct mode in pursuance to the advertisement floated under

the Rules, 2012. They have been inducted in the cadre

- 88 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
through direct mode of recruitment w.e.f. December, 2015

and January, 2016 but by granting retrospective promotion

w.e.f. 01.04.2015, the private respondents have been made

senior to that of direct recruits; meaning thereby they have

been inducted in service the day when the private

respondents did not born in the cadre.

144. Therefore, the law
laid down by
Hon‟ble Apex Court in

the judgment rendered hereinabove in the case of
Ganga

Vishan Gujarati & Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.

(supra); Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers'

Assn. v. State of Maharashtra [Direct Recruit Class II

Engg. Officers' Assn. v. State of Maharashtra (supra);

Nani Sha & Ors. Vs. State of Arunachal Pradesh &

Ors.
(supra) and Sk. Abdul Rashid & Ors. Vs. State of

Jammu & Kashmir (supra), the retrospective promotion

granted in favour of the private respondents vide order dated

28.12.2016 w.e.f. 01.04.2015 causing adverse impact upon

the direct recruits cannot be said to be justified and requires

interference by this Court.

145. The writ petitioners have also challenged the policy

decision as contained in Memo No. 619 (Vidhi) dated

26.08.2021 issued by Joint Secretary to the Government,

School Education and Literacy Department, Govt. of

Jharkhand, whereby a decision has been taken for giving

- 89 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
promotion to the teachers, who are working in Grade-3, 4

and 7, on notional basis and further decision has been taken

to grant promotion with retrospective effect from the date of

availability of vacancy.

146. The said policy decision has been taken by the State on

the strength of direction passed by learned writ Court in

W.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017 [Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of

Jharkhand & Ors
] disposed of vide order dated 26.09.2018,

wherein prayer has been made for direction upon the

respondents-State to pay them monetary benefits upon grant

of Grade-I from the date of appointment and further grade-II,

as per the decision of the Hon'ble Court, passed in

W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 (Arun Sinha & ors. vs. the State of

Jharkhand & ors.). The learned Single Judge after hearing

the parties directed the State to take a uniform decision for

extending the actual benefits of promotion to the petitioners.

147. For ready reference, the relevant portion of order passed

in
Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of Jharkhand & Ors

(supra) is quoted as under:

"The petitioners have approached this Hon'ble
Court with a prayer for direction upon the respondents
to pay them monetary benefits upon grant of Grade-I
from the date of appointment and further grade-II, as
per the decision of the Hon'ble Court, passed in
W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 (Arun Sinha & ors. vs. the State
of Jharkhand & ors.) which has been affirmed in
L.P.A.No.214 of 2008 and analogous cases and also up to

- 90 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in compliance of said
judgment, the circular of the Govt. 2 vide memo No.3027
dated 14.12.2015 issued by the Directorate of School
Education & Literacy, Govt. of Jharkhand, as the promotion
in Grade II has already been granted vide Memo No.1683
dated 15.05.2017.

2. The factual exposition as has been delineated in the writ
petition is that the petitioners are working as Assistant
Teachers in the district of Bokaro and they have joined their
respective posts on the different dates in 1994 & 1999 but
they have been denied the monetary benefits and even the
notional benefits, though they were entitled for the same in
view of resolution of the State Govt. dated 14.12.2015. The
issue regarding grant of monetary benefits to the
trained/untrained teachers fell for consideration before this
Hon'ble Court in W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 and this Hon'ble
Court vide its order dated 04.04.2008 had observed that in
view of earlier decisions of this Hon'ble Court in other cases
particularly, in W.P.(S)No.6264 of 2005 (
Jharkhand Police
Association Vs. State of Jharkhand
), the matric
trained/untrained teachers are also entitled for Grade-I scale
from the date of their initial appointment. The order passed
in W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 was affirmed by the Hon'ble
Division Bench of this Court in LPA No.214 of 2008 and the
same was also affirmed upto the Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP
No.5520- 5522 of 2013. In view of the fact that the order
passed in W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 was affirmed upto the
Hon'ble Apex Court, the State of Jharkhand came-out with a
resolution dated 14.12.2015, issued under the pen and
signature of the Secretary, School Education & Literacy
Department, Govt. of Jharkhand granting therein the matric
trained scale to the teachers from date of their initial
appointment in case of their promotion to Grade-I and II.
Though the issue is set at rest and it is no more res-integra,
the same was not implemented by the State Govt. in true
letter and spirit. Though the petitioners were granted Grade-I
and II from the date of their initial appointment but they were

- 91 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
denied the monetary benefits, which is dehors the rules.
Aggrieved by the same, the petitioners represented before
the respondent No.4 but no orders have been passed till date
and as such, petitioners have been constrained to knock the
door of this Hon'ble Court.

3. Mr. Amit Kumar Tiwari, learned Counsel appearing for
the petitioners strenuously urges that issue involved in this
case is no more resintegra and the same is set at rest by the
Hon'ble Apex Court. In view of the decision of the Hon'ble
Apex Court, the State has also come out with a resolution
dated 14.12.2015 but the same has not been implemented in
true letter and spirit and as such, a direction be given to the
respondents, particularly, respondent No.3 to implement its
own resolution dated 14.12.2015, in view of which
petitioners are entitled for notional benefits 3 from the date of
their initial appointment and monetary benefits from
15.11.2000 as they have already been placed in Grade-I
scale from the date of appointment.

4. Though no counter-affidavit has been filed. However, Mr.
Sumir Prasad, S.C. I very fairly submits that the State is fully
aware that issue is no more res-integra and the matter has
been set at rest by the Hon'ble Apex Court and in view of
that, State has come-out with a resolution for granting
monetary benefits/notional benefits to the matric trained
teachers from the date of their initial appointment but
because of some unavoidable reasons, the same could not be
implemented and several representations are pending before
the respondents and as such, a decision is going to be taken
in this regard taking into consideration the direction of the
Hon'ble Apex Court as well as their own resolution dated
14.12.2015.

5.Be that as it may, having gone through the submissions of
the parties and after perusing the relevant records, this
Court is of the view that issue regarding giving benefits of
Grade-I pay scale fell for consideration before this Hon'ble
Court and the Hon'ble Court had observed that teachers are

- 92 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
entitled for benefits from the date of their initial appointment
and the same was affirmed upto the Hon'ble Apex Court and
hence, the issue is no more res-integra. The State Govt. has
also come-out with a resolution No.3027 dated 14.12.2015
for implementing the same regarding grant of benefits from
the date of initial appointment but unfortunately, the same is
not implemented so far. The teachers are suffering as they
are not getting their benefits though the issue has been set at
rest by the Hon'ble Apex Court. Thereafter, several writ
petitions have been filed for the same relief and several
orders have been passed by the Hon'ble Court for granting
the benefits of Grade-I from the date of initial appointment.

A very fair submission has been made by the learned
Counsel that if the petitioners are not entitled for monetary
benefits from the date of their initial appointment, they are at
least entitled for notional benefits from the date of their initial
appointment and monetary benefits from 15.11.2000, as
contained in para-15(iv) of the resolution dated 14.12.2015
and also in view of settled principles of law. This submission
of learned Counsel is appreciated by this Court.

As such, respondent No.4 is directed to take a
uniform decision in case of teachers for granting the
benefits of Grade-I Scale keeping into account the
decision of this Hon'ble Court in case of "
Arun Sinha &
Ors. vs. the State of Jharkhand & Ors.
, passed in
W.P.(S)No.638 of 2006 which was affirmed upto the
Hon'ble Apex Court and in view of the fact 4 that State has
already come-out with a resolution No.3027 dated
14.12.2015. Needless to say that if the petitioners are
granted promotion and thus entitled for monetary benefits
also and accordingly are entitled for the benefits as prayed
for, in view of decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court and in view
of resolution dated 14.12.2015.

6. It was brought to the notice of the Court that in view
of several orders passed by this Court taking into
consideration the orders passed by the Division Bench

- 93 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
as well as Supreme Court, the State of Jharkhand has
given actual monetary benefits to Assistant Teachers
of all the districts of the State of Jharkhand save and
except Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Dumka and Chaibasa. The
instant case relates to Bokaro. Earlier also the order was
passed by this Court in W.P.(S)No.2128/2018 relating to
Jamshedpur i.e. East Singhbhum.

7. It appears that respondents have adopted method of
pick and choose. The Assistant Teachers of
Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Dumka and Chaibasa have been
discriminated whereas the ratio of the Supreme Court
applies in each and every case. If the teachers have been
considered for granting promotion and have been granted,
they are very much entitled for the monetary benefits also as
per the settled proposition of law as it has been held in the
case of "
Dr. Paras Nath Singh Vs. State of Bihar
, reported in
1990(2) PLJR 248;
Md. Hafiz vs. State of Bihar
, reported in
2003 (2) PLJR 44;
Suryadeo Prasad vs. the State of
Jharkhand
, reported in 2010 (3) JCR 238 and in case of
W.P.(S) No.1932 of 2005 (
Rajeshwar Prasad Vs. the State of
Jharkhand
) wherein this Court has held that promotion
should be granted with all consequential benefits from the
date it fallen due and as such, the respondents cannot be
allowed to proceed against the orders passed by the Hon'ble
Courts. Time and again it has been held that seniority will be
counted from the date of initial appointment. The Assistant
Teachers are entitled for monetary benefits from the date of
promotion though a decision has been taken by the
respondent-State that Assistant Teachers are not entitled for
monetary benefits prior to the State of Jharkhand came into
existence but admittedly they are entitled for monetary
benefits from the date the State of Jharkhand came into
existence or from the date a decision to that effect was taken
by the State i.e. 05.07.2002. Surprisingly the benefits
have been extended to all the teachers except the
teachers of Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Dumka and
Chaibasa. The stand of the respondent is

- 94 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
discriminatory and in complete violation of
Article 14
,
I hereby direct the respondents, particularly,
respondent No.1 to take a uniform decision for
extending the actual benefits of promotion to the 5
petitioners within a period of 12 weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order.

Let a copy of this order be circulated to the
departmental heads of all the districts of Jharkhand.

The Secretary of the Education Department is directed
to circulate the order to all concerned authorities, who are
responsible for making payment. The entire exercise of such
circulation of order shall be completed within a period of 4
weeks. 8. Accordingly, the writ petition stands disposed of."

148. It is evident from
the said judgment
that neither there

was prayer for grant of Grade IV promotion with retrospective

promotion nor there was consideration of Rules, 2012 though

the decision has been taken by the State much after framing

of Rules, 2012 and appointment of direct recruits in the year

December, 2015. The State in the said policy decision as

contained in order dated 26.08.2021 also did not taken care

of inter se seniority of direct recruits on the post of Trained

Graduate Teachers in Grade IV vis-à-vis promotes from Grade

I onwards.

149. Therefore, since in
the said judgment
there is no issue

of granting Grade IV promotion taking into consideration inter

se seniority between „direct recruits appointed as per Rule

2012‟ and promotes appointed as per Rules, 1991, as in the

instant case, but the State based upon the finding so given in

- 95 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
W.P.(S) No. 7392 of 2017 [Nand Kishor Nayak Vs. State of

Jharkhand & Ors], the impugned order/decision of the state

as contained in Memo No. 619 dated 26.08.2021 cannot be

said to be justified.

150. Though, generally policy decision is not to be interfered

with by the High Court in exercise of power of judicial review

but it is also settled that that if the policy decision suffers

from error or irrational then it is to be interfered with.

151. This Court, in order to examine the aforesaid

argument/ground, first deems it fit and proper to refer the

position of law regarding the power of judicial review to be

exercised in the matter of policy decision taken by the State.

152. This Court is aware of the settled law that the policy

decision of the State are not to be disturbed unless they are

found to be grossly arbitrary or irrational.
In this context,

reference may be made to the judgment rendered by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in
Federation of Railway Officers

Association and Ors. vs. Union of India
, (2003) 4 SCC

289 wherein at paragraph-12, it has been held as follows:

"12. In examining a question of this nature where a policy is
evolved by the Government judicial review thereof is limited.
When policy according to which or the purpose for which
discretion is to be exercised is clearly expressed in the
statute, it cannot be said to be an unrestricted discretion. On
matters affecting policy and requiring technical expertise the
court would leave the matter for decision of those who are
qualified to address the issues. Unless the policy or action is

- 96 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws or arbitrary
or irrational or abuse of power, the court will not interfere with
such matters."

153. Reference may also be made to the judgment rendered

in
Directorate of Film Festivals and Ors. vs. Gaurav

Ashwin Jain and Ors.
, (2007) 4 SCC 737, wherein the

Hon'ble Apex Court has been pleased to hold as under

paragraph-16 which reads as under:

"16. The scope of judicial review of governmental policy is
now well defined. Courts do not and cannot act as Appellate
Authorities examining the correctness, suitability and
appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to the
executive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled
to formulate. The scope of judicial review when examining a
policy of the Government is to check whether it violates the
fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the
provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory
provision or manifestly arbitrary. Courts cannot interfere
with policy either on the ground that it is erroneous or on the
ground that a better, fairer or wiser alternative is available.
Legality of the policy, and not the wisdom or soundness of
the policy, is the subject of judicial review."

154. Further, in
Ugar Sugar Works Ltd. Vs. Delhi

Administration and Ors.
, (2001) 3 SCC 635, the Hon'ble

Apex Court has been pleased to hold that "The challenge,

thus, in effect, is to the executive policy regulating trade in

liquor in Delhi. It is well settled that the courts, in exercise of

their power of judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with

the policy decisions of the executive unless the policy can be

faulted on grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness,

- 97 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
arbitrariness or unfairness etc. Indeed, arbitrariness,

irrationality, perversity and mala fide will render the policy

unconstitutional. However, if the policy 11 L.P.A. No. 86 of

2018 cannot be faulted on any of these grounds, the mere fact

that it would hurt business interests of a party, does not justify

invalidating the policy. In tax and economic regulation cases,

there are good reasons for judicial restraint".

155.
In
Parisons Agrotech Private Limited and Anr. Vs.

Union of India and Ors.
, (2015) 9 SCC 657, the Hon'ble

Apex Court has observed as under paragraph-14 which reads

as under:

"14. No doubt, the writ court has adequate power of judicial
review in respect of such decisions. However, once it is found
that there is sufficient material for taking a particular policy
decision, bringing it within the four corners of
Article 14
of the
Constitution, power of judicial review would not extend to
determine the correctness of such a policy decision or to indulge
into the exercise of finding out whether there could be more
appropriate or better alternatives. Once we find that parameters
of
Article 14
are satisfied; there was due application of mind in
arriving at the decision which is backed by cogent material; the
decision is not arbitrary or irrational and; it is taken in public
interest, the Court has to respect such a decision of the executive
as the policy making is the domain of the executive and the
decision in question has passed the test of the judicial review."

156.
In
Jacob Puliyel vs Union of India and Others
SCC OnLine SC 533 wherein at paragraphs-21 & 23, it has

been observed which reads as under:

"21. ... It is well settled that the Courts, in exercise of their power
of judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with the policy

- 98 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
decisions of the executive unless the policy can be faulted
on grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or
unfairness etc. Indeed, arbitrariness, irrationality,
perversity and mala fide will render the policy
unconstitutional. It is neither within the domain of the courts
nor the scope of judicial review to embark upon an enquiry
as to whether a particular public policy is wise or whether
better public policy can be evolved. Nor are the courts
inclined to strike down a policy at the behest of a petitioner
merely because it has been urged that a different policy
would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or more
logical. Courts do not and cannot act as appellate
authorities examining the correctness, suitability and
appropriateness of a policy, nor are courts advisors to the
executive on matters of policy which the executive is entitled
to formulate. The scope of judicial review when examining a
policy of the Government is to check whether it violates the
fundamental rights of the citizens or is opposed to the
provisions of the Constitution, or opposed to any statutory
provision or manifestly arbitrary. 23. There is no doubt that
this Court has held in more than one judgment that where
the decision of the authority is in regard to a policy matter,
this Court will not ordinarily interfere since decisions on
policy matters are taken based on expert knowledge of the
persons concerned and courts are normally not equipped to
question the correctness of a policy decision. However, this
does not mean that courts have to abdicate their right to
scrutinize whether the policy in question is formulated
keeping in mind all the relevant facts and the said policy
can be held to be beyond the pale of discrimination or
unreasonableness, bearing in mind the material on record.

In
Delhi Development Authority
(supra), this Court held that
an executive order termed as a policy decision is not beyond
the pale of judicial review. Whereas the superior courts may
not interfere with the nitty-gritty of the policy, or substitute
one by the other but it will not be correct to contend that the

- 99 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
court shall lay its judicial hands off, when a plea is raised
that the impugned decision is a policy decision. Interference
therewith on the part of the superior court would not be
without jurisdiction as it is subject to judicial review. It was
further held therein that the policy decision is subject to
judicial review on the following grounds:

a) if it is unconstitutional;

b) if it is dehors the provisions of the Act and the
regulations; c) if the delegatee has acted beyond its power
of delegation;

d) if the executive policy is contrary to the statutory or a
larger policy.

157. Further, in
Union of India and Others vs. Bharat

Forge Ltd. and Another
, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1018, the

Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraph-20 has observed as under:

"20. This Court also laid down paragraph 46 as follows:

"46.
In
Census Commr. v. R. Krishnamurthy [Census
Commr.
v. R. Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796 ], a three-
Judge Bench of this Court, after noting several decisions,
held that (SCC p. 809, para 33) it is not within the domain
of the courts to embark upon an enquiry as to whether a
particular public policy is wise and acceptable or whether a
better policy could be evolved and the courts can only
interfere if the policy framed is absolutely capricious or not
informed by reasons or totally arbitrary and founded on
ipse dixit offending the basic requirement of
Article 14
of
the Constitution. It further observed that in certain matters,
as often said, there can be opinions but the court is not
expected to sit as an appellate authority on an opinion."

158. Thus, it is evident that the interference by way of

exercise of power under judicial review is only to the extent if

- 100 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
it has been found that the action of the State is arbitrary and

suffers from the vice or malice.

159. It is evident from the aforesaid judgment that the scope

of judicial review in the matter of showing interference with

the policy decision is in a case where the decision is arbitrary

and suffers from the vice of malice and is in the teeth of

Article 14
of the Constitution of India.

160. This Court in the light of the aforesaid proposition and

discussions made hereinabove, is of the view since in the

policy decision there was non-consideration of the inter se

seniority of direct recruits, who were appointed under Rules,

2012 in the year December, 2015 vis-à-vis private

respondents, who were appointed in the year 1993-94, rather

was only consideration of the teachers appointed in the year

1987, 1988, 1999-2000 in Matric Trained Scale, as would

appear from paragraph 1 of the policy decision dated

26.08.2021, the said policy decision cannot be said to be just

and proper causing adverse impact upon the direct recruits.

161. This Court has failed to understand that though the

said policy decision was taken in the year 2021 and the

recruitment rule was made in the year 2012, based upon

which appointment was made in December, 2015 on the post

of Trained Graduate Teacher in Grade IV which the State did

not take care regarding policy decision for fixing the inter-se

- 101 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
seniority between the private respondents [promotes] and the

writ petitioners [direct recruits].

162. Therefore, this Court is of the view that while making

out a policy decision the authority ought to have taken into

consideration the fact the direct recruits have been inducted

in service on the basis of the Rules, 2012.

163. But, it is evident from the consideration so made in the

said policy decision that there is no consideration of the

direct recruits, who have been appointed in the year

December, 2015 and January, 2016, and have been inducted

in service in terms of Rules, 2012 and it appears that as if

said policy decision has been prepared on the basis of

conception that there is no rule for making entry through

direct recruitment by way of Rules, 2012.

164. The moment the State has come out with a rule in the

year 2012 to make direct recruitment under proviso to
Article
of the Constitution of India, then it is the bounden duty

of the State authority to make a balance in between the direct

recruits and the promotes.

165. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the said policy

decision for grant of retrospective promotion is contrary to

the law down by the Hon‟ble Apex Court on the pretext of the

fact that retrospective promotion granted in the context of the

present case causing impediment to the future prospect by

- 102 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
putting the promotes above the direct recruits even though

they did not take birth, the day when the direct recruits

entered into service, as such it cannot be said to be just and

proper and is not sustainable in the eye of law.

166. This Court, after having discussed the aforesaid fact and

coming to the order passed by the learned Single Judge,

wherefrom it is evident that the learned Single Judge has not

appreciated the factual aspect in right prospective by taking

into consideration the factual aspect of the judgment

rendered in the case of
Arun Sinha
(supra) or
Sunil Kumar

Bhagat
(supra) was passed by this Court.

167. The learned Single Judge has also not taken into

consideration the factual aspect and the propriety of the

policy decision, as has been discussed in the preceding

paragraphs.

168. The learned Single Judge has further not appreciated

that merely the date of entry the consideration has been given

for promotion with retrospective effect which is only on the

compassion since the learned Single Judge has used the

word that „merely because the appointment of teachers in the

year 2015 onwards, the case of those who were already in

service right from 1994 onwards cannot be allowed to suffer.‟

169. The law is well settled that the issue of seniority cannot

be adjudged on the basis of compassion rather it is based

- 103 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
upon the settled position of law, as per the discussion made

hereinabove.

170. This Court, in view of the entirety of facts and

discussions made hereinabove, is of the view that the order

passed by learned Single Judge requires interference.

171. Accordingly, the order dated 26.07.2023 passed by

learned Single Judge is hereby quashed and set aside.

172. Resultantly, impugned order dated 28.12.2016, whereby

the private respondents were granted promotion to Grade-IV

with retrospective effect from 01.04.2015 on notional basis, is

hereby quashed and set aside only to the effect that it would

not have retrospective effect causing adverse effect upon the

direct recruits [writ petitioners].

173. Since, in the policy decision dated 26.08.2021 there is

non-consideration of the inter se seniority of direct recruits,

who were appointed under Rules, 2012 in the year December,

rather there is only consideration of the teachers appointed in

the year 1987, 1988, 1999-2000 in initial Matric Trained

Scale, as would appear from paragraph 1 of the policy

decision dated 26.08.2021, and further the State did not take

care in the said policy decision for fixing the inter-se seniority

between the private respondents [promotes] and the writ

petitioners [direct recruits], causing adverse effect upon the

direct recruits [writ petitioners], even after coming out of new

- 104 - L.P.A. No. 482 & 478 of 2023
recruitment Rules, 2012 and pursuant thereto appointment

made thereunder in the year December, 2015, therefore, the

policy decision dated 28.06.2021 is hereby quashed and set

aside.

174. Resultantly, the State is directed to prepare a fresh

policy decision taking into consideration the inter-se seniority

between the private respondents [promotes] and the writ

petitioners [direct recruits].

175. Accordingly, the State is directed to prepare and publish

fresh seniority list of teachers.

176. With the aforesaid observations and directions, both the

intra-court appeals stand disposed of.

177. Pending Interlocutory Application, if any, stands

disposed of.
