....for the State

1.
Heard the learned Counsels for the parties.

2. We have considered the materials on record.

Present case arose out of a matrimonial discord. Allegation of

torture is general and omnibus. Allegation of forgery relates to

transfer of the de facto complainant's property in favour of the

petitioner by an alleged forged deed. Forged deed is in the

control and custody of the investigating agency. Custodial

interrogation for progress of investigation is not necessary but

petitioner requires to co-operate with investigation in

accordance with law. Accordingly, we are inclined to grant

anticipatory bail to the petitioner but subject to condition.

3. Accordingly, we direct that in the event of arrest the

petitioner shall be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of

Rs.10,000/-, with two sureties of like amount each, to the

satisfaction of the arresting officer and also be subject to the

conditions as laid down under
Section 482(2)
of the Bharatiya

Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and on condition that he shall

appear before the jurisdictional court and pray for regular bail

within a period of four weeks from date and on further

condition that he shall meet the investigating officer once in a

week until further orders and shall provide his specimen

signature and hand-writing, if necessary.

4. The application for anticipatory bail is, thus, allowed.
