28.10.2015. Thereafter, by impugned order dated
19.11.2015 the orders of regularization of services of the
petitioners were cancelled.

21. The petitioner in Writ Petition No.1936/2016 the
petitioner was appointed on daily wage basis on 31.1.1987
in Fire Brigade Department. The services of the petitioner
were regularized vide order dated 28.1.2004. On
28.10.2015, information was sought from the petitioner
with regard to regularization of their services and he was
given 3 daysâ time to submit explanation. The petitioner
submitted his reply to letter dated 28.10.2015. Thereafter,
by impugned order dated 19.11.2015 the order of
regularization of services of the petitioner was cancelled.

22. Mrs.Shobha Menon, learned senior counsel for the
petitioners submitted that impugned orders directing de-
regularisation of services of petitioner have been passed in
contravention of the order dated 27.2.2003 passed in Writ
Petition No.3460/1994 as well as order dated 01.9.2005
passed in Writ Petition No.8359/2005. It is further
submitted that seniority list was required to be prepared
after inviting objections, which has not been done. It has
also been submitted that cyclostyled orders have been
passed which reflect non-application of mind. It is further
submitted that while passing impugned orders the material
on the basis of which original orders of regularization were
passed, has not been taken into account. It is also
contended that services of the petitioners, who are regular
employees of the respondent-Corporation, cannot be de-
regularized without holding an enquiry. It is urged that
petitioners, have put in more than 12 years of service as
regular employees and, therefore, the Corporation
committed manifest error in un-settling the settled things.
It is further submitted that reasons spelt out in the show-
cause notice do not find place in the impugned orders,
therefore, the same have been passed in violation of
principles of natural justice. While inviting the attention of
this Court to order dated 25.7.2012 passed in
W.P.no.10263/2012 it is submitted that, in fact, no seniority
list was prepared till 2012 and the action of respondents in
de-regularising the services of the petitioners is
contemptuous. It is also submitted that respondents ought
to have taken into account the principle of fair play while
considering the qualification/eligibility while deciding the
question of regularization of services of the petitioners. In
support of her submissions, learned senior counsel has
placed reliance on order dated 30.8.1997 passed in Writ
Petition No.2040/1997 [Prabhudayal Pandey vs. M.P.
State Agricultural Marketing Board and another].

23. Mr.D.K.Dixit, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that impugned order of de-regualrisation of
services of petitioner is arbitrary as the Supreme Court in
the case of State of Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi, (2006) 4
SCC 1 has held that the services of persons who have been
regularized, cannot be de-regularized.
It is further
submitted that in the case of
U.P. State Electricity Board
vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey and others
[Civil Appeal
No.3765/2001 decided on 09.10.2007] it has been held that
even if Uma Deviâs case is to be applied, the protection
contained in
Article 14
of the Constitution of India cannot
be overlooked and all the petitioners who have rendered
their services for past about 10 years are entitled to the
benefit of regularization.

24. Mr.Manoj Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that petitioner No.6 in W.P.No.20726/2015 was
never served with the show-cause notice, but straight away
the impugned order dated 19.11.2015 has been passed.
Thus, the petitioner No.6, in the aforesaid writ petition has
been condemned unheard. It is also submitted that show-
cause notice does not fulfil the requirement of show-cause
and no effective opportunity of hearing was afforded to
petitioner as only 3 daysâ time is given by respondent to
the petitioner to show cause. It is further submitted that
action of de-regularisation of services of the petitioners is
vitiated on account of non-preparation of seniority list. It is
also urged that it is nobodyâs case that petitioners are
not entitled for regularization. The only issue which
requires to be adjudicated is, whether they have been
regularized in the order of seniority against the posts
which befit their qualification. It is also submitted that
issue with regard to non-availability of posts, especially
that of not following the reservation and roster, cannot be
made a ground after a decade, as long experience has been
acquired by the petitioners on the post on which they are
regularized and the same takes care of qualification.
In this
connection reference has been made to the decision in the
case of
Bhagwati Prasad vs. Delhi Mineral
Development Corporation
, (1990) 1 SCC 361. Lastly, it is
urged that the impugned orders have the effect of
unsettling the settled things after a decade by taking
recourse to casual process.

25. Mr.Shashank Shekhar, learned counsel for the
petitioner has submitted that action of respondent
demonstrates pre-determination and prejudice inasmuch as
impugned orders have been passed in utter contravention
of the settled proposition of service jurisprudence. It is
further submitted that administrative decisions are
expected to be taken reasonably and within reasonable
time. In the instant case, the impugned decision has been
taken after a period of 12 years.

25. Mr.Vipin Yadav, learned counsel for the petitioners
submitted that letter dated 28.10.2015 purported to be
show-cause notice cannot be termed as âshow-cause
noticeâ as it requires the grounds to be stated, according
to which the action is necessitated, particularly the
penalty/action which is proposed to be taken.
In support of
aforesaid submission he has placed reliance on the decision
in the case of
Gorkha Security Services vs. Government
(NCT of Delhi) and others
, (2014) 9 SCC 105.
While
referring to paragraph 44 of the decision in the case of
Uma Devi (supra) it is contended that if regularization is
already made and is not subjudice, the same need not be
re-opened. Therefore, the impugned orders of de-
regularisation are contrary to the decision in the case of
Uma Deviâs case. It is further submitted that since the
order of regularization has been cancelled after 11 years,
therefore, the same is bad in law.
In support of aforesaid
submission reliance has been placed on the decision in the
cases of
Buddhi Nath Chaudhary and others vs. Abahi
Kumar and others
, (2001) 3 SCC 328, Rajendra v. State
of Maharashtra,
AIR 2008 SCW 2877 and Radha Mohan
Goswami vs. State of M.P.
, (2004) 2 MPHT 49.

26. Mr.Ashish Agrawal, learned counsel for the petitioner
in Writ Petition No.1936/2016 and Mr.Deepak Singh,
learned counsel for petitioner in Writ Petition No.61/2016
have adopted the submissions made by learned counsel for
the petitioners in other writ petitions.

27. On the other hand, Mr.Anshuman Singh, learned
counsel while opposing the submissions made on behalf of
learned counsel for the petitioners, has submitted that
impugned orders have been passed in compliance with
principles of natural justice. It is further submitted that it is
well settled in law that principles of natural justice cannot
be put in straight jacket formula and non-observance does
not automatically result in setting aside any administrative
action. It is also submitted that party alleging violation of
principles of natural justice has to show prejudice and has
to demonstrate how the action could have been different if
opportunity would have been granted.
In support of
aforesaid submission reference has been made to decision
of Supreme Court in the cases of
Managing Director,
ECIL v. B. Karunakar
, (
1993) 4 SCC 727 and Dharampal
Satyapal Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Central
Excise
, (2015) 8 SCC 519. It is contended that none of the
petitioners have been able to demonstrate as to whether
the post were, in fact, vacant or juniors to them have been
regularized or they fulfil the qualification or that
reservation roster was followed. It is urged that none of the
petitioners have been able to demonstrate prejudice,
therefore, the submission with regard to non-compliance of
principles of natural justice deserves to be rejected. It is
argued by him that contention of petitioners that since
seniority lists have not been prepared, therefore, the
orders with regard to de-regularisation cannot be passed,
also does not deserve acceptance as the respondents have
prepared separate gradation lists for four categories,
namely, daily wagers of technical post engaged prior to
31.12.1988; daily wagers of technical post engaged
subsequent to 01.1.1989; daily wager of non-technical post
engaged prior to 31.12.1988 and daily wager of non-
technical post engaged subsequent to 01.1.1989. It is also
argued that aforesaid gradation lists were prepared as on
01.1.2009. It is submitted that since petitioners were
continuing in regular establishment, therefore, their names
were not mentioned in the aforesaid gradation lists and
they only contain the names of daily wage employees. It is
also urged that contention raised on behalf of petitioners
that even till 2012 the gradation list was not prepared
deserves to be rejected as gradation list was prepared in
the year 2009 itself. It was further argued that respondent-
Corporation was not represented at the time when the
order dated 25.7.2012 was passed, as the said fact could
not brought to the notice of the High Court. It is also
submitted that even non-existence of names of petitioners
in the gradation list is inconsequential as petitioners have
failed to demonstrate any prejudice to them.
It is urged that doctrine of severability applies in respect of
administrative orders as well and in case an order which
contains many reasons, and some reasons are severable
from another, the order can be justified on the basis of
sustainable reasons, notwithstanding that Court may not
agree with the unsustainable reasons.

In this connection,
reference is made to the decision of Supreme Court in the
cases of
P.D.Agrawal vs. State Bank of India
, (
2006) 8
SCC 776 and Krishnakali Tea Estate vs. Akhil
Bharatiya Chah Majdoor Sangh
, (2004) 8 SCC 200. It is
also contended that impugned order of de-regularisation
has been passed on the basis of non-fulfilment of
educational qualification, non-availability of vacant post
and non following of reservation roster and not following
the principle of seniority. The aforesaid grounds are
sufficient to justice the orders of de-regularisation.
It is
further submitted that regularization of services of the
petitioners falls in the category of illegal appointment as
per law
laid down in
the case of Uma Devi (supra) and,
therefore, the respondent is fully justified in de-
regularising the services of the petitioners.
It is also urged
that submission of petitioners that long existing position
cannot be unsettled runs contrary to recent decision of
Division Bench in the case of
Manukhlal Saraf vs. Arun
Kumar Tiwari and others
[W.P.No.198/1999]. It is also
argued that petitioner No.6 in W.P.No.20726/2015 has
been transferred to Municipal Corporation, Satna,
therefore, he has not received any notice or order.
However, aforesaid fact has not been mentioned in the writ
petition. Lastly, it is urged that impugned orders have been
passed on the basis of grounds which are mentioned in the
show-cause notice and in every case there are justifiable
reasons which makes the appointment illegal and which
has its foundation in the show-cause notice. Therefore, the
impugned orders of deregularisation of services of the
petitioners are justified and do not call for any interference
of this Court.

28. I have considered the respective submissions on both
sides. The Supreme Court in the case of
Swadeshi Cotton
Mills vs. Union of India
, AIR 1981 SC 818, while
recognizing the rule of fair play as a necessary concomitant
of principle of natural justice, has held that this rule of fair
play must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional
circumstances where compulsive necessity so demands.
The court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal
rule to the maximum extent possible, with situational
modifications.

In
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
, AIR
1978 SC 597 it was held that natural justice is a great
humanizing principle and the soul of natural justice is fair
play in action. It is further held that it is well established
that rules of natural justice are not rigid rules, they are
flexible and their application depends upon the setting and
background of statutory provisions, nature of right, which
may be affected, and the consequences which may entail.
Its application depends upon the facts and circumstances
of each case. The necessary facet of principles of natural
justice before the process of adjudication starts, is that the
authority concerned give to the affected a notice of the
case against him and action proposed to be taken against
him, so that he may adequately defend himself. A notice is
regarded as the minimum obligatory condition. It is the
sine qua non of fair hearing.
[See: East India Commercial
co. Vs. Collector of Customs, AIR 1962 SC 1893 and
Raymond Woollen Mills Ltd. vs. D.G.(Investigation
and Registration), (2008) 12 SCC 73]. It is equally well
settled principle that notice must be precise and
unambiguous. It should apprise the party determinatively
of the case he has to meet and should give adequate time.
In the absence of notice of any kind and reasonable
opportunity, the order passed becomes wholly vitiated.

[See:
Canara Bank vs. Debasis Das
, (
2003) 4 SCC 557
and Canara Bank vs. V.K.Awasthy
, (2005) 6 SCC 321].
The notice must be effective and must be adequate as
regards the details of the case, so that the noticee gets an
adequate opportunity to represent against the impugned
action. A notice in order to be valid has to fulfil following
two attributes viz. (i) it must be adequate and (ii) it should
fully mention all the grounds, on which, the action is
proposed to be taken against the noticee. The grounds
given in the notice, on which the action is proposed to be
taken, should be couched in clear, specific and
unambiguous terms and not in vague or general terms.

[See: Board of Technical Education, U.P. Vs.
Dhanwantare Kumar, AIR 1991 SC 271]. It is equally well
settled legal proposition that if notice mentions one ground
and the action is taken on some other ground or action is
taken on some additional ground, which is not mentioned
in notice, such notice suffers from vagueness and would
amount to violation of principles of natural justice.
[See:

J.Vilanagandan v. Executive Engineer
,
AIR 1978 SC and
Nasir Ahmed v. Assistant Custodian-General, Evacuee
Property
, AIR 1980 SC 1157]. A hearing to be fair must
fulfil several conditions: (i) The adjudicating authority
should receive all the relevant material which the
individual wishes to produce. (ii) It should disclose all
information, evidence or material which the authority
wishes to use against the individual concerned in arriving
at its decision. (iii) It should give to the individual
concerned an opportunity to rebut such information or
material. Reasonable time should be granted to submit
reply to the show-cause notice. [See: (2008) 13 SCC 689].
It is equally well settled legal proposition that grounds in
the show-cause notice must be ones which are relied on in
the impugned order. Otherwise, the action would be held
to be in violation of principles of natural justice.

[See:

Tarlochan Dev Sharma vs. State of Punjab and others
,
(
2001) 6 SCC 261 and CCE Vs. Sheetal International
,
(2011) 1 SCC 109]. The principles of natural justice are
grounded in procedural fairness which ensures taking of
correct decisions and procedural fairness is fundamentally
an instrumental good, in the sense that procedure should
be designed to ensure accurate and appropriate outcomes.

[See:
Dharampal Satyapal Ltd.
(supra)]

29. In the backdrop of aforesaid well settled legal position,
the facts of the cases may be taken note of. Admittedly, the
petitioners had filed writ petitions seeking their
regularization which were disposed of by order dated
27.2.2002 passed in Writ Petition No.1464/2001
[Ramadhar Kushwaha vs. State of M.P. and others]. The
relevant extract of the said order reads as under:-

â4. As the Corporation itself has decided to
regularize the services of employees who are
st
working prior to 31 December, 1988, by which
every employee will get his right according to
his seniority on availability of post and on
fulfilling the eligibility. In the circumstances,
contention of the learned counsel appearing for
the Corporation, that the Corporation is
regularizing the services of employees as per
policy decision which is in the uniform policy, is
accepted and in respect of those employees who
st
are working prior to 31 December,1988,
following directions are issued:-

(a) Respondent Corporation who has already
prepared the seniority list of daily rated
st
employees who are working prior to 31
December, 1988 will regularize the services of
daily rate employees strictly as per their
seniority and eligibility subject to availability of
post.

(b) The respondent-Corporation has prepared
aforesaid seniority list in two heads, technical
and non-technical, will be at liberty to fill up the
technical post on availability of technical post
from daily rated worker who possesses requisite
qualification. If the technical post is not
available and the employee comes in the
seniority criteria then respondent Corporation
will be at liberty to regularize that person even
on non-technical post, if such employee so
chooses or opts such regularization.

(c ) So far as non-technical persons are
concerned, all the daily rated workmen will get
their regularization as soon as the posts become
available as per his seniority and eligibility.

(d) This order will not affect those employees
who have already been regularized because of
the order passed by the High court or by Labour
Court and the aforesaid order has reached its
finality. But so far as the other employees are
concerned, their services will be regularized as
per the direction issued today including those
whose regularization are under challenge before
this Court.

(e) As the employees are to be regularized or
classified on particular post on the availability of
vacant post, as has been held in Full Bench
decision by this Court in
Superintending
Engineer Vs. State of M.P. and others
, [1999 (1)
MPJR 1], in the circumstances, if any litigation
in respect of employee who is working prior to
31-12-1988 or after 1-1-1989 respondent-
Corporation will place this order before the
Labour Court
in that case
and labour courts will
strictly follow the decision of Full Bench
Judgment and directions issued today in this
case.

(f) In respect of those cases in which any junior
person has been regularized ignoring seniority
of other daily rate employees and if presently
the order is under challenge before this Court,
the aforesaid order of regularization by the
labour court stand modified, as per this order.

(g) Those employees who are not satisfied with
their seniority in the seniority list will file fresh
representation before respondent Municipal
Corporation within a period of sixty days from
today and Municipal Corporation will decide the
seniority of those unsatisfied employees within a
period of ninety days thereafter.

(h) So far as the regularization of the employees
working prior to 31-12-1988 are concerned, the
respondent will consider the cases for
regularization as and when the posts are
available strictly according to their seniority.

5. In respect of employees who are engaged
after 1-1-1989 is concerned, following directions
are issued:-

(a) Respondent will prepare a fresh seniority list
of all those employees who are continuously
working in the Corporation and have achieved
the status of permanent workman. This shall be
done within 90 days from today.

(b) The aforesaid list will be duly published by
the Corporation and after considering objections
of the employees, the aforesaid seniority list will
be finalized.

(c ) The respondent Corporation on availability
of post, after exhausting the list of employees
working prior to 31-12-88 will regularize the
services of all those employees strictly in
accordance with their seniority and as per policy
Annexure-R-4.

(d) The policy Annexure R-4 will also be
applicable in respect of employees who are
working after 1.1.89 and have achieved a
permanent status as per provisions of standing
order.

(e) For regularizing the services of workmen
working after 1-1-1989, respondent-Corporation
will also observe the reservation as has been
mentioned in the Policy Annexure R-4 and in
case daily rated employees are available of
reserved quota then respondent will fill up the
aforesaid quota by regularizing the services of
those employees who belongs to reserved
category on priority basis and if any such post
remains vacant then they will follow the
provisions of reservation by the State of M.P.

With the aforesaid directions, the petitions are
finally disposed of.â

30. Thereafter, the services of the petitioners were de-
regularised by order dated 10.8.2005, which was assailed
in a bunch of writ petition, which was disposed of by order
dated 01.9.2005. The relevant extract of the order reads as
under:-

â In these writ petitions an order dated
10.8.2005 has been assailed, by which
regularization of the petitioners has been
cancelled without giving them an opportunity of
hearing. The services of the petitioners were
regularized after they have rendered the service
for consideration period. Order of regularization
was passed after petitioners have rendered the
services for long period, is not in dispute.

Opportunity of hearing has not been afforded, is
also not in dispute. The ground on which the
order of regularization has been cancelled
behind the back of the petitioners is that correct
gradation list was not prepared, as such some of
the incumbents may have been illegally
regularized by the Municipal Corporation,
Jabalpur.

After hearing learned counsel for the parties at
length, in my opinion, the Corporation is not
sure at this stage which of the incumbents have
been wrongly regularized. As the Corporation is
still preparing the gradation list, on the basis of
which it has to be determined by the
Corporation that which of the incumbents were
not entitled for regularization. May be that
seniority list which was earlier prepared was
incorrect, once regularization was made the
petitioners were required to be heard by the
Municipal Corporation before passing order of
deregularisation and in case their case was not
in the seniority of the employees which is the
correct seniority as per the Municipal
Corporation, only
in that case
the order of
regularization should have been cancelled only
in consonance of principle of natural justice
after hearing the petitioners.
Thus, the order dt.
10.8.2005 which has been passed without
hearing the petitioners, without apprising them
of the cause of de-regularisation cannot be
allowed to sustain, once the order of
regularization has been passed after serving for
considerable period, order derogatory to the
interest of civil rights of the employees could
not have been passed without hearing them as
per law
laid down by
the Apex Corut in

Ku.Neelima Mishra v. Harinder Kaur Paintal and
others
, AIR 1990 SC 1402. Thus, the order dt.
10.8.2005 is hereby set aside with liberty to the
Municipal Corporation to prepare the seniority
list, to hear the petitioners and thereafter pass
order of de-regularisation if warranted. There
were Contempt Petition No.70/04 filed, in which,
in accordance with the direction given in the
contempt petition, seniority list has to be
prepared afresh. However, that does not absolve
the Corporation from hearing the petitioners
and passing appropriate order in accordance
with law. Let the seniority list be prepared as
directed in the Contempt Petition.

Writ petitions are allowed to the extent
indicated above. Parties to bear their own
costs.â
(Emphasis supplied)

31. Thereafter, in a bunch of writ petitions, in which
challenge was made to the validity of the show-cause
notice dated 27.8.2011, was disposed of with the following
directions:-

âAs a result, without expressing any opinion
on the merits of the controversy, we dispose of
these petitions with direction to the
Commissioner to decide the matter after
considering the response given by the
petitioners expeditiously by giving due
opportunity to the writ petitioners, in any case,
not later than four weeks from today and
communicate the decision so taken to the
petitioners within the same time. If the decision
is adverse, the petitioners will be free to
challenge the same by say of appropriate
proceedings. That will be decided on its own
merits.

32. It is pertinent to note that Corporation itself had
framed a scheme for regularisation of services of the daily
wage employees and the orders of the regularisation of
services of the petitioners have been passed in the year
2003 i.e. prior t decision in Umadevi'v case (supra). A
comparative chart to indicate the grounds mentioned in the
show-cause notices and in the impugned orders in order to
ascertain whether there is compliance with the principles
of natural justice, is reproduced below:-

33. From perusal of the above chart, it is evident that
action against the petitioners have been taken in violation
of principles of natural justice for the following reasons:-

(a) From perusal of order dated 01.9.2005 passed in Writ
Petition No.8359/2005 it is axiomatic that respondent-

Corporation was granted liberty to prepare the seniority
list after affording an opportunity of hearing to the
petitioners and thereafter pass an orders of de-
regularisation, if warranted.

(b) From perusal of impugned orders it is evident that
respondent-Corporation has concluded that principle of
seniority has not been violated on the basis of seniority list
prepared in the year 2003, whereas in the return as well as
in the written synopsis produced before this Court, a stand
has been taken that seniority list has been prepared in the
year 2009. In the seniority list prepared in the year 2009,
the names of petitioners do not find place, as the orders of
regularization of services of petitioners were already
passed.

(c ) Thus, it is evident that a consolidated seniority list
including the names of petitioners in compliance of order
dated 01.9.2005 passed by this Court has not been
prepared. Therefore, in the absence of the same it is not
possible for the Corporation to conclude that the principle
of seniority has not been followed.

(d) The grounds mentioned in the show-cause notices in
most of the cases are different than the ones, on which, the
impugned orders have been passed, which is evident from
the chart reproduced above.

(e) In the impugned orders it has been recorded that
petitioners have failed to produce any document to show
their educational qualification, whereas by way of show-
cause notices the petitioners were never asked to submit
document with regard to their educational qualifications
alongwith the reply.

(f) The defence set up by the petitioners in their replies has
not been considered while passing the impugned orders;

(g) Since the case of the petitioners were considered with
reference to the gradation list prepared on 09.12.2003 and
not with reference to the gradation list prepared in the
year 2009, in which the names of the petitioners do not
appear, therefore, it is not possible to infer whether any
vacant posts were available in the year 2003.

(h) The petitioners were granted only three daysâ time to
submit their replies, which was inadequate in the fact
situation of the case.

Thus, from the facts narrated supra, it is evident that
orders of de-regularisation have been passed in violation of
principles of natural justice, which cannot be sustained in
the eye of law.

34. The contention raised by learned counsel for
respondent-Corporation that impugned orders have been
passed in compliance of principles of natural justice,
therefore, cannot be accepted in the fact situation of the
case. Similarly, the contention that petitioners have failed
to demonstrate any prejudice also cannot be accepted, as
the prejudice is writ large in the fact situation of the case,
as show-cause notices have been issued on one ground and
impugned orders have been passed on other grounds. The
petitioners have not been given sufficient time to respond
to the show-cause notice and the petitioners were not even
asked to submit documents alongwith the reply. However,
an adverse inference has been drawn on account of non-
submission of documents. The defence of the petitioners
has also not been considered while passing the impugned
orders. The respondent-Corporation was under an
obligation to prepare the seniority list containing the
names of the petitioners to ascertain whether or not the
principle of seniority has been violated. From perusal of
chart, it is evident that doctrine of severability does not
apply to the fact situation of the case.

36. In view of preceding analysis, the impugned orders of
de-regularisation of services of the petitioners dated
19.11.2015 are hereby quashed. The Corporation may take
action for de-regularisation of services of the petitioners, if
so advised, in the light of law
laid down by
the Supreme
Court in the case of Umadevi's (supra) particularly in the
light of observations made in paragraph 53 of the decision.
Needless to state, the respondent-Corporation shall first
prepare the seniority list containing the names of
petitioners as directed vide order dated 01.9.2005 passed
by a Bench of this Court in Writ Petition No.8359/2005,
after inviting objections, and thereafter may issue show-
cause notices to the petitioners containing precise grounds,
on which, action of de-regularisation of services of
petitioners is sought to be taken. The show-cause notices
shall clearly state the documents which the petitioners, in
the opinion of respondent, are required to produce in
support of their claim. Needless to state, the respondent-
Corporation shall pass speaking orders.

37. With the aforesaid directions, the writ petitions stand
disposed of.
