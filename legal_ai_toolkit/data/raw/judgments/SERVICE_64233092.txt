ORDER

Per Sudhir Kumar, Member (A):

The applicant filed this OA on 07.11.2015 with an application for

urgent listing, as she was aggrieved with the impugned orders passed by

the Respondent No.1 National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS, in

short), the sole Respondent at that time, which she had alleged to be

illegal, biased, discriminatory, whimsical, against the Recruitment Rules

(RRs, in short) and being in serious violation of
Articles 16
, 21

& 301
of

the Constitution. Apart from the main relief of the OA, she had also

prayed for Interim Relief. While issuing notice on 11.11.2014, a

Coordinate Bench had held that as regards the interim relief is

concerned, in their considered view it was not appropriate to issue any

direction as asked for at that stage, and the OA was admitted subject to

just exceptions. The applicant of this OA is aggrieved due to non-

consideration of her case for the post of Joint Secretary by Respondent

No.1.

2. One MA No.3794/2014 was filed praying for correction of a

typographical error in the order passed by the Coordinate Bench on

11.11.2014, which was allowed, and the necessary corrections were

ordered to be incorporated in the order passed on 11.11.2014. When the

pleadings were completed by filing of the written submissions of the

Official Respondent No. R-1, as well as rejoinder thereto, the case was

listed once again before the same Coordinate Bench from 07.05.2015

onwards. On the next date of hearing, the applicant's counsel wanted to
OA No.3963/2014

file a reply to the sur-rejoinder filed by the respondents in the

meanwhile, which was also allowed.

3. On 17.08.2015, learned counsel for the applicant had advanced his

arguments for some time, and, thereafter, it transpired and it was

conceded by him that the applicant ought to have made one Shri

Murlidharan Pillai as a party respondent No. R-2 in this case, since the

applicant has claimed seniority over him. Therefore, even at that late

stage, the prayer was allowed, and permission to amend the Memo of

Parties was granted, Dasti notices were ordered to be served upon the

said Shri Murlidharan Pillai, and time was granted to the newly named

private respondent No.R-2 to file his reply. Thereafter the applicant filed

another MA No.3026/2015 paying for three more private respondents

also to be impleaded as party respondents No. R-3 to R-5, and it was

submitted that an advance copy of the MA had already been served upon

all those four private respondents. Notices in that MA were issued to the

official respondents as well as the newly named private respondents,

proposed to be impleaded as Respondents No. R-2 to R-5.

4. On the next date of hearing, the said MA No.3026/2015 filed for

impleadment of total four individuals as private party respondents No. R-

2 to R-5 was allowed, and amended Memo of Parties was allowed to be

filed accordingly, and Dasti notices were ordered to be issued in the O.A.

In the meanwhile, an MA No.3254/2015 had been filed by those four

individuals also, praying for their impleadment as opposite party

respondents, and one of them Shri Akshay Joshi was even present in
OA No.3963/2014

person in the Court, and sought time to file counter reply. That MA No.

3254/2015 had also been thereafter allowed, and the applicant was

directed to serve a copy of the paper book of the O.A. on the newly

named private respondents No. R-2 to R-5. Counter reply was thereafter

filed on behalf of private respondents. Thereafter the case was heard in

great detail on 18.03.2016, but still the learned counsel for the official

respondents sought time for advancing his reply arguments, for which

time was allowed, keeping the case as part-heard. On the next date of

hearing the learned counsel for the Official respondents advanced his

arguments also, and the learned counsel for the applicant sought leave

and permission to file a written synopsis, which was also allowed. None

had appeared on behalf of the four private respondents, but the case was

heard and reserved for orders since all of them were aware of the

proceedings going on, and had themselves filed the M.A. No. 3254/2015,

seeking to be impleaded as party respondents, which M.A. had been

allowed

5. Counter reply had however been filed on behalf of private

respondent R-4, who had appeared in person, and the Private

Respondent No. R-5 had also once appeared in person. It was only that

the private Respondents No. R-2 to R-5 did not advance any oral

arguments, either by themselves, or through any Counsel, beyond the

Counter Reply filed by R-4.

6. The applicant had in May 1992 joined the Institute of Defence

Studies and Analysis (IDSA, in short), which is an Autonomous Body and
OA No.3963/2014

Research Organization, fully funded and controlled by the Govt. of India

to undertake research in defence and security aspects concerning the

nation, and it works in close liaison with R-1 NSCS. The senior serving

or retired officers of the Govt. of India usually head the IDSA, as was said

to have been the case with its previous as well as the present DG on the

date of filing of the OA. It was, therefore, claimed by the applicant that

IDSA comes within the definition of State under
Article 12
of the

Constitution of India, which aspect has not been seriously disputed by

the Respondents also. The applicant has claimed that her appointment

with IDSA was on a permanent sanctioned vacant post of Research

Assistant in Group 'B', through public appointment, as per the RRs

relevant to those posts. According to the applicant, after two years of her

service with the IDSA, on 04.05.1994 she was selected and appointed

against the duly sanctioned and vacant permanent Group 'A' post of

Research Officer in the pay scale of Rs.2200-4000, with all allowances as

admissible to Group 'A' Officers of the Government of India, through the

appointment order dated 04.05.1994 (Annexure A-4). As usual, the said

appointment was stated to be initially for two years, and it was ordered

that she would be on probation period of one year, and on successful

completion of the probation period, the applicant's appointment was to

be continued. She has claimed that upon satisfactory completion of her

probation period, the IDSA had continued her on the said Group 'A'

sanctioned post of Research Officer, and that she was treated by IDSA as

a regular employee, in view of her appointment having been made

against a permanent post, and as per the RRs, and that she had even

continued to draw her annual increments etc. The applicant claims to
OA No.3963/2014

have been then selected by IDSA and appointed on 15.07.1997 to the

next higher Group 'A' post of Research Fellow, in the pay scale of

Rs.12000-16500, with allowances as admissible to Group 'A' Officers, for

a period of two years, w.e.f. 01.07.1997, which appointment was

extended for a further period of two years w.e.f. 01.07.1999, through

order dated 25.09.1999 (Annexure A-5), and was extended thereafter also

from time to time. None of these averments have been effectively denied

by the Official Respondent No. R-1, or by the Private Respondents No. R-

2 to R-5. In fact, her the then employer IDSA is not even a party to the

present proceedings.

7. It was submitted by the applicant that Respondent No.1 NSCS is a

specialized Department of Govt. of India, coming under the direct

administrative control of the Prime Minister's Office, the appointments to

which are made under its own NSCS RRs. It was further submitted by

the applicant herself that this organization NSCS has been given a

special dispensation to make direct and lateral appointments at all levels

from outside the Government also, including the Universities, Research

Institutes etc., by searching for talent through its own mechanism, and

that the appointments in NSCS and the process of making those

appointments do not come under the purview of even the UPSC, as

exemption from the relevant Constitutional Provisions has been built-in

in the NSCS RRs itself.

8. The applicant has claimed that while she was working in Group 'A'

post of Research Fellow in IDSA, in the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500, the
OA No.3963/2014

Respondent No.1 had asked for her services, and had taken her on

deputation, and appointed her on the post of Deputy Secretary to the

Govt. of India, in the same pay scale, with all admissible allowances.

She claimed to have served on the post of Deputy Secretary from

16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, i.e., for more than 2 years, after which her

parent organization IDSA had requisitioned her services to be returned

back, to enable her to work on an important research project. As a

result, she was repatriated from NSCS, and resumed her charge on the

post of Research Fellow in IDSA, in Group 'A', on 27.09.2002 itself. She

has submitted that her performance on the post of Deputy Secretary in

NSCS had earned her outstanding reports and special appreciation. She

has further submitted that the Respondent No.R-1 NSCS had actually

intended then itself to formally appoint her within NSCS for this purpose,

and they had even asked her to obtain from IDSA the service certificate,

which also she had obtained on 19.07.2002, through Annexure A-6,

much prior to her repatriation back to IDSA. The applicant has further

produced the Commendation Certificate dated 27.09.2002 which had

been issued to her by R-1 NSCS when she was reverted back to her

parent organization IDSA, and which certificate had actually been issued

by a Joint Secretary of Respondent No. R-1, as at Annexure A-7, on

behalf of NSCS, with a copy being marked to her substantive employer,

Director IDSA, also.

9. Less than one year later, in July-August 2003, the applicant had

participated in the regular recruitment process conducted by Respondent

No.R-1, for substantive appointments to the post of Deputy Secretary to
OA No.3963/2014

the Govt. of India with NSCS, and on her being successful in the written

examination and interview, the applicant was advised to submit her

resignation to her the then parent organization IDSA, as a precondition,

for further processing her substantive appointment as Deputy Secretary

in NSCS in the Govt. of India. Accordingly, she submitted her

resignation to IDSA on 08.08.2003, though, while awaiting the

completion of the appointment procedure of Respondent No.R-1-NSCS,

she had remained in service of IDSA till 30.09.2003. When the

Respondent No.R-1-NSCS had informed her and IDSA that the President

of India had approved her appointment to the post of Deputy Secretary,

NSCS, in Govt. of India, as per her request, she was relieved from IDSA

on 30.09.2003, and IDSA had, through a letter of the same date

30.09.2003, accepted her resignation, and had relieved her of her duties.

The applicant has claimed that at that time she failed to notice that in

that relieving order issued by IDSA, it was mentioned that she had been

relieved with retrospective effect from 10.08.2003, and that her

resignation had been accepted on 30.09.2003 was retrospective effect,

over-looking the fact that she was in IDSA's service till that date. Her

appointment, thereafter, as Deputy Secretary, Govt. of India with

Respondent No.R-1 NSCS was Gazette notified on 08.12.2003, by virtue

of which Gazette Notification, she came to be holder of a civil post in the

Union of India. The relevant documents were annexed as Annexures A-

10, A-11 & A-12 of the paper book of the O.A.

10. The applicant has submitted that under the RRs of 2001, fresh

appointments to the permanent vacant posts with Respondent No.R-1-
OA No.3963/2014

NSCS had to be made mainly by the mode of Contract and Deputation,

and subject to suitability of the officer, the initial contract of service with

the Government under Respondent No.R-1-NSCS was generally extended

from time to time. If an officer has put in the requisite necessary service

with NSCS for being eligible to the next higher post, the only procedural

requirement was that a fresh contract was required to be signed to

appoint to the officer concerned for the next higher post in order to retain

the talent, which was akin to promotion. Through its orders dated

05.06.2006, the Govt. of India had, however, continued the applicant on

the post of Deputy Secretary for another period of two years, with

retrospective effect from 03.10.2005, and she was also granted three

advance increments, in order to match her salary to be the same which

she was already drawing in IDSA, and one more advance increment was

also granted in recognition of her outstanding service. She has

submitted that when she had become the holder of a civil post under the

Union of India, since her appointment was against a permanent vacant

post, and had been made in full compliance of the RRs, and the

directions of the Government issued through order dated 05.06.2006,

which was in full compliance of RRs, and it was without any fresh

contract, this had the effect of putting her at par with the regular

appointees.

11. Thereafter, in September 2006, while she was holding the post of

Deputy Secretary, a Selection Committee had duly considered her case

for appointment to the post of Director, against a permanent vacant post

with Respondent No.R-1 NSCS. For this purpose, the Selection
OA No.3963/2014

Committee had reckoned her Group 'A' service of 12 years in IDSA, and

the period of her service in NSCS, from the date of her initial joining in

IDSA on 04.05.1994, to the date 31.08.2006, when she was with NSCS,

and had also taken into account her Group 'A' service of more than 09

years, in the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500, w.e.f. 01.07.1997 to

30.09.2006. Thereafter, as per recommendations of that Selection

Committee, she was appointed to the higher post of Director in NSCS in

the pay scale of Rs.14300-18300 (Revised to Pay Band-4 Rs.37400-

67,000 + GP Rs.8700) for a period of 5 years, and all allowances as were

admissible to the equivalent pay of the Group 'A' Officers of the

Government were made available to her. Soon thereafter, in 2007, the

Respondent No.R-1-NSCS was delinked from Cabinet Secretariat, and

brought under the Administrative control of the Prime Minister's Office.

On 22.12.2007, new NSCS (Group A Services) RRs, 2007 were notified,

under which 50% appointments to the posts of Directors were to be

made by promotion, and 50% appointments as Directors were to be made

by deputation/contract/absorption/re-employment, and it was

specifically provided that the promotion quota will be filled up only

through such officers who had been working with Respondent No.R-1-

NSCS, and had put in 5 years of regular service in the feeder grade of

Rs.12000-16500.

12. The applicant had then explained the complication which had

arisen in her case with the advent of the new RRs, 2007 (Annexure A-16),

and we shall revert to that shortly. However, the applicant worked as

Director for 5 years from 2006 to 2011, and vide their order dated
OA No.3963/2014

27.09.2011, the respondent No. R-1 extended her services on the post of

Director for one more year (Annexure A-17). In Para 4.17 of her OA, the

applicant has alleged that despite the fact that all appointments with the

Respondent No.R-1-NSCS are made against permanent vacant posts,

through a duly constituted Selection Committee, and on the same service

conditions and pay scales as admissible to temporary/regular Group 'A'

officers, yet the method of contract is a normal mode of appointment to

NSCS under the RRs, which has been designed only to keep the officers

in continuous stress. At the same time, the appointments made under

50% promotion quota are also made against the permanent vacant posts,

from among the already serving temporary/regular/absorbed officers in

the feeder cadre. She has further submitted that the mode of absorption

under the RRs is essentially meant for regularization of the services of

those officers who are appointed to NSCS on Contract, or on Deputation

basis. In the conspectus of these submissions, the applicant has

claimed that when on 03.10.2003, she was first appointed against the

permanent vacant post of Deputy Secretary with Respondent No.R-1-

NSCS, and later on, when on 29.09.2006 she was duly appointed against

the permanent vacant post of Director, at the time of absorbing her

services with Respondent No.R-1-NSCS, she ought to have been

absorbed w.e.f. 03.10.2003 on the post of Deputy Secretary, and w.e.f.

29.09.2006 on the post of Director, under the relevant DoP&T

instructions in this regard, which the respondent No.1-NSCS has not

done, giving rise to the present O.A.
OA No.3963/2014

13. The applicant has further submitted that she had all along been

representing for treating her service with IDSA w.e.f. March, 1992 as

being in continuum for the purpose of her pension and retirement

benefits. She has further submitted that but for the allure of pension

facility in the Government service, which is not available to IDSA

employees, she would have, in fact, continued to work in the IDSA. It

was further submitted that the Govt. of India had since regularized all

contract appointments made by IDSA, with effect from the initial dates of

their contractual appointments, and that IDSA has since extended

Pension benefits to all such regularized IDSA employees, under CCS

(Pension) Rules, 1972.

14. In the result, the applicant has through this O.A. assailed the

respondents' order dated 12.04.2012 (Annexure A-1), ordering for her

being absorbed against the post of Director, only from the date of

issuance of that order, and their not having provided her the benefit of

absorption of her services w.e.f. 03.10.2003, the date she joined NSCS on

the post of Deputy Secretary after due process of selection, and her

having resigned from IDSA, as per their requirement. She has further

submitted that RRs of NSCS do not empower the respondents to

continue an officer only on Contract basis indefinitely, merely to deny

him (or her) the status of a regular employee. She has further submitted

that in any case she has been substantively holding a civil post under

the Govt. of India since 03.10.2003, and both her appointment to the

post of Deputy Secretary NSCS, as well as Director NSCS later on, were
OA No.3963/2014

duly Gazette notified. She is aggrieved that the respondents' impugned

order as at Annexure A-1 has resulted in wiping out the benefit of her

entire past service with NSCS, rendered on the post of Deputy Secretary

NSCS from 03.10.2003 to 28.10.2006, full benefit of which ought to have

accrued to her, and further her subsequent substantive appointment on

the post of Director NSCS from 29.09.2006 onwards, till the date of

11.04.2012. As a result of this action of the respondents, many persons

who had been, in the past, working as her juniors or her subordinates

have stolen a march over her, just because even though they were her

juniors, and in some cases subordinate to her, and they were even

promoted or taken on deputation to NSCS on dates later than her, they

have been given seniority from the initial dates of their holding the same

post on such deputation or promotion. The applicant has submitted that

Respondent No.R-1-NSCS not absorbing or regularizing her service from

the initial date of her appointment and joining service on 03.10.2003 has

resulted in denial to her of career, post, status, seniority, seniority, and

the full pension benefits available under the CCS (Pension) Regulations,

1972, and that it has also affected her entitlement of consideration of her

case for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary under the promotion

quota for the Select List year 2009.

15. The applicant has further assailed the impugned order dated

12.04.2012 to be baseless, whimsical, discriminatory, vitiated with bias

and prejudice, and against the RRs, as the date arbitrarily chosen by the

respondents for her absorption has no relation whatsoever with the date
OA No.3963/2014

of her initial appointment with Respondent No.1-NSCS, and the various

posts of Deputy Secretary and Director of NSCS held by her. She has

submitted that she has thus been denied right of equality in employment

etc. under
Articles 16

& 21
of the Constitution of India. The applicant

has further submitted that on her taking up the matter with respondent

No.1-NSCS, she was informed that the respondent No.1-NSCS had

declined to give her the benefit of continuity of Group 'A' Service from her

service in IDSA on the plea that her previous Group 'A' Service in IDSA

upto 10.08.2003, and subsequently her joining on appointment in NSCS

on 03.10.2003, was separated by the period of 01 month and 22 days,

and, therefore, her previous experience of working for 09 years in Group

'A' Service rendered in IDSA could not be treated to have been in

continuation for the purpose of according promotion to her. She has

alleged that this stand was contrary to the stand taken by the

respondent No.1-NSCS on 03.10.2003, when they had indeed reckoned

her previous Group 'A' Service in IDSA to have been without any

interruption for the purpose of counting her service qualification, as

required under the RRs, and the respondents could not be allowed to

now change their stand after a decade. It was submitted that it was not

correct and legally tenable for the respondent No.1-NSCS to have raised

the plea of an alleged break in her service, and shelter had been sought

behind the Hon'ble Apex Court judgment in the case of
Banaras Hindu

University Varanasi and Another vs. Dr. Indra Pratap Singh
AIR

1992 SC 780: JT 1992 (1) SC 320.
OA No.3963/2014

16. The applicant has alleged that because of this deliberate mischief

on their part, the respondent No.1-NSCS has, thereafter, through their

order dated 26.11.2013, declined to consider her case for promotion to

the post of Joint Secretary, taking the plea that her past service in IDSA,

and the subsequent service with R-1 NSCS, were separated by a gap of

01 month and 22 days, and, therefore, her employment cannot be

reckoned to be one continuum, and that the assessment of her claim for

promotion would, therefore, have to be considered only on the basis of

her service from the date of her joining in NSCS on 03.10.2003, which

the applicant has termed to be illegal. She has submitted that the

respondents cannot now take a reverse view only because the word

'continuous' has been added in the revised RRs of 2007, which was not

there in the previous RRs. The applicant had represented in this behalf

on 11.12.2013 pointing out the discrimination meted out to her, and had

even cited other cases to allege discrimination. It was submitted that the

respondent No.1-NSCS has now taken a new plea that the applicant's

earlier contract appointment had come to an end, and that her

continuous service could be counted only from the date of her

substantive absorption, and they have thus ignored consideration of her

case for absorption on this basis of service rendered from the initial date

of her joining on contract. She has further submitted that even the

advice sought by the Respondent No. R-1-NSCS from DoP&T and

Ministry of Law was on a wrong premise. The applicant had further

sought shelter behind this Tribunal's Order in the case of
Dr. S.D.

Pradhan vs. National Security Council
in OA No.2250/2012, decided

on 21.10.2013 (Annexure A-20). Thereafter, it was alleged that she had
OA No.3963/2014

represented against the respondents' order dated 29.04.2014, but the

same was not replied to, and she had cited the cases of two individuals

who had later got themselves impleaded as private respondents R-3 & R-

5, but did not advance any arguments, beyond R-4 filing a counter reply

to the OA.

17. The applicant had submitted that in the case of private respondent

No. R-2, the official respondent R-1-NSCS had directly appointed him on

the post of Joint Director/Deputy Secretary, under the mode of

absorption, by even treating or reckoning his co-terminus employment in

their Personal Sections with various Hon'ble Ministers during the years

from 1986 to 2006, which was against the RRs, and R-1-NSCS had even

treated the gap in his employment with the Govt. of India in Ministers'

Personal Sections also from 17.01.1990 to 30.04.1992 as to be in

continuum, only because of which he could get promoted to the post of

Director w.e.f. 29.09.2011, overlooking her seniority over him (R-2). The

applicant had also discussed the case of private respondent No. R-4

stating that on 16.08.2005, the respondents had created a new post of

OSD in the pay scale of Joint Secretary with Respondent No. R-1-NSCS,

for the specific purpose of serving the National Security Advisory Board,

and had then permanently transferred the private respondent No. R-4 to

that post, when he was, in fact, at that time looking after the Hospitality

Wing at the Prime Minister's residence, and even though he (R-4) had no

qualifications/experience whatsoever of defence research or related

aspects. It was submitted by her that private respondent No. R-4 was

later absorbed as Joint Secretary, and then further promoted to the post
OA No.3963/2014

of Additional Secretary, apparently by relaxing the eligibility norms, and

even without the mandatory approval of the ACC. She had explained the

case of another person, Dr. S.D. Pradhan, who was not named, and did

not become a party respondent in this case, but in whose cases also, she

had alleged that Respondent No.R-1-NSCS had reckoned the entire

contract service for the purpose of continuity of service for pensionary

benefits under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.

18. While submitting that she does not want to question the benefits

already granted by the respondent No.1-NSCS to any other person, the

applicant had only submitted that she did not want to be discriminated

against by the respondents.

19. The applicant had taken the ground for filing this OA that she was

entitled to absorption on the post of Deputy Secretary in substantive

capacity w.e.f. 03.10.2003, the date when she had first joined

Respondent No.R-1-NSCS, and required to be treated as having been

substantively promoted on the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006, as had

been stated by the respondent No.1-NSCS in the letter dated 06.10.2006,

by which she would have become entitled to be considered for promotion

to the post of Joint Secretary as on 01.10.2009, even as per the new

NSCS RRs, 2007. She had further taken the ground that she was

entitled for her service in IDSA to be reckoned in continuum for the

purpose of retirement and pensionary benefits under CCS (Pension)

Rules, 1972. In support of her contention, she had taken the ground
OA No.3963/2014

that her appointment to Respondent No.R-1-NSCS as Deputy Secretary

was against a permanent vacant post, and in terms of NSCS RRs as they

were prevailing on that date. She had further taken the ground that the

respondent No.1-NSCS has overlooked her period of service on the two

posts of Research Officer and Research Fellow with IDSA, which had

been reckoned with and considered even by the Selection Committee of

R-1 NSCS itself also, due to which she was held to be meeting the

requirements of service qualification for her appointment to the post of

Deputy Secretary with R-1-NSCS on 03.10.2003, and, therefore, the

respondent R-1-NSCS cannot now be allowed to go back on that aspect,

and not to consider that service of hers with IDSA as eligible service.

20. She has further taken the ground that when her initial appointment

under the then prevailing NSCS RRs of 2001 was on contract basis for

three/five years and the contract was extended from time to time till her

absorption, which is a usual mode of appointment with R-1 NSCS, her

initial appointment was akin to deputation appointment, as held by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Banaras Hindu University

Varanasi and Another vs. Dr. Indra Pratap Singh
(supra).

She has

also submitted that she cannot be denied the benefit admissible to

regular officers just because her direct appointment against a

permanent vacant post had been termed to be on contract basis, as had

been held by this Tribunal in the case of
Dr. S.D. Pradhan vs. National

Security Council
(supra), more so because even her subsequent

promotional appointment to the post of Director on 29.09.2006 had also
OA No.3963/2014

been made against a permanent vacant post, in full compliance of the

then prevailing RRs of 2001. She had further taken the ground that

when her appointment to a civil post with Respondent No.R-1-NSCS was

under
Article 309
of the Constitution, she was entitled to all benefits and

safeguards as available to equivalent officers holding equivalent civil

posts, and it has to be held that she was holding a civil post

continuously since 03.10.2003.

21. The applicant had further sought shelter behind the Hon'ble Apex

Court judgment in
Roshan Lal Tandon vs. Union of India
AIR 1967 SC

1889, which was reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal Baghela AIR 2006 SC 1165=2006 (2) SCC

482, and the relevant paragraphs from the judgment produced at

Annexure A-23 were cited.

She had further taken the ground that both

in respect of her initial contract service/appointment dated 03.10.2003

to the post of Deputy Secretary, and further promotion/appointment

from 29.09.2006 to the promotional post of Director, her service

conditions were throughout regulated under CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965, and

other Rules made under
Article 309
of the Constitution, and also
Article
of the Constitution, and shelter had been sought by her in regard to

her status as such, on the basis of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court

judgment in the case of
Indian Institute of Technology vs. Mangat

Singh
[1973 (9) DLT 475] (Annexure A-24). She had further taken the

ground that the impugned decision to grant her absorption on the post of

Director only w.e.f. 12.04.2012 was illegal, discriminatory, as well as
OA No.3963/2014

against the RRs, both the previous RRs of the year 2001, as well as the

new RRs of 2007, and had caused her serious prejudice, as it had

affected and completely wiped out her continuous service with R-1-NSCS

from 03.10.2003 to 11.04.2012, and it was, therefore, stated to be in

violation of her rights under
Articles 16

& 21
of the Constitution.

22. The applicant had further taken the ground that the date of

12.04.2012 now fixed by the respondents in the impugned order as the

date of her absorption in the NSCS service, on the post of Director, was

completely whimsical, without any basis, and does not have any basis

nor any relation whatsoever to the date of her permanent appointment,

or availability of permanent vacant posts, especially so, since she was

appointed in full compliance of 2001 RRs to the post of Deputy Secretary

on 03.10.2003, against a permanent vacant post, and, therefore, she was

entitled for absorption against her the then post from the same date.

She had further alleged discrimination due to the direct induction of an

officer on the post of Deputy Secretary on 29.09.2006, and on the post of

Director on 29.09.2011, ignoring her claim, when she was already

serving as Deputy Secretary since 03.10.2003, and submitted the R-1-

NSCS had ordered her services to have been absorbed on 12.04.2012 in

an artificial manner, thereby making the said officer, private respondent

R-2, senior to her.

23. She had further taken the ground that her life would be shattered

unless her service since 04.05.1994 in IDSA/NSCS-R-1 is counted for

the period of her total service for the purpose of pension etc. She had
OA No.3963/2014

further taken the ground that the terms contract and a fixed tenure of

such contract being mentioned in the letter of her appointment was a

sham, unreasonable, and a clear case of exploitation, in the fact

situation that the applicant did not, at that point of time, have any

bargaining power, and it was least expected from the Government, which

had to act as a model employer, to make such appointments on contract

basis, against permanent posts. In the result, citing that the respondent

No.1 NSCS had even failed to reply to her Legal Notice dated

11.06.2014, the following prayers had been sought for:-

"a) To quash and set aside the respondent's orders dated

12.04.2012, 26.11.2013 and 29.04.2014 (Annexure A-1, A-
2 and A-3) and order the respondent for applicant's
absorption on the post of Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of
India w.e.f. 03.10.2003 and to further order the
respondent to treat the applicant's appointment dated
29.09.2006 on the post of Director as promotion w.e.f.
from 29.09.2006 as already stated by the respondent vide
order dated 06.10.2006 and to further order the
respondent to consider the applicant for promotion to the
post of Joint Secretary in pay scale of Rs.37400-67000 +
Grade Pay of Rs. 10,000/- as on 01.10.2009 as per the
NSCS Recruitment Rules, 2007 and to reckon her service
in IDSA in continuum for the purpose of retirement and
pension benefits under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.

b) Pass such other order (s) as may be deemed fit in the
interest of justice".

24. Counter reply on behalf of R-1-NSCS was filed on 02.02.2015. A

preliminary objection was taken that all the representations of the

applicant have been replied to, after thorough examination, in

consultation with the nodal departments, DoP&T and Ministry of Law &

Justice. Further, it was submitted that the applicant was working with

IDSA only on contract basis, first as Research Assistant, on stipend

basis, from 06.04.1992 to 16.05.1994, and then as Research Officer in
OA No.3963/2014

the pay scale of Rs.2200-4000 w.e.f. 17.05.1994, as per letter dated

11.12.2013 (Annexure R-1) received from IDSA, (copy of her IDSA

service record was produced as Annexure R-2). It was further admitted

that she was awarded Fellowship in the pay scale of Rs.12000-18000 in

IDSA for two years w.e.f. 15.07.1997. It was further submitted that she

was further awarded another Fellowship in IDSA for two years, w.e.f.

01.07.1999, as per the IDSA service record at Annexure R-3, during

which period she had also worked as a Research Fellow with the R-1-

NSCS in the pay scale of Rs.12000-16500, from 16.08.2000 to

27.09.2002, on loan basis, for which period her pay & allowances were

paid by R-1-NSCS, as per the copy of the Office Order dated 28.08.2000,

at Annexure R-4, whereafter she had returned to IDSA w.e.f. 27.09.2002,

through the order of that date produced at Annexure R-5. It was

submitted that thereafter she had resigned from IDSA, and was relieved

of her duties w.e.f. 10.08.2003, as per the IDSA service record at

Annexure R-6, and that she was paid salary only upto 10.08.2003 by

IDSA, and that she had also availed terminal benefits of her leave

encashment etc. from that office accordingly. In that context, it was

submitted that the contract of the applicant with IDSA came to an end

on 10.08.2003, and that she had been paid her entire salary and

terminal benefits by IDSA only upto that date.

25. It was admitted that the applicant was appointed with R-1 NSCS

on contract basis as Deputy Secretary/Joint Director in the pay scale of

Rs.12000-16500 w.e.f. 03.10.2003, but it was emphasized that this was
OA No.3963/2014

after a gap of 01 month and 22 days after she had left her services with

IDSA. It was further submitted that she was subsequently appointed as

Director with R-1-NSCS w.e.f. 29.09.2006 for a period of 5 years on fresh

contract vide order dated 06.10.2006 (Annexure R-8), which was

extended from time to time for one year at a time, i.e., upto 28.09.2012,

through Annexure R-9, but, in the meanwhile, she was absorbed as

Director with R-1-NSCS w.e.f. 12.04.2012, which alone gave her the

status of a regular Government servant from that date, because prior to

that she was working only on contract basis, both with IDSA, and

thereafter with R-1-NSCS. It was submitted that under the RRs of R-1-

NSCS for promotions to the posts of Joint Secretary, produced at

Annexure R-11, the eligibility criteria for the post of Joint Secretary

clearly shows that in order to be eligible for promotion to the post of

Joint Secretary, the incumbent should satisfy either one of the three

conditions mentioned in the RRs, as follows:-

"(a) 2 years' regular service in Director (DIG scale Grade Pay
Rs.8900); or

(b) 3 years' regular service in Director scale (Grade Pay Rs.

8700); or

(c) 8 years' regular service in Deputy Secretary's scale
(Grade Pay Rs.7600);

with total continuous Group 'A' service of 17 years".

26. The respondents had taken the further preliminary objection that

the applicant does not fulfil the eligibility criteria of 3 years' regular

service in the grade of Director, with total continuous Group 'A' Service of

17 years, for her case being considered for her promotion as Joint

Secretary, though she had been maintaining that she has put in more
OA No.3963/2014

than 17 years in Group A Service, taking into account her past service

rendered both in IDSA, and with R-1-NSCS. It was further submitted

that on the issue of giving weightage for counting of past service rendered

by her in IDSA, DoP&T had opined that no such weightage for counting

of past service was permissible, and though contract appointment can be

made against posts, if the RRs prescribed for the same, but the eligible

service of an employee will be counted only from the date of absorption,

and the service rendered prior to that on contract basis, not being

regular service, cannot be taken into account for counting eligible service

for the purpose of promotion, as per DoP&T advice, produced at

Annexure R-12.

27. It was submitted that prior to the applicant joining R-1-NSCS on

03.10.2003, she was working with IDSA also purely on contract basis,

and she had resigned from IDSA in August 2003 'on her own will', and

not in pursuance of any request from R-1-NSCS, and that even from that

office, she had accepted her contract appointment as Deputy Secretary

with R-1-NSCS, on 03.10.2003, and had even signed a contract

agreement for that purpose. The applicant's contention that she was

assured that her contract appointment will soon be converted into

regular appointment was denied, since there was no such provision in

the 2001 RRs, and the prevalent RRs in the year 2003 did not even have

any provision for promotion, and as per the Guidelines for recruitment of

officers in respondent No.1 NSCS organization, absorption had been

done only 'in rare cases', and that too after completion of a minimum
OA No.3963/2014

period of 5 years by the concerned incumbent in that organization in an

outstanding manner.

28. It was denied that the applicant's appointment as Director w.e.f.

29.09.2006 was on promotion, and it was submitted that her

appointment as Director was only on a fresh contract, and her pay also

was fixed only at the minimum of the scale of pay of Director, vide order

dated 06.10.2006. It was further submitted that during the year 2006,

the previous RRs of 2001 were applicable, which had no provision for

promotion, and that promotion had been included in the revised RRs

2007, which had become effective from 22.12.2007 only, and the

applicant could not, therefore, have been eligible for promotion to the

post of Director in the year 2006, as claimed by her.

29. It was further submitted that the Office Order dated 06.10.2006,

containing the word 'promotion', has since been rectified vide Office

Order dated 20.10.2014 (Annexure R-13), which modification order had

been issued just around a fortnight before the date of filing of the present

OA, but after the Legal Notice had been sent by the applicant's counsel.

30. It was submitted that the applicant's prayers that she be treated as

having been absorbed on the post of Deputy Secretary on 03.10.2003,

and her contract appointment as Director on 29.09.2006 be treated as

promotion, are also based on false presumptions and afterthoughts, and

that she was presently not eligible for being considered for promotion as

Joint Secretary. It was further submitted that the applicant is

questioning the order dated 06.10.2006 regarding her pay fixation in the
OA No.3963/2014

present OA, filed in the year 2014, and, therefore, the present OA is

hopelessly time barred, and that she was estopped from raising these

issues at this stage.

31. In Para-wise reply to OA, it was submitted by R-1 NSCS that apart

from the RRs, there are certain Guidelines also for filling up of the posts

in NSCS, and that the Guidelines on recruitment of Officers in NSCS also

stipulate that absorption can be made "in rare cases only", and after

completion of minimum 5 years' service with that organization in an

outstanding manner, and, therefore, it was submitted that absorption in

NSCS cannot be claimed by the present applicant as a matter of right,

and such absorption is always at the sole discretion of the organization.

It was submitted that since a contract employee cannot be promoted,

and can only be appointed to the next higher grade on a fresh contract,

inadvertently the Office Order dated 06.10.2006 had included/contained

the word 'promotion', which inadvertent mistake had since already been

rectified through Annexure R-13.

32. It was further submitted that in the year 2012, the Prime Minister's

Office had directed to examine and process the case of the present

applicant for absorption in NSCS. Accordingly, her case, along with the

cases of all other officers who had completed 5 years' continuous service

in NSCS till then, were processed, and placed before the Selection

Committee first, and then before the Appointing Authority (Prime

Minister), who had found 3 of them, including the applicant, as being

suitable for absorption, and orders were accordingly issued on

12.04.2012 (Annexure R-10) in respect of those three Officers. It was
OA No.3963/2014

submitted that in 11 years of her continuous service with the

respondent-organization R-3, the applicant had never raised the issue of

her absorption to be given effect to w.e.f. 03.10.2003, which issue has

raised through this OA now. It was further submitted that the applicant

had submitted a representation dated 06.03.2013, which was replied to

through Communication dated 26.11.2013 (Annexure A-2), which

representation of hers was related to the maintenance of her Service

Book in respondents' own organization, and not relating to counting of

her past service rendered in IDSA from May 1992 to 30.09.2003, as has

now been mentioned by her in the present OA, and that after submission

of her aforesaid representation dated 06.03.2013, she had also verbally

raised the issue of her promotion during her meeting with the Deputy

National Security Advisor and the Secretary of R-1-NSCS on 20.11.2013,

after which the reply was issued to her on 26.11.2013, and she was

informed that her past service in IDSA, and subsequent service in the

respondent No.1 NSCS-organization being separated by 01 month and 22

days, the two cannot be reckoned to be one continuum, and, therefore,

an assessment of her claim for promotion will have to be made only with

reference to the date of her joining in NSCS on 03.10.2003, and in

accordance with the RRs and set procedures, and that it was not correct

to say that the respondents had declined her representation.

33. In reply to Para 4.7 of the OA, it was submitted that the applicant

had earlier joined the respondent No.1-NSCS, when she was working in

IDSA as a Research Fellow, 'on loan basis' from 16.08.2000 to

26.09.2002, and that she was not on deputation, as has been wrongly
OA No.3963/2014

mentioned by her. It was submitted after she was relieved from the

respondent No1-NSCS on 27.09.2002 with direction to report to her

parent office IDSA, at that point of time, she was not asked to submit

any Service Certificate from IDSA. Instead, through her Note dated

23.08.2011, she had herself provided a copy of a Certificate addressed

"To whomsoever it may concern" dated 16.08.2011, issued by IDSA,

stating that she had worked as Research Assistant in that organization

from 1992 to 1994 (Annexure R-15), and she had again submitted a copy

of another such Certificate dated 19.07.2002 through her

Communication dated 22.01.2014 (Annexure R-16), with reference to the

Communication dated 26.11.2013 issued to her in response to her

earlier representation dated 06.03.2013. Therefore, her contention that

she had been asked to submit a Service Certificate from IDSA for the

purpose of her appointment in 2003 was denied.

34. It was further denied that the applicant had been advised to submit

her resignation in IDSA as a pre-condition to further process of

appointment in Govt. of India, and it was further denied by R-1- NSCS

that she had remained in service of IDSA till 30.09.2003, and it was

further denied that she was sanctioned leave upto 30.09.2003 by the

IDSA, since, according to R-1- NSCS she did not remain in service of

IDSA till that date, and was instead relieved of her duties w.e.f.

10.08.2003, and her salary was also paid only upto that date only by

IDSA. Her plea in this regard was termed by R-1- NSCS to be an

afterthought.
OA No.3963/2014

35. It was further submitted that the modes of appointment prescribed

in the NSCS RRs 2001 for the post of Deputy Secretary/Joint Director

were (1) deputation/ (2) contract/ (3) absorption/ (4) re-employment, and

that the officers of the (1) Central Government/(2) State Government/ (3)

Universities/(4) Research Institutes/ (5) Autonomous Bodies, holding

analogous posts, were eligible. It was submitted that since at the time of

her selection for the post of Deputy Secretary in R-1-NSCS in the year

2003, the applicant was holding an analogous post in IDSA, her

candidature was considered, and she was appointed to that post in R-1-

NSCS on contract basis w.e.f. 03.10.2003. Still, uno flatu, it was denied

that the respondent R-1- NSCS had reckoned her having held Group 'A'

service of more than 9 years in IDSA from 1994 to 2003 for consideration

of her appointment with the R-1-NSCS. Further, while admitting that the

post against which she was appointed was a regular sanctioned post, it

was once again uno flatu stated that it was filled up not on a substantive

basis, but through her contract appointment, which was one of the

modes of appointment prescribed in the RRs 2001.

36. It was submitted by R-1- NSCS that merely appointing her on

contract basis against a regular post, and notifying such an appointment

in the Gazette of India, and granting her annual increments and other

benefits as admissible to regularly appointed officers in that pay scale

cannot bestow upon her the status of a regular Government servant,

since the conditions of her contract appointment were governed by the

agreement duly accepted and signed by her, which contract agreement

itself inter-alia included application of Fundamental Rules (FRs), LTC
OA No.3963/2014

Rules, CCS (CCA) Rules, 1972 etc. to her appointment. It was further

submitted that contract appointments and absorption were two different

modes prescribed in the 2001 RRs, and a contract employee is governed

only by the agreement signed by him/her, and attains the status of a

regular Government servant only after absorption.

37. It was further submitted that since contract employment had been

prescribed as one of the modes of recruitment of Officers in the NSCS

2001 RRs, such contract employees were also eligible for increments etc.

also, apart from pay & allowances, as admissible to officers recruited

through the other prescribed modes, and on completion of their initial

contract period, as assessment was made for their continuation in the

same grade, or to give them the higher grade, on the basis of a fresh

contract. It was still submitted that they, however, can become regular

Government servants from the date of their absorption only.

38. It was further denied that the applicant was substantively

appointed to the post of Director in the year 2006 only because the

Selection Committee had at that time taken into reckoning her

continuous Group 'A' service of 12 years in IDSA and NSCS put together,

and 9 years out of which was in the pay scale of Deputy Secretary/Joint

Director both in IDSA and NSCS put together. It was instead submitted

that she was appointed as Director on a fresh contract keeping in view

only her performance in R-1- NSCS in the grade of Deputy Secretary,

during the two spells of her contract service with R-1- NSCS by that

time, totalling to 5 years, since the Guidelines for recruitment of officers

in NSCS provided that a contract officer can be considered for higher
OA No.3963/2014

post on a fresh contract basis on completion of 5 years of such contract

service.

39. It was further submitted that the NSCS was designated as a

specialized Research unit, under the direct charge of the National

Security Advisor (NSA, in short) in the Prime Minister's Office, vide

Cabinet Secretariat's Resolution dated 27.02.2002, and it was admitted

that the new RRs for Group 'A' services in NSCS were notified on

22.12.2007, which is a matter of record. The applicant's contention that

with the advent of the new RRs 2007, she should have been

absorbed/regularized from the back date of 03.10.2003, and that she

was eligible for her appointment on the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006

to be treated, as promotion was denied and called a far-fetched

imagination. It was submitted that appointing people on absorption/re-

employment/contract, as prescribed in the RRs, is the sole discretion of

the organization, and as regards promotion, no junior/subordinate of the

applicant had been promoted to the post of Director/Joint Secretary after

the new RRs 2007, and when three eligible officers, including the

applicant, were found suitable to be eligible for absorption, orders were

issued on 12.04.2012 accordingly.

40. It was further submitted by R-1-NSCS that though (such Class-I

/Group A Service) appointments in the Government of India are normally

done through UPSC, however, the respondent-organization-NSCS has

been given a special dispensation in the matter of recruitment of its

officers/staff, to enable it to tap the available talent from within or

outside the Government etc., and whenever the Search Committee of R-
OA No.3963/2014

1-NSCS identifies suitable candidates anywhere, such identified

candidates are offered appointment. While serving Government servants

are taken on deputation basis, those working with the Research

Institutes/Autonomous Bodies/Private Institutions etc., who cannot

come on deputation, are offered contract appointments, if they are

cleared otherwise from security angle. Retired Government servants are

also appointed on re-employment basis. It was further submitted that

whenever any vacancy arises at a level, and the process of selection has

been initiated, the candidature of already serving NSCS contract officers

is also considered, and if they are found suitable as per the

RRs/Guidelines, they are appointed to the higher grade, on a fresh

contract basis, as was done in the applicant's case.

41. It was further submitted that after joining respondent-organization

NSCS, the applicant had consented to become a member of the

Contributory Provident Fund (CPF, in short) as applicable to contract

employees, and that only after her absorption w.e.f. 12.04.2012 she

became a member of the New Pension Scheme (NPS, in short), and her

CPF accumulations were refunded to her, which goes to show that she

was fully aware that she would not be eligible for pension under the CCS

(Pension) Rules, 1972 in NSCS. It was denied that any of her junior, or

any of her subordinates, had been appointed or absorbed in the grade of

Director prior to her absorption along with two others on 12.04.2012. It

was further submitted that the date of 12.04.2012 is very much relevant,

as the order of her absorption in NSCS was issued on that date, after

receiving the approval of the Competent Authority. It was also submitted
OA No.3963/2014

that she had entered into a fresh contract agreement for her contractual

appointment to the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006, without raising the

issue of her absorption from the back date of 03.10.2003, which

contention she has now raised through this OA. It was submitted that

all the representations of the applicant were examined in consultation

with the nodal departments, DoP&T and Ministry of Law & Justice, and

detailed replies were sent to her, clarifying that as per the existing RRs,

she is not eligible for promotion as Joint Secretary at present, and it has

also been clarified that she was appointed as Deputy Secretary w.e.f.

03.10.2003 only because she was earlier holding an analogous post in

IDSA, as was required in the RRs of 2001.

42. The applicability of the case of
Banaras Hindu University

Varanasi and Another vs. Dr. Indra Pratap Singh
(supra) to the instant

case was denied, as that case related to Merit Promotion Scheme of the

University Grants Commission, whereas the present OA concerns the

RRs and other Rules and Regulations applicable to the NSCS and other

Central Government employees, and that it is clear that for promotion to

the post of Joint Secretary in NSCS, one has to have rendered a

minimum regular service of 3 years in the grade of Director, with

minimum 17 years' continuous Group 'A' Service, and the applicant does

not meet this eligibility criteria at present. It was denied that the

respondents had vide order dated 26.11.2013 declined to consider the

applicant for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary, since it had been

already clarified to her vide Communication dated 29.04.2012 that her
OA No.3963/2014

regular service counts from the date of her absorption in NSCS, i.e.,

12.04.2012.

43. The respondents had further distinguished her case from the case

of
Dr. S.D. Pradhan
(supra), who had been on contract with the NSCS

from 1999 to 2001, and was subsequently absorbed as Joint Secretary,

because he was working continuously since 29.06.1989 in various

capacities, and the last post of OSD at JS level was held by him as on

07.06.2001.

44. The applicant's contention that her representation dated

17.06.2014 was not replied to was denied, stating that it had been

replied through Annexure R-18 dated 05.09.2014. Respondents had

thereafter explained the individual cases of private respondent R-3 Ms.

Shweta Bakshi, private respondent R-5 Shri Akshay Joshi, private

respondent R-2 Shri Murlidharan Pillai, and of private respondent R-4

Shri Rohit Khera, and the circumstances of their absorption and

promotion etc. They had also explained the facts concerning the case of

Dr. S.D. Pradhan, which had been mentioned by the applicant in the OA

in her own manner.

45. In reply to the grounds, it was submitted by R-1-NSCS that the

applicant had herself resigned from her previous employer IDSA, which

resignation was accepted by IDSA, to be effective from 10.08.2003, and it

had nowhere been mentioned in her relieving order that she was relieved

for the purpose of joining service with R-1-NSCS, though, while

considering her appointment to the post of Deputy Secretary in NSCS
OA No.3963/2014

w.e.f. 03.10.2003, her candidature had been considered by considering

her to have been holding an analogous post in IDSA prior to that, as was

required under the then prevalent 2001 RRs. It was further submitted

that the applicant has wrongly cited the Hon'ble Supreme Court's

judgment, because in that judgment it has nowhere been held that

contract appointments are akin to deputation appointment.

46. It was further reiterated that the word 'promotion' was

inadvertently mentioned in the order passed by R-1-NSCS on

06.10.2006, as a contract employee could not have been promoted, and

as per NSCS RRs of 2001, promotion did not figure as a mode of

recruitment, and, on the contrary, any officer being absorbed had to give

a Service Certificate. It was submitted that the applicant could not have

demanded any promotion, and since the word 'promotion' had been

inadvertently wrongly used in the order dated 06.10.2006, that order had

since been rectified on 20.10.2014.

47. The applicant's contention that her rights and obligations were not

determined only by the contract signed by her, but were determined

instead by Statutory Rules was denied as her own imagination and an

afterthought. It was submitted that the fact remained that she had been

absorbed on the post of Director in NSCS only w.e.f. 12.04.2012, on the

basis of consideration of her performance during the period from

03.10.2003 to 11.04.2012, and the applicant had at that point of time

not raised any issue then and there regarding the effective date of her

absorption. It was further submitted that consequent on her absorption,

her contractual status has since changed, to that of a regular
OA No.3963/2014

Government servant, and this was not violative of her fundamental rights

of equality. It was further submitted that the mere fact that the

appointment of the applicant on contract basis was against a permanent

vacant post does not mean that she is entitled to absorption from the

date of her initial contract appointment in a retrospective manner.

48. Explaining the case of private respondent R-2 Shri Murlidharan

Pillai, it was submitted by R-1-NSCS that he was holding an analogous

post in PMO when he was appointed as Joint Director with R-1-NSCS on

absorption basis w.e.f. 29.09.2006. Thereafter, since RRs of 2007, when

they were promulgated, provided that the NSCS officers with 5 years'

regular service in the pay scale of Deputy Secretary/Joint Director were

eligible for promotion to the grade of Director, and since R-2 Shri Pillai

had by then completed 5 years of regular service with R-1 NSCS on

28.09.2011, he was promoted to the post of Director w.e.f. 29.09.2011,

as per the 2007 RRs, and on the basis of the recommendations of the

Selection Committee.

49. It was further submitted by R-1-NSCS that 11 years after her

joining on contract basis, the applicant cannot question her joining as

such, and since contract appointment is not akin to deputation, and in

reply to para 5.16 of the OA it was submitted that only a serving regular

employee can be selected to come on deputation, for a specified tenure,

with the prior concurrence of his parent organization, and after

completion of deputation tenure, reverts to his parent organization. It

was, therefore, submitted that even as per notified RRs, contract

appointments and deputation appointments are two different modes of
OA No.3963/2014

appointments being made in NSCS. Any injustice having been meted out

to the applicant was denied, and it was submitted that on all the

occasions when the issue was raised by her, she had been informed that

presently she was not eligible for promotion. Therefore, it was prayed

that the OA may be dismissed, with costs against the applicant.

50. The applicant filed her rejoinder on 10.04.2015, more or less

reiterating her contentions as already made out in the OA, which need

not be repeated here once again. It was reiterated by her that under the

NSCS RRs of 2001, all initial appointments to regular/permanent posts

were to be made by the methods of (1) Contract/(2) deputation /(3)

absorption/(4) re-employment, and that there was no provision for any

regular appointments whatsoever. It was submitted that as can be seen

from Annexure R-12 of the respondent-R-1-NSCS's counter reply, DoP&T

itself had termed those RRs as vague, and that the R-1-NSCS had further

complicated the matters by having obtained waiver of consultation with

UPSC, DoP&T, and Ministry of Finance for the recruitments made at

higher levels.

51. It was further submitted that the respondent R-1-NSCS had

amended the RRs in the year 2007, which also are nothing but a mere

repetition of 2001 RRs, except that 'promotion' has been added as

another mode of making appointments. It was further submitted that for

consideration of her candidature for appointment to the post of Deputy

Secretary, the Respondents had already treated her to have been holding

the analogous post of Research Fellow in IDSA on regular basis, and,

later, when her appointment on the post of Director was to be
OA No.3963/2014

considered, they had treated both her deputation period of two years in

NSCS earlier (from 16.08.2000 to 26.09.2002) and three years of her

contract service from 2003, as the total 5 years of service on regular

basis, while considering her eligibility and making her a Director on

29.09.2006. It was, therefore, submitted that now the R-1-NSCS cannot

go back from their having reckoned her eligibility of three years' service

as regular service w.e.f. 2003, before her appointment as Director, for

the purpose of consideration of her case for promotion to the post of

Joint Secretary.

52. It was submitted that while the respondents had ignored her right

of absorption from the very beginning, on the other hand, along with her

promotion to the post of Director on 29.09.2006, the respondents had

made direct initial appointment of one Mr. Murlidharan Pillai as Deputy

Secretary, as such from the same date when she became a Director, who,

as a Deputy Secretary, was junior to her, and he could become Director

only on 29.09.2011. It was, therefore, submitted that for the period of 5

years from 29.09.2006 to 28.09.2011, private respondent R-2 had been

her subordinate/junior. However, while private respondent R-2 was

promoted as Director on regular basis earlier, w.e.f. 29.09.2011, the

applicant was ordered to have been absorbed as Director more than six

months later, only through the impugned order dated 12.04.2012,

thereby making the private respondent R-2 as senior to the applicant,

because of which she had also asked for her similar regularization with

effect from the date of her initial appointment. Again discussing the case

of Mrs. Shweta Bakshi, private respondent R-3, it was submitted by the
OA No.3963/2014

applicant that she was absorbed/regularized on the post of Under

Secretary on 04.12.2012, and, therefore, as per Rules, she ought to have

become eligible for promotion to the next post of Deputy Secretary only

after 5 years of regular service. But, less than a year later, on

06.11.2013, R-1-NSCS had promoted her to the post of Deputy

Secretary, by reckoning her previous contract service, which reckoning of

previous contract service is being denied in the case of the applicant,

and, therefore, she is being discriminated against.

53. It was further submitted by the applicant that since the superior

officers of the R-1-NSCS were impressed with the applicant's

performance while on deputation, they had decided to initiate the

process for her appointment against the permanent post of Deputy

Secretary, and she had submitted her C.V. accordingly. Vide letter dated

23.04.2003, she was asked to appear for written test, and the interview

was held on 08.05.2003, and then she was also asked to submit the 'No

Objection Certificate' from IDSA for treating her as being nominated by

the IDSA, and also that she would be relieved and sent on deputation to

the respondent-organization in the event of her selection.

54. It was submitted that in July-August 2003, she had been informed

by R-1-NSCS regarding her having qualified in the selection process, and

while the final approval of her selection/appointment was being obtained

from the highest levels, she was asked to submit her resignation to the

IDSA, and to remain ready for joining her services with the R-1-NSCS.

Accordingly, on 08.08.2003, she had submitted her resignation from

IDSA, but its acceptance was kept pending by IDSA, awaiting the joining
OA No.3963/2014

message from R-1-NSCS, and that during this interregnum period, she

had remained on the rolls of IDSA, as may be seen from the fact that on

14.08.2003, the IDSA had even considered her proposal for going on

foreign tour, and on 18.09.2003, the Director IDSA had approved her

application dated 10.09.2003 for sanction of leave till 30.09.2003

(Annexure A-8 colly).

55. It was submitted that on 29.09.2003, she had received a verbal

message from her superiors in R-1-NSCS, asking her to join forthwith on

the post of Deputy Secretary, and, as a result, she had requested and

was relieved from IDSA on 30.09.2003, and her LPC had been issued,

and after the intervening holidays, i.e., on 1st and 2nd October, 2003, she

had joined on 03.10.2003 on the post of Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of

India with R-1-NSCS, which had later been Gazette notified. A true copy

of the applicant's LPC dated 29.09.2003 issued by IDSA was submitted

as Annexure A-26 (Page 256 of the paper book) which had in para 4

stated that she had handed over the charge of her Office in IDSA on 30th

September, 2013.

56. It was further submitted by the applicant that she had all along

been under the impression that her eligibility for the post of Deputy

Secretary was reckoned under Clause 12 (iii) of NSCS RRs of 2001, by

reckoning her total Group 'A' service of 9 years with IDSA, also as

qualifying service, and it is now only that the respondents have stated in

their counter reply that she had been appointed not on the basis of her 9

years of Group 'A' Service in IDSA, but only because she was holding
OA No.3963/2014

analogous post in IDSA, and it has further been admitted by the

respondents that they had treated her as holding the analogous post of

Research Fellow with IDSA on regular basis on the date of appointment,

and, therefore, they could not allege any gap in her appointment, and in

the light of the letter dated 23.04.2003, and the NOC given by the IDSA,

she was bound to be treated as a candidate nominated by IDSA, and,

thus, entitled for her reckoning of her past service in IDSA.

57. It was further submitted that the respondents have now only

revealed that they had reckoned her two spells of service with them, i.e.,

deputation from 16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, and contract service from

03.10.2003 to 28.09.2006, i.e., a total of 5 years of service, to consider

her eligibility for the post of Director, and when this is seen in the light of

Clause 12 (ii) of the NSCS RRs 2001, it can only mean that the

respondents had treated the 5 years' period of her service with them, first

on deputation from IDSA, and then on contract, as regular service, and

they cannot now deny that to have been regular service. It was further

submitted that since the respondents have admitted to have treated the

applicant's previous service in IDSA since May 1994 as well as NSCS

service with them as regular service, she has to be held to be entitled to

all benefits, including absorption with R-1-NSCS w.e.f. 03.10.2003, and,

therefore, eligible for consideration for promotion to the post of Joint

Secretary as on 29.09.2009, or the applicable cut off date fixed as per

rules after the said date.
OA No.3963/2014

58. It was reiterated that though the respondents' orders (Annexure A-

2 to A-3) are supposedly based on internal consultation with DoP&T and

Ministry of Law, but on the basis of incorrect and half baked facts, and

are contrary to the respondents' own conduct vis-a-vis other officers, and

its RRs, as well as against the settled law. It was reiterated that

respondents have already promoted three officers by reckoning their

contract service as regular service, but had denied to her similar

treatment in respect of her appointment w.e.f. 03.10.2003 to the post of

Deputy Secretary on similar contract basis, and also her further

promotion vide appointment letter dated 29.09.2006 to the post of

Director, both of which were proper appointments in the civil posts, duly

notified in the Gazette of India. It was submitted that the applicant's

contract of appointment was not a proper contract, under the
Contract

Act
, but was subject to CCS Rules, and the applicant had all along

enjoyed the appropriate status, which was extended to her, and

continued unilaterally by the Govt. of India.

59. It was further submitted that her previous employment under IDSA

was also as per the RRs of IDSA, against the permanent vacant posts,

and it was wrong to state that her appointment dated 17.05.1994 in

IDSA against a Group 'A' post of Research Officer was on contract basis,

as, rather, it was a regular appointment, and was regulated by CCS

Rules. It was submitted that though it was labelled as temporary initially

for two years, upon successful completion of the probation period of one

year, it was later continued, and the applicant had even earned her

promotion also in the regular course, in the higher pay scale of
OA No.3963/2014

Rs.12000-18000, which was the promotion methodology in IDSA, and

she was also granted all benefits attached to the higher pay scale and

annual increments. It was submitted that as on 16.08.2000, when she

was deputed to work with NSCS for a 2 years' period, the applicant was

working in IDSA on a Group 'A' post of Research Fellow in the pay scale

of Rs.12000-18000. It was submitted that IDSA being a sister

organization of NSCS, it is a common practice in between both these

organizations to depute officers to each other. In that process, the R-1

NSCS had first taken her on deputation against the post of Deputy

Secretary, Govt. of India w.e.f. 16.08.2000, in the same pay scale as in

IDSA, and she had served with NSCS for more than two years, till

27.09.2002, and such deputation appointment was made in compliance

of the NSCS RRs of 2001, which provided for

deputation/contract/absorption/re-employment as being the only modes

of appointment in NSCS, and stating that R-1 NSCS had taken her

services from IDSA on 'loan basis' was a travesty of justice.

60. It was further submitted that the respondent No.1 NSCS's reply

creates a false impression as if she had resigned her Group 'A'

appointment with IDSA without any reasons whatsoever, as if she was

wandering about, when on 03.10.2003 R-1 NSCS had suddenly

appointed her on the post of Deputy Secretary to the Government of

India. It was reiterated that once she had returned from her first

deputation with NSCS to IDSA, the superior officers in R-1-NSCS had

initiated the process for her substantive appointment in NSCS against

the permanent vacant post of Deputy Secretary, as per its RRs. The
OA No.3963/2014

recruitment process undertaken had included a written test, and an

interview, both of which were held in May, 2003, and the applicant had

successfully qualified. When only the formal approval of her

appointment on the said post in the office of R-1-NSCS was under

process, she was asked to resign from IDSA, and to be ready to join the

respondent R-1-NSCS's office.

61. It was further reiterated that though the applicant had tendered

her resignation from IDSA on 08.08.2003, but she continued to serve

IDSA till 30.09.2003, as per the service record and L.P.C. filed by her,

and she was relieved by IDSA on 30.09.2003, and after the intervening

holidays, she joined NSCS on the first available date on 03.10.2003 on

the post of Deputy Secretary. It was further submitted that the IDSA

order dated 30.09.2003, which had stated that her resignation had been

accepted w.e.f. 10.08.2003, was contrary to the L.P.C. dated 29.09.2003

(Annexure A-26), and had in fact been never delivered to her, but must

have been only kept in her personal file, which was sent to R-1 NSCS.

62. It was further reiterated that her promotion to the post of Director

was also not in question for more than 10 years, and it was now only

that the R-1 NSCS had started acting in a foul manner, to make a case of

break in her continuous service, in order to be able to decline her request

for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary. It was submitted that the

stand of R-1-NSCS was inconsistent with the fact that she was not only

on rolls of IDSA till 30.09.2003 as mentioned above, but also, as late as

on 14.08.2003, the IDSA had even considered her proposal for foreign

tour, and on 18.09.2003 the Director, IDSA had approved her leave
OA No.3963/2014

application dated 10.09.2003 for sanction of leave till 30.09.2003

(Annexure A-8 colly).

63. It was submitted that though in the matters of appointments, R-1

NSCS has been exempted from the purview of UPSC and DoP&T, but the

RRs (Annexure A-12 & A-16) provide for peculiar manner of making

appointments, i.e., only by modes of contract/deputation/absorption/

re-employment for the permanent Group 'A' posts, by searching for the

suitable persons in a discreet manner. For promotions to higher posts

also, the same mode is adopted, though a fresh contract of appointment

is issued, while treating the same as promotion for all purposes. It was

pleaded that it was only because of this that the R-1 NSCS had rightly

treated the applicant's appointment dated 29.09.2006 on the post of

Director as promotion, thus supporting her submission that her initial

appointment dated 03.10.2003 itself was in the nature of a regular

appointment, entitling her to all service benefits, and career progression.

64. It was further submitted that the Government of India's order dated

27.09.2011 (Annexure A-17) purportedly extending her contract

appointment as Director for a period of one more year, w.e.f. 29.09.2011

to 28.09.21012, on the existing terms and conditions, was issued in

exercise of its unilateral powers, on which the applicant has no control.

It was, therefore, prayed that both her initial appointment as Deputy

Secretary, as well as her promotion to the post of Director, were in the

nature of regular appointments.

65. It was later on only, through the new RRs 2007, that in the

eligibility conditions the words 'total continuous service' were inserted in
OA No.3963/2014

place of 'total service'. It was further submitted that respondents have

not correctly quoted the RRs in respect of appointments to the posts of

Joint Secretary, which had actually been produced by her by way of

Annexure A-16 (at page 80 of the paper-book of the OA). It was

submitted that since the R-1 NSCS is exempted from the purview of

DoP&T/UPSC/Ministry of Finance guidelines, it had been taking its own

decisions in an arbitrary manner, and in the cases of R-2 Shri

Murlidharan Pillai and R-3 Miss Shweta Bakshi etc., they were

regularized with their past contract service being reckoned for the

purposes of promotion, without any reference to DoP&T or Law Ministry,

and that the R-1 NSCS is now bound by its own precedents.

66. It was denied by the applicant that her employment with IDSA was

only on contract basis throughout, and it was submitted that like other

similarly placed employees, she would also have been eligible for pension

under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, if she had continued in the IDSA. It

was further submitted that it was wrong on the part of the respondents

to say that as per the Guidelines for recruitment of officers in R-1-NSCS,

absorption can only be done "in rare cases", and after completion of a

minimum tenure of five years in NSCS in an outstanding manner, which

Guidelines are not at all in existence, and which have not been adhered

to by the R-1-NSCS in the past, and that the private respondent R-2 was

admittedly not only absorbed in violation of those very Guidelines, cited,

but not produced, but he has even been allowed to steal a march over

her.
OA No.3963/2014

67. It was further submitted that only when she started asking for her

further promotion, and consideration of her case for the post of Joint

Secretary, that the respondents had acted maliciously, and with bias,

and had illegally issued an order dated 20.10.2014, ostensibly trying to

correct their order dated 29.09.2006 issued eight years' back, just to be

able to deprive her of her legal rights, and, therefore, the said order dated

20.10.2014 is non-est in the eyes of law, and has to be discarded,

because changing the words 'promotion' to 'selection' in the order dated

06.10.2006 after a gap of more than eight years, through order dated

20.10.2014, is nothing but a mala fide attempt to deprive her of her legal

rights.

68. The contention of the respondent No.1-NSCS that her previous

deputation from IDSA to R-1-NSCS was 'on loan basis' was denied, on

the basis of Annexure R-3 of the counter reply, wherein it has been

clearly stated that she was deputed for a period of one year from

16.08.2000 and during the period of her deputation she was to draw her

pay and allowances from R-1-NSCS. It was further submitted that the

respondents have admitted that she was already holding an analogous

post in IDSA, and that her candidature for appointment had been

considered by treating her holding the analogous post of Research Fellow

in IDSA on regular basis. Therefore, all the averments of the respondent

No.R-1-NSCS, denying her the benefit of 09 years' Group 'A' service in

IDSA, by taking the plea that it was on contract basis, were termed by

her to be wrong.
OA No.3963/2014

69. It was submitted that respondents have made a new revelation that

the basis of her appointment to the post of Director on 29.09.2006 was

her service with them in the grade of Deputy Secretary for five years, in

two spells, of working on contract, i.e., firstly while on deputation from

IDSA from 16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, and secondly for three years of her

holding the regular post of Deputy Secretary, in NSCS since 03.10.2003.

It was, therefore, submitted that from this, it is apparent that the R-1-

NSCS had in 2006 itself treated the applicant having rendered five years

of regular service with them in the grade of Rs.12000-16500/-, only on

basis of which she was found to be qualified for appointment to the post

of Director in NSCS. Therefore, after having treated her deputation from

IDSA with R-1-NSCS, and later service, though called as contract service,

as regular service with NSCS for the purpose of her being qualified for

appointment to the post of Director, now, at this stage, they cannot be

allowed to take a turn, and deny to her the eligibility for the post of Joint

Secretary, by reckoning her appointment dated 29.09.2006 as Director

not as a regular appointment, and considering her to be eligible for being

considered for the post of Joint Secretary on completion of her three

years' tenure on 29.09.2009, in terms of 2007 RRs.

70. It was further submitted by the applicant that when the

respondents had on 03.10.2003 considered her to have held analogous

post in IDSA in the past, now that past service in an analogous post in

IDSA cannot be discarded, due to an alleged break in service, which was

not true. It was submitted that respondents have acted in a mala fide

manner, and when she had first represented, and then served a legal
OA No.3963/2014

notice also claiming her rights, on the basis of the order dated

06.10.2006, which clearly stated that her appointment to the post of

Director w.e.f. 29.09.2006 was on promotion, the respondent No.1-NSCS

had no choice but to consider her candidature for the post of Joint

Secretary, and just to deliberately deny her that, they had acted with

bias, and had attempted to tamper with that order in the year 2014,

more than 08 years later, and had now amended their order of

06.10.2006, which was patently illegal, and that the said amended order

has to be held to be an invalid order. It was further submitted that the

respondents have not denied the correctness and the applicability of the

ratio of the Hon'ble Apex Court's judgment on the issue of continuous

service, and the fallacy of respondent No.1-NSCS 's plea regarding an

alleged break in service.

71. It was reiterated by the applicant in her rejoinder that she had

become eligible for the post of Joint Secretary in October, 2011 itself, on

completion of five years' of regular service as Director. The cases of the

private respondents were, therefore, once again described by the

applicant in her own manner, which we shall discuss and appreciate in

an appropriate manner later. Particularly in the case of private

respondent R-4 Shri Rohit Khera, the applicant had reiterated that it was

an admitted case of the respondents that he had throughout worked at

the residence of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, as Comptroller, in the grade

of a Deputy Secretary, and that he had never been promoted on the post

of Joint Secretary through any orders of DoP&T or ACC for such
OA No.3963/2014

promotion. It was further submitted that, therefore, his appointment in

R-1-NSCS itself was in violation of NSCS RRs, as there is no provision for

creating any vacancy through the permanent transfer of a post, as stated

by R-1-NSCS, nor can an officer be said to be holding the post of Joint

Secretary merely because he draws salary which falls in that pay scale.

It was submitted that though he had already attained the normal age of

superannuation, but till date he was still working on the post of

Additional Secretary in NSCS.

72. The applicant had thereafter cited the Hon'ble Delhi High Court's

judgment in the case of
Juliana Loieau v. British High Commission
,[

2012 (130) DRJ 552] in which it had been held that the origin of every

service of employment is an offer and its acceptance, which amounts to a

contract, but when pursuant to such a contract the employment

assumes a status akin to services under the Union and the States, and

where the Statutes like
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
, etc. intervene, or

where the service is statutorily regulated, then it can be argued that the

conditions of service would be governed by terms beyond the letter of

offer, on terms whereof the appointment had been offered. Therefore, it

was submitted by the applicant that since all the CCS Rules were made

applicable to her after her accepting the offer of appointment, and the

contract to define since the conditions of service went much beyond the

letter of offer, on terms whereof the appointment was offered to her, and

such rules were made applicable, her contractual employment assumed

a status akin to services under the Union and the States.
OA No.3963/2014

73. Because the respondents have admitted that the terms and

conditions as mentioned in the contract were nothing but prescribing the

application or otherwise of the statutory rules, which may be framed and

altered unilaterally by the Government without the consent of the

employee, it was submitted by the applicant that that being so the

contract appointment also fell within the provisions of
Articles 309
and
of the Constitution of India. It was further submitted that the

respondents had not denied that the law as
laid down in

Roshan Lal

Tandon v. Union of India
(supra) and UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal

Baghela (supra) would apply, more so because she had been appointed

as per the RRs in vogue, and was also held to be entitled to all benefits of

regular appointments. It was, therefore, submitted that the respondent

R-1-NSCS's reply to the OA is false and baseless, and the averments

made in the OA were reiterated.

74. In order to counter the detailed rejoinder submitted by the

applicant, the official respondent R-1-NSCS filed a sur-rejoinder on

30.06.2015 denying that any discrimination or bias had been meted out

to the applicant, as alleged. It was also denied that the DoP&T had

termed the RRs of R-1-NSCS as vague, and it was submitted that DoP&T

had only made certain observations in regard to the length of service in

the lower grade prescribed for appointment as Joint Secretary, and had,

therefore, asked for clarification/validation in consultation with the

Ministry of Law & Justice, Department of Legal Affairs. It was submitted

that the Ministry of Law & Justice had thereafter found the provision of
OA No.3963/2014

17 years' of continuous Group 'A' Service as correct for promotion to the

post of Joint Secretary.

75. It was further submitted in this sur-rejoinder that NSCS is

exempted from consultation with UPSC only, and wherever required,

advice and approval of DoP&T, Ministry of Finance etc. is obtained in

various matters, including recruitment.

76. It was further submitted that while reviewing the RRs of 2001, it

was found that there was no provision for career progression of contract

officers of R-1-NSCS who, could only be absorbed based on their

outstanding performance, and, therefore, in the RRs of 2007 the clause

regarding 'Promotion' was added, in order to benefit such exceptional

officers who would otherwise have stagnated, and that the revised RRs of

2007 were issued with the approval of Hon'ble Prime Minister, DoP&T

and Ministry of Law & Justice. The DoP&T opinion, as already mentioned

in the counter-reply, was thereafter repeated. They had once again

explained the cases of R-2 Shri Murlidharan Pillai, and R-3 Miss Shweta

Bakshi.

77. It was further submitted that after her selection for appointment to

NSCS, the applicant was asked to obtain a 'No Objection Certificate' from

her the then employer, IDSA, stating that they have no objection to NSCS

in considering her candidature, and that she would be relieved and sent

on deputation in the event of her selection. However, since she could not

obtain the requisite NOC from IDSA for her appointment to R-1-NSCS on

deputation basis, therefore, she had resigned from IDSA, and had also

availed all terminal benefits, including encashment of leave, from that
OA No.3963/2014

office, and it is incorrect of her to say that she had submitted the

requisite NOC from the IDSA.

78. Her contention with regard to her appointment with IDSA having

continued till 30.09.2003 was thereafter once again denied, and it was

submitted that even the LPC issued by the IDSA on 29.09.2003

(Annexure A.26) is not relevant, as she had joined NSCS on a fresh

appointment, on contract basis, after resigning from IDSA, and availing

all terminal benefits. However, at the same time, it was admitted that

she was holding an analogous post in IDSA on contract basis, because of

which her candidature was considered, and she was appointed as

Deputy Secretary in NSCS on contract basis w.e.f. 03.10.2003.

79. It was further reiterated by R-1-NSCS that though in the order of

her appointment as Director issued in 2006, the word 'Promotion' had

been included inadvertently, but the same order had also mentioned that

her appointment was on the terms and conditions of service as laid down

in the agreement of contract, and even her pay was fixed at the minimum

of the pay scale of Director, and since the word "promotion" had been

wrongly mentioned, that has since been modified on 20.10.2014,

through Annexure R-13. It was further submitted that her appointment

with IDSA was on contract basis as per her service records at Annexure

R-2 and R-3 of the counter-reply of R-1-NSCS, which also goes to show

that she had joined NSCS earlier "on loan basis", and not on deputation

basis, and that she was relieved from IDSA w.e.f. 10.08.2003, and she

had joined R-1 NSCS on 03.10.2003. Her contentions in regard to the
OA No.3963/2014

period in between, and that she was considered by IDSA for a foreign

tour, or was sanctioned leave etc. were termed to be misleading, and not

supported by any proper orders issued by the IDSA.

80. It was further submitted that appointing a person on contract/re-

employment, as per RRs, against a regular post, does not bestow upon

the incumbent the status of a regular Government servant, when the

RRs themselves have a provision to appoint an individual on contract

basis on those posts. All other averments, as already discussed in detail

while discussing the counter-reply earlier filed were repeated. The

averments made by the applicant in respect of handling of cases of the

private respondents were also denied. An attempt was made by R-1-

NSCS to argue the specific cases of private respondents, particularly that

of R-4 Mr. Rohit Khera, which approach itself is per se impermissible as

per law.

81. It was denied that irrespective of the mode of appointment, all

officers are entitled to be at par in the matter of service, seniority and

career progression. It was submitted that the officers of R-1-NSCS are

appointed through various different modes, as prescribed in the RRs

(earlier 2001 RRs, and now 2007 RRs), and they are all governed by

either the Central Civil Service Rules, or All India Service Rules etc., and,

therefore, the officers who have been appointed on contract basis, or on

re-employment basis, cannot be treated at par in respect of matters

relating to seniority and promotion, since the question of maintaining a

single seniority list of such appointees, and promoting them to the next
OA No.3963/2014

higher grade, arises only after they have been absorbed, and that the

seniority and promotions in respect of officers on deputation with R-1-

NSCS is taken care of by their respective Cadre Controlling Authorities.

Therefore, it was again prayed that the OA be dismissed with costs

against the applicant.

82. All the four private respondents filed their separate counter-replies

also. Private respondents R-2 to R-5 had in their written submissions

dated 22.01.2016 submitted that they are not inclined to file any

separate reply in the matter, and would adopt the counter-reply already

filed by R-1-NSCS in the aforesaid OA. With this the pleadings were

completed.

83. Heard. As already mentioned above, the case was argued in great

detail on two dates of hearing. Thereafter, the learned counsels also

submitted written submissions of their arguments. In the written

submissions filed on behalf of the applicant, most of the arguments as

advanced, along the lines of the OA and the rejoinder, were reiterated.

It was further submitted that her previous Employer IDSA had actually

forwarded her application for the post of Deputy Secretary with R-1

NSCS along with NOC itself, but, during the course of recruitment

process of written test and interview conducted in August 2003, the R-1

NSCS had asked her to submit resignation from IDSA, if she was ready

to join to the post of Deputy Secretary on a permanent basis. It was

submitted that the applicant is a renowned research scholar, and she

was assured by R-1-NSCS that though her appointment was being made
OA No.3963/2014

against a permanent sanctioned vacant post, initially the appointment

order would be only for a contract of two years, and she was further

assured that it was akin to regular appointment, along with reasoning

given that the R-1-NSCS's RRs provide for appointment only through

the modes of contract for new entrants, or otherwise on deputation for

temporary appointments, absorption and re-employment etc. It was

submitted that she had been further assured that she would be

absorbed/given regular status from the initial date of her joining itself,

by maintaining the seniority, as well as reckoning her past service in

IDSA.

84. It was further reiterated that her appointment, which was Gazette

notified also, came to be regulated under
Articles 309
to 313 of the

Constitution of India, and that she was even treated at par with regular

Govt. Officers in the matters of Leave, LTC, Leave Salary, Travelling

Allowances and all other entitlements/improvements sanctioned

subsequently, as per DoP&T order dated 12.04.1985. It was further

submitted that the fixity of tenure under the contract of appointment

signed by her on 03.10.2003 was neither the essence of that contract,

nor substantial to that contract, and that she had continued to be in

service without any fresh contract being signed, merely by R-1-NSCS

issuing administrative orders extending her tenure, and giving her the

benefit of seniority/pay protection/increments.

85. It was further submitted that even though her appointment Order

as Director stated such appointment to be on contractual basis for a
OA No.3963/2014

period of 5 years, it incorporated all the service conditions akin to regular

appointments, and was also on a permanent sanctioned and vacant post,

and was made by fully following the then prevailing RRs, and the word

'Promotion' had been correctly used, since it is settled law that promotion

is an incidence of regular appointment. Her contention again was that all

along she was under the impression that she has been selected under

Clause 12 (iii) of the RRs for the post of Deputy Secretary, which

impression has been shattered now only by the respondent No.1 NSCS

stating on record that she was selected under Clause 12 (i) of the RRs, by

treating her to have held analogous post on regular basis in her earlier

parent organization-IDSA. Further, it was submitted that when for the

purpose of counting the service requirement of 5 years for considering

her case for promotion as a Director, the respondents had even counted

her first deputation tenure with them (during her substantive

appointment with IDSA) from 18.08.2000 to 27.09.2002, and had added

to that the three years' contract tenure on the post of Deputy Secretary

with them from 03.10.2003 to 28.09.2006, the respondents cannot be

allowed to make a 'U' turn now, and to state that her appointment with

her previous Employer IDSA, as well as her appointment with R-1 NSCS

on the post of Deputy Secretary, and also on the post of Director, were

never on regular service, when this Tribunal had in the case of Dr. S.D.

Pradhan vs. NSCS (supra) already held that since during the period of

his contract employment, Dr. Pradhan had been given several

promotions, his contract employment was as good as the regular

employment, since fixity of tenure was never indicated in the

appointment on contract basis, and was not adhered to also.
She had
OA No.3963/2014

sought shelter behind the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in

Roshan Lal Tandon vs. Union of India
(supra) followed in the case of

UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal Baghela (supra).

86. It was further submitted that when the R-1 NSCS had already

admitted her past service with them (when she was an employee in IDSA,

and was on deputation with them) in NSCS as regular service while

considering her case for appointing/promoting her as Director, the

intention and purpose behind the impugned order dated 12.04.2012

could not be elicited. Further reliance has been placed upon the Hon'ble

Apex Court judgment in
DTC vs. DTC Mazdoor Union
(1991) 1 Suppl.

SCC 600, and, in particulars paragraphs-223 to 225 and Para 264 of

that judgment, which were reproduced in the written arguments

submitted.

87. It was, therefore, reiterated that she is entitled to fair and just

treatment with regard to her mode of appointment by absorption, and

maintenance of her seniority over private respondent R-2. All other

arguments, as already discussed, were reiterated, and it was submitted

that if her Group 'A' service with IDSA is counted to compute 17 years of

Group 'A' service, even counting the alleged gap of 01 month and 22

days, if not on 04.05.2011, she would have completed her 17 years of

eligible experience at least on 26.06.2011, and, therefore, she should be

considered eligible for the post of Joint Secretary as on 01.07.2011, as

normally 1st of July is the cut off date for consideration of eligibility for

promotions in R-1-NSCS.
OA No.3963/2014

88. It was further submitted that the alleged break in her continuous

service, a point which has been introduced by the respondents now only,

is an afterthought, discriminatory and baseless, and without any

meaning, and on the question of continuous service, reliance had once

again been placed upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of
Banaras Hindu University Varanasi and Another vs. Dr.

Indra Pratap Singh
(supra).

89. It was reiterated that she was actually and factually relieved from

the IDSA only on 30.09.2003, and had then joined on the post of Deputy

Secretary with R-1-NSCS on the very next available working day, on

03.10.2003, and that there was no break in her continuous Group 'A'

service, and merely because IDSA had passed an order behind her back,

stating that she had been relieved retrospectively w.e.f. 10.08.2003, on a

genuine error of overlooking her sanctioned leave upto 30.09.2003, the

same cannot be raised as a ground to deny her continuity of service. The

cases of the private respondents were once again discussed, which need

not be repeated here once again.

90. In their written submissions, the respondent R-1-NSCS had once

again denied the eligibility of the applicant for her absorption from the

back date, i.e., on 03.10.2003, and the aspects of gap of 01 month and

22 days, and her availing of all terminal benefits, leave encashment etc.

from IDSA were again mentioned. It was further reiterated that even

though the applicant has claimed weightage of her past service rendered

by her in IDSA, but since the DoP&T has opined that no such counting of
OA No.3963/2014

her past service is permissible, since that service was rendered on

contract basis, and not on regular basis, and it cannot now be taken into

account for counting of 17 years' continuous regular service. The

applicant's contention regarding the order promoting her w.e.f.

29.09.2006 as Director was again denied, stating that the RRs of 2001

had no provision for promotion, which promotion had been included only

in the revised RRs effective from 22.12.2007, and, therefore, it could not

be held that she was promoted in 2006 as a Director, which was actually

only a fresh contract appointment, and that the office order dated

06.10.2006, containing the word 'Promotion', already stood rectified vide

order dated 20.10.2014 (Annexure R-13). It was, therefore, submitted

that the applicant does not at all fulfil the eligibility criteria of 17 years of

continuous Group 'A' Service, which is required for consideration of her

case for the post of Joint Secretary. The individual cases of private

respondents were thereafter once again discussed, which need not be

repeated here once again.

DISCUSSION ON THE POINTS OF LAW INVOLVED

91. After having heard the case in great detail, we have given our

anxious consideration to the facts and law concerning the instant case.

The first thing which has to be decided is about the nature of

employment into which the applicant had entered with R-1 NSCS from

03.10.2003. It is an admitted fact from both sides that her selection for

that post was done as per the NSCS RRs of 2001 then in vogue for

appointments to the posts of Deputy Secretaries of R-1 NSCS. The

applicant has claimed that it was a regular and substantive
OA No.3963/2014

appointment, even though it was given effect to by way of her signing a

contract for a period of two years, which was in the nature of an

agreement, a copy of which has been produced by the applicant at

Annexure A-10 of her OA.

92. It is seen that para-2 of that supposed contract agreement provided

for that she may be required to devote her whole time to the duties

assigned to her, and that she should at all times obey the Rules,

including the Central Government Servants' (Conduct) Rules. Para-3 (iii)

of that agreement even provided for 3 months' notice being required from

either side for termination of that agreement, or 3 months' salary in lieu

of notice from the side of the Government. Para-4 provided that in case

of any misconduct by her, the applicant could be suspended. Para-5

provided for the scale of pay, DA, CCA etc. at the rates admissible under

the Central Government Rules. Para-6 provided for the applicant being

eligible to leave and leave salary etc. in terms of DoP&T OM dated

12.04.1985. Para-7 provided for the applicant to be entitled to Travelling

Allowance in terms of Rules supplementary to Fundamental Rules. Para-

8 provided for her being entitled to receive the benefits of any

improvement in the terms and conditions of her service. Para-9 provided

for her pay and leave salary to be subject to any emergency cut that may

be ordered by the Government. Para-10 provided for the provisions of

CCS (CCA) Rules, and Rules made thereunder, and any Rules made and

deemed to be made under
Article 309
or continued under
Article 313
of

the Constitution to the extent to which they are applicable to the service,

which she was joining, being applicable to her. That agreement had been
OA No.3963/2014

signed by the applicant and an existing Deputy Secretary, NSCS, and an

Under Secretary being her two witnesses, and the Joint Secretary Dr.

S.D. Pradhan signing on behalf of President of India, with his signatures

also being witnessed and attested by the very same Deputy Secretary and

Under Secretary, as witnesses on his behalf, who were the attesting

witnesses of the witnesses of the applicant also. There were no

independent/different witnesses who had attested to have been

witnessed to the signatures affixed first by the applicant, and then by the

said Joint Secretary, Dr. S.D. Pradhan, to that supposed contractual

agreement.

93. The Gazette Notification at Annexure A-11 had clearly stated that

the President is pleased to appoint the applicant as Deputy Secretary,

NSCS, for a period of two years, or until further orders, whichever is

earlier, and that Notification published in the Gazette of India Part-1

Section-2
did not have any cross reference or mention of such

appointment being subject to an appointment agreement (Annexure A-

10). This Gazette Notification, therefore, was the last nail in the coffin of

the supposed contract agreement signed on 03.10.2003 by the applicant

and a Joint Secretary of NSCS, in the absence of any independent

different witnesses attesting to the veracity of the agreement having been

signed by the applicant out of her own free will.

94. It is trite law that any appointment is given effect to by an employer

through an offer of appointment, which, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in "
Roshan Lal Tandon
" (supra), is in the nature of contract
OA No.3963/2014

employment. Like in every contract, even in the case of a contract for

public employment, the offer of appointment made to a candidate sought

to be employed, and his/her acceptance of that offer, form the basis of

his/her appointment, enabling him to join against the post for which

he/she had been selected. Such an appointment is made against a

vacancy, and in a post, and this positive and deliberate act of

engagement creates a relationship of an employee and the employer in

between the two parties, and is the starting point in the career of every

public servant in public employment.

Such appointment confers a

status, and ensures all the rights attached to public service, including

confirmation, seniority, promotion and so on. It was held by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in "
Roshan Lal Tandon
" (supra), that once appointed to

his post or office, the Government Servant acquires an status, and his

rights and obligations are no longer determined by the consent of both

parties, but by statute or statutory rules, though these rules may be

framed and altered unilaterally by the Government.

95. As has been held by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in

the case of
Basant Lal Malhotra vs. State of Punjab & Ors.
AIR 1969

(P&H) 178, an appointment means an actual act of posting a person to a

particular office.

The same position of law was later upheld by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Prafulla Kumar Swain vs.

Prakash Chandra Misra & Others
1993 SCC (L&S) 960, when it was

held that an appointment means an actual act of posting a person to a
OA No.3963/2014

particular office, and anything short of it cannot be construed as an

appointment.

96. On the other hand, the law is also very well settled in respect of a

purely contractual employment. An employment can also be purely in

the nature of contractual employment, and, unless it is governed by a

statute or Statutory Rules, it was held that the
Indian Contract Act

would not only be applicable to the formulation of the contract, as also to

the determination thereof, as was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

the case of
Bank of India vs. O.P. Swarankar
AIR 2003 SC 858=(2003)

2 SCC 721.

97. However, the concomitants of a purely contractual employment

with the Government were most clearly explained and
laid down by
the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal

Baghela (supra), which the applicant has produced at Annexure A-23 of

her OA. In that judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was dealing with

the case of a person who was appointed as a Drugs Inspector purely on

ad hoc or contractual basis, and that appointment was meant to come to

an end automatically, with the efflux of time, after which the person

holding that contractual appointment/post was not to have any right to

continue in that post, even though the concerned person may have been

continued from time to time on similar ad hoc basis, beyond the initially

prescribed contractual period. In that case, it was held by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court that when a person is employed purely under a contract,

it is only that the contract alone which would govern the terms of

appointment of such contractual employee in respect of his service, and
OA No.3963/2014

not the rules framed under
Article 309
of the Constitution, governing the

process of selection and conditions of service to the post on which he was

employed.

98. In the instant case before us, it is not so. Both the sides are ad-

idem on the point that the process of selection of the applicant was

conducted as per the RRs of the year 2001 as applicable for the post

concerned, and that it was not as if she had been randomly picked up for

appointment only for a limited period. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court had in the above cited judgment "U.P.S.C. vs. Girish Jayantilal

Baghela (supra) laid down the tests which distinguish a purely

contractual employment from a regular and substantive employment. It

was found by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the respondent in that

case did not have any right to continue as Drugs Inspector after expiry of

the six months' period, for which alone he had been initially appointed.

His contractual appointment for the six months' period was de hors all

the Rules, and, in particular, the RRs for the posts of Drug Inspectors

had not been followed in making his selection for that six months'

contractual appointment period. It was, therefore, held by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court that his appointment was not made in a manner which

could even remotely be said to have complied with the requirements as

laid down under
Article 16
of the Constitution. Therefore, his

appointment being purely contractual, it was held that the stage of his

acquiring the status of a Government servant had never arrived.
OA No.3963/2014

99. When we apply those tests to the instant case, it is seen that the

actual Gazette Notification, issued in the name of the President, through

Annexure A-11 dated 08.12.2003, which was published in the Gazette of

India Part-1
Section-2
, had in every manner conferred upon the

applicant the status of the holder of a Gezetted civil post, and that

Notification had been issued without any reference to the "agreement"

(not a "contract"), which the respondents had made her sign on

03.10.2003, as per Annexure A-10 of the OA. In fact both Annexures A-

10 and A-14 have been titled as "Agreement", & have not at all

mentioned to be in the nature of a "Contract". Therefore, it is clear that

in the instant case the applicant had acquired the status of a Gazetted

Government servant from day one, i.e., 03.10.2003, the day she joined

the R-1-NSCS as a Deputy Secretary. All the arguments of the R-1-NSCS

to the contrary, which had been adopted in toto by the private

respondents R-2 to R-5 also are, therefore, rejected as being without any

legal basis whatsoever.

100. Enumerating the concomitants of a contract in the case of UPSC

vs. Girish Jayantilal Baghela (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had

noticed that:-

i) While working as a contractual employee, the respondent was
not governed by the relevant Service Rules;

ii) That the respondent did not enjoy even the privilege of
availing casual or earned leave.

iii) That the respondent was not entitled to avail the benefit of
General Provident Fund
OA No.3963/2014

iv) Nor was the respondent entitled to any pension (which are
normal incidents of a Government service).

v) It was also noticed by the Supreme Court that the respondent
could neither be placed under suspension, entitling him to a
subsistence allowance,

vi) Nor could the respondent be transferred anywhere in India.

vii) It was further notified that some of the minor penalties, which
can be inflicted on a Government servant, while they continue
to be in Government service could also not be imposed upon,
the respondent of that case; and

viii) Lastly, he was not entitled to any protection under
Article 311

of the Constitution.

101. Testing the present applicant's case on the touchstone of

these eight concomitants of a purely contractual appointment, bereft of

any status as a Government servant, the case of the present applicant

certainly cannot be held to be that of having been only a contractual

employee of the respondent No.1 NSCS, because of the very nature of the

process of her appointment, and her acquiring the status of holder of a

Gazetted civil post, which was duly Gazette notified through the Gazette

Notification 08.12.2003 (Annexure A-11), which itself was sufficient to

bring her case totally beyond the status of "a purely contractual

employee", as was the case in the case of UPSC vs. Girish Jayantilal

Baghela (supra), and more particularly so because the Gazette

Notification nowhere mentioned her employment to have been made on

contractual basis.

102. It is also clear that she had been recruited through the due process

as prescribed under the RRs 2001, that she was not randomly picked up

from the streets, that she was considered to be already holding an

analogous post in IDSA, that she was subject to all the Service Rules &
OA No.3963/2014

Regulations, as well as entitled to all protections under
Article 309
to 313

of the Constitution, that she was entitled to take Casual Leave as well as

leave of all other kinds as applicable to the Central Govt. employees; that

she could have been placed under suspension, and would then have been

entitled to Subsistence Allowance; that she could have been transferred

or deputed on duty, or on tour anywhere in India, and any disciplinary

action could have been taken against her.

103. Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has in the case of
Satish

Chandra Anand vs. Union of India
, AIR 1953 SC 250 held that State

can enter into contracts of temporary employment and impose special

terms in each case, provided they are not inconsistent with the

Constitution, and those who chose to accept those terms and enter into

the contract are bound by them, even as the State is bound. Here, in the

instant case, there was no "Contract" as such, but only an "Agreement"

binding down the applicant to all Service Rules & Regulations etc., none

of which were inconsistent with the Constitution. Therefore, in turn, the

State, being the Govt. of India here, was also bound by the status

conferred upon the applicant by them after such appointment.

104.
In the case of Manager, M/s.
Pyarchand Kesarimal Porwal Bidi

Factory vs. Onkar Laxman Thenge
, 1969 (2) SCR 272: AIR 1970 SC

823, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that a subsisting contract of

service with one master is a bar to service with any other master unless

the contract otherwise provides, or the master consents. A contract of

employment involving personal service is incapable of transfer.
OA No.3963/2014

Therefore, after the R-1 NSCS had secured its relationship of being the

applicant's Master by asking her to come and join her services with them

after serving her earlier Employer-Employee relationship with the IDSA, it

cannot now be allowed to shirk from its responsibilities after having

stepped into the shoes of being the applicant's Master, and deny any

Employer-Employee relationship, which is much different than that in

the case of purely contractual employees.

105. The position of civil service and civil servants is different in U.K.

Law and the Indian Law. Regarding the U.K. Law of Crown Service, in

the Commentary on Administrative Law by the Late Sir William Wade as

per the 11th Edition, 2014, Edited by H.W.R. Wade & C.E.F. Forsyth, the

following legal position prevailing in U.K. may be mentioned:

"The Law of Crown Service

Nature of Crown Service

Crown service is one of the most curious departments of public
law. In most other democratic countries the position and rights
of state employees from an important branch of administrative
law, and the tenure of posts in the civil service gives rise to many
questions for the courts, whether they be ordinary courts of law
or special administrative courts. In England the position is
different. The civil service despite its great size and importance,
is largely staffed and regulated under arrangements which are
legally anomalous. It has generally been held that at common law
civil servants of the Crown, and military servants also, have no
legal right to their salaries and no legal protection against
wrongful dismissal. Although recently the picture has changed
substantially, the law has long regarded the civil service as if it
still consisted of a handful of secretaries working behind the
scenes in a royal palace. Although it has lost its domestic
character in every other respect, it is still in a primitive state of
legal evolution.

Another paradox is that in practice the situation is just the
opposite of what these legal rules would suggest. Crown service,
though legally the most precarious employment, is in reality the
most secure. This is merely convention, but in the civil service
OA No.3963/2014

the convention is deeply ingrained, so that there are probably
better grounds for complaining that civil servants are excessively
protected than for criticising their defencelessness in law. Even
when a public inquiry reveals serious failings in the conduct of
civil servants, they are rarely dismissed.

Crown servants of all ranks are in law the servants of the Crown
and not of one another. A civil servant therefore has no
contractual rights against his department, his minister or any
superior officer. Whoever engages him acts merely as the Crown's
agent, and his contract of employment is directly between
himself (as servant) and the Crown. Any remedy must therefore
be sought against the Crown alone.

Tenure: No Protection at Common Law

The best-known decision on the legal insecurity of civil service
tenure concerned the dismissal of a consular agent in Nigeria. He
had been engaged for a term (as he said) of three years certain,
but was prematurely dismissed. He sued the Crown by petition of
right, but the Court of Appeal refused him relief, holding that it is
not competent for the Crown to tie its hands by such a contract
(with a civil servant).

The basis of the rule that Crown servants are dismissible at
pleasure, therefore, is the principle that the public interest
requires that the government should be able to disembarrass
itself of any employee at any moment. All the emphasis was on
public policy. There was no suggestion that the rule had any
connection with the royal prerogative.

The rules so laid down was followed in later decisions. Yet the
reasons put forward for this policy will not really bear
examination. Any employer can always dismiss a servant: the
only question is whether, if he does so, he should pay
damages for breach of contract. No master can be compelled
to employ a servant, any more than a servant can be
compelled to serve a master. The argument that the Crown
could not otherwise relieve the public of an undesirable servant
therefore falls to the ground., It may be said that the Crown
should not be put in the dilemma of ignoring the public interest
or else committing a breach of contract-for a breach of contract,
despite Mr. Justice Holmes's famous theory to the contract, is a
wrongful act. But to that it can be answered that it is of even
greater importance that engagements expressly entered into
should at least be honoured in the breach, if not in the
observance. The Crown should be an honest man, and if
driven to break its contract ought to pay damages, as it does for
breach of other contracts. Yet the latest decision has confirmed
that civil servants can be dismissed at will.......................".

106. But, further, while discussing the common law on powers of the

Crown, the learned Author (and Editors) had opined as follows:

"Common Law Powers of the Crown

As adumbrated, the Crown as a corporation sole has all the
powers of a natural person and may enter into contracts and
own and convey land and do all the many other things its
subjects may do (as just explained, these are sometimes
inaccurately called 'prerogative powers'). These are considerable
powers in many circumstances and they are generally exercised
by ministers on behalf of the Crown. Ministers are, of course,
responsible to parliament for their exercise and that exercise is
subject, when appropriate, to judicial review. Moreover,
elementarily, such common law powers cannot be exercised
inconsistently with a statute. Equally elementarily, the
exercise of these powers is 'circumscribed by public law'. Some
consider that it is 'illegitimate' for any exercise of power by
ministers not to rest on parliamentary authority, but the
common law powers of the Crown have existed for centuries and
have been upheld times in recent years."

(Emphasis supplied)

107. However, at the same time, while discussing the realms beyond the

law, the learned Authors opined as follows:

"Consensual submission' may not necessarily mean the
acceptance of specific contractual obligations, as opposed to
voluntary participation or activity. Contractual obligations
belong to private law, so that where the only rights asserted
are covered by such obligations, judicial review will be
refused. For this reason many commercial, social and sporting
associations will lie outside the field of public law."

(Emphasis supplied)

108. Thus, while discussing the liability of the Crown in U.K. in the case

of Contracts, the learned Authors opined that the Crown is free to make
OA No.3963/2014

contracts without statutory authority since it enjoys the power of a

natural person, they further opined that contracts of service with public

authorities rest on the same 'ordinary law' basis as other contracts,

except in the case of the Crown. However, the position is entirely

different in the case of India. Under the Indian Constitution, the

President, or the Governors of the States, are free to act and enter into

contracts which are not in consonance with Part XIV of the Constitution,

relating to Services under the Union and the State, consisting of
Articles
and
of the Constitution. Further, regulation of recruitment and

prescribing conditions of service of persons appointed to public service

and civil posts in connection with the affairs for the Union, or of any of

the State, has to be done only under
Article 309
of the Constitution, in

accordance with the Rules made under the Authority of that Article & its

Proviso, regulating such recruitment, and conditions of service of

persons appointed to such services and posts, subject to the protection

made available to the persons so employed in civil capacities, either

under the Union, or under a State, under
Article 311
of the Constitution,

even though
Article 310
lays down that except as expressly provided by

the Constitution, every person who is a member of a defence service or of

a civil service of the Union etc., or holder of any civil post etc., holds

office during the pleasure of the President, or the pleasure of the

Governor of the State, as the case may be. But, such pleasure of the

President, or of the Governor, would still be bound by the Rules made

under
Article 311
of the Constitution regarding dismissal, removal or

reduction in rank of such persons.
OA No.3963/2014

109. Under
Article 309
, read with the proviso below
Article 320 (3)

concerning the functions of the Public Service Commission, while it is

possible to prescribe that in respect of some posts and service

regulations may be made either generally, or in any particular class of

case, or in any particular circumstances, that it shall not be necessary

for the appropriate Public Service Commission to be consulted regarding

matters relating to the method of recruitment to a particular Civil

Service, or for a particular category of civil posts concerned, however,

this does not absolve the Executive from the rigours of
Articles 309
and
of the Constitution, and the protection available to the holders of

civil posts under
Article 311
of the Constitution of India. In the instant

case it is clear that IDSA also fell under the definition of the State for the

purposes of
Article 12
of the Constitution, and that R-1 NSCS certainly is

covered under that Article. Therefore, R-1 NSCS cannot be absolved

from the rigours of
Article 311
, even in spite of the exemption granted to

it under
Article 320 (3).

110. Therefore, it is clear that in the instant case, the respondents have

on the one hand appointed the applicant to be a holder of a civil post,

and even issued a Gazette notification to that effect, as such declaring

her to be the holder of that civil post, but, on the other hand, they have

also taken recourse to forcing her to sign an "Agreement" of service,

containing a number of conditions, as already discussed above, but

which conditions also only work towards more closely defining the

character of her employment to be that of a holder of a civil post, because

of those conditions having borrowed and brought into effect the
OA No.3963/2014

applicability of CCS (Conduct) Rules, CCS (CCA) Rules, and other

parallel Service rules concerning the Central Civil Services of the Union

of India to the applicant's appointment with them. Therefore, we have no

hesitation in holding that the "Agreement", which has been termed by

R-1 NSCS to have been a "Contract", was only a charade or a facade,

designed more to try to hide the true nature of the applicant's

employment with R-1-NSCS.

111. In fact, the fact that the so-called "contract" "Agreement" dated

03.10.2003, entered into between the applicant and the President of

India, was a sham, and non-est in the eyes of law, is further signified by

the fact that both the witnesses who had signed as witnesses for the

applicant, and as witnesses for the signature of Dr. S.D. Pradhan, Joint

Secretary to the Govt. of India in NSCS, were the same, and both were

employees of R-1 NSCS. This agreement having been attested to twice by

the same witnesses, both for the applicant, as well as for the Joint

Secretary signing on behalf of the President of India, who had signed

twice for having been witnesses for both sides, is totally unacceptable in

law. The "Agreement" having been signed by the same witnesses from

both the sides flies in the face of the law relating to the Law of Contract,

and the law relating to Law of Evidence in relation to contracts.

112. Though in the context of different Acts, like the Transfer of Property

Act, the Registration Act and the Indian Evidence Act, it has been held by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the attestation required as a proof of
OA No.3963/2014

execution of document is required by law to be attested under
Section 68

of the Indian Evidence Act, and its importance is such that the object of

such attestation is to protect the executant from being required to

execute a document by the other party thereto by force, fraud or undue

influence. It has been further held that such attestation is meant to

ensure that the executant of the agreement was a free agent, and not

under pressure, or subject to fraud, while executing the document

concerned.

113. It has been further held that the object of placing more attestation

than one upon a document, whether at the parties' voluntary instance,

or by requirement of law, is ordinarily not for the purpose to demand the

combined testimony of all of them at the trial, but merely to provide by

way of caution a number of witnesses, so that the main object of various

Statutes, requiring the attestation to be such that an element of validity

has to surround the act of execution, is achieved, with certain

safeguards.

114. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in the case of
M.L. Abdul

Jabbar Sahib v. H. Venkata Sastri and Sons and others
etc. [AIR

1969 SC 1147] that the act of attestation must be done by a witness

animo attestandi, i.e., "with the intention to attest", who should not only

be present at the time for affixing their signatures on the document while

it was being executed, but that the attesting witness must see that the

executants actually signed of freewill, and it must also be shown that the

attestor had signed the documents in the presence of the executants. In
OA No.3963/2014

the instant case, the manner in which two witnesses had signed as

having been witnesses to the signatures on the "Agreement" of both the

applicant, and of the Joint Secretary of NSCS signing on behalf of the

President of India, it cannot be elicited and held that the Agreement was

indeed signed by the applicant free from any undue influence, or out of

the free will of the applicant before us.

115. That is why, the law requires more than one attestation of

witnesses from either side, and at least one attesting witness from each

side who is capable of giving evidence of the signature having been

affixed out of free will, which is a necessary concomitant for the

execution of a valid contract "Agreement" to ensure that the executant

was a free agent, and was not under any pressure of any kind while

executing the document. The execution of an "Agreement" means not

only signing of the Agreement by a person on the document, but also the

attestation of his signature having been made out of free will, by

attesting witnesses, where it requires such attestation. It is, therefore,

clear from the facts of the instant case that after the applicant had joined

service with the respondent No.1-NSCS on 03.10.2003, she was perforce

made to sign the "Agreement" as at Annexure A-10, even though that

"Agreement" is of no consequence when tested on the touch-stone of

the requirements of a valid "Contract".

116. Similarly, the "Agreement" made on 29.09.2006 (Annexure A-14)

at the time of applicant's promotion to the post of Director was also

signed by the applicant and one Shri Rohit Khera, Joint Secretary on
OA No.3963/2014

behalf of the President, who is incidentally private respondent R-4 of this

O.A., and both signatures were again witnessed by the same set of two

witnesses, both of whom were Directors working under the Joint

Secretary, who was the executant on behalf of the President of India.

Therefore, had this been a civil case, none of these two "Agreements"

Annexure A-10 dated 03.10.2003 and Annexure A-14 dated 29.09.2006

would have stood the scrutiny of being as per the Law of Contracts, and

Law of Evidence. Therefore, insofar as the nature of the applicant's

appointment with the respondents is concerned, it is clear that from day

one, i.e., 03.10.2003, she was a holder of a civil post in R-1 NSCS, which

was properly Gazette notified also, and when she was promoted as

Director again, she continued to be a holder of a civil post, which

promotional appointment of hers was also properly Gazette notified, and

the respondent R-1 NSCS cannot be allowed to hide behind the sham

"Agreements" at Annexures A-10 and A-14, to try to pass off her

employment with them as having been contractual employment, when

the employment had all the trappings of a substantive appointment, or

appointment to a Gazetted civil post of appropriate stature.

117. The respondent R-1 NSCS has desperately tried to make out a case

as if her appointment was only a contractual employment, and was not a

substantive employment. But it is seen that she was even placed on

probation in her employment to the civil post under the Union of India,

which employment can only be in three manners, viz. (i) permanent

employment, subject to a period of probation, followed by confirmation as

probationer, and thereafter the appointee acquiring a substantive lien, (ii)
OA No.3963/2014

appointment in a temporary service, under the Central Civil Services

(Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, or, (iii) appointments "purely on

contractual basis", without any trappings whatsoever of the appointee

being a Government servant, which contractual employees never get to

become the holders of a civil post.

118. As we have pointed out above, even though the Gazette Notification

dated 08.12.2003 had mentioned that the President had appointed the

applicant as Deputy Secretary with R-1-NSCS on contract basis for a

period of two years, or until further orders, whichever is earlier, but

through the Agreement executed on 03.10.2003, all the trappings of her

being the holder of a civil post were attached to her employment. It is

also not the case of the respondent R-1 NSCS that she was appointed

under the CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965.

119. It may be pertinent to mention here that removal from service of a

temporary government servant, who is not in quasi permanent service, is

easy, as it is liable to termination at any time, by notice being given in

writing (by the Government servant to the Appointing Authority, or by

the Appointing Authority to the Government servant), the period of such

notice being one month, as per Rule-5 (1)(b) of CCS (Temporary Service)

Rules, 1965. The concomitants of Temporary Service appointments

under fixed period temporary service made under proviso to Rule 5(1)(b)

of the Rules vis-a-vis substantive appointments were examined by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Union of India and others v. Arun Kumar

Roy
(1986) 1 SCC 675, and it was held that when once Service Rules

have been framed under
Article 309
, the Rules so framed govern the
OA No.3963/2014

service after appointment, and that they override the term of any

contract, which is not in consonance with the said Rules. It was further

held that any Subordinate Legislation by way of Notification, clarifying

the operation of Statutory Rules, cannot override the Statutory Rules

themselves.

The said Rule-5 of the CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965

was first interpreted by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Senior

Superintendent, R. M. S., Cochin V. K. V. Gopinath
(AIR 1972 SC

1487=(1972) 3 SCR 530.

However, that judgment was declared not to

be a good law through the Supreme Court's subsequent judgment in the

case of
Raj Kumar vs. Union of India
, [1975] 3 S.C.R. 963=AIR 1975

SC 1116.

After taking notice of these two judgments in
Union of India

and others v. Arun Kumar Roy
(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court had

held as follows:-

"17. The question whether the terms embodied in the Order of
appointment should govern the service conditions of
employees in. Government service or the rules governing them
is not an open question now. It is now well settled that a
Government servant whose appointment though originates
in a contract, acquires a status and thereafter is governed
by his service rules and not by the terms of contract. The
powers of the Government under
Art. 309
to make rules,
to regulate the service conditions of its employees are
very wide and unfettered. These powers can be exercised
unilaterally without the consent of the employees concerned. It
will, therefore, be idle to contend that in the case of employees
under the Government, the terms of the contract of
appointment should prevail over the rules governing their
service conditions. The origin of Government service often
times is contractual. There is always an offer and
acceptance, thus bringing it to being a completed contract
between the Government and its employees.
Once
appointed, a Government servant acquires a status and
thereafter his position is not one governed by the contract
of appointment. Public law governing service conditions
steps in to regulate the relationship between the employer
and employee. His emoluments and other service
conditions are thereafter regulated by the appropriate
statutory authority empowered to do so. Such regulation
is permissible in law unilaterally without reciprocal
OA No.3963/2014

consent. This Court made this clear in two Judgments
rendered by two Constitution Benches for this Court in

Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India
, (1968) 1 SCR 185 : (AIR
1967 SC 1889) and in
State of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki
Nath Khosa
, (1974) 1 SCR 771 : (AIR 1974 SC 1).

18. Thus it is clear and not open to doubt that the terms
and conditions of the service of an employee under the
Government who enters service on a contract, will, once
he is appointed, be governed by the rules governing his
service conditions. It will not be permissible thereafter for
him to rely upon the terms of contract which are not in
consonance with the rules governing the service.

19. The powers of the Government under Article. 309 of
the Constitution to make rules regulating the service
conditions of the government employees cannot, in any
manner, be fettered by any agreement. The respondent
cannot therefore, succeed either on the terms of the contract
or on the notification on which the High Court has relied upon.
Nor can he press into service the rule of estoppel against the
Government.

20. Now, we may usefully advert to clause. (v) of para 2 of the
Order of appointment. This clause reads as follows :

"Other conditions of service will be governed by the relevant
rules and orders in force from time to time."

21. This clause was inserted by way of abundant caution
making it clear that the conditions of service will be regulated
by the rules, obtaining from time to time regarding the service
in question."

(Emphasis supplied)

120. As was held in Paragraphs 18 & 19 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's

judgment in the case of
Union of India and others v. Arun Kumar Roy

(supra), even in the case of an employee under the Government, who

enters service on a contract, the terms and conditions of service of the

employee will, once he was so appointed, be governed by the rules

governing his service conditions, and it will not be permissible thereafter

(either for him, or for the Government) to go back to and rely upon the

terms of the contract, which are not in consonance with the rules
OA No.3963/2014

governing the service, since the powers of the Government under
Article
of the Constitution to make Rules regulating the service conditions of

the Government employee cannot in any manner be fettered by any

agreement. Here, in the instant case, it is the other way round. After

having bound the applicant with all the fetters of the Service Rules and

Regulations from the day 1, i.e., 03.10.2003, it is the Govt. of India which

is trying to go back and to try to turn the clock back, to the detriment of

the applicant's accrued rights.

121. In Para-12 of their counter reply, respondent No.R-1 NSCS has

submitted two things, firstly that the RRs 2001 prevalent in 2006 did not

have any provision for promotion, and secondly that as per the

Guidelines for recruitment of officers in NSCS, absorption can be done

only "in rare cases", and after completion of a minimum tenure of 5

years in an outstanding manner. We find both these submissions to be

entirely against the well settled and laid down principles of

Administrative Law. When once the 2001 RRs had been prescribed by

the respondents (through Annexure A-12 dated 16.02.2001), that was in

the nature of a Subordinate Legislation. Thereafter the respondents

cannot have, and cannot take recourse to, any purported Guidelines,

which have neither been brought on record by them, nor could have been

issued in supersession of the Subordinate Legislation issued through the

General Statutory Regulation No.97 dated 16.02.2001. After the RRs

2001 had been framed and notified, keeping of any element of discretion

in their drawers in the form of any Secret and undisclosed Guidelines is
OA No.3963/2014

both illegal, as well as totally abhorrent to all tenets of law. RRs could

have been, however, amended, which was actually done in 2007.

122. The submission of the respondents that the RRs did not have any

provision for promotion is also not acceptable, as the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has repeatedly held that consideration for promotion is a

fundamental right of any holder of a civil post, if a promotional post

exists, and the R-1 NSCS has failed to deny that the promotional post of

Joint Secretary does exist.

123. The contention of the respondents that absorption can only be done

"in rare cases" is also completely unacceptable. This smacks of an

element of discretion, without following any prescribed Rules or

Regulations, or the prescription of any cut-off or qualifying criteria like

'Very Good' in CRs of so many years out of so many years, or

'Outstanding' in CRs of so many years out of so many years. It is trite

law that administrative discretion is abhorrent to the Rule of Law, and

the R-1 NSCS cannot be allowed to plead that without prescribing any

qualifying standards as per Rules, they can have and keep an

administrative discretion in their pockets, to take a decision to absorb

certain persons, "in rare cases", and not to absorb all others, even if

they are also holders of civil posts, and had performed well, when no

such benchmark for performance has been prescribed under the Rules

for determination of those "rare cases". Stating that absorption could

have been done "in rare cases" further discloses the propensity on the

part of R-1 NSCS to take recourse to a discretion de hors the RRs, which
OA No.3963/2014

in itself is a blasphemy. As was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

E.P. Royappa vs. State of Tamil Nadu
: AIR 1974 SC 555, equality and

equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule

of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an

absolute monarch, and that the principle of equality enshrined in

Article 14
must guide every state action, whether it be legislative,

executive, or quasi-judicial (
Meneka Gandhi vs. Union of India
:

(
1978) 1 SCC 248,) and Ajay Hasia vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi and

Others
(1981) 1 SCC 722.

124. It has been further submitted in the counter reply of R-1 NSCS that

respondents have the sole discretion to decide regarding the cases for

absorption, which also cannot be the case, because the term

"absorption" is only used in the cases of deputationists, or persons

holding their lien in another organization, and who have moved to the

borrowing organization, where they are sought to be so "absorbed".

"Absorption" can also be used in the case of contractual employees, and

Temporary Service employees. But then, as we have discussed above, the

appointment of the applicant with R-1 NSCS w.e.f. 03.10.2003 was

neither "purely contractual", nor was it under the CCS (Temporary

Service) Rules, 1965, and that it already had all the trappings of a

substantive employment (with even a period of Probation having been

envisaged). Therefore, at least in the case of the present applicant, the

very term "absorption" had lost its meaning altogether, when she was

already substantively employed after her selection in a proper manner, as

per the RRs and she was holding her post in her own right.
OA No.3963/2014

125. The meaning of the word 'absorption' had been discussed in the

case of
Dev Dutta vs. State of Madhya Pradesh
[(1991) Supp2 SCC

553] in Paragraph-8 of the judgment as follows:-

"8. Now coming to the question of seniority, the term "absorbed"

in Service Jurisprudence with reference to a post in the very
nature of things implies that an employee who has not been
holding a particular post in his own right by virtue of either
recruitment or promotion to that post but is holding a
different post in a different department is brought to that
post either on deputation or by transfer and is subsequently
absorbed in that post whereafter he becomes a holder of that
post in his own right and loses his lien on his parent post. No
one asserts that the instant one was a case of the absorbed Sales
Tax Inspectors being initially sent on deputation from the post of
Block Level Extension Officer to the post of Sales Tax Inspector
and being subsequently absorbed in that post. Consequently,
when as pointed out by the High court, it was not disputed that
the surplus Block Level Extension Officers had been absorbed in
the post of Sales Tax Inspectors it is obvious that it was a case of
absorption by transfer.
In this connection it would be useful to
recapitulate that the minutes of the meeting
referred to above
held
on 30/09/1965 laying down the principles of procedure for
absorbing the surplus personnel specifically stated that the
surplus staff which was to be "absorbed" "should be treated as
having been transferred from one post to another so that
there may be no break in their service".

(Emphasis supplied)

126. In fact it is true that the vagueness in the 2001 RRs of the R-1

NSCS had been very clearly pointed out by the DoP&T itself in its Noting

dated 21.03.2014, produced by the respondent themselves at Annexure

R-12. The R-1 NSCS has also falsely stated that there was no provision

for promotion in the RRs, since it was not clearly spelt out in the 2001

RRs, but as per the RRs of 2007, produced by them as Annexure R-11,

promotion is certainly one of the methods for appointment of the Joint

Secretaries, of the Directors and of the Deputy Secretaries, as per the

RRs Gazette notified on 22.12.2007. Therefore, the total absence of any

possibility of promotions under 2001 RRs cannot be appreciated, when
OA No.3963/2014

the clarity has not come even after 2007 RRs. The DoP&T Noting dated

21.03.2014, submitted by the respondents at Annexure R-12, had stated

as follows:-

"8. In the present case, it seems that the eligibility
requirement of total continuous service of 17 years is
specified for the officer in PB 3 GP Rs.7600 for being
considered for promotion to the post of JS in NSCS.
Other eligibility criteria in respect of officers of NSCS having
2 years regular service in PB-4 GP Rs. 8900, or 3 years
regular service in PB 4 GP Rs.8700 for being eligible to JS
appear to be separate provisions. This interpretation is
logical from the provisions prescribed for deputation of this
post. It prescribes that the officers in PB 3 GP Rs.7600
with total continuous Group A service of 17 years is
eligible for being considered for appointment to the post
by deputation/absorption. Due to vagueness of the
provisions of the RRs, this interpretation needs to be
clarified/validated in consultation with M/o Legal
Affairs.

9. NSCS may accordingly decide the eligibility of the
officer to the post of HS DoP&T may not have any further
comments in the matter".

(Emphasis supplied)

127. When the respondents have themselves framed their RRs in a vague

manner, both in 2001 and in 2007, and not in accordance with the

settled principles of Administrative Law, they cannot be allowed to hide

behind the imperfections of those Rules to deny to the applicant her due.

128. One further controversy unnecessarily raised by the R-1 NSCS has

been in the context of their submission that the applicant was "on loan

basis" with them w.e.f. 16.08.2000 to 27.09.2002 from IDSA, and was

not "on deputation". In this context, the following definition of "loan"

may be reproduced from page 1039 of P. Ramanatha Aiyar's Law Lexicon,

3rd Edition, 2012, Edited by Dr. Shakil Ahmad Khan. As was held in
OA No.3963/2014

Nihal Singh vs. Ganesh Dass Ramgopal: AIR 1937 Oudh 124";

"except with respect to money "to loan"implies that a thing is

delivered to another for use, without reward, and to be returned in

specie." But, in the instant case, during the relevant period of more than

two years, the salary and other emoluments of the applicant were paid by

R-1 NSCS only, and not by her the then employer IDSA, and, therefore, in

terms of the above cited 1937 judgment, her services with R-1 NSCS

cannot be termed to have been "on loan basis", but were certainly "on

deputation basis":-

"A lending; that which is lent; a permission to use; a bailment of
an article for a certain time to be used by the borrower. Loan may
include the lending of anything a horse, a carriage, a book, or any
kind of goods, as well as money. To loan is to lend a thing to
another, either gratuitously or for reward. In order to constitute a
loan, there must be a thing loaned, a lender, and a borrower, as
well as a contract between the parties. Where the relation between
a depositor in a bank and his banker is that of debtor and
creditor, simply, the transaction cannot in any proper sense be
regarded as a loan, unless the money is left, not for safekeeping,
but for a fixed period at interest, in which case the transaction
assumes all the characteristics of a loan. "Except with respect to
money, 'to loan' implies that a thing is delivered to another for
use, without reward, and to be returned in specie."

129. The R-1 NSCS has also denied any continuity in service of the

applicant from the IDSA to the R-1 NSCS organization. However, their

claim in this regard is false, totally hollow and unbelievable, in view of

Annexure A-26 LPC, which they have failed to deny or to controvert. The

very fact the R-1 organization later on felt the need to call for the Service

Book of the applicant from the IDSA, and IDSA ultimately forwarded it to

them, and the official respondent R-1-NSCS have themselves produced

photocopies of certain pages from her Service Book at Annexure R-2,
OA No.3963/2014

clearly goes to show that R-1 NSCS was fully aware about the continuity

of the applicant's service from IDSA to their organization. Even in their

sur-rejoinder, R-1 NSCS has failed to deny the genuineness of Annexure

A-26 dated 29.09.2003, which clearly shows that the applicant was to be

relieved from IDSA on 30.09.2003 only.

130. Also, as has been recorded in the applicant's IDSA Service Book

itself, she was deputed to R-1 NSCS for a period of two years w.e.f.

16.08.2000, and she was to draw her pay and allowances from the R-1

NSCS only during her deputation period, as per the order dated

25.08.2000 passed by them. Deputation can only be of a substantive

appointee, who retains a lien with the parent employer. If the contention

of R-1 NSCS that the applicant was a purely contractual basis employee

with IDSA has to be accepted, then there could have been no deputation

of the applicant from IDSA to R-1 NSCS, and no return of hers to IDSA to

re-occupy her lien would have been possible. The very fact that it was

felt necessary to take her "on loan", or "on deputation basis",

howsoever, it may be called, from the IDSA to R-1 NSCS, and for IDSA to

have so lent her services to the R-1 NSCS, and to then have taken her

back in their organization after completion of her more than two years'

deputation tenure with the R-1 NSCS, goes to show that her employment

with the IDSA also was not on "purely contractual basis" and that she

did hold a lien in IDSA.

131. Even though the deputation may have been illegally called to be 'on

loan basis', but her services on such deputation had been treated as
OA No.3963/2014

substantive services with R-1, and R-1 itself had, while considering her

case for promotional appointment to the post of Director, taken into

account that previous two years' deputation service of hers along with the

three years' service in the past of Deputy Secretary, for the purpose of

counting her 5 years' of qualifying service with NSCS for her promotion to

the post of Director, it proves that neither the applicant's appointment

with IDSA had been purely a contractual appointment, not her

deputation to R-1 NSCS had been so. If it was only a contract, the

contract should have been terminated with IDSA on 16.08.2000, and

then a fresh contract ought to have been entered into by her with the

NSCS for the period of her deputation with R-1 NSCS w.e.f. 16.08.2000,

which was neither done, nor contemplated, nor has been mentioned

anywhere in the pleadings.

132. Therefore, whatever may have been the nomenclature recorded in

her Service Book behind her back, to which she had no access, the

nature of her employment with IDSA was that of a substantive

employment, and her services were lent 'on loan or deputation basis' to

R-1 w.e.f. 16.08.2000 and were then taken back by the IDSA when R-1

NSCS sent her back after the end of her deputation period. As mentioned

above, when services are taken only on "loan basis", it is not necessary

for the obligation to pay the salary etc. during the period concerned has

also to be necessarily borne by the loanee organization, and cannot

continue to be borne by the loaning organization. In the instant case, R-

1 NSCS took on such a responsibility, and, therefore, very rightly so, they

later on treated that period of her deputation as substantial service.
OA No.3963/2014

133. The contention of the respondent R-1 NSCS that they cannot now

count her previous service in the IDSA for the purpose of considering her

case for Joint Secretary-ship, only because there had been a gap on

paper of 01 month and 22 days in her appointment being terminated by

the IDSA, and her joining the respondents on 03.10.2003, cannot also be

accepted, and is an absolutely false submission, because of the fact that

the respondent R-1 NSCS itself has failed to deny the contents of the

documents dated 14.08.2003 & 10.09.2003 (Annexure A-8 colly)

produced by the applicant, in which the applicant had sought permission

regarding the invitation received by her to attend the Conference on "Post

Modern Terrorism", and the IDSA Director's office had received that

through Dy. No.2689 dated 14.08.2003, and then Director IDSA had

signed on it on 18.08.2003, and had reviewing the situation found that

her deputation cannot be supported.

134. Respondent No.R-1-NSCS has also failed to deny the genuineness

of the applicant's request for leave dated 10.09.2003, by which she had

requested Director IDSA that she may be granted Earned Leave/Half Pay

Leave w.e.f. 09.08.2003 to 30.09.2003, and in Para-3 of her request letter

dated 10.09.2003, she had also stated that she was unable to attend the

office during the preceding period with regularity or for more than an

hour, and that also will have to be considered as leave period in the

interests of discipline. That leave request had been received in the office

of Director, IDSA, by Dy. No.2965 dated 18.09.2003, and the Director

IDSA had approved the sanction of her Earned Leave/Half Pay Leave
OA No.3963/2014

w.e.f. 09.08.2003 to 30.09.2003, and had also mentioned that since she

was unable to attend office during the preceding period from 09.08.2003

to 10.09.2003, that period also will have to be considered as leave period,

and her sense of discipline had met with the approval and appreciation

by the Director, which shows the integrity on behalf of the applicant.

Further, the respondent R-1-NSCS has also not been able to deny the

Annexure A-9 dated 30.09.2003, the applicant's relieving order issued by

IDSA, which order was passed by IDSA on 30.09.2003, though it had

been mentioned in it that she was relieved of her duties in that Institute

w.e.f. 10.08.2003 (AN). But since this relieving order had not been

passed and issued by IDSA on 10.08.2003, but had actually been passed

and issued on 30.09.2003, it supports the applicant's contention that she

was in service with the IDSA till 30.09.2003, and that there had been no

gap in her appointment with IDSA coming to an end in that date, and her

joining with R-1-NSCS on the next very available working day on

03.10.2003. As had been held in
Badat & Co. v. East India Trading

Co.
: AIR 1964 SC 538, merely an evasive denial, without any specific

countering of the averments made and facts narrated, cannot be

accepted, and such indirect admission itself being proof, no other proof is

necessary.

135. It is also seen that the R-1-NSCS has themselves supported the

sequence of events as narrated by the applicant in the OA by producing

Annexure R-6 of their counter reply, in which it is seen that sanction of

46 days of E.L. for encashment as per the Rule vide Officer Order No.

12A/2003 dated 03.12.2003 has been recorded earlier than the legend
OA No.3963/2014

recorded below that, that the present applicant's resignation has been

accepted, and she had been relieved from her duties in (the IDSA)

Institute w.e.f. 10.08.2003, vide Office Order No.9C/2003 dated

29.09.2003. It is thus clear that the last entry regarding the Office Order

dated 29.09.2003 issued by IDSA was recorded after the Office Order

No.12A/2003 issued by IDSA was passed on 03.12.2003, for leave

encashment purposes, because the Service Book of the applicant had

remained with the IDSA for quite a long time even after she had joined R-

1-NSCS, and this entry regarding the antedating of the date of her being

relieved as entered in the Service Book had actually been made some

time after 02.12.2003, when her 46 days' Earned Leave encashment had

also been sanctioned by IDSA. Therefore, the entire story of R-1-NSCS of

there being a gap of 01 month and 22 days in the applicant's employment

with IDSA ending and her employment with the R-1 NSCS starting is

entirely bogus, and unbelievable, and an utter falsehood. Further, it may

be added that even if such a break in service of 01 month and 22 days

was to be accepted to be true, still, after the R-1-NSCS having taken into

account her previous employment with IDSA as analogous service,

making her eligible for appointment to the post of Deputy Secretary with

R-1 NSCS w.e.f. 03.10.2003, the respondent R-1 NSCS cannot now turn

around, and the benefit of such analogous service of hers of 17 years

cannot now be denied to the applicant. In this context, in a slightly

similar case of absorption of a deputationist Doctor, in a Coordinate

Bench's order dated 28.10.2016 (including one of us Member (A)) in OA

No.1699/2012 - Dr. Niruta Sharma v. Union of India, it has been held

as follows:
OA No.3963/2014

"22. We are also bound by the orders of the Full Bench,
Paragraphs 11 to 25 of which have been reproduced above. The
Full Bench had held that the deputationists are given seniority
and fixation of pay, taking into account the full period of
equivalent service rendered by them in their earlier parent
Department. Therefore, in so far as her seniority is concerned,
the present applicant is entitled to claim the seniority which had
accrued to her by way of the equivalent service rendered by her
with the Himachal Pradesh Government, including the period of
her deputation with the Respondent No.2 of this O.A. In this
context, it is seen from the reply of the respondents in response
to Para-4.9 of the OA that the respondents have, under the
advice received by them from DoPT, already fixed her seniority by
protecting that past service of hers, rendered by her in her earlier
parent organization, including the period of deputation with
Respondent No.2. Therefore, the ratio of the Full Bench
judgment has been fully complied with by the respondents in her
case.

23. The Full Bench had further held that in the matter of
promotions, deputationists who get absorbed will be able to claim
weightage on the basis of the seniority that is so carried forward
by them. It is apparent from the reply of the respondents in
response to Para 4.9 of the OA that they have already given due
weightage to the applicant's seniority as carried/brought forward
by her from her previous employment with Himachal Pradesh
Government in the matter of fixation and seniority, in the
Seniority List of the CHS cadre.

24. However, though the stand of the respondents that such
protection of past service does not make the absorbed doctors
eligible for promotion to the next higher grade in CHS with
retrospective effect, is also correct, the absorbed doctors in the
GDMO Sub-Cadre of CHS need not be required to once again
complete the prescribed qualifying service in the feeder grade of
GDMO Sub-Cadre, into which they have been so absorbed, after
the date of such absorption, in addition to any other eligibility
requirement, since they have already worked on analogous post
during the period of their deputation service. The respondents
are, therefore, not fully justified and right in making the
submission that such qualifying service can count only from the
date of absorption of the absorbee Doctor into the GDMO Sub-
Cadre of CHS, and no weightage can be ascribed to their
analogous service in the past, during the period of their
deputation.

25. While it is correct that the absorption in CHS is the
point of time on which there is a new start of service of the
applicant in a new cadre of CHS, in the pay scale of the post
concerned, in which the absorbee Doctor's entitlements would
start counting afresh, because he/she has joined the CHS cadre
only from that date of absorption in substantive capacity, but her
past service with the Himachal Pradesh Government, and her
period of analogous service while on deputation with CHS, while
retaining her lien with the Himachal Government, would not only
count for the purpose of seniority to be fixed, by protecting such
OA No.3963/2014

past service, but should also count towards the qualifying service
for further promotions in CHS. However, she would not be
entitled for any retrospective promotion.

26. xxx (Not reproduced here)

27. Therefore, while the claim of the applicant for fixation of
her initial pay in CHS in the higher pay scale, as had been
granted to her in her previous substantive employment with the
Himachal Government, from the date of her absorption in CHS
itself cannot be granted to her, more so when she had knowingly
and willingly accepted her absorption under the CHS cadre only
as a Senior Medical Officer w.e.f. 09.10.2003, in the pay scale of
Rs.10,000-15200, in the interest of her remaining at Delhi,
instead of reverting back to her earlier parent cadre in Himachal
Pradesh, but the weightage of her having already rendered
analogous service during the period of her deputation also would
have to be provided to her, and, only if that period of analogous
service falls short of the period prescribed for the consideration
of her case for promotion, she would be required to render only
such balance period of qualifying service after her absorption
into CHS. If her analogous service experience while being on
deputation with CHS has already exceeded the qualifying period,
her eligibility for consideration of her case for promotion would
start soon after such absorption.

28. Therefore, the OA is partially allowed, but there shall be
no order as to costs.

136. The respondent R-1-NSCS cannot also be allowed to hide behind

the fact that the relieving order of the IDSA does not mention the reason

for which the applicant had resigned from her service with that Institute,

and does not mention anywhere that she had submitted her resignation

and sought voluntarily to be relieved, just because her impending

appointment with R-1 NSCS had not been mentioned by IDSA in its

order. Such a mention was not at all necessary in that order passed by

IDSA, because it was only an acceptance of her letter of voluntary

premature resignation, and in that it neither was neither necessary for

her to mention her future plans, nor was it necessary for the IDSA to

indicate the reasons for their having accepted her request for such

premature voluntary resignation.
OA No.3963/2014

137. Further, it was not as if the RRs dated 16.02.2001 notified through

GSR 97, which have been produced before us through Annexures A-12 &

A-27, had not been re-considered and amended in between. The GSR

183 dated 16.04.2003 filed by the applicant as a part of Annexure A-27

goes to show that firstly the name of the R-1 Organization had been

changed to the National Security Council Secretariat, and secondly a

Selection Committee, comprising of three Members each, had been

introduced in Column 13 for the RRs in respect of the posts of Joint

Secretary, Scientist 'G" and Major General, and against the posts of

Director and Deputy Secretary, in place of the earlier existing entries.

Such a Selection Committee, duly provided for in the RRs for the post

concerned, cannot be reduced only to be to select people for the purpose

of contractual employment only, when the prescribed methods of

recruitment under Column-11 for the posts of Directors were

Deputation/Contract/Absorption/Re-employment. It is, therefore, clear

that the Selection Committee in Column 13 of the RRs would apply to all

the four methods of selection provided for in Column 11 of the RRs.

138. However, in respect of any such Selection Committee, the Apex

Court had in
Dr. Krushna Chandra Sahu and Others vs. State of

Orissa and Others
AIR 1996 SC 352=(1995) 6 SCC 1 decided the scope

of powers of any such Selection Committee as follows, holding that such

powers have to conform to the RRs, and, therefore, the Selection

Committee must set parameters for the four methods of Selection

provided for in Column 11 of the RRs:-
OA No.3963/2014

"35. The members of the Selection Board or for that matter, any
other Selection Committee, do not have the jurisdiction to lay
down the criteria for selection unless they are authorised
specifically in that regard by the Rules made under
Art. 309.
It is
basically the function of the rule making authority to provide the
basis for selection. This Court in
State of Andhra Pradesh v. V.
Sadanandam
, AIR 1989 SC 2060 observed as under (para 16, at
pp. 2065-66 of AIR):-

"We are now only left with the reasoning of the Tribunal that there
is no justification for the continuance of the old Rule and for
personnel belonging to either zones being transferred on
promotion to offices in other zones. In drawing such conclusion,
the Tribunal has travelled beyond the limits of its jurisdiction. We
need only point out that the mode of recruitment and the category
from which the recruitment to a service should be made are all
matters which are exclusively within the domain of the executive.
It is not for judicial bodies to sit in judgment over the wisdom of
the executive in choosing the mode of recruitment or the
categories from which the recruitment should be made as they are
matters of policy decision falling exclusively within the purview of
the executive".

(Emphasis supplied)

36. The Selection Committee does not even have the inherent
jurisdiction to lay down the norms for selection nor can such
power be assumed by necessary implication.
In
Ramachandra Iyer
v. Union of India
, (1984) 2 SCR 200 : (AIR 1984 SC 541), it was
observed (para 44, at p.562 of AIR):-

"By necessary inference, there was no such power in the ASRB to
add to the required qualifications. If, such power is claimed, it has
to be explicit and cannot be read by necessary implication for the
obvious reasons that such deviation from the rules is likely to
cause irreparable and irreversible harm".

37. Similarly, in
Umesh Chandra Shukla v. Union of India
, 1985
Suppl (2) SCR 367 : (AIR 1985 SC 1351), it was observed that the
Selection Committee does not possess any inherent power to lay
down its own standards in addition to what is prescribed under
the Rules.

Both these decisions were followed in
Sh. Durgacharan
Misra v. State of Orissa
, (1987) 2 UJ (SC) 657 : (AIR 1987 SC
2267) and the limitations of the Selection Committee were pointed
out that it had no jurisdiction to prescribe the minimum marks
which a candidate had to secure at the viva voce test.

38. It may be pointed out that rule making function under
Art.
is legislative and not executive as was
laid down by
this Court
in
B.S. Yadav v. State of Haryana
, AIR 1981 SC 561. For this
reason also, the Selection Committee or the Selection Board
cannot be held to have jurisdiction to lay down any standard or
basis for selection as it would amount to legislating a rule of
selection."
OA No.3963/2014

139. The only issue that now remains now to be adjudicated is with

regard to the determination of the seniority of the applicant vis-a-vis the

other four private respondents. For deciding that, we may just follow and

rely on the Hon'ble Apex Court judgment in the case of
V. Sreenivasa

Reddy and Others vs. Govt. of A.P. and Others
AIR 1995 SC 586,

and in particular, paragraphs 15-20, which are reproduced below:-

15. It is settled law by the judgment of the Constitution
Bench in Direct Recruits Class II Officers Association v.

State of Maharashtra, (1990) 2 SCR 900 : (1991 AIR SCW
2226), that appointment in accordance with Rules is a
condition precedent to count seniority. Temporary or ad hoc
or fortuitous appointments etc. is not an appointment in
accordance with the Rules and the temporary service cannot
be counted towards the seniority.
Delhi Water Supply and
Sewage Disposal Committee v. R. K Kashyap
, 1989 Supp (1)
SCC 194 : (AIR 1989 SC 278);
Masood Akhtar Khan v. State
of M.P.
, (1990) 4 SCC 24;
D. N. Agrawal v. State of M.P.
,
(1990) 2 SCC 553 : (AIR 1990 SC 1311);
State of Tamil Nadu
v. E. Paripoornam
, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 420 : (1992 AIR SCW
2057);
R. C. Poudyal v. Union of India
, (1993) 2 JT (SC) 1

Excise
Commissioner, Karnataka v. V. Sreekanta
, 1993 Supp (3)
SCC 53 : (1993 AIR SCW 1740).

16.
In
K. C. Joshi v. Union of India
, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 272
: (AIR 1991 SC 284), the seniority is to be counted from the
date on which appointment is made to the post in
accordance with the rules. The previous temporary service
should be considered to be fortuitous.

In
Union of India v. S.
K. Sharma
, (1992) 2 SCC 728 : (1992 AIR SCW 1150), this
Court held that the approval of the UPSC for continuation in
ad hoc post for the purpose of granting pay and allowances,
would not amount to regular appointment and ad hoc
services cannot be counted for determining seniority by the
selection by PSC vide Vijay Kumar Jain v. State of Madhya
Pradesh, 1992 Supp (2) SCC 95.

In
K. C. Joshi
's case (AIR
1991 SC 284), this Court held that employee would become
a member of service only from the date of his appointment
according to rules.

In
A. M. Sehgal v. Raja Ram
, 1992 Supp
(1) SCC 304 : (1991 AIR SCW 1246), this Court held that
where statutory rules link seniority with confirmation
seniority cannot be fixed according to length of service and
confirmation to a post borne on the cadre is a condition to
get seniority.

In
State of West Bengal v. Aghore Nath Dey
,
(1993) 3 SCC 371, it was held that ad hoc services followed
OA No.3963/2014

by regular service, the benefit of ad hoc service is not
admissible if the appointment was in violation of rules.

In
D.
N. Agrawal v. State of Madhya Pradesh
, (1990)2 SCC 553 :

(AIR 1990 SC 1311), it was held that seniority cannot relate
back to the date of temporary appointment.

17. Under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) where it is necessary in the public
interest to fill emergently a vacancy in the post borne on
the cadre of a service, class or category and if the filling of
such vacancy in accordance with the rules is likely to result
in undue delay, the appointing authority may appoint a
person temporarily otherwise than in accordance with the
said rules. Under sub- rule (iv) of R. 10(2), such temporary
appointee shall not be regarded as a probationer in such
service, class or category or be entitled by reason only of
such appointment to any preferential claim to future
appointments to such service, class or category. Rule 23(a)
provides the Procedure for commencement of the date of
probation of persons first appointed temporarily as under:-

"If a person having been appointed temporarily under
sub-rule (a)(i)(1) or sub-rule (c) of R. 10, a post borne on
the cadre of any service, class or category or having been
appointed to any service, class or category, otherwise
than in accordance with the Rules governing and
appointed thereto is subsequently appointed to any
service, class or category in accordance with the Rules, he
shall commence his probation from the date of
subsequent appointment or such earlier date as
appointing authority may determine."

The other clauses are not relevant for the purpose of this
case, hence omitted.

18. Rule 33 determines the seniority - (a) The seniority of a
person in a service, class or category or grade shall, unless
he has been reduced to a lower rank as a punishment, be
determined by the date of his first appointment to such
service, class, category or grade. If any portion of the service
of such person does not count towards probation under
Rules 10(a), (iv), 10(c), 16, 37(d), or 42(d), his seniority shall
be determined by the date of commencement of his service
which counts towards probation.

19. It is true that in Diwakar's case (AIR 1982 SC 1555) and
in
Venkata Reddy
's case, this Court upheld the exercise of
the power by the Government under proviso to clause (3) of

Art. 320
of the Constitution and in
Venkata Reddy
's case
(1993 AIR SCW 2750) held that the temporary employees
are appointed in accordance with the rules. As stated
earlier, those appointments came to be made during ban
period and remained in service for long period. In this case,
there is no ban on recruitment and the appellants are
eligible to apply for and seek direct recruitment.

In

Paripoornam
's case (1992 AIR SCW 2057), another Bench of
OA No.3963/2014

three Judges, considering the similar Madras Rules, held in
paragraph 14, that temporary appointments made under R.
10(a)(i)(1) to fill in emergency vacancies were otherwise than
in accordance with the Rules and the temporary service
cannot be counted towards the seniority.

Same is the view
held by another three Judges Bench in
A. P. M. Mayankutty
v. Secretary Public Service Department
, (1977) 2 SCW 360 :

(1977 Lab IC 551).
In Diwakar's case (
AIR 1982 SC 1555)
and Venkata Reddy
case (1993 AIR SCW 2750), this Court
approved the validity of the exercise of the power under
proviso to clause (3) of
Art. 320
owing to the ban on the
recruitment by the government and long lapse of time which
has elapsed from the date of the initial temporary
appointments till the date the decision was taken by the
government to regularise the services of such temporary
appointments.

20.
In
A. K. Bhatnagar v. Union of India
, (1991) 1 SCC 544,
this Court while deprecating the practice of the government
giving a go-by to the statutory rules or regulations, framed
under proviso to
Art. 309
of the Constitution making large
scale departure, expressed thus :-

"On more than one occasion this Court has indicated to
the Union and the State Governments that once they
frame rules, their action in respect of matters covered by
rules should be regulated by the rules. The rules framed
in exercise of powers conferred under the proviso of
Art.
of the Constitution are solemn rules having binding
effect. Acting in a manner contrary to the rules does
create problem and dislocation. Very often government
themselves get trapped on account of their own mistakes
or actions in excess of what is provided in the rules. We
take serious view of these lapses and hope and trust that
the government both at the Centre and in the States
would take note of this position and refrain from
acting in a manner not contemplated by their own rules."

140. In the instant case, it is absolutely clear from the above discussion

that the applicant was first on deputation from 2000 to 2002 in R-1-

NSCS, but was later taken on substantive appointment w.e.f. 03.10.2003,

when she was not on deputation from IDSA, since she had resigned from

her post in IDSA with effect from 30.09.2003.

141. We have already discussed above that the nature of her

employment with R-1-NSCS was never purely on contractual basis, and,
OA No.3963/2014

therefore, she cannot at all be classified under the category of contractual

employees. It was also not a case of absorption, because absorption can

only be of a deputationist, or of a temporary or ad hoc worker, or of a

person working under CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965, and,

therefore, her case was clearly not that of absorption also.

142. In the result, it is clear that from the very beginning from

03.10.2003 itself, the case of the applicant was that of re-employment

only, since her previous service with IDSA had already been treated by

the Selection Committee of R-1 NSCS, as provided for in Column 13 of

the RRs for the post concerned to be analogous service, from which her

employment was terminated by the IDSA Office Order dated 30.09.2003

and then she was re-employed with R-1 w.e.f. 03.10.2003.

143. We have examined the contents of the Notification No.18/4/51-

Estt.(B) issued on 01.09.1958 by the Government of India, Ministry of

Home Affairs, and subsequently amended many times thereafter, titled

the Union Public Service Commission (Exemption from Consultation)

Regulations, 1958. It is seen that through DoP&T Notification dated

31.01.2001 issued through GSR 88 dated 17.02.2001, an item No.21 had

been introduced in Schedule-I under Regulation-2 of such Union Public

Service Commission (Exemption from Consultation) Regulations, 1958, in

which the following posts of the R-1 NSCS have been kept out of the

purview of consultations from UPSC.:-

"(21) Posts of Lt. General, Scientist "H", Major General, Scientist
"G", Secretary, Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director,
Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, Principal Private Secretary,
Senior System Analyst, Researc1:l Officer, Private Secretary,
Section Officer. Protocol Officer, Assistant, Research Assistant,
OA No.3963/2014

Personal Assistant, Protocol Assistant, Senior Library and
Information Assistant and Draftsman Grade' I' in the National
Security Council Secretariat, Cabinet Secretariat."

144. However, such blanket exemption from consultation with UPSC

accorded to the R-1 NSCS Organization with effect from 17.02.2001

through Gazette Notification GSR-88 cannot be turned into a licence to

indulge in favouritism amongst its employees, and to abuse the discretion

which may have become available to R-1 NSCS Organization because of

that Notification.

145. We have also found something absolutely abhorrent and against all

tenets and principles of law in the counter-reply of R-1 NSCS. One of

these things is the submission made that only in some cases, the

discretion is exercised to provide permanent employment to persons all of

whom are initially contractually engaged by the R-1 NSCS. We find this

submission to be totally obnoxious. There cannot be any absolute

discretion. Even the exercise of discretion must be reasonably made and

in public interest, as was held by Lord Halsbury in Sharp v. Wakefield

[1891] AC 173, and which law has been followed by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in Manager, Govt. Press v. Balliappa, AIR 1979 SC 429, and in

Union of India v. Sudhir Kumar Jaiswal
, 1994 SCC (L&S) 925=1994

(2) SCR 674.

146. If the decision is taken without any principle, or without any norm,

the four corners of which are required to be known in advance, such

decision is nothing but arbitrary, and antithesis of the Rule of Law, as
OA No.3963/2014

was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of

India and Ors.
, AIR 1967 SC 1427, and in Swant Singh v. Assistant

Passport Officer, New Delhi, AIR 1967 SC 1836.

147. In fact, in the United States, in the case of United States v. Martin

Wanderlich, 342 US 98=1996 LED 113(1951), this proposition has

been beautifully summed up by holding as follows:

"Law has reached its finest moments when it has freed men
from unlimited discretion of some rulers, some civil or military
official, some bureaucrat.......Absolute discretion is a ruthless
master. It is more destructive of freedom than any of man's
other inventions".

148. We have also found that the respondents have not been able to

effectively deny the applicant's averment that the respondent R-1 NSCS

has become an accommodating ground for all persons whose inclination

is palatable to the ruling dispensation, and to provide them permanent

employment, without their having even an iota of knowledge about

security scenario of the country. The respondent R-1 NSCS has not been

able to deny the applicant's averment that one of the persons

permanently absorbed in NSCS was previously only in-charge of catering

in the Prime Minister's residence, and was then directly absorbed by

Respondent R-1-NSCS on a higher post of Joint Secretary, without his

having absolutely any knowledge of the security scenario of the country.

Respondents also have not been able to deny the applicant's averment

that one of the named private respondents in this case was earlier only in

the Personal Section of a Minister, where he could not have gathered or

gained any knowledge of the security scenario of the country, but still he
OA No.3963/2014

was absorbed, and given permanent employment with respondent R-1

NSCS, and even in doing so, he was permanently placed ahead of the

present applicant, who is an expert in the security matters in her own

right, as had been recognized by the respondent R-1 NSCS earlier also,

when they had sought her services on deputation from her previous

employer IDSA. We find this scenario most disappointing and

depressing, and actually being against the Security interests of the

nation.

149. Therefore, in the conspectus of the law as laid down above, as cited

by us from various Supreme Court's judgments, and from the order dated

28.10.2016 in OA No.1699/2012 (supra), and as is seen from the

discussion of the facts of this case, we hold that the applicant was in

substantive employment with IDSA earlier, though it was called as a

contract, and that she was re-employed as Deputy Secretary in

substantive capacity with R-1 w.e.f. 03.10.2003, and that she was,

therefore, fully eligible to count her past analogous employment, with a

similar/parallel organization (IDSA) prior to that date, till 30.09.2003.

This also flows from the Full Bench order of this Tribunal dated

22.04.2009 in OA 1436/07 with OA 1437/2007 and OA 1438/2007- Dr.

Snehal Bhave Vs. UOI & Ors and the connected two cases, which had

been followed by the Coordinate Bench in
OA No.622/2012 Dr. Pankaj

Agnihotri v. Union of India
.
OA No.3963/2014

150. In the result, for the foregoing reasons, the OA is allowed, but there

shall be no order as to costs.

Per RAJ VIR SHARMA, MEMBER(J):

151. After going through the order proposed by the Hon'ble

Administrative Member, I am unable to agree with the view taken,

as well as the conclusion arrived at, by him in the proposed order.

Hence, I am writing this dissenting order.

152. The brief facts of the case, which are not disputed by

either side, are as follows:

(A) The applicant worked on contract basis in the Institute of

Defence Studies and Analysis (hereinafter referred to as 'IDSA'),

New Delhi, first as Research Assistant on stipend basis from

6.4.1992 to 16.5.1994, and then as Research Officer in the scale of

pay of Rs.2200-4000/- (4th
CPC
) with effect from 17.5.1994 to

16.5.1996. Her contract appointment as Research Officer was

extended by two more years w.e.f. 17.5.1996.

(B) While continuing as Research Officer for the second term

of two years on contract basis, the applicant was awarded
OA No.3963/2014

Fellowship in the scale of pay of Rs.12000-18000/- (5th
CPC
) in

IDSA for two years w.e.f. 15.7.1997, and another Fellowship for two

years w.e.f. 1.7.1999.

(C ) During the term of her said second Fellowship, the NSCS

appointed the applicant as Research Fellow against a post of

Deputy Secretary in the NSCS, in the scale of pay of Rs.12000-

16500/- (5th
CPC
) from 16.8.2000 to 27.9.2002, on loan basis. She

returned to IDSA on 27.9.2002. She resigned from IDSA and was

relieved of her duties w.e.f. 10.8.2003. She was paid salary and

terminal benefits by IDSA up to 10.8.2003.

(D) Thereafter, the applicant was appointed as Deputy

Secretary in the scale of Rs.12000-16500/- (5th
CPC
) in NSCS on

contract basis with effect from 3.10.2003 for a period of two years

or until further orders whichever was earlier, vide notification dated

8.12.2003, and office order dated 12.12.2003, issued by the NSCS.

Thus, the applicant joined NSCS on a fresh contract w.e.f.

3.10.2003. Her said contract appointment as Deputy

Secretary/Joint Director was extended for a further period of 2

years w.e.f. 3.10.2005 on the terms and conditions of services
laid

down in
the agreement, vide order dated 5.6.2006.

(E) Thereafter, the applicant was appointed as Director in

NSCS in the pay scale of Rs.14300-18300/- w.e.f. 29.9.2006 for a

period of 5 years on fresh contract, vide order dated 6.10.2006. The
OA No.3963/2014

said contract appointment was extended for one more year, i.e., up

to 28.9.2012, vide order dated 27.09.2011. Before her said contract

appointment came to an end, the applicant was absorbed as

Director in NSCS w.e.f. 12.4.2012, vide office order dated 12.4.2012

(Annexure A/1).

(F) After her absorption in the post of Director w.e.f.

12.4.2012, the applicant made representation dated 6.3.2013

regarding maintenance of her Service Book, and met the Dy.N.S.A.

on 20.11.2013 regarding her promotion as Joint Secretary. The

respondent-NSCS, vide communication dated 26.11.2013

(Annexure A/2), informed the applicant that her service in IDSA,

and subsequent service in NSCS, with the two being separated by a

month and 22 days, cannot be reckoned to be one continuum, and

therefore, an assessment of her claim for promotion will have to be

made with reference to her date of joining in NSCS on October 3,

2003, and in accordance with Recruitment Rules and set

procedures.

(G) Being dissatisfied, the applicant made further

representation dated 11.12.2013 claiming consideration of her case

for promotion to the grade of Joint Secretary. The respondent-

NSCS, vide its communication dated 29.4.2014 (Annexure A/3),

informed the applicant that she did not fulfill the eligibility criteria
OA No.3963/2014

laid down in
the Recruitment Rules for promotion to the post of

Joint Secretary.

(H) Therefore, the applicant has filed the present O.A. under

Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, seeking the

following reliefs:

"8.a) To quash and set aside the respondent's
orders dated 12-4-2012, 26-11-2013 and 29-

4-2014 (Annexure: A-1, A-2 and A-3) and order
the respondent for applicant's absorption on
the post of Deputy Secretary to the Govt. of
India w.e.f. 3-10-2003 and to further order the
respondent to treat the applicant's
appointment dated 29-9-2006 on the post of
Director as promotion w.e.f. from 29-9-2006 as
already stated by the respondent vide order
dated 6-10-2006 and to further order the
respondent to consider the applicant for
promotion to the post of Joint Secretary in pay
scale of Rs.37400-67000 + Grade Pay of
Rs.10,000/- as on 1-10-2009 as per the NSCS
Recruitment Rules, 2007 and to reckon her
service in IDSA in continuum for the purpose
of retirement and pension benefits under CCS
Pension Rules, 1972.

8.b) Pass such other order(s) as may be deemed fit
in the interest of justice."

153. Thus, in the present O.A., the applicant has mainly

raised three issues, namely, (1) her absorption from 3.10.2003; (2)

promotion as Joint Secretary, and (3) to reckon her service in IDSA

in continuum for pensionary and other service benefits.
OA No.3963/2014

154. When the applicant had accepted her appointments as

Deputy Secretary/Joint Director on contract basis w.e.f. 3.10.2003,

and as Director in NSCS w.e.f 29.9.2006 on contract basis, for

specified periods, and had entered into agreements/contracts with

the NSCS, and when the NSCS, vide its order dated 12.4.2012

(Annexure A/1), had absorbed her in the post of Director w.e.f.

12.4.2012, I do not find any substance in the claim of the

applicant for being absorbed in NSCS w.e.f. 3.10.2003.

155. Furthermore, it transpires that the applicant never made

any representation before the departmental authority questioning

the office order dated 12.4.2012 and claiming absorption in NSCS

with effect from 3.10.2003, i.e., the date when she had joined the

NSCS as Deputy Secretary/Joint Director on contract basis for a

period of two years. She has, for the first time, raised the said issue

in the present O.A.
Section 20
of the Administrative Tribunals Act,

1985, stipulates that a Tribunal shall not ordinarily admit an

application unless it is satisfied that the applicant had availed of all

the remedies available to him. As the applicant has not approached

the respondent-NSCS in the matter of her absorption w.e.f.

3.10.2003, she cannot be held to have availed of the remedy

available to her, and, therefore, the present O.A. is liable to be

rejected as being hit by
Section 20
of the Administrative Tribunals

Act, 1985.
OA No.3963/2014

156. As per the National Security Council Secretariat (Group

'A' Services) Recruitment Rules, 2007, in case of promotion to the

grade of Joint Secretary, officers of NSCS have to fulfill the following

eligibility criteria:

(a) 2 years regular service in Director (DIG scale Grade

Pay Rs.8900/-), or

(b) 3 years regular service in Director scale (Grade Pay

Rs.8700/-), or

(c) 8 years regular service in Deputy Secretary's scale

(grade Pay Rs.7600/-);

with total continuous Group 'A' service of 17 years.

The applicant cannot be said to have fulfilled the eligibility criteria

of minimum total continuous Group 'A' service of 17 years for

promotion as Joint Secretary. Prior to her joining NSCS, she was

working in IDSA on contract basis. She resigned from IDSA w.e.f.

10.8.2003, and got all terminal benefits from IDSA. Thereafter, she

joined NSCS on contract basis as Deputy Secretary/Joint Director

w.e.f. 3.10.2003. As the eligibility service of an employee counts

from the date of absorption, and the service rendered on contract

basis, not being regular service, cannot be taken into account for

counting eligibility service for promotion to higher grade, I do not

find any substance in the claim of the applicant that she had put in
OA No.3963/2014

more than 17 years of Group A service in terms of the Recruitment

Rules for promotion to the post of Joint Secretary.

157. The applicant's appointment as Director with effect from

29.9.2006 was on a fresh contract. She herself had signed a fresh

contract while accepting the said offer of appointment. There was

also no provision in the Recruitment Rules of 2001 for promotion

from the post of Deputy Secretary to the post of Director. Therefore,

the claim of the applicant that she was promoted from the post of

Deputy Secretary/Joint Director to the post of Director in 2006 is

untenable. The provision regarding promotion from the post of

Deputy Secretary/Joint Director to the post of Director was made

only in the National Security Council Secretariat (Group 'A' Service)

Recruitment Rules, 2007. The respondent-NSCS, vide order dated

20.10.2014 (Annexure R/13), rectified the office order dated

6.10.2006, ibid, where the word 'promotion' was inadvertently

mentioned. In this view of the matter, I do not find any substance in

the contention of the applicant that her appointment as Deputy

Secretary/Joint Director was deemed to be regularized with effect

from 3.10.2003 on the issuance of the office order dated 6.10.2006

by the respondent-NSCS promoting her from the post of Deputy

Secretary/Joint Director to the post of Director with effect from

29.9.2006 on contract basis.
OA No.3963/2014

158. As already noted, the applicant was working in IDSA on

contract basis. Consequent to her resignation, she was relieved

from IDSA w.e.f. 10.8.2003. She was paid all terminal benefits up to

10.8.2003. Thereafter, she joined NSCS again on contract basis

with effect from 3.10.2003, and continued to work in NSCS on

contract basis till 12.4.2012 when she was absorbed in the post of

Director. The CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, were applicable to regular

appointees up to 31.12.2003. The regular employees with effect

from 1.1.2004 were eligible for New Pension Scheme. Therefore, I do

not find any substance in the applicant's claim to reckon her

service in IDSA in continuum for the purpose of retirement and

pension benefits under the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.

159. The decisions relied on by the applicant, which have been

discussed by the learned Administrative Member, being

distinguishable on facts, are of no help to the case of the applicant.

160. Resultantly, the O.A. is dismissed as being hit by
Section
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, and also being devoid

of merit. No costs.
