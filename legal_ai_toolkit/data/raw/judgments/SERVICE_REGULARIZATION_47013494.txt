Patna
Bench OA No.050/00033/2024

7. Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA are that

applicant was initially appointed as Casual Labour through due process of law

on 29.11.1989 and was subsequently granted Temporary Status w.e.f.

29.11.1993 by the respondents vide order dated 31.10.1991 (Annexure A-2).

After completion of three years regular service with temporary status, the

respondents declared him a temporary government servant at par with Group-D

employee we.f. 29.11.1993 vide order dated 27.07.1995 (Annexure A-5) and

holding the same status, applicant retired from service on 29.02.2020 at par

with Group-D employee against MTS post after getting all benefits applicable

to a permanent government employee, except pension. The respondents

regularized batch-mate Shri Kaushal Kumar Singh vide order dated 02.01.2020

and other similarly placed Annexure A-7 & Annexure A-1 but discriminated

applicant.

8. It is further stated by the applicant that respondents issued one Gradation

List as on 01.01.2019 of such employees in which name of applicant figured at

sl. No.06 where in the date of his temporary status has been shown but date at

4 OA No. /050/0033/2024

par with Group-D status has not been shown purposely for the reasons best

known to the respondents. As the applicant was near to retire, he submitted a

self-explanatory representation on 25.01.2019 for granting pension and other

consequential benefits but when the said representation was not responded to by

the respondents, applicant along with two others filed OA No.278/2019 which

came to be disposed of on 02.01.2020 with direction to the respondents to take

decision about regularization of the applicant within 30 days since he is going

to superannuate from service on 29.02.2020.

9. It is further stated that applicant retired from service on 29.02.2020 but

Patna no action was taken by the respondents on the representation of the applicant.
Bench

But after one year of his retirement, respondents passed the Impugned Order

mechanically without application of mind towards the fact and legal position

that applicant has completed more than 27 yeas of service as a temporary

Government servant at par with Group-D employee whereas other two co-

applicants have been regularized against same post of MTS vide order dated

09.03.2020 (Annexure A-7) discriminating the applicant.

10. Applicant stated that in many similar and identical cases, this Tribunal

has decided cases granting pension and other pensionary benefits to the

applicants therein and upheld by Hon'ble High Court of Patna where it has been

held that once an employee has completed more than 10 years of service at par

with Group-D employee even without any order of regularization, have been

allowed pension and other consequential benefits, hence impugned order is per-

se-illegal and contrary to judicial pronouncements. Even after receipt of said

order dated 28.01.2021, applicant preferred a representation dated 24.08.2021

for re-consideration but no order has been passed till date.

5 OA No. /050/0033/2024

11. It is clear from the aforesaid submissions and judicial pronouncements

mentioned above that the applicant is being deprived of pension which is

recurring in nature and he is not at fault rather it is an administrative fault/lapse

as his representation dated 24.08.2021 is still pending adjudication. Hence,

applicant humbly stated that the present OA be decided in his favour.

12. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have filed

written statement and narrated the background of the present matter. It is stated

that the applicant was initially engaged as Casual Labour on 29.11.1989 and

thereafter on completion of three years regular service, he was promoted at par

Patna with temporary group-D employee vide Office Memo dated 27.07.1995.
Bench

Applicant retired on 29.02.2020 as Casual Worker at par with temporary

Group-D. Hence, the applicant is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for in

the present OA.

13. It is further stated in the WS that as per settled position, applicant would

have come under old pension scheme had his service got regularized before

retirement whereas applicant retired on 29.02.2020. It is asserted that there were

only two (UR-01 and OBC-01) approved vacancies at Patna GPO for the year

2020 as communicated by order dated 02.01.2020 in OA No.278 of 2019

(Annexure A-6) complied vide letter dated 26.02.2020 (Annexure R/2) batch-

mates regularized. Further, on recommendation of DPC two officials were

found fit for promotion to MTS cadre namely Shri Mahendra Kumar and Shri

Kaushal Kumar Singh against the unfilled vacancies for the year 2020 vide

office order dated 09.03.2020 (Annexure R/3) and candidature of the applicant

was not considered as sufficient number of eligible senior employees were

available.

6 OA No. /050/0033/2024

14. Respondents have further stated in the WS that since the applicant was

not regularized before his retirement, he cannot lay a claim for pension and/or

pensionary benefits as also the benefit of MTS.

is an obligation of the employer under the law and the state as
Patna an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State
Bench
Policy envisaged in Part-IV of the Constitution should
provide the same. After rendering three years of continuous
service with temporary status, the casual labouers shall be
treated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the
Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
benefits as are admissible to Group "D" employees on regular
basis."

(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of Yashwant
Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in (1996) 7 SCC 113,
dealing with question for determination "whether appellant is entitled to
any pensionary benefits since total service of more than eighteen years
was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held:-

"3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the
appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of
quasi-permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was
necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.
It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was
in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary
benefits.

There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was
not made permanent even when he had served the Government for
18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied
the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a
permanent employee of the government. The appellant having
served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to
treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.

Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we
hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent
after he served the Government for such a long period. The services
of the appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he
shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to
treat the appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980
after serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of
permanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be
finalized within six months from the receipt of this order. The

14 OA No. /050/0033/2024

appellant shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date
of retirement.

(iii) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical facts
and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain Singh,
CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017. Their Lordships was
seisin with similar issue as decided by Central Administrative Tribunal
Bench, Patna in O.A. No. 900 of 2012 vide order dated 18.2.2016 The
Union of India- Ministry of Communication, Department of Posts taken
plea as before Tribunal that services of private respondents Temporary
Status Casual Labour, was never regularized nor worked on a regular
group 'D' post till his retirement. Therefore he is not entitled to pensioner
benefits. Their Lordships in case of
Kritnarain Singh
(supra) affirmed
view taken by this Tribunal in OA No. 900/2012 based on Hon'ble High
Court Patna judgement dated 15.12.2015 in CWJC No. 17204/2015. So
also their Lordships observed that Tribunal has taken correct view

favour of an employee and that judgment stands and holds the field and
writ application dismissed.

Patna facts and legal issue in case of
Union of India versus Smt Ram Kali
Bench Devi, DWJC No.

temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992 and he
died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more than 25 years
of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in temporary status begets
the benefits of pension. Failure on part of postal department not to
regularize services of husband of private respondents cannot be
appreciated. Their Lordships decided in favour of temporary status
employee at par with Group 'D' employee and upheld order dated
22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna). So also observed that in
similar and identical cases adjudicated in favour of employees in OA No.

into the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 23.10.1992 and died in
harness on 15.11.2007 and his legal heirs is entitled to benefit of
pension/family pension or not ?"

So also held that sub-clause (3) of clause (2) of Para 5 of Casual
Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization Scheme is

15 OA No. /050/0033/2024

crystal clear that temporary employees is entitled to pension and
retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of service in the
temporary status followed by regularization. Their Lordships further

(vi) The Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla in
Patna CWP No. 2299 of 2014, The Sr. Superintendent of Posts offices versus
Bench Shri Painu Ram decided on 23.7.2018, dealing with identical issue on
facts and legal points and law as involved in present O.A "whether a part
timer, who was conferred temporary status was entitled for same benefits,
as are admissible to reglar employees in terms of instructions dated
12.4.1991 as amended on 30.11.1992 issued by respondent department

Supreme Court in
Jagritti Mazdoor Union (Regd
) (supra) and held that
after the conferment of the temporary status upon the present respondent,
he was entitled for benefits which are accrueable to a regular Group 'D'
employee after completion of three years of service on temporary basis.
So also considered judgements of various Benches of learned Tribunal
and upheld the order dated 31.1.2014 in O.A. No. 426/HP/2013
(Chandigarh).

(vii) Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh
in case of
Mrs. Alka Sharma versus Union of India
, 2017 (2) SCT 739
(P&H) (DB) dealing with the issue in the case of widow of the railway
employee in pari materia provision of family pension "whether widow of
temporary employee not been subsequently appointed on substantive post
could be granted pension and family pension under Railway Services
(Pension) Rules as for no fault of deceased employee on lapses on
railways could not be considered for regularization". The Hon'ble High
Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such
lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The
Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family
Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased
employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary
capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary
employee.

The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of
family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by
notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for
a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.

16 OA No. /050/0033/2024

20. In the other similar and identical situation, The Central Administrative
Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of original applicants on
similar facts and legal issue as involved in the present OA in hand and some of
them are cited as under:-

(a)(i) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018

Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors
decided on
28.10.2021. The said O.A. was filed by Night Guard working in
Department of Posts seeking pension and other pensionary benefits in
terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read with GID (3) below Rule 2
of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.

The learned Tribunal observed that as per
judgement by The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Uma Devi
's case,
Department of Posts has circulated policy in June/July 2014 for
regularization of casual labours having worked for ten years or more and
vide judgement dated 13.11.2017 Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC
No. 12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the policy. The applicant
Awadhesh Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984 on
daily wages, conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and retired on
October, 2019 after 35 years of total service as temporary status and not
been regularized.

Patna The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of clause
Bench 5 of Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66-9/91-SPB. I
dated 30th November, 1992- benefits to a casual labour on completion of
three years service in Temporary status become entitled to be treated at
par with temporary Group 'D' employees of the Department of Posts and
would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D'
employees on regular basis such as counting of service for purposes of
pension and terminal benefits as in the case of temporary employees
appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and retirement
benefits after the regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order
relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in case of
Prem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others

reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-

"35. There are some of the employees who have not been
regularized in spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or
more years whereas they have been superannuated. As they have
worked in work-charged establishment, not against any particular
project, their services ought to have been regularized under the
Government instructions and even as per the decision of this
Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma Devi 2006
(4) SCC 1. This Court in the said decision has laid down that in
case services have been rendered for more than ten years without
the cover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services
be regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those
employees who have worked for ten years or more should have
been regularized. It would not be proper to regulate them for
consideration of regularisation as others have been regularised,
we direct that their services be treated as a regular one. However,
it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to claiming any dues
of difference in wages had they been continued in service
regularly before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall
be entitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the
regular establishment and the services rendered by them right
from the day they entered the work-charged establishment shall
be counted as qualifying service for purpose of pension.

36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P.
Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered
in the work-charged establishment shall be treated as qualifying
service under the aforesaid rule for grant of pension. The arrears
of pension shall be confined to three years only before the date of
the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid accordingly within

17 OA No. /050/0033/2024

three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the employees are
allowed and filed by the State are dismissed."

OA No.050/00143/2018 Awadhesh Prasad Singh vs. Union of
India & Ors.
). Their Lordships vide order dated 08.04.2024, heard the matter
at length and observed that no prima facie case made out. Thereafter vide
order dated 20.06.2024 upheld order dated 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018.
The present OA on hand also no different.

(b) In the similar and identical situation the learned Coordinate Bench
Chandigarh of the Tribunal recently in October 2023 adjudicated in OA
No. 060/690/2019 (Chandigarh) Santosh Kumar versus Union of
India & ors allowed OA directing to grant family pension and other
retiral benefits of the deceased employee. The learned Tribunal dealt
issue "whether the person who has not been regularized by the
respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2) of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972
is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal has considered the matter and
examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules, 1972 and observed
that provisions are pari materia to Rule 75- Family Pension Scheme for
Patna Railway servants, 1954.
So also held that case is covered by judgement in

Bench

case of
Alka Sharma vs Union of India & ors
2017 (2) SCT (P&H)
(DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana.

So also case of

Sr. Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram
in CWP.

No.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of
Himachal Pradesh and reliance has also been placed upon judgement
passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Jagrit Mazdoor Union
(Regd) and others vs Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd & anr
etc,
1990 supp. SC 113.

So also observed that case is fully covered by
judgement of Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh in matter of

Union of India vs Meena Devi
in CWP No. 34 of 2014 decided on
23.7.2018.

21. In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue "applicant casual
labour of department of posts obtaining temporary status accordance with the
scheme not regularized retired on 29.02.2020 is entitled to pension and
pensionary benefits."

22. Admittedly, applicant was initially engaged as Casual Labourer in year
1989. The department of posts vide instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all
daily wagers working in post offices are to be treated as casual labourers. The
department of posts has made Scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of
Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme effective from 01.10.1989.
The scheme provided provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual
labourers. So also the scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D'
regular employee available on conferment of status of temporary employee.

23. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Jagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.
1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that

18 OA No. /050/0033/2024

substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same
emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
temporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal
department on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240
days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal
employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly
with regular employees in the department.

24. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in
Jagrit Mazdoor
Union
(supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-

"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the
casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of
the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are
admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis."

25.
In compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Jagrit Mazdoor Union
(supra). The Department of Posts, Government of
India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary
Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been
drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and
Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously
pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers
working continuously for long period.

26. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and
beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits
to long continuous working of casual labourers.

27. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on applicant -
while working as casual labour in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant
is appointee of year 1989 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize
and ought to have been regularized before superannuation on 29.02.2020
accordance with law as regular employee for no fault of applicant made to
suffer violating
Article 14
, 21
, 31A
and
of the Constitution of India.

28. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1993
pursuant to order dated 31.10.1991 (Annexure A-2) and the statutory binding
scheme has conferred after 3 years certain advantages to temporary employee
w.e.f. 29.11.1993 as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the pay scale

19 OA No. /050/0033/2024

for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA. Para 3 provides
for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'
employee after completion of one year of service from date of conferment of
Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of increment to a
government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent is clear as
noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and writ in the
nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as social
legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The Central
Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State
Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating temporary
status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group 'D'
employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and
entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on
Patna
Bench regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity
Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary
status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on
absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation
with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically
provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three
years continuous service as temporary status.

29. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 29.11.1993 and
accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial
construction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after three
years since 29.11.1993 has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees
and regularly contributed to G.P.F w.e.f. 27.07.1995 vide Order dated
27.07.1995. So also declared at par with Group-D vide order dated 27.07.1995
(Annexure A-3) The applicant was in capacity of Group 'D' employee. The
applicant having continuously worked as temporary status casual labourer since
29.11.1993 and on 27.07.1995 declared at par with Group 'D' employee vide
Annexure A-3 is holder of post of temporary employee/ permanent status and
deserves to be dealt fairly by the model employer state accordance with
guarantee enshrined in the
Article 14
and
of the Constitution of India. This
Tribunal is of the view whereof that it is unfair to continue the applicant such a
long in temporary post and without considering for regularizing till retirement.

20 OA No. /050/0033/2024

30. The applicant declared at par with Group -D employee vide order dated
27.07.1995 (Annexure A-3) acquired status of Group 'D' employee of
Department of Posts and it is well settled in law that entitled for such benefits
as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis. So also held by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Jagrit Mazdoor Union
(supra). Batch-mate of
applicant in OA No.278 of 2019 Kaushal Kumar Singh regularized vide order
dated 26.02.2020 (Annexure R/2 annexed with WS).

31. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no
recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers
available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged
statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the
Constitution of India and applicant husband not regularized as for no fault
Patna
Bench cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his duty
and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take
advantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them
that since no regularization no pension etc.

32. The applicant before retirement submitted representation dated
25.01.2019 to allow to regularize services on regular cadre post. Respondents
stated in WS that applicant could not be considered for regularization as Group
'D' through selection in view of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual
labourers. The written statement and averments of OA that respondents not
regularized services of applicant and rejected the representation after retirement
vide Impugned Order dated 28.01.2021 (Annexure A-1). The applicant was
never at fault for such lack of regularization served for more than 27 years as
temporary employee.

33. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in
the O.A that respondents have not regularized services on regular post as per
law on time, in spite of written requests dated 25.01.2019 and retired on
29.02.2020 without being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view since
respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated
12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 1982. Hence
respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny
retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee before retirement. The
matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to

21 OA No. /050/0033/2024

applicant and he ought to have at least considered for regularization before date
of superannuation. The applicant worked since 1989 till 29.02.2020 almost
more than twenty seven (27) years in the department as temporary employee at
par with Group-D.

34. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein
above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated
30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of
casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status
reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the employee in
light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away by
respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.
Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of
Patna
Bench
implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged
in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are
substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to
employee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and
tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless
regularized no pensionry benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not
be denied relief claimed.

35. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992
quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal
department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly
acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits admissible to temporary
Group 'D' employee such as counting of service for purpose of pension and
terminal benefits as in case of temporary employees appointed on regular basis
while granting them pension and retirement benefits after their regularization.

36. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are
regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The
Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death
gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as
are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS
Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension
and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2

22 OA No. /050/0033/2024

CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive
appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Rules 2021.

37. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as
extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes
temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021
are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So also the
explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6) cases
of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services and
posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December, 2003,
who retired or were retired before having been appointed in a substantive
capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the government
servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)
Patna
Bench
Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as admissible to any other
public servant and respondents have violated fundamental right enshrined in

Article 14
and
of Constitution of India.

38. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years
service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992
provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement
benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed
by regularization.

39. The applicant stood retired on 29.02.2020 as temporary employee for no
fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge his duties and no
rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2021
and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension, family pension and
retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status of employee was at par
with regular employee on long continuation on temporary post in welfare state.
The Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would
prevail over any policy decision.

40. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it
clear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a
substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type of category of
temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity,
death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant same scale as

23 OA No. /050/0033/2024

admissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent
provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-

(i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation
after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent
service of not less than 10 years.

(ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of
continuous temporary service.

(iii) In event of death while in service.

41. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes
clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021
(erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of
whereof of the affirm view that Government of India, Department of Posts
instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992
and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read
Patna conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial
Bench
legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered
service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes
entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the
part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension
Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers
the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state
as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy
envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.

42. Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses
and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and applicant entitled to
receive pension as if retired from regular establishment and so also held by
Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgment in case of
Prem Singh versus
State of U.P & Ors
(2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced herein above.

43. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in
case of
Union of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.
154 of 2019 decided
on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in
O.A. No. 372/2017 (
Bhikhani Devi Vs Union of India
) as Tribunal relied on
ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against
same.

Their Lordships in case of
Bhikhani Devi
(supra) observed that
judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none
of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that

24 OA No. /050/0033/2024

there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'
unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an
employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be
admissible.

44. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the Division
Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal issue dealt in
detail rules applicable in case of

Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual
labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual
Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal

54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia provision in Rule 75 of
family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted that
Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a regular
employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari Kakkar

Prasad Singh versus Union of India & Ors. related to temporary status
employee not regularized, allowed OA directing respondents to settle pension
and all pensionary benefits treating his superannuation. This Tribunal in case
Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order dated 17.01.2022 directed respondents to
process for issuance of Pension Payment Order.
Order dated 17.01.2022 in
OA
No.36/2021, Rameshwari Devi
case was challenged in CWJC No.7859 of
2022 and Hon'ble High Court, Patna, their Lordships on all arrears amount
directed to pay interest at rate of 8% in light of Hon'ble Supreme Court
decision in case of Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of UP, (2001) 9 SCC 687.

51. Case of Rita Devi versus Union of India, OA No.2630 of 2021 (CAT
Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased employee
worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while working
as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in Postal
Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension etc.
This
Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008 (
Meena Devi vs.
Union of India
) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015
(
Union of India versus Meena Devi
) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,
Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.

Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was

27 OA No. /050/0033/2024

whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -
without regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this
Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as

In case of
Shiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others

O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) upheld by Hon'ble High Court of
Patna. This Tribunal was seisin with issue - whether applicant who retired more
than 25 years service as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' without
regularization is entitled for pension and other retirement benefits? Applicant
was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post and applicant did not accept
Patna
Bench
and continued as Temporary Status and retired as temporary status employee at
par with Group 'D'. Applicant started employment as Night Guard on daily
basis in Postal Department, conferred status of Temporary Status, selected as
MTS, did not join denied pension, family pension.

This Tribunal in case
Shiv
Shankar Sah
(Supra) considered orders passed in similar facts in OA
No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015 upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017
by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on part of Postal Department not to
regularize the services of husband, private respondent in 23 years of service
after having granted temporary status at par with Group 'D' employee and
conduct of postal department cannot be appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble
High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017 upheld order passed by this
Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing respondents to grant pensionary
benefits even without regularization under old pension scheme.

53. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that as per rules
for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on
regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service
after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On
working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'
employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not
regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of
respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise
meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible
for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order

28 OA No. /050/0033/2024

passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not
regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension.
In case of

entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary
Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on
03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service
and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.

54. In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.
No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue
applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary
status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at
part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension
Patna
Bench
denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on
regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not
issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right
accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule
2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
So also placed reliance in case OA
No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of
2017 in
Ratneshwar Singh

CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA
No.372/2017.

55. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India
& Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this
Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships
considered argument of respondents department that contention of department
cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be
construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying
for more than 27 years.
This Tribunal in
OA No.050/00396 of 2019
Shatrughan Prasad versus Union of India
vide order dated 02.07.2024 has
allowed identical OA.

39.
In
Yashwant Hari Katakkar
(supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was
not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½

benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent
employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances
appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the
government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be

of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019
(Annexure - A/5 with OA) in paragraph 3, their Lordships held - "These

regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by
petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted
by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be
construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was

32 OA No. /050/0033/2024

occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed
in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in
paragraph 11 of impugned judgment comes to the aid of respondent-
petitioner." In view of law
