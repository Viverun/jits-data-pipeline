Heard in part. After having heard the arguments for

considerable time, we feel that there are certain aspects in the

reply, which needs to be clarified, more particularly regarding

the relationship of landlord and tenant between the cultivator

and the owners, i.e., Devta.

Apart from that, even the applicability of Abolition of

Big Landed Estate Act, 1953 and
H.P Tenancy and Land

Reforms Act, 1972
is required to be clarified as to whether

these Acts would per se apply to the case of the Devtas and in

addition to the aforesaid, there appears to be contradiction in

para 4 of the reply filed by the respondents to the writ petition,

where at the first place, it has been mentioned that the excess

land owned by the Devta was vested with the State

Government and thereafter, transferred to the tenants

(Annexure A/3). Whereas in the subsequent para, it has been

denied that the land of the Devta has been transferred to the

name of the tenants solely on the basis of the aforesaid Acts.

Let a comprehensive affidavit in this regard be filed on or

before the next date of hearing.

This petition was disposed of vide order dated

Committee during the course of the day and

Today, the respondents have handed over the

instructions, which goes to reveal that in replies to the final

orders passed by this Court, the matter was examined in detail

by the Committee, so constituted for this purpose. On brief

examination of the instant case, the technical parameters as

formed by the Committee are as under:-

Relaxation is required.

The petrol pumps have been classified to be an essential

commodity as per Section 2A & Schedule 1 of the
Essential

Commodities Act, 1955
. For the development of the land in

question, the following general regulations of Appendix-I of

HPTCP Rules, 2014 are applicable:

"III. General Regulations
The following provisions shall be applicable where no
specific mention is made, namely:-

3. Maximum acceptable slope for development shall be
45 degrees.

::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:38:04 :::CIS

II. Maximum hill cut of 3.50 Metre height shall be
permissible."

.

Section 28 of the H.P Town and Country Planning Rules,

2014 reads as under:-

"28. Relaxation in setbacks, height of floors

and building etc. may be allowed in Government
projects in the public interest. In case of private
construction/projects relaxation in setbacks,

height of floors and building etc. may be
considered by the Competent Authority keeping
in view the site conditions. However, in private

projects having plot area of more than one

hectare, relaxation shall be allowed by the State
Government only.

According to the Technical Committee, after

examining the technical and legal aspects of the case, it was

found that the case of the petitioner for proposed construction

of retail outlet pump as stated above is a public utility and is

located in Non-Core Area of Shimla Planning Area.

Furthermore, the Committee also found that the construction

proposed is not in relation to building construction but only for

the development of land/site in question and, therefore,

following two relaxations are required in the instant case:-

i. Hill cutting beyond permissible limits of 3.50 mtrs.

ii. Relaxation in overall slope of the site from 52

degrees to 45 degrees.

As regards the first relaxation, it is not in dispute that

only application for sanctioning of plans for construction are

required to be submitted to the concerned department, which

::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:38:04 :::CIS

in turn shall then ensure that no construction activity takes

place where the slope is more than 45 degrees/35 degrees.

.

As regards the second relaxation, the proposal for retail

petrol pump outlet is to be constructed in and around 20

metres of the total plot area and this condition is duly fulfilled

by the petitioner. Once that be so, obviously, the slope where

the construction is proposed will naturally be less than 45

degrees once the hill cutting is carried out.

In such circumstances, we direct the respondents to

consider the case of the petitioner for relaxation as aforesaid

within a period of two weeks from today.

For compliance to come up on 23.5.2022.

It would be noticed that the petitioner filed an

application for cancellation of mutation, which was sanctioned

as far back as on 30.8.1975. This application was filed after

more than 45 years of sanction of the mutation. Yet, it has not

only been entertained by the Deputy Commissioner, Mandi,

but he in turn has called for the report of Tehsildar Balh,

district Mandi.

It is really surprising as to how the Deputy

Commissioner, Mandi could have called for the report without

going into the question whether the application filed by the

petitioner was within prescribed period of limitation and the

same was either maintainable. Even otherwise, no provisions

of law have been quoted in the application, which could

indicate the jurisdiction of the Collector/Deputy

Commissioner, Mandi.

In such circumstances, issue notice. Mr. Vinod

Thakur, learned Additional Advocate General appears and

waives service of notice on behalf of the respondents.

Reply/instructions be filed within six weeks. In the

meanwhile, further proceedings in the application for

cancellation of mutation filed by the petitioner, which is stated

to be pending before second respondent, shall remain stayed.

water prior to commissioning of the scheme in the year

2007.

assisted by Mr. Arjun K. Lal, Advocate, would argue that the

instant petition is liable to be dismissed at the threshold as on

the one hand, the petitioner claims himself to be a leading

jurist of this country and on the other hand, he has failed to

::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:38:05 :::CIS

array Shalooni University as party respondent. Even the

petitioner, has not been specifically stated in the petition.

5 In rebuttal, Mr. Ankush Dass Sood, learned Sr.

Advocate, assisted by Mr. Manik Sethi, Advocate, would argue

that since he has already annexed relevant orders, therefore,

this ground is neither contentious nor changeable at the

instance of respondent-University.

submissions at this stage.

On 26.8.2021, this Court passed the following

order:

"Reply to the execution petition was filed as far as back

on 16.3.2020. Thereafter, a lot of changes have taken

place including recommendations of the case of the
petitioner for regularization which is stated to be
pending before the Board of Management and probably

for want of meeting, no decision has been taken.

the meeting of Board of Management within two weeks

and take a decision, as aforesaid; and report
compliance on the next date of hearing.

2 It appears that while passing the aforesaid order,

this Court was not apprised of the latest factual position,

which has now come on record by way of supplementary

affidavit filed on behalf of the Registrar of the respondent-

University, which reveals that the meetings of the Finance

Committee and Board of Management had already been held

on 9.6.2021 and 11.6.2021 respectively, wherein it was

observed as under:

"The Finance Committee discussed and considered the
proposal but did not approve the same, as this proposal
was not examined/prepared as per policy. Moreover, no

::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:38:05 :::CIS

financial liability has been worked out in respect of this
proposal."

.

3 The supplementary affidavit further reveals that

the matter has bee n referred to the Students Welfare Officer

for calculating the financial liability on account of Mess

Helpers/Cooks, who have been reinstated on outsource basis.

4 Now that the matter has been referred to the

Students Welfare Officer, it is expected that an early decision

in the matter would be taken by the said officer.

5 Accordingly, the matter is adjourned to

25.11.2021, when fresh status report be filed by Registrar of

Cr.MP No.1358/2021

Appellant/applicant No.2, Jasmer Singh, has

once again moved the instant application for suspension

of sentence. Earlier application (Cr.MP No.973/2021) was

rejected at the time of admission of the appeal vide order

dated 22.6.2021.

2 In the application now filed, it has been

averred that the applicant has two minor daughters and

one mentally retarded and physically challenged son.

Moreover, wife of the applicant is due for delivery and the

expected date is 21.9.2021. According to him, his family is

at the stage of starvation.

3 The respondent-State was put to notice and in

the instructions handed over to the Court, which are

made part of the record, the aforesaid facts have not been

denied.

4 Though, the applicant has been convicted and

sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of

ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- and in default

of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous

::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:38:05 :::CIS

imprisonment for one year, for the offence punishable

under
Section 20(b)(ii)(c)
of the Narcotic Drugs and

.

Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, however that, in

itself, does not affect the power of this Court to suspend

the sentence or grant the bail to the applicant; if

compelling and exceptional circumstances so warrant.

This power cannot be exercised in a routine and casual

manner, but has to be exercised sparingly, that too, in

exceptional circumstances.

5 Having regard to the totality of the facts and

circumstances of the instant case, more particularly,

taking into consideration the penurious circumstances

and indigent situation, in which the family of the

applicant is placed, we deem it proper to suspend the

sentence of the applicant for a period of three months.

Ordered accordingly.

6 Consequently, the applicant is ordered to be

released on bail, on his furnishing personal bond in the

sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety of the like amount to

the satisfaction of the concerned Jail Superintendent.

7 The applicant shall surrender himself on the

expiry of three months from today i.e. 14.12.2021 before

the Jail Superintendent, Bilaspur.

terms and disposed of.

It appears that the promotion to the post of Deputy

Registrar has been stayed since 26.2.2019.

We really wonder how this could have been done.

The post of Deputy Registrar is a functional post in the

University. The individual dispute cannot have primacy over

the larger public interest. Therefore, we deem it proper to

vacate the stay granted on 26.2.2019. Ordered accordingly.

However, we clarify that the promotion, if any, shall be subject

to the final outcome of the instant petition.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has filed an

application for amendment of the petition in the open court,

which is taken on record.

Learned counsel for the respondents jointly pray

for and are granted two weeks' time to file reply.

for over a period of two years, has not been filed by them,

although the case was listed before this Court on 16.12.2020,

respondents prayed for and were granted time to file reply.

justification for granting further time to file reply, however as a

matter of sheer indulgence and by way of last opportunity,

subject to costs of Rs.10,000/-, to be paid to the petitioner,

four weeks' further time is granted to do the needful. The costs

That no fundamental or constitutional right whatsoever

automatically solved. So far as sewerage related issue is
concerned , in this regard all residents of the Hari
Cottage had already represented to the Commissioner of
the respondent MC on
23.07.2020 ( Annexure R/42 ) and no action in this
regard has been taken till date."

respondent-Municipal Corporation, Shimla is ready and willing

.

to execute the work in question and it is only because of the

hindrances created by the persons residing in the locality that

the work is not being executed.

3 In this view of the matter, we direct respondent-

Municipal Corporation to execute the work in question and in

case any person has any grievance, he/she is at liberty to

approach this Court for redressal of grievance(s). However,

under any circumstances, would there be no hindrance(s) in

the execution of the work. The Municipal Corporation is at

liberty to approach the Superintendent of Police, Shimla in

case the police assistance is required.

4 Needless to say that the execution of the work

would be undertaken after carrying out necessary demarcation

so that there is no damage or obstruction caused to the private

properties in question.

5 Since the work in question has commenced in the

year 2018, it is expected that the work shall be executed as

expeditiously as possible and in no event later than

directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 2 lacs before the registry of

this Court and to continue to pay Rs.10,000/- per month to

the respondent.

Since there is no order of stay passed by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court, therefore, the mere fact the appellant

may have filed an SLP cannot be a ground not to deposit the

amount in question.

In this view of the matter, we restrain the

Executive Engineer, HPPWD Barsar Division from releasing

salary of the petitioner till further orders.

By medium of this petition, the petitioners-State

have sought to assail the award that was passed by the learned

Labour Court-cum-Industrial Tribunal, Kangra, at

Dharamshala, way back on 20.12.2017.

Even though, the petitioners-State have tried to

justify their inaction in not filing the petition within a

reasonable time in para 15 thereof, however, we are not at all

satisfied with the averments contained in para 15. The

petitioners-State have only tried to justify passing of the file

from one desk/department to another. Therefore, the instant

petition cannot be entertained.

Learned Advocate General prays for and is granted

four weeks' time to file a supplementary affidavit.

As per status report, dated, 9.11.2020, work of

laying down pipes for supply of potable water has been

completed and even testing of the line was done on

6.11.2020. It is also not in dispute that the petitioner has also

been provided with water connection. However, learned

counsel for the petitioner would argue that even though the

pipeline had been laid, but frequency of water is yet erratic and

for many days, there is no supply at all. More over, even water

tank that was constructed is leaking.

Let learned Advocate General obtain instructions

on the next date of hearing.

Heard. We are prima facie of the considered view

that majority of these litigations, among the industrialists and

truck operators, are frequently coming up before this Court

only on account of non-fixation of freight charges.

One similar issue came up before this Court in

CWPs No. 777/2020 and 5422/2020, wherein, on the

directions of this Court, the Deputy Commissioner, Solan,

after inviting all the stake holders, fixed the freight charges,

that too with consent of all the stake holders.

Therefore, in the given facts and circumstances of

the case, we deem it proper to direct the Deputy

Commissioner, Una, to undertake similar exercise, after

associating all the stake holders, within eights weeks from

today. Ordered accordingly.

We make it absolutely clear that each of the stake

holders shall be free to voice his grievance(s) including fixation

of quota of trucks, if any.

Notice. Mr. P. P. Chauhan, Advocate, appears and

waives service of notice on behalf of the respondent.

It is rather shocking to note that even though the

petition filed by the respondent herein was for restitution of

conjugal rights and even the judgment that was rendered by

the learned court below is to this effect.

However, perusal of the decree accompanying the

judgment, would show that the petition has been accepted and

the marriage between the parties has been dissolved by a

decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty, which obviously is

not in accordance with either prayer made in the petition or

findings rendered by the learned court below in the judgment

itself.

It is more than settled that the decree follows the

judgment. Therefore, let notice be issued to the official/officer,

who has drawn the decree in question to explain his conduct.

Since the instant appeal emanates out of a

matrimonial discord, therefore, let both the parties appear

before this Court on the next date of hearing.
