JUDGMENT

This is a suit filed by the plaintiffs against the defendants

seeking the relief of declaration by declaring that the order passed

by the 1st defendant in RD 197 LGB, 2003, dated 17-4-2003 as non-

est in the eye of law, grant of perpetual injunction against the 3 rd

defendant restraining it, its agent, men or anybody under or

through it from dispossessing the plaintiffs from the schedule

property or in any way interfering with the plaintiffs lawful

9 O.S.No.3666/2003

possession of schedule property and grant such other reliefs as

deemed fit under the circumstances of the case with costs.

2. The brief averments of the plaint are as under:-

Plaintiffs submit that originally one Sri. Linga Reddy resident

of Agara village, Begur Hobli, Bangalore South taluk, had four sons

namely Venkata Reddy, Gururva Reddy, Thimma Reddy and

Pasalappa Reddy and the plaintiffs herein are the grand sons and

the great grandsons of the above said Sri. Linga Reddy. Their

entire joint family owned and possessed joint ancestral properties

to an extent of 15 acres 11 guntas of land in Survey No. 31 of

Yellukunte village described as schedule property and 12 acres 31

guntas of land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte village, both

situated at Agara Village, Begur Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk.

Survey No.31 consisting of 15 Acres 11 guntas of land i.e. schedule

property was earlier comprised of 5 Survey Nos i.e. Survey No.

No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 and similarly Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte

village consisting of 12 Acres 31 guntas was earlier comprised in

four Survey No. 68, 70. 71. 72 and in the above survey numbers,

the great ancestor of the plaintiffs Sri.Pasalappa Reddy had

constructed a private tank during the year 1890 to be used as a

water resource for agricultural activities and during re-survey

10 O.S.No.3666/2003

operations conducted by the State Government through Land

Records Department in the year 1937, Survey Nos. 7 to 10 and 13

were consolidated and total extent of 15 Acres 11 guntas was

assigned new Survey No. 31 of Yellukunte village. During the year

1934-35, the then Deputy Commissioner by his order dated 25-11-

1935 in CL 1314/1934-35 ordered for merging of the above said

five Survey numbers in to Survey No.31 and in this order, the

existence of tank is mentioned and further the Department of Land

Records after the survey of the schedule property along with land

in Survey No.69, of Haralakutne village, had prepared a report

wherein it has been clearly mentioned that the great ancestor of

plaintiffs Sri.Pasappa Reddy had constructed private tank in the

schedule property as well as land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte.

From the documents and recitals therein, it is clear that the great

ancestor of plaintiffs namely Sri.Pasalappa Reddy owned and

possessed the schedule property as well as 12 acres 31 guntas of

land in Survey No.69 of Haralakunte village and had constructed

his own private tank. The plaintiffs and their family members

belonging to the Joint Hindu family succeeded to the schedule

property as well as the land comprised in Survey No.69 of

Haralakunte village and exercised their rightful ownership and

possession upon the same.

11 O.S.No.3666/2003

3. When this being the situation, to their shock and surprise, on

31-12-1994, the Tahsildar Bangalore South taluk suo-moto passed

an order thereby directing cancellation of names of the plaintiffs

family from the relevant revenue records on the ground that the

schedule property and the land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte

village are Government Tank. Aggrieved by the said order, one of

the family members of the plaintiffs challenged the said order

before the Asst. Commissioner in RA.No.127/1995-96 which came

to be dismissed for default and further the order of Asst.

Commissioner was challenged before the Hon'ble High Court of

Karnataka in W.P.No.22420/97 and the High Court quashed the

order passed by the Tahsildar and the Asst. Commissioner and

remanded back the matter for fresh disposal before the Special

Tahsildar for adjudicating the dispute between the plaintiffs and

the State Government in RRT 43/1998-99 which is still pending.

Owing to the orders passed by the Tahsildar cancelling the names

of the plaintiffs family members from the RTC, they have filed two

suits in O.S.4830/96 in respect of 12 Acres 31 guntas of land in

Survey No. 69 and O.S.No.1265/96 which came to be decreed in

favour of the plaintiffs and the same has been challenged by the

State Government before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in

RFA No.1050/2000. With regard to property in O.S.4830/96, the

12 O.S.No.3666/2003

City Civil Court has directed the state Government, Special

Tahsildar and the Deputy Commissioner to maintain status-quo

and with regard to land in Survey No.69 of Haralukunte Village, the

Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has passed an order of status-

quo. The schedule property is the absolute property of the

plaintiffs and their family members and neither the State

Government nor the defendants have got any manner of right,

title, interest or possession over the same and further the schedule

property is not the subject matter of acquisition either by the State

Government or by the 3rd defendant.

4. When this being the realities and when the plaintiffs are in

exclusive peaceful possession and enjoyment of the schedule

property, to their shock and surprise, the officials of the 3 rd

defendant appeared near the schedule property and threatened to

dispossess the plaintiffs from the schedule property and also

threatened to dismantle the structures existing in the schedule

property. The plaintiffs sent a legal notice to the 3 rd defendant on

9-4-2003 as per
section 64
of the BDA Act, and the 3rd defendant

after receiving the said notice kept quiet for some time, and again

they started to interfere with their peaceful possession and

enjoyment over the schedule property and when the plaintiffs

verified the defendants claim over the schedule property, to their

13 O.S.No.3666/2003

utter shock and dismay, they found that the 1st defendant has

ordered that all the legal proceedings between the plaintiffs and

the State Government have been decided against the plaintiffs and

the schedule property has been ordered to be transferred to the

3rd defendant authority and the plaintiffs made a tough task to

convince the officials of the 3rd defendant that the order passed by

3rd defendant is not only opposed to the real facts, but also

amounting to sub-judice and gross contempt of Court. Hence, the

plaintiffs having left with no other alternative are constrained to

seek the indulgence of this court seeking the reliefs as sought in

the plaint. Hence this suit.

5. In this case, the defendant No.1 is the State Government,

while the defendants 2 and 3 are the Special Deputy Commissioner

and the Commissioner of BDA. The defendants 4 to 24 are the

allottees of sites formed in the schedule lands.

6. The defendants 1 and 2 have jointly filed their written

statement, while the defendant No.3 has separately filed his

written statement.

7. The allottees of sites ie., defendants 11, 12, 14, 23 and 24

have filed their written statement separately while defendants 15 &

16, and 18 to 21 have jointly filed their written statement.

14 O.S.No.3666/2003

8. The defendants 4 to 10, 13, 17 and 22 have not filed their

written statement.

9. In their Written Statement, the defendant Nos.1 and 2

have contended that the suit filed by the plaintiffs' is misconceived

and is liable to be dismissed in limine.

10. Order dated 17.04.2003 is not amenable to jurisdiction of

this Court. The Order dated 17.04.2003 is a communication from

the first defendant to the second defendant directing him to hand

over 15 acres 11 guntas of land in Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte Village,

Begur Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk to the Bangalore Development

Authority. The said communication is in the nature of

interdepartmental communication. Hence, the prayer for

declaration cannot be granted.

11. The suit filed by the plaintiffs is not preceded by a Notice

under Section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code. Hence, the suit is not

maintainable and therefore, is liable to be dismissed.

The relief of permanent injunction sought for by the plaintiff

cannot be granted as the plaintiffs are not in possession of the

land at any point of time. They were never in possession of the

land in question. There is a lengthy narration of facts tracing the

title to the property in question by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 1 to

5 of the plaint. Property in Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte Village did not

15 O.S.No.3666/2003

belong to the family of the plaintiffs and the allegations made

contrary to this are denied as false. The genealogy as stated in

document No.1 is not admitted. It is denied that the great ancestor

of the plaintiffs Pasalappa Reddy constructed a private tank

comprised of Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13. It is admitted that earlier

survey numbers were changed to 31. But Pasalappa Reddy did not

form a tank. Plaintiffs were never in possession of suit schedule

property and also Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte Village.

12. Parts of Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 of Yellukunte Village were

water logged. The total extent of this water logged land comprised

in one boundary was 15 acres 11 guntas. They were clubbed into

one survey number and it was made into a tank. It was in fact a

government tank. Over the years, the tank dried up and the land

lost the character of a tank though in the village map, it was being

shown as a government tank. Survey No.13 was throughout a

government land and in the revenue records, it was shown as a

mufat kaval land.

13. Certain lands in Yellukunte Village, Begur Hobli, Bengaluru

South Taluk was acquired in favour of BDA for formation of HSR

Layout. One of the lands which formed part of HSR Layout was

Sy.No.31 since the land had lost the character of a tank long ago,

the government decided to handover this land to the BDA for

16 O.S.No.3666/2003

being allotted in turn to various eligible persons. The land was

duly handed over to BDA and the BDA after forming sites has

allotted sites to various persons. As of now, number of houses

have been fully constructed and either allottees or transferees

from allottees are residing there. About 7 to 8 houses are now

under construction.

14. Plaintiffs are making claim on the land in question on the

basis of certain wrong entries in the revenue records. In respect of

the lands in question, certain persons had made claim as

unauthorized occupants. The BDA decided to set apart a sum of

Rs.9,90,310/- at the disposal of the Tahsildar, Bangalore South

Taluk to facilitate him to disburse compensation as ex-gratia

compensation. A number of persons filed claim for award of

compensation and their claims are pending before the second

defendant.

15. The land in question was never a private tank. The plaintiffs

have misinterpreted some of the revenue records and on that

basis, they are claiming that Pasalappa Reddy owned and

possessed the suit land, which is false and incorrect. Pasalappa

Reddy did not claim ownership and possession over the lands in

Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 which were clubbed together in Form

No.31. In fact, Pasalappa was not the owner of Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10

17 O.S.No.3666/2003

and 13. Plaintiffs are not the successors in interest of Pasalappa

Reddy. The plaintiffs had never been in possession of the suit land

at any point of time. They are not in possession of the suit land.

16. The defendants 1 & 2 have produced the Certified Copy of

the Village Map and Pakka Book, which clearly prove that the land

was throughout a government tank.

17. It is admitted that the Tahsildar, Bengaluru South Taluk in

the year 1994 deleted certain wrong entries in the record of rights.

Filing of appeals by the plaintiffs and writ petitions before the

Hon'ble High Court is admitted. After remand, the matter is

pending before the Tahsildar. Filing of suit in respect of Sy.No.69 is

admitted. However, it is contended as false that the suit schedule

property is the absolute property of the plaintiffs and their

families. There is no question of dispossessing the plaintiffs as

they were never in possession of the land. After passing of the

order dated 17.04.2003, the property was handed over to the BDA

and the BDA has formed layouts and also allotted sites to

respective allottees.

18. The threatened dispossession of the plaintiffs and actions

taken by them are false and make believe.

19. There is no cause of action for the suit and the one

mentioned in paragraph 13 of the plaint is false. The plaintiffs are

18 O.S.No.3666/2003

not entitled to reliefs sought for. The plaintiffs have filed a false

and vexatious suit. Hence, prayed to dismiss the suit with costs.

20. The 3rd defendant has filed its written statement by denying

the averments taken up in the plaint and further contended that

this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the matter in dispute, and

the above suit is not maintainable either in law or on facts and

same is liable to be dismissed in limine. With regard to the

averments made in para-2 of the plaint, the same is put to strict

proof of the same. Further, the 3rd defendant denied the averments

made in para-3 of the plaint as false. In fact, the tank standing on

the schedule property and Survey No.69 was never a private tank

and all along the same belonged to the Government of Karnataka.

Defendant admitted the contents of para-4 of the plaint, but

denied the averments made in para-5 as false and plaintiffs are put

to strict proof of the same. In fact, the copy of the document

produced at document No.5 clearly disclose that the same was

forged to include the Survey No.31 in the plaint schedule property

only in order to facilitate the concerned. The 3rd defendant submit

that the plaintiffs were at no point of time in possession of the

schedule property and all along the suit schedule property was a

Government property and the Government of Karnataka having

sanctioned an improvement scheme for the formation of layout

19 O.S.No.3666/2003

called " Between Hosur Road and Sarjapura Road", by virtue of its

notification No.HUD /444/MNX/86 dated 28-11-1986 and appointed

the Special Addl. Land Acquisition Officer as the Deputy

Commissioner under the
Land Acquisition Act
, and in furtherance

of the same, the suit schedule property being a Government

property was transferred to the 3rd defendant by its order No. RD

197-NGB/2003 dated 17-4-2003 and this defendant has taken the

possession of the same. After taking possession of the suit

schedule property, the 3rd defendant has also called for tenders by

issuing paper publication and the work is already in progress. In

these circumstances, the contention of the plaintiffs that they are

in possession of the suit schedule property and the defendant

interfered in their property is totally false and incorrect. Further

the allegations that in spite of notice and order of this court, they

interfered in the plaintiffs possession is also denied as false. It is

further denied that the plaintiffs and their joint family at any point

of time owned and possessed and were enjoying the suit schedule

property and land in Survey No. 69 of Haralukunte village and

pendency of proceedings before the special Tahsildar in RRT

No.43/98-99 is in no way concerned to this suit. The filing of suits

by the plaintiffs and the family members is admitted, but the fact

of passing an order of status-quo is put to strict proof and further

20 O.S.No.3666/2003

the averments relating to OS No.1265/1996 is in no way concerned

with the suit schedule property. While denying the averments

made in paras-9 & 10 of the plaint, it is contended that the same is

put to strict proof of the same. The 3rd defendant submitted that

plaintiffs with an intention to grab the valuable property belonging

to the state Government are laying false claim one after another

without producing any documents relating to their title. The relief

of declaration cannot be granted, as the plaintiffs have no right,

title or interest over the schedule property. There is no cause of

action for the suit and the court fee paid is insufficient. Among

these grounds, the 3rd defendant prayed to dismiss the suit.

21. The defendants 11, 12, 14, 15 & 16, 18 to 21, 23 and 24 being

the allottees of sites formed in the schedule property by the BDA

the defendant No.3, have filed their written statement. Since the

contentions taken by them are similar, except the site numbers

and measurement allotted to them is different, the gist of their

written statement is extracted below:

22. They have contended that the suit is not maintainable in

law, either on facts and circumstances of the case. The plaintiffs

are not entitled to the relief sought as they are not the owners,

21 O.S.No.3666/2003

possessory holders, cultivators and having any title documents in

respect of the suit schedule property bearing Sy.No.31 measuring

15 acres 11 guntas situated at Yellukunte Village, Begur Hobli,

Bengaluru South Taluk and the property bearing Sy.No.69,

measuring 12 acres 31 guntas situated at Yellukunte Village, Begur

Hobli, Bengaluru South Taluk. The said land is situated within the

government tank. Hence, the suit is liable to be dismissed in

limine.

23. It is denied that the schedule property has been acquired

through their ancestors and subsequently the revenue documents

have been changed in the name of the plaintiffs. The documents

filed by the plaintiffs are created for the purpose of knocking off

the properties, which is also known as HSR Layout.

24. The plaintiffs have not filed any title documents such as

Grant Orders, Grant Certificate, Katha Extract, Survey Sketch,

Village Sketch, Village Map etc. Plaintiffs though stated that the

schedule properties were acquired through their ancestors, but to

substantiate the same, no documents are produced.

25. It is contended that the schedule land is a government land,

wherein the government formed a tank and subsequently, the suit

land was acquired by the BDA for formation of Hosur Sarjapura

Layout and the same was approved on 28.11.1986 in Notification

22 O.S.No.3666/2003

No.HUD.444.MNX.86 and the said land was handed over to

engineering section along with permission on 17.04.2003 in RD

1977 NGB 2003 and possession was also taken on 26.05.2003.

Therefore, the said land has been vested with the BDA. Therefore,

the plaintiffs have no right and title over the schedule property.

Even the plaintiffs have not challenged the acquisition proceedings

so far. Hence, the above suit is not maintainable after acquisition

proceedings, which attained finality. Even the plaintiffs have not

issued notice under
Section 64
of the BDA Act before filing the suit,

which is mandatory.

26. After acquisition proceedings in accordance with rules,

the BDA formed the layout and allotted sites to its members ie.,

defendants mentioned above. Thereafter, they have made all

requisite payments and even paid tax of the property. The BDA

also executed the registered Sale Deed in their favour and the

defendants were also issued with Possession Certificate, Katha

Certificate, Katha Endorsement and other registered title

documents in respect of the schedule property. They also applied

for approval of the plan. They are lawfully in physical possession

and enjoyment of their respective sites. Even the other allottees of

the sites have also obtained all the registered title documents

including plans and put up their residential constructions.

23 O.S.No.3666/2003

27. It is contended that this Court has got power to call for all

the original records from the concerned revenue departments to

know the reality and to take action. Under these circumstances,

the suit is not maintainable and is liable to be dismissed in limine.

28. As per plaint averments itself, a second suit claiming

declaration of title is barred as per the provisions
of Code of Civil

Procedure
as the prayer is hit by Res Judicata and is liable to be

dismissed as such.

29. Prayer for declaration of the order passed by 1 st defendant

as non-est in the eye of law, cannot be granted as an alternate and

efficacious remedy to challenge the said order, is available and the

plaintiffs having not availed such remedy known to law, cannot

seek a declaration before this Court.

30. The defendants have put the plaintiffs to put to strict proof

of the averments in para 2 of the plaint regarding their lineal

descendancy of one Linga Reddy and it is contended that the

genealogical tree produced is cooked up for the purpose of the

suit.

31. The plaintiffs have failed to aver how the said properties

came into possession of the ancestors of the plaintiffs, as averred

in para 3 of the plaint. The plaintiffs have not produced any title

24 O.S.No.3666/2003

deeds evidencing their ownership claim over the properties

mentioned in para 3 of the plaint.

32. The documents produced by the plaintiffs do not depict

anywhere the names of any persons whatsoever and hence, as

averred in para 4 of the plaint, the plaintiffs cannot claim anything

through those documents.

33. As averred in plaint para 5 by the plaintiffs, these defendants

put the plaintiffs to strict proof of the documents through which

they claim that their ancestors name is shown in the revenue

documents and it has depicted that their ancestor had constructed

the tank and further put the plaintiffs to strict proof of the

averment that their ancestors constructed the tank. It is well

settled law that revenue documents do not prove title. The

plaintiffs with the connivance of certain officials have cooked up

these revenue documents and are claiming possession over the

said lands.

34. The averments of the plaint paragraphs show that the

plaintiffs are mischief mongers and are making all out efforts to

knock off valuable property belonging to the State and acquired by

the BDA. The averments depict that the plaintiffs have availed all

remedy available and are pursuing parallel remedies to somehow

succeed to knock off the suit schedule property.

25 O.S.No.3666/2003

35. As averred in plaint para 11, it is admitted that the first

defendant has issued the order and has also directed that the land

be transferred to 3rd defendant to facilitate formation of layout

formed by the 3rd defendant. All the surrounding villages abutting

the schedule properties have been acquired by the BDA, the third

defendant and the ancestors as well as the plaintiffs have received

compensation for the acquisition of the land for formation of HSR

Layout. When such being the case, the claim now put forward by

the plaintiffs are all false, hit by res judicata and they are also

estopped from claiming ownership of the lands that are acquired

by the first and third defendants.

36. As regards to para 12 of the plaint is concerned, the

plaintiffs cannot question the order before this Court and a

separate remedy is available for the plaintiffs to challenge the

same. As the said order pertains to land acquisition by the State,

the Land Acquisition Act expressly bars the jurisdiction of Civil

Court. Hence, this Court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the order

passed by the first and third defendants. Hence, the suit is liable to

be dismissed as having no jurisdiction with costs.

37. There is no cause of action for instituting this suit and

hence, the suit is liable to be dismissed.

26 O.S.No.3666/2003

38. As per the averments made in the subsequent applications

filed by the plaintiffs, it is clearly averred that the third defendant

has formed layout and sites have been allotted to various persons

and absolute sale deeds have been executed. All the allottees and

persons who have purchased the said sites in the suit schedule

property have to be made parties to the suit for proper

adjudication. The suit deserves to be dismissed for non-joinder of

the said persons. The plaintiffs though being aware that the sale

deeds have been executed by the BDA, the third defendant has not

challenged the execution of the sale deeds. In view of the same,

the suit has to be dismissed for non-seeking of prayer of setting

aside the sale deeds. The defendants have purchased sites formed

in the suit schedule property and have obtained the khatha in their

respective names and have paid tax. The court fee paid on the

plaint is grossly insufficient and the suit is liable to be dismissed for

non-payment of proper court fee.

39. The defendants have denied all other averments in the

plaint, which are not specifically denied as false and prayed the

Court to dismiss the suit with costs.

40. The suit filed by the plaintiffs is false, frivolous, vexatious

and not maintainable both in law and on facts. The suit is tainted

with malafides and the same is nothing but abuse of process of law

27 O.S.No.3666/2003

amounting to contempt of court within the meaning of
Section 2(c)

of the Contempt of Courts Act.

41. The relief of declaration sought in the plaint cannot be

granted in view of the bar provided under the proviso to
Section 34

of the Specific Relief Act. Hence, the suit is barred under
Section 9

of CPC and the plaintiff is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule

11(d)
of CPC
.

42. The suit schedule property had been acquired and taken

possession by the BDA by passing the final notification

No.HUD/444/MNX/86 dated 28.11.1986, which is conclusive

evidence of acquisition under
Section 6(3)
of the Land Acquisition

Act. Thus the plaintiffs have neither title nor possession over the

schedule property.

43. The suit is barred under
Section 3
of the Limitation Act.

44. The suit is hit by delay and latches and on the principles of

res-judicata. The acquisition of the land and the taking over the

possession by the BDA had not been challenged by the plaintiffs.

Hence, the suit is hit by the principles of estoppel. Since the

acquisition of the land by the BDA has reached its finality, the

plaintiffs have no locus standi to challenge the notification No.RD

197/LGB/2003, dated 17.04.2003.

28 O.S.No.3666/2003

45. The suit is unsustainable against the 1st and 2nd defendants

for want of notice under
Section 52
of the Land Acquisition Act and

under
Section 80
of CPC. Similarly, the suit is barred against 3rd

defendant under
Section 64
of CPC.

46. The BDA had acquired the land by passing the final

notification on 28.11.1986 and taken possession of the suit

schedule property in furtherance of the developmental projects,

the layout was formed and the sites were allotted to various

persons including these defendants and the allottees have

constructed their houses and are residing therein. The suit

schedule land has been transformed into a residential layout

through the operation of law and the schedule property has lost its

identity as an agricultural land. Hence, the suit for declaration and

permanent injunction claiming the schedule property as an

agricultural land cannot be maintained for want of cause of action

and the plaint is liable to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a)
of

CPC
.

47. The suit is not properly valued and the court fee paid is

insufficient and hence, the suit is liable to be rejected under Order

VII Rule 11(b) and (c)
of CPC
.

48. The BDA has formed the layout and allotted sites to

allottees and put them in possession by issuing Possession

29 O.S.No.3666/2003

Certificate and thereafter, executed the deeds of absolute sale and

the transfer has been effected in accordance with
Section 54
of the

Transfer of Property Act and the sale deeds have been got

registered with the payment of the required stamp duty in

accordance with law. The katha has been transferred into the

names of allottees and the property was was and is being collected

by the BDA from the defendants. The plans are sanctioned by the

BDA and the constructions were put up by the allottees and the

same has not been challenged by the plaintiffs. Hence, the present

suit is not maintainable and hence prayed to dismiss the suit with

costs.

49. In view of the above said pleadings, the following issues and

32 O.S.No.3666/2003

50. Actually, this suit was once disposed off by decreeing the

suit on 22-11-2004. But aggrieved by the said judgment and de-

cree, the defendant Nos.1 and 2 herein filed RFA No.416/2005 and

the defendant No.3 herein filed RFA No.67/2005 before Hon'ble

High Court of Karnataka. RFA No 67/2005 was clubbed with RFA

No.416/2005 and the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka passed an

order on 29-11-2006 by remitting the matter back to this court for

fresh disposal in accordance with law within nine months from the

date of order by setting aside the judgment and decree. Though

the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has directed to dispose off

this case within 9 months from the date of disposal of RFAs but till

2025 it was pending for disposal for one or the other reasons of fil-

ing inter-locutary applications, impleading of more defendants,

amendments, framing of additional issues, further evidence etc.

For the following;

36 O.S.No.3666/2003

REASONS

59. Addl.Issue No.3 (24-02-2011), Addl.Issue Nos.2 and 3 (30-08-

2018) and Addl.Issue Nos.4 and 5 (24-02-2016) :- These five Issues

are regarding maintainability of suit in the viewpoints of defendant

No.14 and defendant No.24, in as much as, they are connected to

GPA executed by plaintiffs in favour of Chandramouli Reddy and

L.Shivarama Gowda and burden of proof of validity of GPA of plain-

tiffs; proving that GPA is fabricated as has been contended by de-

fendant No.24; non-maintainability of suit in the view point of de-

fendant No.14; maintainability of suit having regard to the fact

that as on the date of the filing of this suit, the Plaintiff No.7 was no

more and validity of GPA executed by him, which are all inter-con-

nected to each other. Hence, to avoid repeated discussions they

are taken up together here under.

60. First of all, most important point to be noted here is the

same plaintiffs of this case along with some other plaintiffs, filed

two other cases. They are OS No.1265/1996 and OS No.814/2005

filed against the same defendants with same set of facts in respect

of Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte village and all these three (3) cases are

remitted back to this court by the Hon'ble High Court for fresh dis-

posal as same as in this case. Surprising point is in that cases, the

37 O.S.No.3666/2003

plaintiffs made similar set of facts that the deceased Pasalappa

Reddy constructed a private tank. Further, interesting point is in

each cases is that they stated that said Pasalappa Reddy con-

structed private tank in the property of suit schedule property of

each case. Such as in OS No.1296/1996 and in OS No 814/2005,

they stated that the said Pasalappa Reddy constructed private tank

in Sy.No.69. In this OS No.3666/2003, they stated that the said

Pasalappa Reddy constructed private tank in Sy.No 31. But,

nowhere in each cases stated that he constructed "two separate

tanks" in Sy.No.31 and Sy.No.69 and in the evidence of this case, as

discussed below, the witnesses failed to establish either construc-

tion of separate tanks and even failed to establish construction of

tank by Pasalappa Reddy. Moreover, all these three cases are con-

nected to each other, but not clubbed. It is evident in the order of

Misc.No 468/2007 dated 21-07-2007 filed by plaintiffs herein in

which it is ordered as " The Petition is allowed. OS No.1265/1996 and

OS No.814/2005 pending on the file of CCH-10 and OS No.4830/1996

pending in the file of CCH-9 are withdrawn and transferred to CCH No

12 where OS No.3666/2003 is pending for trial and disposal in accor-

dance with law." Hence, these three cases OS No.3666/2003, OS

No.814/2005 and OS No.1265/1996 are taken up together for dis-

posal to avoid ambiguities as since 1996 till date, there are bunch

38 O.S.No.3666/2003

of cases between same parties in respect of properties in Sy.No.69

of Haralakunte village and property in Sy.No 31 of Yellukunte vil-

lage, wherein the plaintiffs claimed through the root of their ances-

tors without any title deeds and only on the basis of the contention

that Late Pasalappa Reddy constructed a private tank in the suit

schedule properties. But, the contentions of the defendants are

that the said properties are government land with "tank bed area".

Then question is whether the tank is private or government and

whether Pasalappa Reddy constructed tanks separately in both the

properties or how he can construct a single tank in both Sy.No.69

and Sy.No.31 which situated in different villages such as Har-

alakunte village and Yellukunte village, is the crucial point. If they

are decided once in all cases, then definitely the question in contro-

versy since 90's in respect of same subject matter of property and

between same parties would attain finality without opening the

doors to multiplicity of proceedings and accordingly this court

made every endeavour to dispose off this matter which is directed

by Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka to dispose within nine months

as ordered in RFA No.416/2005 C/W 67/2005 dated 29-11-2006.

61. Important point is in OS No.814/2005, wherein the plaintiff filed

that case against the Commissioner of BDA only and PW 1 himself

stated in the affidavit of examination chief and plaintiffs in plaint as

39 O.S.No.3666/2003

that case depends on judgment in OS No.1265/1996 and hence the

parties have not lead evidence in that case and every proceeding is

conducted in OS No 3666/2003. The GPA Holder/PW 1 in OS

No.814/2005 and OS No.1265/1996 is none other than S. Chandra

Mouli Reddy and in that regard discussed in detail here below.

62. Though the above cases are not clubbed, but on the basis

of oral submissions of the respective sides, they are taken to the

Board together in every callings. Only, on going through the mate-

rials on record together while preparing for judgment, it came to

the notice of the Court that they are not clubbed. But, this Court

finds there is no need to again reopen the stage for clubbing of the

matter in the suits which are posted for judgment which leads to

reopening IAs which will lead to further procrastination of this age

old suits, hence, by invoking inherent power under
Section 151
of

CPC and considering the order in Misc.No.468/2007 dated 21-07-

2007 filed by plaintiffs which is discussed supra, this court pro-

ceeded to pass judgment in these three cases without clubbing

them, which will not in any way adversely affect either technically

or legally in respect of subject matter and parties to the suit. Fur-

ther, it will not cause any prejudice to the interest of justice. If it is

again reopened for clubbing the matter, then definitely it will lead

to multiplicity of proceedings.

40 O.S.No.3666/2003

63. Admittedly and originally, this suit is filed against defen-

dant Nos.1 to 3 and later defendant Nos.4 to 24 are added. The

plaint prayers in this suit for declaration and perpetual injunction

are reiterated here under;

"a) by declaring that the order passed by the first defen-

dant in RD 197 LGB, 2003 dated: 17.04.2003 as non-est in the
eye of law.

b) Grant relief of perpetual injunction against the third
defendant restraining him, his agent, men or anybody under or
through him from dispossessing the Plaintiffs from the Sched-
ule Property or in any way interfering with the Plaintiffs lawful
possession of Schedule property; and

c) Grant such other relief/reliefs as this Hon'ble Court
deems fit in the circumstances of the case including the costs of
the proceedings, in the ends of justice."

64. Before discussing facts and law in respect of circum-

stances of this case, as they have direct bearing on the remaining

Issues, here now, with regard to above five Issues, we have to look

into validity of GPA, validity of GPA after the death of person who

executed GPA and other grounds of non-maintainability of suit in-

voked by the defendants.

65. Regarding, Addl.Issue No.3 dated 30-08-2018 is con-

cerned, in paragraph 6 of page No.14 of the judgment of Hon'ble

41 O.S.No.3666/2003

High Court of Karnataka in RFA No 416/2005 C/W 67/2005, it is ob-

served and opined that the suit to the extent of dead plaintiff that

is 7th plaintiff by the Power of Attorney may be bad in law and the

same paragraph is reproduced here under;

" 6. The plaintiffs 1 to 9 had prosecuted the suit through
their Power of Attorney one Chandramara Reddy. As on the
date of suit the 7th plaintiff was dead. The Power of Attorney
instituted the suit on behalf of all the plaintiffs including the
dead 7th plaintiff. The suit to the extent of dead plaintiff by the
Power of Attorney may be bad in law, but the suit on behalf of
the plaintiffs 1 to 6, 8 and 9 cannot be assailed as bad in law."

66. Hence, further discussion on this Issue is just wasting of time

as this Issue is directly connected to the maintainability of the suit

to the extent of the Power of Attorney by a dead person that is

plaintiff No.7 as to 'whether the defendant No.24 proves that as on

the date of the suit the plaintiff No.7 was no more, the plaintiffs

filed their suit filed by power of attorney holder is bad in law ?'.

67. Now, on perusal of order sheet, this suit is filed on 02-06-

2003. In the cause title of original plaint, it is noted as "all the plain-

tiffs are represented by their attorney holder S.Chandra Mouli

Reddy. The verification portion of plaint shows that it is verified by

GPA holder of plaintiff S.Chandra Mouli Reddy. Further, the verify-

42 O.S.No.3666/2003

ing affidavit to the plaint is deposed by the same GPA S.Chandra

Mouli Reddy.

68. It is well known that as per
Order VI Rule 1 of the CPC
,

"Pleading" shall mean plaint or written statement. Further the said

pleadings shall be signed by the parties and his pleader and it is

not as "signed by the party "or" pleader". That means in the plaint

and written statement, signature of both the parties and the coun-

sels/pleaders shall be compulsory. To make it more clear the Rule

14 of
Order VI of CPC
is hereby reproduced;

"14. Pleading to be signed.--Every pleading shall be
signed by the party and his pleader (if any):

Provided that where a party pleading is, by reason of ab-
sence or for other good cause, unable to sign the pleading, it
may be signed by any person duly authorized by him to sign
the same or to sue or defend on his behalf."

69. Further, the proviso gives opportunity to sign the plead-

ing in the absence of parties for cause, then by the duly authorized

person. Duly authorized person under law is "power of attorney

holder." as provided in Order III Rule 1 and 2
of CPC
.

70. Why this Court is discussing these provision here because

in this case, the original plaint is filed through GPA holder S. Chan-

dra Mouli Reddy and as stated above in the original plaint filed, it

43 O.S.No.3666/2003

contains signature of said GPA. But, all the subsequent "amended

plaint" contain signature of neither parties nor GPA holders. They

are signed by only the "counsel/advocate for plaintiff" which is not

tenable under law.

71. Further, to make it more clear,
Order III Rule 4 of CPC
is

reproduced here under for better understanding of the pleader's

authority and duty towards the suit and he has no authority to file

pleadings independently without signature of either parties or

their attorney.

"4. Appointment of pleader.--(1) No pleader shall act for
any person in any Court, unless he has been appointed for the
purpose by such person by a document in writing signed by
such person or by his recognised agent or by some other per-
son duly authorised by or under a power-of-attorney to make
such appointment.

(2) Every such appointment shall be 3[filed in Court and shall,
for the purposes of sub-rule (1), be] deemed to be in force until
determined with the leave of the Court by a writing signed by
the client or the pleader, as the case may be, and filed in Court,
or until the client or the pleader dies, or until all proceedings in
the suit are ended so far as regards the client.

Explanation. --For the purposes of this sub-rule, the following
shall be deemed to be proceedings in the suit,--

(a) an application for the review of decree or order in the
suit,

44 O.S.No.3666/2003

(b) an application under section 144 or under section 152 of
this Code, in relation to any decree or order made in the suit,

(c) an appeal from any decree or order in the suit, and

(d) any application or act for the purpose of obtaining copies
of documents or return of documents produced or filed in the
suit or of obtaining refund of moneys paid into the Court in
connection with the suit.

(3) Nothing in sub-rule (2) shall be construed--

(a) as extending, as between the pleader and his client, the
duration for which the pleader is engaged, or

(b) as authorising service on the pleader of any notice or doc-
ument issued by any Court other than the Court for which the
pleader was engaged, except where such service was expressly
agreed to by the client in the document referred to in sub-rule
(1).

(4) The High Court may, by general order, direct that, where
the person by whom a pleader is appointed is unable to write
his name, his mark upon the document appointing the pleader
shall be attested by such person and in such manner as may be
specified by the order.

(5) No pleader who has been engaged for the purpose of
pleading only shall plead on behalf of any party, unless he has
filed in court a memorandum of appearance signed by himself
and stating--

(a) the names of the parties to the suit,

(b) the name of the party for whom he appears, and

(c) the name of the person by whom he is authorised to ap-
pear:

45 O.S.No.3666/2003

Provided that nothing in this sub-rule shall apply to any
pleader engaged to plead on behalf of any party by any other
pleader who has been duly appointed to act in Court on behalf
of such party."

72. Then, filing of amended plaint without signature of

either the plaintiffs or their attorneys is not permissible under law.

73. Further, in another way also, the amended plaints are de-

fective as they are not accompanied with verifying affidavit by

plaintiffs or their attorneys as it is main requirement under law.

The concerned provision
of CPC
is reproduced here under;

"Order III Rule 15. Verification of pleadings.--

(1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being
in force, every pleading shall be verified at the foot by the party
or by one of the parties pleading or by some other person
proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with
the facts of the case.

(2) The person verifying shall specify, by reference to the
numbered paragraphs of the pleading, what he verifies of his
own knowledge and what he verifies upon information received
and believed to be true.

(3) The verification shall be signed by the person making it
and shall state the date on which and the place at which it was
signed.

(4) The person verifying the pleading shall also furnish an
affidavit in support of his pleadings."

46 O.S.No.3666/2003

74. Here in this case, in both the amended plaints, there is no

verification portion and no verification affidavit. If pleader has is

acquainted with case, then why he has not verified the amended

plaint has remained unanswered.

75. Further, the amended plaint is also treated as "plead-

ings" under Order VI Rule 1 as it adds/inserts something new

pleadings in the original plaint which shall have to be verified as

true and correct. Further, Rule 3(2) in Chapter I of Karnataka Civil

Rules of Practice clearly gives meaning to the word "Pleadings" as;

"2) "Pleadings" shall include plaints, written statements,
memoranda of appeals, cross-objections, original petitions,
applications, counter statements, replies, rejoinders and ev-

ery statement setting out the case of a party in the matter to
which the pleadings relate."

76. Further, Chapter IV Rule 24 to 32 of Karnataka Civil Rules

of Practice clearly say that the facts and pleadings shall be verified

by the deponent and identified by a competent person.

77. Hence, the present amended plaints in this case which

are the main source for adjudication of justice is not valid as per

law because none of the plaintiffs, none of their attorneys and

none of their appointed pleaders verified the amended plaint as

true and correct. Then, it gives presumption that the whole plaint

47 O.S.No.3666/2003

is bundle of non-existing facts as no one confirmed it as true and

correct. In this viewpoint the suit is definitely not maintainable.

78. Moreover, as per Ex.P.1 the Special Power of Attorney

executed by the plaintiff No 1 to 9 in favour of PW 1 hererin named

L. Shivarama Reddy is executed on 25-10-2004. As per the dates

noted in the amended plaints and as on the date of order sheet on

which they have produced are the subsequent dates from the date

of execution of said SPA. One of the amended plaints is filed on 22-

01-2008 and another amended plaint is filed on 04-08-2018, but

both does not contain signature of either plaintiffs or the SPA

Holder anywhere in the amended plaint and they do not contain

the verification portion and verification affidavit. Then, as per their

own default, the plaint filed by the plaintiffs itself is not maintain-

able.

79. Now, in this regard, we have to go through the deposi-

tion of PW 1 who is none other than alleged SPA holder of plain-

tiffs. The said SPA is marked as Ex.P 1 as stated supra. Here it is im-

portant to note that, though the suit is filed through GPA holder

named S. Chandra Mouli Reddy, but the GPA executed in his favour

is not produced by the plaintiffs. Further, the defendant No.24

claimed that the plaintiff No.7 died prior to filing of this suit and

48 O.S.No.3666/2003

the said GPA has lost its validity on his death. But, the Hon'ble High

Court of Karnataka, as stated supra, opined that to the extent of

deceased defendant No.7 the said GPA is bad in law. That means

with regard to remaining plaintiffs, it will continue to be in force. If

it is so, then while appointing another person as GPA/SPA, they

ought to cancel the previous GPA by due process of law or they

ought to give GPA combined with both the attorneys under single

roof of a single GPA and whatever it may be they ought to

rescind/revoke/cancel the previous GPA/SPA otherwise the present

SPA is "bad under law" as both the SPA/GPA are executed for the

same purpose. If the earlier SPA holder/GPA holder died, then such

cancellation does not arise. But in his cross examination PW 1 ad-

mitted as the said S. Chandra Mouli is still alive as on cross exami-

nation dated 25-07-2012 as:-

"7ನೇ ವಾದಿ ದಾವೆಯನ್ನು ಹೂಡಿದಾಗಲೇ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದರು ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ. ಇಲ್ಲಿಗೆ 2
ವರ್ಷಗಳಲ್ಲಿ 9ನೇ ವಾದಿ ತೀರಿಕೊಂಡರು. 9ನೇ ವಾದಿಗಳ ವಾರಸುದಾರರನ್ನು ಸೇರಿಸಲು
ಮಾಹಿತಿಯನ್ನು ನನ್ನ ವಕೀಲರಿಗೆ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದೇನೆ. ಅವರು ಇನ್ನು ಮುಂದೆ ಅರ್ಜಿಯನ್ನು
ಹಾಕಲಿದ್ದಾ ರೆ. ಮೊದಲು ದಾವಾ ಹಾಕಿದಾಗ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಪತ್ರ ಹೊ‍ಂದಿದ ಚಂದ್ರ ಮೌಳಿಯವರು
ಇನ್ನು ಬದುಕಿದ್ದಾ ರೆ. ನಾನು ಸಹ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಪತ್ರವನ್ನು ತೆಗೆದುಕೊಂಡು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯನ್ನು
ಕೊಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದೇನೆ."

80. Further as on cross examination dated 08-08-2012, he

has stated that:-

49 O.S.No.3666/2003

" Chndramouli filed power of attorney to conduct the
case. It is false to suggest that the said power of attorney
given in favour of Chandramouli is not cancelled. It is false to
suggest that without canceling the power of attorney given in
favour of Chandramouli, I am giving evidence on the basis of
power of attorney."

81. But, the plaintiffs neither produced the GPA executed in

favour of said S. Chandra Mouli Reddy nor produced deed of can-

cellation of said GPA.

82. Further, in his cross examination dated 29-08-2012 made

by the learned counsel for defendant No.1 and 2, PW 1 has stated

as:-

"Ex.P 1 is my power of attorney. Ex.P.1 is signed by all
the plaintiffs, ie., plaintiff Nos.1 to 9".

83. On perusal of Ex.P 1, all the plaintiff Nos.1 to 9 put their

signature in the year 2004. But, the same PW 1, as stated supra, in

his cross examination dated 25-07-2012 stated that the plaintiff

No.7 died prior to filing of this suit and the plaintiff No.9 died 2

years prior to that date of evidence. As per cause title of the plaint,

the name of Plaintiff No.7 is "A M Rami Reddy." According to PW 1

himself, he died prior to filing of this suit. On perusal of Ex.P 1 the

name of Plaintiff No.7 is mentioned in the array of persons who ex-

ecuted said SPA. In the signatures, the signature of A. M. Rami

50 O.S.No.3666/2003

Reddy found in every pages of Ex.P 1. Then, how a dead person put

his signature on this SPA. Surprising point is one Advocate who

had enrollment number as KAR/1958/1995 has identified the par-

ties to Ex.P 1. Further, Notary public name M.G. Uthappa (Regd

621) attested this document. In this regard, in page No.38 of his

cross examination dated 16-11-2011 PW 1 has stated as:-

" I do not know how the signature of A.M. Rami Reddy came on
Ex.P.1 dated 25.09.2004. I do not know when the said Rami
Reddy died. I do not know the date of execution of Ex.P.1 before
the Notary. I do not know before which Notary, Ex.P.1 was exe-
cuted. It is false to suggest that we have fabricated the signa-
ture of 7th plaintiff though he was not alive as on the date of
Ex.P.1. It is false to suggest that the executants of Ex.P.1 not ap-
peared before the Notary and not signed on Ex.P.1. On the last
page of Ex.P.1, another date as 25.10.2004 is mentioned. It is
false to suggest that Ex.P.1 is not a genuine document."

84. Another important false statement given by PW 1 in his

cross examination is in page No.38, wherein he has stated as:-

" Myself also have give instruction to our Advocate for drafting
the plaint. Entire family verified the Plaint averments. Sri
Chandramouli, who has verified the Plaint averments, is not
one of the plaintiff in OS No.3666/2003. It is false to suggest
that Sri Chandramouli had no power to verify the plaint aver-
ments in OS 3666/2003. I do not know regarding not produc-
ing Power of Attorney of Chandramouli Reddy. It is false to

51 O.S.No.3666/2003

suggest that without power of attorney, Chandramouli Reddy
has presented the suit in OS 3666/2003".

85. But, as discussed supra, none of the plaintiffs verified the

plaint and even not only them, this PW 1 has also not verified

amended plaint which are filed after execution of SPA in his favour.

86. Further, in page No.39, PW 1 stated as:-

" I do not know the date of death of Plaintiff No.9 - K. Ra-
machandra Reddy. Plaintiff No.9 is my brother's son. Plaintiff
No.9 died about 6-7 years back. It is false to suggest that
plaintiffs are not in possession of the suit schedule property."

87. Then it is clear that this SPA is not maintainable in respect

of plaintiff No 9 too. If the plaintiff No.9 died before 6-7 year prior

to 16-11-2011, the date of that cross examination, then definitely

plaintiff No.9 also died prior to execution of that SPA. If the signa-

ture of two persons are forged in a document, that means the

whole document is treated as fabricated, because, it shows either

involvement of other plaintiffs to fabricate or fabrication by SPA

holder himself by impersonation of other plaintiffs or SPA holders,

who is unduly influenced or misrepresented by remaining plaintiffs

or remaining plaintiffs are unduly influenced by SPA holders as vis

a vis/ vise versa, finally the finding of this court is that Ex.P.1 and all

the GPAs executed in favour of S. Chandra Mouliu Reddy which are

52 O.S.No.3666/2003

marked as Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19 are fabricated documents, because

without describing their right, title and interest over the suit sched-

ule property and without mentioning as to through which title/

deeds they became absolute owners of that properties, the said

GPAs are executed. Where there is no proper authority, right and

title and power to be identified over the property, then no power

or authority would be handed over to GPA Holder. To execute

power through GPA, first of all the executant shall have power over

that properties.

88. The fact that a dead person signed a document, means

definitely it is fabricated document as the death of defendant No.7

prior to the date of G.P.A. is admitted by P.W.1.

89. On perusal of original plaint, only the GPA Holder S.

Chandra Mouli Reddy put his signature as discussed supra. The

suit is filed in the year 2003. Ex.P.1 is executed in the year 2004.

Evidence of PW 1 has commenced on 26-10-2004. Then, not only

the GPA of Plaintiff No.7 but also GPA of Plaintiff No.9 is bad in law

as he was no more as on the date of 25-07-2012 that is the date of

cross examination PW 1 as he admitted that Plaintiff No.9 died two

years prior to that cross examination.

53 O.S.No.3666/2003

90. Importantly, in page No 26 of cross examination of PW 1,

the learned counsel for defendant confronted copies of GPAs

executed by the plaintiffs in favour of S.Chandra Mouli Reddy con-

fronted to PW 1 and they are got marked as Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19, he

admitted that documents and the portion of deposition at that

cross examination is reproduced here under as it gives effect on

these Issues as the suit is not maintainable;

" It is true to say that one Chandramouli Reddy filed this suit
as a General Power of Attorney holder of plaintiffs. It is true to
say that there are Xerox copies of seven General Power of Attor-
neys issued by seven plaintiffs in favour of the said Chan-
dramouli Reddy. I admit that now I see the said xerox copies
which are confronted to me and they are marked as Ex.D.13 to
D.19. The said Chandramouli Reddy is my elder brother's son.
I can produce the originals of Ex.D.13 to D.19 provided the said
Chandramouli give them to me. It is true to say that myself
and the said Chandramouli Reddy are in good terms. It is true
that as the said Chandramouli Reddy was not keeping good
health, I am deposing on behalf of the plaintiffs.
Learned counsel for the 3rd defendant asked a question to
the witness, that the plaintiffs have not empowered the said
Chandramouli Reddy to file this suit. Learned counsel for the
plaintiff submitted that as the said defence has not been taken
by the defendants. It should not be allowed to ask the said
question as it is a question of law. Heard. As the question in-
volved is a question of law and the said question need not be
pleaded and any defendant or adversary can raise the question

54 O.S.No.3666/2003

of law even without the writtens statement. Hence the question
is allowed.

It is not true to say that the plaintiffs have not authorised the
said Chandramouli Reddy to file the plaint as such the plaint it-
self is not maintainable."

91. Now, on perusal of Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19;

 Ex.D 13 is the copy of GPA dated 24-04-2000 executed by A.G

Shivashankar Reddy (Plaintiff No 1) and A.G. Jayarama Reddy

(not party in this case) executed in favour of favour of Chan-

dra Mouli Reddy S/o.A.L. Subbaiah and in that document

schedule II is the plaint schedule herein;

 Ex.D 14 is the copy of GPA dated 24-04-2000 executed by S.

Ramachandra Reddy (Plaintiff No 2) and S. Gopala Reddy (not

party in this case) , G. Srinivasa Reddy (Plaintiff No 5),

Venkata Reddy ( plaintiff No 3), S. Shankar Reddy (not party

to his case), executed in favour of favour of Chandra Mouli

Reddy S/o. A.L. Subbaiah and in that document, schedule II is

the plaint schedule herein. Surprising point in this document

is after the name of second plaintiff herein, the names of his

legal heirs are arrayed as 1(a) to 1(d). None of the legal heirs

of other executors are mentioned. Then, the question will

arise at the time of execution of that GPA whether plaintiff

No.2 was also alive or not.

55 O.S.No.3666/2003

 Ex.D.15 is the another GPA dated 24-04-2000 executed in re-

spect of same property in Ex.D 12 and Ex.D 13 by M. Pasala

Reddy S/o. Late Chikkamuniswamy, P.Munireddy S/o.

Pasalareddy (not party here), Lakshmidevamma W/o. Late Ja-

yaramareddy, M. Krishna Reddy, M. Srinivasa reddy, M. Muni

Reddy Govinda Reddy, G. Nagaraja Reddy, Srinivasa Reddy,

Kamalakshmma, (they are not parties to this case), Venkata

Reddy (plaintiff No.3) , Pradeep Reddy (not party here) exe-

cuted in favour of favour of Chandra Mouli Reddy S/o. A L

Subbaiah. Surprising point in this document is this document

is also executed on the same day that is 24-04-2004.

 Another surprising point is if we go through Ex.D 16 to Ex.D

19, all are the similar GPAs executed on the same date ie., on

24-04-2000 by different persons in favour of the very same S.

Chandra Mouli Reddy in respect of same property which is

suit schedule property herein. In all these documents, it is

stated that they are owners of property in Sy.No. 69 of Har-

alakunte village and Sy.No. 31 Yellukunte village, but there is

no explanation about how they acquired that properties. Fur-

ther, if we compare it with above reproduced portion of cross

examination of PW 1, it creates cloud on the ownership of

the plaintiffs over the suit schedule property. In such a junc-

56 O.S.No.3666/2003

ture, the plaintiffs ought to have brought this Chandra Mouli

to witness box, but they have not taken any pain to do so

which leads to presumption under Section 114 of Indian Evi-

dence Act as all the GPAs are created for the purpose of this

case or to grab the properties mentioned in this suit as nei-

ther the parties put their signature in any of the plaints (in-

cluding amended plaint).

92. Further, in page Nos.28 and 29 of his cross examination

PW 1 has stated as;

" It is true that in Ex.P.2, it is mentioned that "the genealogical
tree is according our statement and we have signed admitting
the contents thereof". It is true that Ex.P.2 does not contain
anybody's signatures. It is not true to say that, the persons
shown in Ex.P.2 are not the members of the families as shown
in it and that we have created Ex.P.2 for the purpose of this
suit. Now I see one signature shown to me, but I cannot iden-
tify the said signature. The said signature is of the vakalath of
A.C.Sudarshana Reddy filed in LAC No.381/86-87 which is
available in the records summoned from BDA. Now I see the
claim petition filed in LAC 381/86-87 but I cannot identify the
signatures forthcoming in the documents. Now I see claim pe-
tition filed in LAC 378/1986-87, but I cannot say who had
signed the said claim petition. Now I see claim petition shown
to me of LAC No.381/86-87 but I cannot identify the signa-
tures. It is true to say that in the said claim petition my name
is shown as the 5th claimant but I have not signed it.

57 O.S.No.3666/2003

Now I am shown the claim petition of LAC No.379/86-87,
but I cannot identify any of the signatures found in it. So also
the signatures that are forthcoming in the possession taking
mahazar of LAC No.376/87-88. Now I see the affidavit accom-
panying I.A. filed under O.7 R14(d)
of CPC
the signature found
on the said document is of mine. Now I see Ex.P.1 the Special
Power of Attorney executed by the plaintiffs but I cannot iden-
tify all the signatures on the said document. I only identify the
signatures of A.L. Nanjunda Reddy."

93. Then, PW 1 himself failed to prove his own document that

is Ex.P 1 as he is unable to identify the signatures of parties to Ex.P

1.

94. Further, in page No 30 of his cross examination the PW 1

has stated as:-

" It is not true to say that, all the plaintiffs are hale and healthy.
I do not know, is there any difficulty to some of the plaintiffs
who are healthy to come over to the Court and to give evi-
dence. It is not true to say that, myself colluding with the plain-
tiff have filed this suit in order to knock off the valuable prop-
erty of the 3rd defendant. It is not true to say that, though the
7th plaintiff is no more, we had filed this suit without having
any right or title over the suit schedule property in order to
grab the suit schedule property. It is not true to say that, with
the apprehension that if the plaintiffs appear before the Court
the truth will come out, I am deposing falsely pretending to be
a General Power of Attorney holder of the plaintiffs. It is not
true to say that myself and my family members are used to

58 O.S.No.3666/2003

knock off the Government properties by creating false docu-
ments."

95. Moreover, in page No 13 of his cross examination con-

ducted by the learned counsel for defendant No.3 on 29-10-2004,

PW 1 has stated and admitted on GPA as:-

"All the plaintiffs have executed Special Power of Attor-
ney in my favour to prosecute the suit at Agara Village, Banga-
lore. All the plaintiffs had joined in my house to execute the
said Special Power of Attorney ie., Ex.P.1. On 24th and 25th of
October the plaintiffs had executed the Special Power of Attor-
ney. In the evenings of 24th and 24th of October the plaintiffs
had executed the Special Power of Attorney but I cannot say
now the exact time and day of the each plaintiff executed the
said document and now I cannot say on which exact date I had
obtained the signature of the notary on Ex.P.1. On that day, we
took the notary to my house to get executed Ex.P.1. Now I see
Ex.P.2, it is true to say that I cannot say on which date each of
the deceased persons died. It is true to say that Ex.P.2 was ob-
tained during the year 1999. It is true that in Ex.P.2 which was
issued on 12.04.1999, A.M. Rama Reddy S/o. Muganna Reddy is
shown as dead by that time. But I do not know when exactly
A.M.Rama Reddy died. It is true that in Ex.P.1, it is shown that
7th plaintiff A.M. Rama Reddy S/o. Muganna Reddy has signed
Ex.P.1 on October 24th or 25th 2004. It is true to say that in the
plaint, it is shown that A.M. Rama Reddy S/o. Muganna Reddy
as 7th plaintiff. It is not true to say that I do not have any
knowledge about the contents of the plaint and about the facts

59 O.S.No.3666/2003

of this case. It is not true to say that 7 th plaintiff is a fictitious
person created for the purpose of this suit."

96. But, as discussed supra, Ex.P 1 clearly shows that it is exe-

cuted in respect of OS No.3666/2003. PW 1 admitted above that as

on the date of Ex.P.1, plaintiff No.7 was dead. As on the date of

cross examination, plaintiff No.9 was dead. Plaintiffs have not

taken any pain to bring their legal representatives on record, which

shows the attitude of power of attorneys of this case.

97. But, plaintiffs/PW 1 has not produced the documents

which show the health condition of the plaintiffs who are alleged to

be facing health issues and they did not take any pain to come be-

fore the court to tell the truth. Further, in such situations, to prove

their case, they have not made any effort to appoint court commis-

sioner to record evidence directly from the mouth of either of

plaintiffs which shows they have utterly failed to prove that they

have duly executed and authenticated the Power of Attorney in

favour of Chandra Mouli Reddy to verify the plaint and to file the

present suit. Further they have failed to prove that they have duly

executed and authenticated the power of attorney in favour of

PW1/ L. Shivarama Reddy to give evidence on their behalf in this

suit. On the other hand, the defendant No.24 proved that as on the

60 O.S.No.3666/2003

date of the suit, plaintiff No.7 was no more and the plaintiffs filed

their suit through power of attorney holder, is bad in law. Further,

not only defendant No.24 but also all the defendants who cross ex-

amined PW 1 proved that the Power of Attorney produced by the

plaintiffs belongs not only to Mr. Chandra Mouli Reddy, but also

SPA executed in favour of PW 1/L. Shivarama Reddy are fabricated

documents as a dead person signed on that documents, then

whole document will become void, since how the attesting and

identifying person put their signature on such power of attorneys.

As per above discussions and reasons, whole suit is not maintain-

able accordingly, the defendants proved that the suit is not main-

tainable.

98. Therefore, as per the facts and circumstances of the case

and on the basis of above discussions, this court is of the consid-

ered opinion that Ex.P 1 and Ex.D 13 to Ex.P 19 are fabricated docu-

ment as PW 1 stated that the said S. Chandra Mouli Reddy still alive

and if this court do not recognizes the fabrication of that docu-

ments here, though no Issues are framed in that regard, then

there is a chance of multiplicity of proceedings and further chance

of filing false suit by using said GPAs. Here this court has every au-

thority to recognize it as fabricated on the basis of above discus-

sions as originally this suit was filed by the plaintiffs/GPA holder of

61 O.S.No.3666/2003

the plaintiffs (S. Chandra Mouli Reddy) on the basis of either of

Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19. Further, this court finds that this suit is not

maintainable as discussed supra as the suit is filed by dead person

and the due procedure of law is not followed while filing the plaint

and amended plaints are not signed by either parties or GPA

holder and they have not verified them and they are not attached

with verifying affidavit. Only the learned counsel for plaintiffs put

his signature on the amended plaints which is not tenable under

law. Accordingly, this Court answers Addl.Issue No.3 dated 24-02-

2011, Addl.Issue No.2 and 3 dated 30-08-2018 in the Affirmative.

Addl.Issue No 4 and 5 dated 24-02-2016 are answered in the Nega-

tive.

99. Issue No 1 to 4, Addl.Issue No 1 and 2 dated 24-02-

2011, Addl.Issue No 1 dated 30-08-2018 :

Though as per above discussions, it is clear that the this suit

is not maintainable and this case is a false case, the main docu-

ments through which the suits are filed are fabricated and the orig-

inal plaintiffs anyway never-ever come before the court and further

the GPA holder through whom this suit is filed that is S. Chandra

Mouli Reddy also did not appear before the court and evidence

lead by another GPA that is Shivarama Reddy, than the GPA holder

who filed this suit etc., are enough to dismiss this suit, but for full-

62 O.S.No.3666/2003

fledged judgment and to avoid third round litigation as this is sec-

ond round litigation as it is remitted case by Hon'ble High Court of

Karnataka as stated above and hence to avoid all the above, this

Court gone through remaining Issues which are regarding facts

and law connected to subject matter of this suit.

100. These, Seven Issues are inter-connected to each other,

hence to avoid repeated discussions they are taken up together

here under;

On perusal of plaint, the plaintiffs have filed this case without

prayer for declaration of their ownership and title and they prayed

for declaration of the order passed by the 1 st defendant in RD 197

LGB, 2003 dated 17-04-2003 as non est in the eye of law. Surprising

point is nowhere in the plaint they narrated about their title and

ownership of the property and they filed this suit by stating that as

a joint family they enjoyed and in possession of suit schedule prop-

erty and their ancestor Pasalappa Reddy constructed a private tank

in the suit schedule properties in 1890's and on that basis now,

they are claiming to declare the above stated order as non-est. In

the plaint, they narrated about the previous litigation and con-

nected litigation in respect of property in Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte

village which shows that these plaintiffs made separate similar liti-

gation pertaining to this suit schedule property which is coming

63 O.S.No.3666/2003

under properties in Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte village and in respect of

property in Sy.No.69 of Haralakunte village. Surprising point is in

alleged GPAs which are marked as Ex.D 13 to Ex.D 19, they inserted

both the properties in GPAs, but here in this Ex.P 1, just mentioned

as to prosecute in OS No 3666/2003. Nowhere in the plaint, there is

pleading about their clear title and the contentions raised by the

defendants in the written statements create cloud about the title

and possession of the plaintiffs, despite that, the plaintiffs have not

prayed for declaration of their title which shows they are trying to

get the fruit in the case by avoiding payment of court fee, by just

paying Rs.75/- to the extent of 15 acre 11 guntas of land without

mentioning whether it is agricultural or converted land in both

body of the plaint and also the plaint schedule and thus on the

plain reading of the plaint itself, it shows clever drafting.

101. Next to that, the said alleged order dated 17-04-2003 is

passed by defendant No.1 who is the Principal Secretary of

Revenue Department which is marked as Ex.P 31. In this document

it is ordered as:-

"ಸದರಿ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಕೈಗೊಂಡ ನಿರ್ಣಯದಂತೆ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ತಾಲೂಕು

ಬೇಗೂರು ಹೋಬಳಿ ಮುಳ್ಳು ಕುಂಟೆ ಗ್ರಾ ಮದ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31ರ 15 ಎಕರೆ 11 ಗುಂಟೆ

104. Further, it is stated that:-

105. Then, in that proceedings the concerned authority by

due process considered that the suit schedule properties are gov-

ernment tank bed area and there is no pending litigation on the

same. While filing of this case, the plaintiffs have clear knowledge

about this order as main prayer is to declare the said order as non-

est, then definitely plaintiffs shall pray for declaration of their title

as the said order tells that suit schedule property is government

land. As per plaint pleadings itself, the plaintiffs relied upon ge-

nealogical tree only with regard to their ownership over the prop-

erty. They have not pleaded as to how their ancestors acquired the

said property. There is no single piece of document of title of an-

cestors of plaintiffs such as "document of Government grant such

as inams or in any other way of government grant or purchase

deeds/sale deeds". Further, there is no narration about any ad-

verse possession of plaintiffs which is hostile to the title of the de-

67 O.S.No.3666/2003

fendants which shows that plaintiffs themselves tied their hands

to get relief in future by way of "adverse possession" as by filing of

this suit "they surrendered their right of adverse possession if any"

over the suit schedule property for present and future in respect of

this suit schedule property.

106. Further Ex.P 31 and 31(a) clearly say the matter is con-

nected to "land acquisition" for BDA, then, plaintiffs without taking

action before competent authority filed this suit by invoking civil

nature, which clearly shows the attitude of the plaintiffs, in which

they are trying to get "multiple benefits by throwing a stone" as

without payment of court fee, knowing that their title is in cloud

without making prayer for declaration of their title and and trying

to get relief by filing in wrong Court though
Section 5
of CPC gives

clear provision of bar to file such suits where the special law re-

garding revenue matter existed and bars the jurisdiction of civil

court and
Section 5
of CPC reproduced here under as the plaintiffs

have clear knowledge that for their claim, the doors of Land Acqui-

sition Act and connected revenue Acts are closed;

"5. Application of the Code to Revenue Courts.--(1)
Where any Revenue Courts are governed by the provisions of
this Code in those matters of procedure upon which any spe-
cial enactment applicable to them is silent, the State Govern-
ment 2*** may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare

68 O.S.No.3666/2003

that any portions of those provisions which are not expressly
made applicable by this Code shall not apply to those Courts,
or shall only apply to them with such modifications as the
State Government 3*** may prescribe.

(2) "Revenue Court" in sub-section (1) means a Court
having jurisdiction under any local law to entertain suits or
other proceedings relating to the rent, revenue or profits of
land used for agricultural purposes, but does not include a
Civil Court having original jurisdiction under this Code to try
such suits or proceedings as being suits or proceedings of a
civil nature."

A "Revenue Court" as a Court with original jurisdiction
under this Code to try suits or proceedings relating to the rent,
revenue, or income of land used for agricultural purposes, it
does not provide a Civil Court with original jurisdiction under
this Code to try such suits or proceedings as civil suits or pro-
ceedings.

107. Then, it is clear that plaintiffs, if they want to get relief

through civil court with regard to cause of action of this suit, then

they have two options;

 they ought to produce clear title deed;

 they ought to make prayer of declaration of their title and

ownership as without clear title they do not get relief of dec-

laration of the order of revenue officer as non-est as prayed

in prayer (a).

69 O.S.No.3666/2003

108. Further, PW 1 has produced Ex.P 36 and Ex.P 37 which are

the orders passed in LAC No.143/1988 and LAC No.144/1988 in re-

spect of Sy.No.7 and Sy.No.8 of Yellakunte village and in Ex.P 31

and Ex.P 31(a), it is stated that suit schedule properties are govern-

ment tank bed land, makes it clear that since 1988 itself, suit

schedule property belongs to government as if these plaintiffs

claim their title then at that time itself they ought to file LAC case.

109. Further, after receiving of entire records in OS No 4830/96,

PW 1 has stated in page No 33 as:-

" Now I see the entire records of OS 4830/96 called from
CCH No.9. I admit that the plaintiffs herein had filed the said
suit along with some other plaintiffs I admit it. Hence the en-
tire records of OS 4830/96 is marked as Ex.D.20 I cannot iden-
tify the signatures that are forthcoming on the plaint of OS
4830/96. So also about the signatures that are present in the
vakalath. Now I see the withdrawal memo filed in OS 4830/96
as I was not present when the said parties signed the said
memo, I cannot identify who have signed the said memo. It is
true to say that we do not have any other documents with re-
gard to the suit schedule property other than the documents
produced by us before the Court. N A RFA is pending before
the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka with regard to the suit
schedule property and re-survey No.69 of Haralukunte village.
But I do not know the exact RFA number."

70 O.S.No.3666/2003

110. On perusal of Ex.D 20, it shows that the said suit was filed

for declaration and injunction by plaintiff No.8 and others herein

against the defendant which shows that plaintiffs are trying to

avoid bar by res-judicata by filing suits on same cause of action and

subject matter by arraying different plaintiffs by mingling up and

jumbling up in different cases and different LAC proceedings.

111. At this juncture, it is apt to refer to the guidelines laiddown

by the Hon'ble Apex Court in
Anathula Sudhakar v/s Buchch Reddy

case as herein this case, there is no supporting document for their

title, which creates cloud as there is no document of their posses-

sion too over the suit schedule property which is mandatory under

the guidelines given by Hon'ble Apex Court in Anathula sudhakara

vs Buchi Reddy and the relevant portion of the judgment is repro-

duced here under;

"
Anathula Sudhakar vs P Buchi Reddy
(2008) 4 SCC 594) in
which guidelines given by Hon'ble Apex Court as;
"17. To summarize, the position in regard to suits for
prohibitory injunction relating to immovable property, is as
under:

(a) Where a cloud is raised over plaintiff's title and he does
not have possession, a suit for declaration and possession, with
or without a consequential injunction, is the remedy. Where the
plaintiff's title is not in dispute or under a cloud, but he is out
of possession, he has to sue for possession with a

71 O.S.No.3666/2003

consequential injunction. Where there is merely an interference
with plaintiff's lawful possession or threat of dispossession, it is
sufficient to sue for an injunction simpliciter.

(b) As a suit for injunction simpliciter is concerned only with
possession, normally the issue of title will not be directly and
substantially in issue. The prayer for injunction will be decided
with reference to the finding on possession. But in cases where
de jure possession has to be established on the basis of title to
the property, as in the case of vacant sites, the issue of title
may directly and substantially arise for consideration, as
without a finding thereon, it will not be possible to decide the
issue of possession.

(c) But a finding on title cannot be recorded in a suit for
injunction, unless there are necessary pleadings and
appropriate issue regarding title [either specific, or implied as
noticed in Annaimuthu Thevar (supra)]. Where the averments
regarding title are absent in a plaint and where there is no
issue relating to title, the court will not investigate or examine
or render a finding on a question of title, in a suit for
injunction. Even where there are necessary pleadings and issue,
if the matter involves complicated questions of fact and law
relating to title, the court will relegate the parties to the remedy
by way of comprehensive suit for declaration of title, instead of
deciding the issue in a suit for mere injunction.

(d) Where there are necessary pleadings regarding title, and
appropriate issue relating to title on which parties lead
evidence, if the matter involved is simple and straight-forward,
the court may decide upon the issue regarding title, even in a
suit for injunction. But such cases, are the exception to the

72 O.S.No.3666/2003

normal rule that question of title will not be decided in suits for
injunction. But persons having clear title and possession suing
for injunction, should not be driven to the costlier and more
cumbersome remedy of a suit for declaration, merely because
some meddler vexatiously or wrongfully makes a claim or tries
to encroach upon his property. The court should use its
discretion carefully to identify cases where it will enquire into
title and cases where it will refer to plaintiff to a more
comprehensive declaratory suit, depending upon the facts of
the case."

112. Then, this suit is definitely not maintainable as there is no

prayer for declaration of title.

113. Further, in the cross examination of PW 1, he admitted

about LAC proceedings which establishes bar of this suit for want

of jurisdiction as PW 1 admitted that the suit claim is rooted with

LAC proceedings. In page No 16 of cross examination of PW 1, he

has stated that :-

"It is not true to say that in the LAC proceedings we have

stated that the said Sudarshan Reddy belongs to the branch of

A.P. Ramaiah S/o. Pasalareddy."

114. Here important to note that PW 1 has not denied the LAC

proceedings initiated by plaintiffs. In page Nos. 17 to 20 of his

cross examination, he admitted and identified the documents

73 O.S.No.3666/2003

pertaining to different survey numbers mentioned in Ex.P 31 and

Ex.P 31(a) and also admitted LAC proceedings on Sy.No 13 and also

admitted that the said survey number renumbered as Sy.No 31

which is suit schedule property and also admitted that in the said

document, it is noted as government land and in this regard Ex.D 3

to Ex.D 10 are got marked through confrontation and avoid

ambiguity the same portion of deposition are reproduced here

under though it is lengthy;

"I am not aware of the fact that LAC proceedings with
regard to Survey No.7 of Yellukunte Village were held in LAC
No.378/86-87 before the Land Acquisition Office, LAC
No.379/86-87 with regard to Survey No.8, LAC No.380/86-87
with regard to Survey No.9, LAC No.381/86-87 with regard to
Survey No.10, LAC No.386/86-87 with regard to Survey No.30.
Now, I see one document which is now marked as Ex.D.3. It is
true to say that Ex.D.3 I with regard to LAC proceedings with
regard to Survey No.7, so also Ex.D4 with regard to Survey
No.8. Now, I see a document which is shown to me with
regard to Survey No.9, but I am not aware of the said fact. I
am not aware of the fact that the plaintiffs herein might have
participated in the LAC proceedings with regard to Survey
No.9. Now, I see a document which is shown to me with
regard to Survey no.10 which is now marked as Ex.D.5. It is
true to say that Ex.D5 is with regard to the LAC proceedings of
Survey No.10/1 & 10/2. Now, I see one document shown to me
which is now marked as Ex.D.6. It is true to say that Ex.D6 is

74 O.S.No.3666/2003

with regard to the pahchayat Parikath entered within the
family including the plaintiffs and myself. The said panchayat
Parikath is with regard to the family partition within our
family of the property acquired by BDA and some of the
properties of our family which were acquired by BDA are not
mentioned in the said Parikath. Now I see another document
which is now marked as Ex.D.7. I admit that we had filed the
said document before the LAC Officer, but he had not accepted
the same. It is not true to say that Ex.D.7 contains all the
properties of our joint family. Now I see one RTC ad one katha
certificate, but it is not true to say that the said documents are
produced by us in the LAC proceedings to show the division of
the entire property of our joint family. Without verifying the
records, I cannot say the description of our joint family, which
are not mentioned in Ex.D.7. It is not true to say that our joint
family does not possess any property other than mentioned in
Ex.D.7 as such we have not mentioned about those properties
in Ex.D.7. I do not now one Pasala Reddy of our family had
filed an application before the Special Tahsildar, Bangalore
South Taluk on 26.12.1974 requesting for the grant of
occupancy right with respect to Survey No.7 of Yellukunte
Village to an extent of one acre 24 guntas. As there are three
to four Pasala Reddys in our family now I cannot say which of
the Pasala Reddy has filed the said Form No.7 with regard to
Survey no.7. It is not true to say that in the said Form No.7 the
said Pasala Reddy has shown that the khathedar and owner of
Survey no.7 is Basavanna Devaru. It is not true to say that, in
the said Form No.7, in the khathedar and land lord column,
the name of Basavanna Devaru is shown.

75 O.S.No.3666/2003

Now I see one document shown to me which is now marked
as Ex.D8. It is true to say that BDA has acquired an extent of
24 acres 7 guntas in Survey No.13 of Yellukunte Village
according to the document. It is true to say that none of our
family members including the plaintiffs and myself had filed
any objections with regard to the acquisition of of any extent
of land as shown in Ex.D.8. It is not true to say that, as we
were not the owners of any part of land in Survey No.13, we
had not filed any objections for the acquisition of the said
survey numbers (the witness volunteers) as we are the owners
of the lands of Survey No.13 which is now a part of re-survey
number 31. Now I see one document shown to me and I
admit it and marked as Ex.D.9. It is true to say that it is the
Tippani Uthar of re-survey number 31. It is true to say that
according to Ex.D.9, an extent of 25 guntas of land has been
taken into Survey No.13 to form resurvey number 31. Now I
see another document shown to me I admit it and it is marked
as Ex.D.10. It is true that Ex.D.10 is an Index of land of Survey
No.13. It is true that in Ex.D.10, it is shown that 25 guntas of
land has been taken from survey No.13 for the purpose of
tank, which is n ow a part of re-sruvey No.31. It is true to say
that in Ex.D.10, it is shown that Sarkari Musathu Kaval."

115. Further, in his cross examination, he has stated that he and

plaintiffs are relatives and they are owners of 25 guntas of land in

Sy.No.13, but no single document of ownership is produced.

Therefore, suit is not maintainable without prayer for declaration

of title.

76 O.S.No.3666/2003

116. Evidently, the suit is not maintainable and further, the

genealogy which is marked as Ex.P 2 is also not genuine as it is not

corresponding with paragraph 2 of the plaint and same is admitted

in the cross examination of PW 1. Mainly, the plaintiffs based their

case on family tree stating in paragraph 3 of the plaint as their

entire joint family as evidenced by the genealogical tree owned

and possessed joint ancestral properties and they included

property in Sy.No 69 of Haralakunte village which is not the subject

matter of this suit. The instant case may be first of its kind, wherein

the plaintiffs for filing a suit for declaration and perpetual

injunction regarding ancestral property, relying only upon family

tree without producing a single document of title deed of their

ancestors.

117. As per paragraph 2 of the plaint, one can identify the

relationship of Linga Reddy and his sons only, but we cannot

identify the plaintiffs are children of whom as the main base of this

case is genealogy. On perusal of Ex.P 2, they have produced

genealagy of Thimma Reddy (deceased) S/o. Linga Reddy. But, in

the plaint, it is stated that their genealogy is routed with original

person Linga Reddy. As per this Ex.P 2 the said Thimma Reddy had

two sons they are Linga Reddy and Chikk Nanda Reddy. The said

Linga Reddy had 4 children namely, father of Smt, Nanjamma,

77 O.S.No.3666/2003

Linga Reddy, Ravindra and Ramesh (the name of first son of Linga

Reddy is not visible in the document), Dr.L Narayana Reddy, Dr. L.

Srinivasa Reddy and L. Rama Reddy. But none of them are plaintiffs

here in. Chikka Nanda Reddy had a son by name Chikka Ramaiah

(deceased). The children of this deceased Chikka Ramaiah is shown

as Papamma, A. C. Sudarshana Reddy (defendant No. 6), A. C.

Prakash and A. C. Srinivasa Reddy. No plaintiffs other than plaintiff

No.6 are found in this genealogy. Surprising point is in paragraph

2 of the plaint, wherein it is specifically stated that plaintiffs have

produced this Ex.P 2 in proof of their case. But, in first sight itself,

without going through cross examination of PW 1, as discussed

supra, the plaintiffs failed to prove their own genealogy. In Ex.P 2

the Ex.D 1 marked through confrontation and the portion of cross

examination of PW 1 in page No 15 in respect of genealogy/Ex.P 2

is reproduced here under to show that PW 1 utterly failed to prove

genealogy as,;

" It is true to say that there are no other male co coparcener
present in the family of late Linga Reddy other than the
persons who were born later than 1999. The name of the 3 rd
plaintiff Venkatareddy son of Narayana Reddy is shown in
Ex.P.2. the relevant portion is marked as Ex.D.1. It is true to
say that as per Ex.D.1, it is shown that Venkatareddy son of
Narayanareddy aged about 37 years. It is also true to say that
in the plaint, the age of the 3rd plaintiff is shown as 58 years. It

78 O.S.No.3666/2003

is not true to say that there is no relation between the 3 rd
plaintiff and the remaining plaintiffs and that 3rd plaintiff does
not belong to the family of late Linga Reddy. The name of 6 th
plaintiff Sudarshan Reddy is also shown I Ex.P.2. The relevant
portion is now marked as Ex.D.2. It is true to say that it is
forthcoming in Ex.D.2 that the said Sudarshan Reddy is the son
of Chikkaramaiah who belongs to the family of Thimmaredy."

118. Then, plaintiffs failed to establish their relationship and

genealogy and hence, even on this count also, this suit is not

maintainable as the main base for this suit invoked by the plaintiffs

is their joint family relationship. When, the joint family relationship

is not proved then, there is no locus standi to the plaintiffs to claim

suit schedule property as their family properties.

119. As per Ex.P.31, the plaintiffs had knowledge that suit

schedule property is tank bed area and in the plaint, they have

stated that the said tank is constructed in 1980s by Pasalappa

Reddy.

120. On perusal of Ex.P 3 to Ex.P 65, all are related to LAC

proceedings, RTCs and endorsements. There are no documents

produced to show that plaintiffs are in possession of suit schedule

property. All these exhibits are enlisted at the end of this

judgment. Without documents of possession, plaintiffs made

79 O.S.No.3666/2003

prayer (b) ie., not to dispossess them from plaint schedule

property. When, plaintiffs failed to prove their joint family

relationship as supra, then how they claim to be in joint possession

over that larger extent of suit schedule property? They did not pray

for declaration of their title and did not pray for handing over of

possession from defendants and in his own cross examination, PW

1 without giving chance to defendants to prove their possession,

admitted the possession of defendants in the suit schedule

property as the same is reproduced here under;

In page No 30 of his cross examination PW 1 admitted as:-

" It is true that one person has constructed house in the suit
schedule property (the witness volunteers) there is Police
protection in the suit schedule property and if we try to enter
the suit schedule premises the Police will chase us out. It is
not true to say that neither myself nor the said
Chendramoulireddy had no proper authority to represent the
plaintiffs and to file this suit and to give evidence in this suit."

121. Prior to that PW 1 in page No 22 admitted the property in

Sy.No 31 as government land as:-

"I am not aware of the fact that in the said writ petition, the
3rd defendant BDA was also made as a party. Now I see Ex.P.6
it is issued by survey department. Now I see one document
filed by me earlier said to be the typed copy of Ex.P.6, which is
now marked as Ex.D.11. But I am not aware of the fact that the

80 O.S.No.3666/2003

said typed version was also filed by the 1 st plaintiff in the said
writ petition. It is true that in Ex.D.11, it is mentioned that
resurvey number 31 is mentioned as "Sarkari Karabinanteh"

(ಸರ್ಕಾರಿ ಖರಾಬಿನಂತೆ) I am aware of the fact that the plaintiffs herein

and some others earlier, had filed OS No.4830/96 with regard
to the suit schedule property. Now I see Xerox copy of the
plaint filed in OS No.4830/96. I admit it and it is now marked
as Ex.D.12. Now I see Ex.D.12 and now I see para 27 of the
plaint which is now marked as Ex.D.12(a). It is true to say that
in the said plaint, it is stated that the RTCs of the suit schedule
property from the years 1968-69 to 1993-94 were standing in
the name of the plaintiffs. It is true that according to us, the
said entries in the RTCs were made basing on the orders
passed by the then learned District Deputy Commissioner in CL
1314/34-35 dated 25.11.1935. It is true that in the said order,
the learned District Deputy Commissioner has only formed a
new survey number from taking lands from survey No.7 to 10
and 13. Now I see Ex.P.4. It is true that in Ex.P.4, it is
mentioned as "Sarkari karabu kere."

122. And further in page No.29, he admitted that BDA

developed suit schedule property as:-

"It is true that plaintiffs had filed an application for the
grant of Temporary Injunction against the 3rd defendant. It is
true that in the said affidavit, it has been stated that the BDA is
trying to develop the entire suit schedule property. It is true
that BDA has developed the suit schedule property, but it is not
true to say that the entire suit schedule property has been

81 O.S.No.3666/2003

allotted by the BDA in favour of the allottees. I am not aware
of the fact that BDA has allotted the entire suit schedule
property to the allottees".

123. From the above admission of PW1, he is not aware about

allotment, but does not deny the allotment.

124. Further, in page No 37 of his cross examination PW 1
admitted as:-

"In Sy.No.31 of Yellagunte Village, 3rd defendant has formed
roads, drainage. I do not know regarding defendant No.14
constructed the house and residing there in."

125. Further, in page No 41 and 42 of his cross examination

conducted by learned counsel for defendant No 15 and 16, PW 1

has stated as:-

"Plaintiffs have filed suit for title and possession. Suit
property is part and parcel of Sy.No.31 of Yellukunte Village
measuring 15 acres 11 guntas, Sy.Nos.7, 8, 9, 10 and 13
comprised in Sy.No.31. I am unable to say to what extent the
plaintiffs are the owners of the land in Sy.No.7, 8, 9, 10 and

13. Pasara Reddy was the original owner of the suit property.
He acquired the suit property under Sale Deed. I do not know
who executed the sale deed in favour of of whom, because
that sale transaction was taken place about 150 years ago. I
have seen the documents produced by the plaintiffs in this
case. I do not know the date, month and year of to the sale

82 O.S.No.3666/2003

deed of Pasara Reddy. I do not know who is the vendor of
Pasara Reddy."

126. Even though we invoke
Section 90
of Indian Evidence Act

about documents which are more than 30 years old but plaintiff

failed to prove it by producing revenue documents, and without

producing title deeds or documents pertaining to grant of land.

127. Moreover, in page No 42 of his cross examination PW 1

admitted as:-

"After the death of Pasara Reddy, rounded off the name of
Pasara Reddy and entered the name of the Government. But, I
do not know in which year, the name of the Government
recorded in the revenue records."

128. Then, plaintiff admitted the suit schedule property as

government land.

129. Including the above in last paragraph of page No 42 the

PW 1 admitted as:-

"After death of Pasara Reddy, the property of Pasara Reddy
was not transferred to the names of L.Rs., of Pasara Reddy
through documents."

130. Then, it is clear that plaintiffs and legal representatives

of Pasala Reddy (who allegedly the predecessor of plaintiffs who

83 O.S.No.3666/2003

alleged to have built a tank in suit schedule property ) are not the

owners in possession of suit schedule property.

131. In page No. 43 of his cross examination PW 1 stated

that:-

"On approximate basis, the boundaries of the suit schedule
property are mentioned in the plaint. No documents in order
to show the boundaries of the suit property."

132. Then PW 1/Plaintiffs themselves failed to identify the

suit schedule property which is main ingredient to prove their case.

133. Next to that, the PW 1 himself admitted in page 43 of his

cross-examination that tank is not built in plaint schedule property

as:-

"Pasara Reddy constructed the tank in the original
Sy.No.69. It is false to suggest that I have not produced any
documents to show that Pasara Reddy constructed the tank."

134. In pages 43 and 44 of his cross-examination, PW 1

further stated that:-

"It is false to suggest that Exs.P.27 to P.30 are the Xerox
copies and Exs.P.27 to P.30 are created by me. I do not kn ow
the sale deeds are executed in favour of defendants 15 and 16
in respect of the suit sites. It is false to suggest that though the
defendants 15 and 16 are the owners and in possession of the
suit sites, I am deposing false evidence. It is false to suggest

84 O.S.No.3666/2003

that the plaintiffs have no documents to show that their
possession over the suit property as on the date of the suit. It
is false to suggest that we have filed this false suit in order to
knock off the off government property" which is reflected in
evidence of D.W.3.

135. Finally, in the cross examination of PW 1 dated 08-08-

2012 by the learned counsel for defendant No.23, in page 46, PW 1

clearly admitted that BDA acquired and formed layout by stating

as:-

"The BDA, with the help of Police, had acquired the land in
Sy.no.31 in the year 1986 and formed the sites. I do not know
how many sites were formed by the B.D.A. I know that
H.S.R.Layout name is given to the land of Sy.No.31 and
surrounding layouts. It is false to suggest that the BDA has
formed the sites in the land of Sy.No.31 in the year 1986.
About 07 years ago, the BDA has formed the sites in the land
of Sy.No.31 with the aid of Police. I have not challenged the
acquisition proceedings before the Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka, except filing of this suit."

136. Again in page No.60, PW 1 has admitted as:-

"The drainage are formed and provided civic amenities in
the suit lands illegally with the help of Police. Few people have
constructed houses in the suit lands."

85 O.S.No.3666/2003

137. Then it is clear that plaintiffs are not in possession of

suit schedule property.

138. The evidence of PW 1 gone contra to plaint pleadings as

in plaint pleadings, they are stating that Pasala Reddy built tank in

Sy.No 31 which is suit schedule property, but in his cross

examination, twice in page No 43 and cross examination dated 29-

08-2012 by the learned counsel for defendant No 1 and 2, stated

that tank constructed by his grand father in Sy.No.69 and also

stated in same page as "there is no tank in suit land."

139. There is further admission by PW 1 in cross examination

dated 06-09-2012 by learned counsel for defendant No 3 as:-

" It is false to suggest that Preliminary and Final
Notifications were issued in respect of suit schedule property.
It is true to suggest that in the total extent of land, H.S.R
Layout is formed. Few of us received the compensation
amount in respect of .few lands."

140. If in total extent HSR layout is formed, there denial of

notifications, assumes insignifance. Therefore, as per facts and

circumstances of the case and above discussions, without other

choice to defendants, he himself failed to prove not only

maintainability of this suit, but also he failed to prove route/root

cause of this suit as failed to prove genealogy on the basis of which

86 O.S.No.3666/2003

he alleged that suit schedule property is their ancestral property,

and further failed to prove the suit schedule property as his

ancestral property as he admitted that it is property of government

and his great great father did not construct tank in suit schedule

property and admitted that the suit schedule property is acquired

by BDA and BDA formed HSR layout in suit schedule property and

failed to prove the possession of plaintiffs over the suit schedule

property as they received compensation for BDA acquisition and

BDA formed drainage system and provided civic amenities and

admitted that some other persons constructed houses in suit

schedule property.

141. It is important to note that by summoning Special

Thahsilar as witness PW 2, the plaintiffs further taken their case to

the stage of bad to worse situation for them in their way of proving

their case as in page No 7 of his evidence there is a note that:-

"Question : According to you what is the nature of the
lands in Survey No.31 of Yellukunte Village?
Answer:- It is a Government Tank.

(At this stage learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted
that as this witness deposing against the interest of the
plaintiffs, he may be permitted to cross-examine this witness
by treating him as hostile and prayed time to file appropriate
application. Hence, further examination of the witness is
deferred at request."

87 O.S.No.3666/2003

142. These two sentences are enough to dismiss the suit as

suit schedule property is totally a government land not the land of

family of plaintiffs as the witness who is concerned authority of

government to identify the property, has clearly admitted that the

suit schedule property is government land.

143. In page No 9 of cross examination of PW 2, he has stated

as:-

" As I have not received any communication from the
Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, I cannot say though the
Xerox copy of the orders passed by the Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka in WP No.3912/2003 is shown to me and that I
cannot say whether the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has
stated the operation of the orders passed by the Tahsildar
dated 26.05.2003 with regard to the suit schedule property in
RRT 43/98-99. Now, I see 21 certified copies of the RTCs of
Survey Nos.7, 8 and 10 of Yellukunte Village. I admit those
RTCs. Hence, they are marked as Ex.P.38 to P.58 (the witness
volunteers) as the above matter has been referred to COD
investigation the entire records pertaining to the suit schedule
property are with the COD Department since 7.11.1994. I
cannot say that Ex.P.38 to P.58 and other RTCs marked in this
suit are issued by our office according to procedure. It is true
that other than the orders passed on 31.12.1994 cancelling
the entries which the name of A.P. Rama Reddy and
Pasalareddy with regard to the suit schedule property, no
proceedings or orders has been passed by us with regard to

88 O.S.No.3666/2003

the said subject. I cannot say about the in action of the
Government with regard to the suit schedule property since
1968 upto 1994. It is true that I our office and ADLR office, we
have the documents relating to the ownership of the plaintiffs
over the suit schedule property. I am not aware of the fact that
in RRT 43/98-99 records showing that A.P.Ramaiah and
Pasalareddy have contributed private tank in the suit schedule
property were called from the ADLRs office."

144. There is clear admission in page Nos.15 and 16 of cross

examination of PW 2 as suit schedule property is government

property which belongs to 3rd defendant, such as:-

" It may be true to say that as many of the records
pertaining to the suit schedule property are with the
Karnataka Lokayuktha, we do not have any records to show
that during the year 1978 itself, it is learnt that the suit
schedule property is a Government Tank as such the entries of
column No.12/2 and column No.9 were discontinued. It is true
to say that I say that it is learnt during the year 1978 itself,
that the suit schedule property is a government tank basing
on the office correspondence and office notes available in our
office. It is true to say that basing upon our office
correspondence, I say that since form the year 1978-79, the
entries in the RTCs of the suit schedule property in column
No.12/2 and 9 were discontinued and the said entries once
again continued due to the passing of the orders as per
Ex.D.21. Departmental proceedings were initiated against the
said Tahsildar and he was punished with reducing of official

89 O.S.No.3666/2003

rank. It is true to say that as the Government knew that suit
schedule property belongs to the Government it has been
transferred in favour of the 3rd defendant BDA. It is true to say
that after verifying the documents pertaining to the suit
schedule property and knowing about the fact that the
Government is the absolute owner of the suit schedule
property and that no 3rd person has any right over the suit
schedule property, the same has been transferred in favour of
the 3rd defendant BDA."

145. Further he has stated in page No.17 as:-

" It is true to say that unless it is specifically shown as
private tank, all tanks are deemed to be Government tanks."

146. Now, on perusal of Ex.D 22 to Ex.D 26, in the Tippani

Sketch it is shown as "kere". Ex.D 28, Ex.D 30, Ex.D 32, Ex.D 35 the

official memorandum of BDA dated 19-08-1987 shows about

approval of award and compensation towards Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10/1,

10/2 of Yellukunte village. In cross examination of PW 1 in page No

41 stated that " suit property is part and parcel of Sy.No 31 of

Yellikunte village measuring 15 acre 11 guntas. Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13

comprised in Sy.No 31. I an unable to say to what extent plaintiffs are

the owners of the land in Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13." And in the cross

examination dated 29-08-2012 by the learned counsel for

defendant No 1 and 2, PW 1 has stated as, " It is true to suggest that,

90 O.S.No.3666/2003

earlier suit land was given as Sy.No 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13. Now the Survey

number is assigned as Sy.No 31." And as discussed supra PW 1

admitted the formation of HSR layout in suit schedule property and

about receiving of compensation.

147. Then, as above, one thing is clear that plaintiffs have no

right, title and interest to get reliefs as prayed in this case. Further,

there is no counter prayer from the defendants other than prayer

for dismissal of the suit with exemplary costs. But Issues are

framed on the basis of pleadings regarding construction of house

by defendant No 14, formation of layout by BDA and allotment of

site to defendant No 24. In this regard in the evidence of PW 1 and

PW 2, as discussed supra, it is established that earlier suit schedule

property is government land and it is acquired by BDA by due

process of law by preliminary and final notifications and BDA

formed HSR layout in the suit schedule property and formed

drainage and provided civic amenities and some persons have

built house in the sites of that layout.

148. In the evidence of DW1, the plaintiffs failed to elicit

anything in their favour with corroboration. In the cross

examination of DW 1, no where it is elicited that the government

tank is in Sy.No 9 and nowhere established tank as private tank.

91 O.S.No.3666/2003

Further, in page No 11 though stated as property taken by Pasala

Reddy for formation of tank, but stated as not owner of four

guntas of land as, "not belongs to Pasala Reddy." On the other

hand, the defendant No 14 as DW 2 produced the certified copy of

gift deed dated 11-08-2004 to establish his title and photographs,

negatives of photos, water bill, electricity demand bill and

electricity receipts to establish his possession. In Ex.D 48, there is

recital about sale deed by GPA in favour of Donor and Ex.D 49 to 56

shows the photos of building. Ex.D 58 to Ex.D 60 shows that the

said bills are in respect to water supply and electricity supply to site

No 1172, 3rd sector, HSR layout, Bangalore. In this regard in page

No 6 of his cross examination DW 2 stated as:-

"ಸೈಟ್‍ ನಂ.1172 ನ್ನು ಬಿಡಿಎ ನಮ್ಮ ತಾಯಿಯ ಪರವಾಗಿ ಮಂಜೂರು ಮಾಡಿದೆ

ಎಂದು ನನ್ನ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಸಾಕ್ಷಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಹೇಳಿದ್ದೇನೆ ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ವಾದ ಪತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ ವಾದಿಗಳು

ಹೇಳಿರುವಂತೆ ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಯ ಅವರ ಮಾಲೀಕತ್ವವನ್ನು ನಾನು ನನ್ನ ಪ್ರತಿವಾದಿ ಪತ್ರದಲ್ಲಿ

ಅಲ್ಲಗಳೆದಿರುತ್ತೇನೆ ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಯ ಮಾಲೀಕರು ಯಾರಾಗಿರಬಹುದು ಎಂದು

ನನಗೆ ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಗೆ ಮಾಲೀಕರು ಯಾರು ಎಂದು ನಿಮಗೆ

ಗೊತ್ತಿಲ್ಲದಿರುವಾಗ ವಾದಿಗಳು ದಾವಾ ಆಸ್ತಿಯ ಮಾಲೀಕರಲ್ಲ ಎಂದು ಅಲ್ಲಗಳೆದಿದ್ದೀರಿ

ಎಂದರೆ ಅವರಿಗೆ ಟೈಟಲ್‍ ಡೀಡ್‍ ಇಲ್ಲ ಬಿಡಿಎ ನಮ್ಮ ತಾಯಿಗೆ ಸೈಟನ್ನು ಮಂಜೂರು

ಮಾಡಿದೆ ಎಂದು ಸಾಕ್ಷಿದಾರರು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾ ರೆ."

92 O.S.No.3666/2003

149. When the learned counsel for plaintiffs put a question

like "Site No 1172" and failed to ask regarding total extent of land

as pleaded in plaint which shows the awareness of the plaintiffs

about formation of sites by BDA in suit schedule property. Whether

BDA can form layout in the place of tank is answerable by the

authorities of BDA that is DW 1 and putting question on that

regard as in page No 7 and 8 of cross examination of DW 2 will not

help the plaintiffs.

150. Though in page No 8 of cross examination of DW 2 it is

stated as:-

"ದಿನಾಂಕ 20-05-2003 ಕ್ಕೆ ವಾದಿಗಳು ಈ ದಾವೆಯನ್ನು ಮಾಡಿ ಬಿಡಿಎ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ಟಿಐ

ಆರ್ಡರ್‍ ಪಡೆದಿದ್ದರು ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ಆದ್ದರಿಂದ ಬಿಡಿಎ ದವರು ಲೇ ಔಟ್‍ ಮಾಡಲು

ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ ಎಂದರೆ ನಿಜ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ಟಿಐ ಆರ್ಡರ್‍ ಇದ್ದ ಕಾರಣ ಬಿಡಿಎ ದವರು ನಮಗೆ

ಮಾಡಿಕೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ಸೇಲ್‍ ಡೀಡ್, ಅಲಾಟ್ಮೆಂಟ್‍ ಲೆಟರ್‍ ಇತರೆ ದಾಖಲೆಗಳು

ಸೃಷ್ಟಿಸಿದವುಗಳು ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ. ಆ ರೀತಿ ನಮಗೆ ಬಿಡಿಎ ದವರು ಕೊಟ್ಟ ದಾಖಲೆಗಳು

ನ್ಯಾ ಯಾಲಯದ ಆದೇಶದ ವಿರುದ್ದ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಟ್ಟಿರುವ ದಾಖಲಾತಿಗಳು ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ."

151. On perusal of order sheet, this suit is filed on 02-06-2003

and order sheet shows only emergent notice sent on IA No. III as

order of staus quo is there in OS No 4830/1996. But, as in this case

as above, the plaintiffs failed to prove their case and hence status

93 O.S.No.3666/2003

quo shall survive. Next to that in page No 9 of cross examination of

DW 2 stated as:-

"ನಮ್ಮ ಮನೆ ಕಟ್ಟಿದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಫೋಟೋಗಳನ್ನು ಹಾಜರುಪಡಿಸಿದ್ದೇನೆ."

152. Then, defendant No.14 established better title than the

plaintiff and his possession over site No.1172 formed out of HSR

layout which is formed in the suit schedule property.

153. Next to him, the SPA holder of defendant No.10 who is

examined as DW 3 produced the SPA executed by defendant No.

10 who is none other than his wife. Ex.D 62 is the certified copy of

sale deed executed by BDA on 12-11-2003 in respect of Site No.

1168 in Sector III of HSR layout. He has produced photographs

with CD, tax paid receipts and electricity and water bill which are

marked as Ex.D 62 to Ex.D 70 and in his cross examination he has

stated that:-

" ಆ ಪ್ರಕಾರ ಎಳ್ಳು ಕುಂಟೆ ಗ್ರಾ ಮದ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31 ಕೆರೆ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರ್ಕಾರಿ ಕೆರೆ ಎಂದು

ಸಾಕ್ಷಿದಾರರು ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾ ರೆ. ಕೆರೆ ಪ್ರದೇಶದಲ್ಲಿ ಲೇ ಔಟ್‍ಮಾಡಬಾರದು ಎಂಬುದು ಕಾನೂನು

ಎಂದರೆ ಇರಬಹುದು. ಸದರಿ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31 ರ ಕೆರೆಯನ್ನು ಬಿಡಿಎದವರು ಭೂ ಸ್ವಾ ಧೀನ

ಮಾಡಿದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ನಾನು ದಾಖಲೆಗಳನ್ನು ಹಾಜರುಪಡಿಸಿಲ್ಲ. ಸದರಿ ಆಸ್ತಿಯನ್ನು 1993 ರಲ್ಲಿ

ನಾವು ಬಿಡಿಎದವರ ಸ್ವಾ ಧೀನಕ್ಕೆ ಕೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದೇವೆ ಎಂದು ಸರ್ಕಾರದವರು ಹೇಳಿದ್ದಾ ರೆ ಎಂದರೆ

ನಿಜ. ಸದರಿ ಸರ್ವೆ ನಂ.31 ರ ಜಮಿಾನಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ಬಿಡಿಎದವರಿಗೆ ಹಕ್ಕು ಮತ್ತು ಅಧಿಕಾರ

94 O.S.No.3666/2003

ಇಲ್ಲ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ. ತಮಗೆ ಅಧಿಕಾರ ಇಲ್ಲದಿದ್ದರೂ ಸಹಾ ಬಿಡಿಎ ನನ್ನ ಹೆಂಡತಿಯ

ಹೆಸರಿಗೆ ಸೈಟನ್ನು ಮಂಜೂರು ಮಾಡಿ ಕ್ರಯಪತ್ರ ಬರೆದುಕೊಟ್ಟಿದೆ ಎಂದರೆ ಸರಿಯಲ್ಲ."

154. There is no question about her possession and no

contra elicited about her title and possession and plaintiff ought to

elicit about right and title of BDA with DW 1 only not with this

defendant.

155.Further the defendant No.12 is examined as DW 4 and

Ex.D 71 to 90 are got marked through him which are the certified

copy of sale deed dated 04-03-2004 which shows his vendor

purchased property site No.1161 in HSR layout from BDA and other

documents are tax paid receipt paid by him, ECs, photographs,

water bill, electricity bill and receipts pertaining to said site and

same cross examination it is elicited as same as cross examination

of DW 3 where in plaintiffs failed to extract contra to title and

possession of this defendant over the concerned site which is

formed out of HSR layout.

156. Remaining documents are the documents marked

through DW 1 which are revenue records listed at the end of this

judgment which shows Sy.No 31 as Sarkari karabhu land and as

"Kerege ada jameenu". Ex.D 43 is the notification of acquisition of

95 O.S.No.3666/2003

lands for BDA which includes suit schedule property also shows

podding of Sy.No 31 as 31/1 to 31/7. Further Ex.D 1 to Ex.D 19 are

marked through confrontation PW 1 to establish the suit filed by

the plaintiffs is not maintainable.

157. Now, the learned counsel for defendant No.3 relied

upon following citations;

1. AIR 2008 SC 2033 (
Anathula Sudhakar vs Buchi Reddy
)

which is discussed supra;

2. AIR 2003 SC 234 (
Northern Indian Glass Industries vs

Jaswant Singh and others
) in which it is held as:-

" (B) Land Acquisition Act,
S.16
- Taking of possession - After

passing of award - Effect - Land vests with Government free

from all encumbrances - Landowner thereafter cannot ask for

restitution of possession even if land is not used for the

purpose of which it was acquired".

This citation directly gives effect adverse to plaintiff in this case.

3. AIR 1996 SC 3377 (
T N Housing Board vs A Viswam
(dead)

by Lrs) in which it is held as;

" (A) Civil P.C. (5 of 1908), O.39, R.2 - Injunction against
Housing Board - Housing Board acquiring land for public
purpose - Suit for injunction filed by landowner of small part
of acquired land - Land Acquisition Officer (LAO) taking
possession of whole land and delivering it to Housing Board -

96 O.S.No.3666/2003

Non impleadment of LAS as party defendant to suit -
Presumption under
S.114 (e)
of Evidence Act,. Attracted - Land-
owner cannot be said to be in possession of land - Injunction
cannot be issued against Housing Board in whom Land stood
vested.

(B) Land Acquisition Act (1 of 1894),
S.16
- Acquisition of
Land - Mode of taking possession - Recording of a
memorandum or panchanama by LAO in presence of witnesses
signed by them - Would constitute taking possession of land."

Presently, in this case before this court also, the plaintiffs are

claiming as owners of suit schedule property without any title deed

where the acquisition for public purpose is established as

discussed supra.

Surprising point in this case is plaintiffs have not sought for

declaration of their title and not sought for handing over

possession though they are not in possession.

 2005 SCC OnLine Kar 705 (ITI Employees' Housing Co-
Operative Society Ltd, Bangalore vs Venkatappa) in which clearly

discussed about land acquisition proceedings which is

applicable to the documents confronted to PW 1 in his cross

examination.

 ILR 2007 KAR 5121 ( M.B.Bettaswamy vs The Commissioner,
BDA and Another) in which it is observed as;

97 O.S.No.3666/2003

"CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908 - Section 96 read with
Order 41 Rule 1 - Regular First Appeal - Suit for possession
and injunction - Challenge to dismissal of suit - Plaintiffs
assertion that he is in settled position of the suit schedule
property - Threat of dispossession by the respondent BDA -
Suit land was the subject matter of acquisition - Formation
of layout - Held, when the land is acquired and the
possession is taken, the land vests in the State. Even if the
plaintiff puts up unauthorised construction, he does not
have any legal right to remain in possession based on the
illegal structure and it cannot be termed as a settled
possession - A person who is unauthorisedly squatting on
the public property, has not right to remain in possession -
However, the Trial Court extending the sympathy, directed
the BDA to issue notice and evict the plaintiff in accordance
with law. Such sympathy will harm the public interest, as
there are several persons legally waiting for lawful
allotment - Further held, Admittedly the plaintiff has not
proved his title nor proved his right to remain in possession

- Dismissal of suit is justified."

In this present case before this court, the facts and

circumstances are very same, more over, the plaintiffs have failed

to prove their possession too.

 (2014) 2 SCC 269 (
Union of India and Others vs Vasavi
Cooperative Housing Society Ltd and others
) in which it is held

as;

98 O.S.No.3666/2003

"
A. Specific Relief Act
1963 - Ss. 34 and 5 - Suit for
declaration of title and possession - Burden of proof in case
of - Reiterated, burden is on plaintiff to establish its case,
irrespective of whether defendants prove their case or not -
In absence of establishment of its own title, the plaintiff
must be non-suited even if title set up by defendants is
found against them - Weakness of case set up by
defendants cannot be a ground to grant relief to plaintiff -

Evidence Act, 1872
, Ss.101 to 103.

B. Property Law - Ownership and title - Entries in
revenue records - Value of - Reiterated, do not confer any
title -
Evidence Act, 1872
,
S.35
".

Herein this case plaintiffs themselves failed to prove their case

and not only so defendants have established that suit is not

maintainable.

 AIR 1995 SC 1955 (
State of Bihar vs Dhirendra Kumar

and others
) it is held that, " Civil.P.C.(5 of 1908),
S.9
, Civil

Court - Jurisdiction - Extent - Validity of notification under
S.4

and declaration under
S.6
of Land Acquisition Act - Civil Court

has no jurisdiction to go into that - Only High Court can do

that in proceeding under
Art.226
of Constitution."

In the case on hand, the Defendant No.3 by confronting the

documents of LAC proceedings in connected properties and as per

99 O.S.No.3666/2003

admission by PW 1, as discussed supra, it finds that this suit is

directly connected to LAC proceedings where plaintiffs

surrendered their right to file appeal before proper authority

within time against the order mentioned in prayer (a). Further, it

also to be presumed that the plaintiffs have clear knowledge that

they will not succeed in such appeal.

 2017 (2) AKR 695 ( BDA, Bangalore vs Bhagavandas Patel) in
which it is held that civil court has no jurisdiction to grant order

of injunction wherein layout formed out of acquisition

proceedings which directly applies to this case and relevant

paragraphs reproduced here under;

"
(A) Specific Relief Act
(47 of 1963),
S.34
- Suit for declaration

158. The learned counsel for defendant No 15 and 16 relied

upon;

 (1998) 4 SC 539 (
Punjab Urban Planning and Development

Authority vs Shiv Saraswati and Steel Re-Roling Mills
) in which it

is held as, "
Specific Relief Act
1963 -
S.7
- Suit for specific

performance of contract - Plaintiff, instead of proving his own case

fully cannot take advantage of weakness in defendant's case."

 2020 (3) KCCR 1718 ( Smt.Rathnamma vs Mrs. Zeenathunisa

Since dead by Lrs) in which it is held as, "
Specific Relief Act
, 1963

-
Section 34
- Permanent injunction on the ground the plaintiff is in

possession - Possession not provied - Injunction cannot be granted

- Suit dismissed - Held, the order of Trial Court Proper."

 2007 (1) KCCR 235 (Sri Aralappa vs Sri Jaganath and others) in

which it is held as, " HINDU LAW - PARTITION - SPECIFIC RELIEF

ACT, 1963 -
Section 34
-
Transfer of Property Act, 1882
-
Section 5
-

Partition does not give title to create a title. It only enables the

sharer to obtain what is his own in a definite and specific form for

purpose of disposition of the wishes of his former co-sharers. If the

101 O.S.No.3666/2003

sons have no pre-existing right, in a partition deed they cannot get

right in the property for the first time". Here in this case before

this court plaintiff claiming this case through the root of

ancestral rights without establishing their ancestors right over

the suit schedule property and also failed to prove family

relationship as per Ex.P 2.

 2021 (3) KCCR 2639 (
Sundrabai and Others vs R Ananthram

Singh (Lrs
), it is held as, "
Specific Relief Act, 1963
-
Sections 34
and
- Suit for reliefs of declaration and perpetual injunction - Neither

documents produced by plaintiff no report of Commissioner

showing possession of or title to suit property - No other evidence

showing claim of plaintiff - Plaintiff orally stating suit property lay

adjacent to her house property and therefore she was in possession

and enjoyment of suit property - Cannot be accepted - More so in

face of fact that defendants had obtained perpetual injunction

against sons of plaintiff - Dismissal of suit not interfered with."

This suit is definitely replica of that suit as herein, the relief of

declaration and perpetual injunction is prayed. As discussed supra,

the plaintiffs cleverly drafted the plaint without prayer for

declaration of their title stickled their nose with the order of

102 O.S.No.3666/2003

defendant No.1 as prayer (a) where they tried to create the

jurisdiction of this court though matter is under LAC.

 AIR 2023 SC 379 (
Smriti Debbarma (dead by Lrs) vs Prabha

Ranjan Debbarma and others
) in which it is enlightened us

as, "
Specific Relief Act
(47 of 1963),
S.34
- Suit for declaration -

Decree of possession - Cannot be passed in favour of the

plaintiff on the ground that defendants unable to fully establish

their right, title and intereast in the property.
Evidence Act
(1 of

1872), S.101, S.102

The plaintiff to succeed has to establish that she has a

legal title to the schedule A property and consequently,

is entitled to a decree of possession. The defendants

cannot be dispossessed unless the plaintiff has

established a better title and rights over property. A

person in possession of land in the assumed character

as the owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary

rights of ownership, has a legal right against the entire

world except the rightful owner. A decree of possession

cannot be passed in favour of the plaintiff on the

ground that defendants have not been able to fully

establish their fight, title and interest in the property.

103 O.S.No.3666/2003

The defendants, being in possession would be entitled

to protect and save their possession, unless the person

who seeks to dispossess them has a better legal right in

the form of ownership or entitlement to possession.

The burden of proof to establish a title lies upon the

plaintiff as this burden lies on the party who asserts the

existence of a particular state of things on the basis of

which she claims relief. The onus of proof, no doubt

shifts and the shifting is a continuous process in the

evaluation of evidence, but this happens when a suit

for title and possession, the plaintiff has been able to

create a high degree of probability to shift the onus on

the defendant. In the absence of such evidence, the

burden of proof lies on the plaintiff and can be

discharged only when he is able to prove title. The

weakness of the defence cannot be a justification to

decree the suit. (Paras 30-31)"

Here in this present case, there is no counter claim from the

defendants to declare their title and possession. But, they pleaded

the same and accordingly Addl.Issues are framed and answered as

above. A discussed supra plaintiffs themselves failed to establish

104 O.S.No.3666/2003

their case by every corner of the case. Therefore this citation is

applied here.

159. Therefore, as per the facts and circumstances of the

case and above discussions, this court is of the considered opinion

to dispose this case as under;

 The plaintiffs have failed to prove that they are the absolute

owners in lawful possession, peaceful possession and

exclusive enjoyment of the suit schedule property with a

given boundaries and measurements as on the date of filing

of the suit as discussed supra in gist as not only suit is not

maintainable but also failed to prove genealogy, admitted

possession of defendants, failed to identify the suit schedule

property, hence, Issue No 1 answered in the Negative;

 Further, plaintiffs failed to prove that the alleged order

passed by the 1st defendant bearing No.RD 197 LGB 2003

dated 17-04-2003 is non-est in the eye of law as in the gist,

plaintiffs have not produced any single document on it and

defendant No.3 established the said order as genuine by

confronting the connected documents and LAC proceedings

with calling of Ex.D.20 and further defendants elicited

contradiction to plaintiffs' case by the mouth of PW 1 himself

105 O.S.No.3666/2003

as discussed supra, hence, Issue No 2 answered in the

Negative;

 On the other hand, defendant No 3, not only confronted and

marked documents to establish that suit schedule property

as government land but also succeeded in the cross

examination of PW 1 by eliciting admission as suit schedule

property is government land and the tank bed area belongs

to government and also produced the documents in respect

of suit schedule property and plaintiffs failed to elicit contra

to contentions of defendants in the cross examination of DW

1 to DW 4 and PW 1 himself admitted the formation of HSR

layout in the suit schedule property and distribution of

compensation amount. Accordingly, defendant No.3 proved

that the suit schedule property is a Government property

and the same has been acquired for the formation of layout

called " Between Hosur Road and Sarjapura Road" (which

stands for (HSR) by virtue of its Notification

No.HUD/444/MNX/86 dated 28-11-1986 and acquisition

proceedings having reached its finality, the suit schedule

property was transferred to 3rd defendant by its order

bearing No.RD 197-NGB-2003 dated 17-4-2003 and

106 O.S.No.3666/2003

possession has been taken on 26-5-2003 and hence this

court answers Issue No 3 in the Affirmative;

 The plaintiff has failed to prove his possession and

construction and existence of tank formed by Palasappa

Reddy and there are no documents produced about

threatening by officials of defendant No.3 and where there is

no possession, then such threatening for dispossession does

not arise. Therefore, the plaintiffs failed to prove that the

officials of the 3rd defendant authority threatened to

dispossess them and also to dismantle the existing

structures in the suit schedule property and accordingly,

Issue No 4 answered in the Negative;

 The defendant No.14 established in the cross examination of

PW 1 and by his own evidence as discussed supra as he has

constructed the house in Site No.1172, HSR Sector III,

Bangalore and accordingly Addl.Isue No 1 dated 24-02-2011

answered in Affirmative;

 The Defendant No.14 further proved by eliciting admission

by PW 1 as the B.D.A., has formed Layout in the suit schedule

property and formed roads, drainage system and civic

amenities is existing in the suit schedule premises, as

contended in para 5 of the Written Statement, hence

107 O.S.No.3666/2003

Addl.Issue No 2 dated 24-02-2011 is answered in the

Affirmative.

 Further, it is proved as above that after acquisition of land

bearing Sy.No.31 of Yelukunte village, BDA formed layout

and allotted sites and accordingly Additional Issue No 1

dated 30-08-2018 is answered in the Affirmative.

160. Issue No.5 : As per the facts and circumstances of

the case and above discussion, the plaintiffs failed to prove

their case and plaintiffs are not entitled to get relief. Hence,

this Court answers Issue No 5 in the Negative.

161. Issue No.6 : For the foregoing reasons and as per an-

swers to above Issues, this court is of the considered opinion

that this suit is liable to be dismissed and accordingly, pro-

ceeds to pass the following;

ORDER

The suit filed by the plaintiffs is hereby dis-

missed.

No order as to costs.

Draw decree accordingly.
