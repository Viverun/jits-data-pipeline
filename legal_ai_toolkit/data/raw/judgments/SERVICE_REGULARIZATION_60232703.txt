law on the similar facts and the issue involved not been referred to higher
bench. So also judgments dealing with pari

(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of
Yashwant Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in
(1996) 7 SCC 113, dealing with question for determination "whether
appellant is entitled to any pensionary benefits since total service of
more than eighteen years was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:-

held:

"3. Dr.. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing
for the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when
the appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½
years of quasi-permanent
permanent service. According to him to earn
pension it was necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of
permanent service.

It is contended that since the total service of the appellant
was in quasi-permanent
permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the
pensionary benefits.

There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant
was not made permanent even when he had served the
Government for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the
appellant is denied the pensionary benefits simply on the
ground that he was not a permanent employee of the
government. The appellant having served the government for
almost-two
two decades it would be unfair to treat him as
temporary/quasi-permanent.

permanent.

Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we
hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become
permanent after he served the Government
Gove for such a long
period. The services of the appellant shall be treated to be in
permanent capacity and he shall be entitled to the pensionary
benefits. We allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
Tribunal and direct the respondents to treat the t appellant as
having been retired from service on 7.3.1980 after serving the
Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of permanent
service) and as such his case for grant of pension be finalized
within six months from the receipt of this order. The appellant

and he died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more
than 25 years of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in
temporary status begets the benefits of pension. Failure on part of
postal department not to regularize services of husband of private

(vii) Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at
Chandigarh in case of
Mrs. Alka Sharma versus Union of India

widow of the railway employee in pari materia provision of family
pension "whether widow of temporary employee not been
subsequently appointed on substantive post could be granted pension
and family pension under Railway Services (Pension) Rules as for no
fault of deceased employee on lapses on railways could not be
considered for regularization". The Hon'ble High Court
Cou considered
the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such lack of
regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The Hon'ble
High Court considered relevant Rules 75,75 governing Family Pension
Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased
employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in
temporary capacity and at time of the death was still working as
temporary employee.

The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of
family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee
by notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension
only for a period of three years preceding the date of filing
fil O.A.

11. In the other similar and identical situation, The Central
Administrative Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of
// 14 // OA/050/00638/2022

original applicants on similar facts and legal issue as involved in the
present OA in hand and some of them are cited as under:

under:-

(a) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018

Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors

decided on 28.10.2021. The said O.A. was filed by Night Guard
working in Department of Posts seeking pension and other
pensionary benefits in terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read
with GID (3) below Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.

The
learned Tribunal observed that as per judgement by The Hon'ble
Supreme Court in
Uma Devi
's case, Department of Posts has
circulated policy in June/July 2014 for regularization of casual
labours having worked for ten years or more and vide judgement
dated 13.11.2017 Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.
12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the policy. The applicant
Awadhesh Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984
on daily wages, conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and
retired on October, 2019 after 35 years of total service as temporary
status and not been regularized.

The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of
clause 5 of Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66- 66
9/91-SPB. I dated 30th November, 1992-1992 benefits to a casual labour
on completion

entitled to be treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees of
the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis
such
ch as counting of service for purposes of pension and terminal
benefits as in the case of temporary employees appointed on regular
basis while granting them pension and retirement benefits after the
regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order relied on
larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case of
Prem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others

reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-

"35. There are some of the employees who have not
been regularized in spite
ite of having rendered the services for
30-40
40 or more years whereas they have been superannuated.

As they have worked in work-charged
work establishment, not
against any particular project, their services ought to have
been regularized under the Government instructions
inst and
even as per the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of
Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court
in the said decision has laid down that in case services have
been rendered for more than ten years without the cover of
the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be
regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those
employees who have worked for ten years or more should
have been regularized. It would not be proper to regulate
them for consideration of regularisation
re as others have been
regularised, we direct that their services be treated as a
regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be
entitled to claiming any dues of difference in wages had they
been continued in service regularly before
befo attaining the age
of superannuation. They shall be entitled to receive the
pension as if they have retired from the regular establishment
and the services rendered by them right from the day they
entered the work-charged
charged establishment shall be counted asa
qualifying service for purpose of pension.

36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P.
Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services
rendered in the work-charged
charged establishment shall be treated
as qualifying service under the aforesaid rulerul for grant of
pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three
years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible
// 15 // OA/050/00638/2022

benefits be paid accordingly within three months.
Resultantly, the appeals filed by the employees are allowed
and filed by the State are dismissed."

provided provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual labourers.
So also the scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D' regular
employee available on conferment of status of tempor

14. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ
petition before Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Jagrit MazdoorUnion

in the postal department on completion of one year of continuous service
// 16 // OA/050/00638/2022

with at least 240 days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The
state as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy
should treat similarly with regular employees in the department.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in

21. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory
terms no recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual

applicant was never at fault for such lack of regularization.

23. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by
applicant in the O.A that respondents have not regularized services on
regular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests dated
11.10.2021 and retired on 30.09.2021 without being regularized. This
Tribunal is of the view since respondents state failed to discharge his
statutory duty as per the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even once
considered for regularization since 198
19822.. Hence respondents cannot take
advantage ooff own mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not
regularized deceased employee before retirement. The matter of right

accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to applicant and he
ought to have at least considered for regularization before date of

the employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken
away by respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of
Telecommunication & I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated

enhance ssocial
and has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justice.
Hence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no pensionry
benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief
claimed.

25. The sub-clause
clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated
30.11.1992 quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of
the postal department with effect from date of completion three years of
service in newly acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits
admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service
for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary
employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pen
pension
sion and
retirement benefits after their regularization.

26. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants
are regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above.
The Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pensio
pension
n and
death gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same
provisions as are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants
under the CCS Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The
claim for pension and benefits accrued accordance
accordance with Rule 10 of Rules
1965 read with Rules 2 CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary
employee retired without substantive appointment are held entitled for
pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Rules 2021.

27. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension
Pension Rules
2021 as extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where
excludes temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension
Rules 2021 are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So
also the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply
to (6) cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to
civil services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before
31st December, 2003, who retired or were retired before havi
having
ng been
appointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be
payable to the government servant to the extent provided in the Central
Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to
benefits as admissible to any other public servant and respondents have
// 20 // OA/050/00638/2022

violated fundamental right enshrined in
Article 14
and
of Constitution of
India.

28. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of
three years service in temporary status sub clause (3) of claus
clausee 2 of para 5
dated 30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to
pension and retirement benefits on his completion of three years service in
temporary status followed by regularization.

29. The applicant stood retired on 30.09.2021 as temporary
employee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge
his duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965
read with Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of
pension, family pensi
pension
on and retirement benefits to temporary employee.
The status of employee was at par with regular employee on long
continuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory
Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy
decision.

30. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021
makes it clear that applicant who stood retired before having been
appointed in a substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type
of category of temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension,
retirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to
applicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant under CCS
Pension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:

temporary/quasi permanent service of not less than 10 years.

zed, allowed OA directing respondents to settle
pension and all pensionary benefits treating his superannuation. This
Tribunal in case Rameshwari Devi (Supra) vide order dated 17.01.2022
directed respondents to process for issuance of Pension Payment Order

37. Case of Rita Devi versus Union of India, OA No.2630 of
2021 (CAT Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased
employee worked continuously more than seventeen years died in hharness
arness
while working as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status
in Postal Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family
pension etc.
This Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of
2008 (
Meena Devi vs. Union of India
) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in
CWJC No.7760 of 2015 (
Union of India versus Meena Devi
) vide
judgment dated 08.12.2022, Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled

pension, family pension and benefits this Tribunal vide order dated
05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as regular G
Group

38.
In case of
Shiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India &
Others
O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin
with issue - whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as
Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled
for pension and other retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for
promotion to MTS, rregular
egular post and applicant did not accept and continued
as Temporary Status and retired as temporary status employee at par with
// 25 // OA/050/00638/2022

Group 'D'. Applicant started employment as Night Guard on daily basis in
Postal Department, conferred status of Temporary Status
Status,, selected as MTS,
did not join denied pension, family pension.

This Tribunal in case
Shiv
Shankar Sah

No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015 upheld in CWJC No.11435 of
2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patn
Patna - failure on part of Postal Department
not to regularize the services of husband, private respondent in 23 years of
service after having granted temporary status at par with Group 'D'
employee and conduct of postal department cannot be appreciated or
ignored.

ored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017
upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing
respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under
old pension scheme.

39. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above
above judgments observed that
as per rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary
benefits on regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which
includes full service after regularization and 50% service rendered under
temporary status. On working for three years as Temporary Status treated at
par with Group 'D' employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary
status employee is not regularized having served more than 20 years, it can
only be due to failure of respondents depa
department.

rtment. Temporary Status
employee officials otherwise meeting conditions for regularization and
pensionary benefits were thus eligible for pension and retirement benefits.
So also this Tribunal considered order passed in identical case OA No.143
of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not regularized and allowed OA for
grant of pension.
In case of
Shiv Chandra Sah
(Supra) vide order dated
21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant entitled for pension
and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary Status period as
Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on 03.11.2018,

n during 27 years of
applicant's service and right accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary
Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972
