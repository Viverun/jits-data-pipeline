JUDGMENT

Dated this the 8th day of December, 2025
Nitin Jamdar, C.J.

The subject matter of controversy in this group of appeals arising
from the judgments of learned Single Judges of this Court relates to the post
of Clerk/Cashier in the erstwhile District Co-operative Banks in Kerala.
Ranked Lists were prepared by the Kerala Public Service Commission
pursuant to the selection process; however, before any appointments could
be made from the Ranked Lists, the District Co-operative Banks in the State
were amalgamated with the Kerala State Co-operative Bank. Since the
candidates included in the Ranked Lists were not appointed, they filed writ
petitions seeking appropriate directions for their appointments.
Several petitions were filed by individual candidates included in the
Ranked Lists, and the dates and events would differ in each matter, but the
legal issue being the same in all the appeals, they are dealt with by this
common judgment.

Co-operative Societies, State of Kerala. From Group 'B', the candidates

came into force on 14 February 2019, which amended Schedule I appended
to the Act of 1969, consequently modifying the categories of societies for
which the KPSC could carry out recruitment under Act 5 of 1996. All the
Petitioners/Candidates were included in the said Ranked Lists after the
selection process was concluded for appointment to the post of
Clerk/Cashier in the District Banks.

7. For the purpose of brevity, we refer to the facts in one petition each
from both Group 'A' and Group 'B', and the orders passed therein.

8. From Group 'A' (judgment in favour of the candidates), the facts in
W.P.(C) No. 26491 of 2017 are as follows. The KPSC by notification dated
15 March 2014, invited applications for appointment to the post of
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:122:-

2025:KER:94890

Clerk/Cashier in various District Co-operative Banks in the State. On 15
March 2014, the KPSC issued another notification inviting applications
from employees of various Primary Co-operative Societies affiliated to the
concerned District Co-operative Banks, in the quota earmarked for them, as
provided under Rule 187 of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Rules, 1969
(Rules of 1969). Petitioner Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 7 applied for the post in the
general category and Petitioner No. 4, 5, 6 and 8 applied in the quota
earmarked for employees of Primary Co-operative Societies. The test was
conducted, and the Ranked List came into force with effect from 7 February
2017. However, the Ranked List was not given effect to. The grievance
raised by the Petitioners therein is that though 23 posts were reported to the
KPSC, not even a single appointment has been made. If the Petitioners are
appointed against the existing vacancies, even if the State Bank comes into
existence, they will be absorbed along with the existing employees.
Accordingly, by this petition, the Petitioners prayed for the issuance of a
writ of mandamus directing the Bank to report all vacancies in the cadre of
Clerk/Cashier to the KPSC.

9. The learned Single Judge (Devan Ramachandran, J.) disposed of W.P.
(C) No. 26491 of 2017 along with other petitions by judgment dated 12
July 2022 (Ground 'A'), observing that going by Section 74H of the Act 1
of 2019 which was introduced through amendment in the year 2019, all
proceedings suits, decrees, recovery certificates, appeals and other legal
proceedings, pending or existing immediately before such amalgamation,
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:123:-

2025:KER:94890

shall continue against the transferee Bank. The learned Single Judge also
observed that it was relevant to verify the number of vacancies available at
the time when the Ranked Lists in question came into force, when the
District Banks were in existence. It was also observed that directions were
issued in respect of the Kannur District Co-operative Bank, which were
required to be issued in all these cases, and proceeded to dispose of the writ
petitions by the following directions:

"In the afore circumstances, these writ petitions are
ordered with the following directions:

a) The Registrar of the Co-operative Societies -

either himself or through a constituted Authority or team
of experts - will evaluate the financial status of each of the
erstwhile District Co-operative Banks and the
Malappuram District Co-operative Bank at the time when
the judgment in W.P.(C) Nos.201/2018 and
11228/2019 were issued and then decide notionally what
posts would be available to each of them at that time,
strictly in terms of the directions in the said judgment. For
this purpose, I order the petitioners to make available a
copy of the said judgment before the Registrar within a
period of two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of
this judgment.

b) On the Registrar thus evaluating the staff position
of the various erstwhile District Co-operative Banks and
the Malappuram District Co-operative Bank, necessary
orders consequent to their merger with the Kerala Bank -
save in the case of the Malappuram District Co-operative
Bank, will also be issued; in which event, the claims of the
petitioners and similarly situated persons, as also of all
other persons in the Rank Lists, will be evaluated and
effectively modulated.

W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:124:-

2025:KER:94890

c) While doing so, the Registrar will consider the
contentions of the petitioners in these cases that, during
the pendency of the Rank Lists and when interim orders
of this Court were holding the field with respect to the
notification of vacancies to the PSC, unqualified and
unauthorized persons have been appointed by each of the
erstwhile District Co-operative Banks and the
Malappuram District Co-operative Bank and that too in
violation of the statutory ratio for such purpose between
promotions and direct recruitments. For this purpose, I
allow the petitioners to file their written objections in this
regard before the Registrar within a period of one month
from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment, so that
said Authority can then consider each of such contentions,
based on the factual circumstances relating to the
individual erstwhile District Co-operative Banks and the
Malappuram District Co-operative Bank; thus leading to a
decision as to how many vacancies should be earmarked
for direct recruitment, after cancellation of the earlier
appointments made or after setting aside the same, in
terms of law. In this process of course, every person
effected will also be given an opportunity of being heard.
In other words, while the afore exercise is undertaken and
completed, the Registrar will verify whether the
promotions pointed out by the petitioners in these cases,
as also appointments made during the time when the
Rank Lists was in force, were in order and if not, issue
appropriate orders with respect to it within the statutory
Scheme and the provisions of the by-laws of the
individual Societies, as the case may be. A consideration of
these aspects shall be reflected in the resultant order.

(d) Needless to say, except in the case of the
Malappuram District Co-operative Bank, the afore
exercises shall be completed only after hearing the
competent official of the Kerala Bank also because, even if
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:125:-

2025:KER:94890

vacancies are available, it would be within their
prerogative to choose not to fill it up; however, taking care
that no unauthorized promotion or unauthorized
appointment had been effected in the erstwhile District
Co-operative Bank prior to such amalgamation.

(e) Finally, it does not require this Court to say
specifically but, as regards the vacancies that have already
been reported on the orders of this Court, the sole factum
of the expiry of the Rank List will not stand in the way of
the petitioners being granted benefits; provided they are
found eligible based on the ranking in the said List, as also
other criteria and qualifications as are imperative.

(f) As a corollary to the afore directions, I further
clarify that if the enquiry with respect to the impugned
promotions or appointments during the pendency of the
Rank Lists would require more time, then the Registrar
would be free to evaluate the vacancies as directed in (a)
above and to allow the PSC to make advices against the
same at the first instance.

(g) As far as the impugned promotions and
appointments made during the period of the Rank Lists is
concerned, if any of them are found to be illegal, then
corresponding orders will be issued to the PSC to issue
advice from the Rank List which has now expired;
however, within the limits of the vacancies that have been
ordered and reported consequent to the directions of this
Court.

(h) The afore exercises shall be completed as
expeditiously as is possible but not later than a period of
six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this
judgment; however, leaving liberty to the Registrar to act
earlier in terms of the aforesaid directions in the case of
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:126:-

2025:KER:94890

vacancies in which the question of promotion or
unauthorized appointments do not come into play.

(i) Qua claims of some of the petitioners in these
cases with respect to vacancies in the Community Quotas
and others are concerned, they will also be assessed by the
Registrar in terms of the statutory mechanisms and
resultant orders issued. For this purpose, I direct the
petitioners, who are so interested, to impel such
contentions before the Registrar through a written
petition, which may either be in addition to the ones
mentioned in the aforementioned directions or
independently."

***

These were the directions issued while disposing of Group 'A' petitions.

10. In Group 'B', we refer to the facts in W.P.(C) No. 29057 of 2019,
filed by fifteen candidates who were included in the Ranked List for
appointment to the post of Clerk/Cashier. W.P.(C) No. 29057 of 2019 was
filed by fifteen Petitioners concerning the Alappuzha District Co-operative
Bank Ltd. The case and grievance of these Petitioners are: as on the date on
which the Ranked List was brought into force, that is 23 February 2017, a
large number of vacancies in the post of Clerk/Cashier were lying vacant in
various branches of the Bank, but, ignoring the ratio stipulated in the Model
Recruitment Rules for the District Co-operative Banks, 1998, all these
vacancies were being filled up by promoting persons who are working in the
feeder post. From 23 February 2017 to 22 December 2020, the vacancies
arisen in various branches of the Respondent Bank are as follows. From 23
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:127:-

2025:KER:94890

February 2017 to 22 February 2020, 46 retirement vacancies; from 31
March 2020 to 22 December 2020, 21 retirement vacancies; and from 2
June 2017 to 2 March 2018, 39 promotion vacancies. From the Ranked
List, only 25 candidates were adviced for appointment to the post of
Clerk/Cashier, and during the period between 4 March 2017 and 6 July
2019, eight posts of Clerk/Cashier were filled up by promoting persons
working as Peons. The Respondent Bank did not report the vacancies to the
KPSC only with the intention of filling up those vacancies by departmental
hands. The Government, by letter dated 19 October 2017, issued specific
directions to the Managers to promptly report all vacancies arising in the
Banks to the KPSC. By circular dated 9 August 2016, the Registrar also
directed the Managers of all District Co-operative Banks not to fill up any
vacancies arising in the Banks otherwise than in accordance with the
provisions of the
Kerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969
, and the Rules
framed thereunder. Apart from that, specific orders were issued by the
Registrar of Co-operative Societies, in continuation of the general orders
issued by the State Government since 1971, which also mandate that the
Respondent Bank is bound to report all vacancies to the KPSC well in
advance. The Government further issued another circular dated 20
September 2019, directing all appointing authorities to report, every year,
all vacancies likely to arise during the succeeding year.

11. The facts in Group 'B' petitions are broadly identical for the purpose
of deciding the legal questions involved. The learned Single Judge (Amit

Rawal, J.), who heard this petition along with W.P.(C) No. 31786 of 2018,
observed that the factum of amalgamation could not be ignored so as to
issue directions to a Bank that was no longer in existence, and accordingly,
dismissed the petition by judgment dated 25 January 2021.

12. Before the validity of the Ranked Lists expired, interim orders were
passed in favour of the Petitioners/Candidates in all the writ petitions,
directing the reporting of vacancies, keeping the question as regards the
availability of vacancies to be decided at an appropriate stage. This is a
position common to all the petitions.

13. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The learned
Advocate General Mr. K. Gopalakrishna Kurup along with Mr. Imam
Gregorios Karat, learned Government Pleader, appeared for the State. Mr.
P. C. Sasidharan, learned Advocate appeared for the Appellant - Kerala
Bank. Dr. K. P. Satheesan, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by Mr. P.
Mohandas, and Mr. George Poonthottam, learned Senior Advocate, along
with Mr. O. V. Maniprasad, Mr. B. S. Swathi Kumar, Mr. M. R. Anison, and
Mr. T. R. Harikumar, learned counsel, represent the Petitioners/Candidates.

14. The appeals from Group 'A' petitions have been filed by the District
Banks and the State Government. Therefore, we had queried the learned
Advocate General regarding the reason why the State Government has
chosen to file these appeals when the dispute essentially concerns the
Co-operative Societies and the employees. According to the learned
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:129:-

2025:KER:94890

Advocate General, the State Government has preferred the appeals as it has
certain statutory functions to discharge under various enactments. Merely
because the statutory provisions enable the State Government to regulate
the affairs of the Co-operative Societies to a certain extent, the State does
not become a party to the lis between the society and its employees. As to
the contention of the learned Advocate General that the State has filed the
appeals because directions were issued to the Registrar of Co-operative
Societies, the Petitioners pointed out that it is the statutory duty of the
Registrar, and that the learned Single Judge, in exercise of writ jurisdiction
in a lis between the society and its employees, merely issued directions to
the statutory authorities. The learned counsel for the Petitioners also
submitted that this group of appeals was filed by the State because this
litigation is a result of political interference. Be that as it may, since the
challenge to the impugned judgment is already before us through the
appeals filed by the Banks, we have heard the learned Advocate General for
the State and Banks on their respective contentions.

15. For the Appellant - State, the learned Advocate General Mr. K.
Gopalakrishna Kurup, and for the Appellant - Kerala Bank, the learned
counsel Mr. P. C. Sasidharan, in short, submitted as follows. The action of
the Appellants is related to
Section 74H
of the Act of 1969. Though the
validity of Section 74H was challenged, the challenge was negatived by the
Division Bench of this Court in the case of Saidalavi Master M. v. State of
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

Kerala1, affirming the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of

Lathif U.A., MLA v. State of Kerala2
.
Section 80(3A)
was inserted by Act 6
of 1995. Under
Section 80(3A)
, the candidates are to be recruited to the
Co-operative Societies by the KPSC. The Kerala Co-operative Societies
(Amendment) Act, 1996 (the Act of 1996) was enacted to grant special
powers. As per the definition of "society" in the Act of 1996, it would mean
to be a "society" in
Schedule I of the Act
of 1969. Schedule I to
Section
80(3A)
was amended and the reference to the District Banks in Schedule I
was taken away. Consequently, the KPSC cannot issue advice for candidates
to the District Level Co-operative Societies. Under Section 74H(13), a
specific provision has been made for employees whereby only permanent
employees are eligible to be absorbed on Amalgamation and the obligation
of the State Bank extends only to the absorption of such permanent
employees. Pursuant to Rule 28A(5), the Government of Kerala, in exercise
of its powers under Section 74H, has framed the Kerala State Co-operative
Bank Recruitment Rules, 2023, under which the post of Clerk/Cashier is
now regulated. These Rules came into effect on 2 August 2021, and any
appointment to the State Bank made thereafter has to be in accordance with
the selection process prescribed under the said Recruitment Rules.
Therefore, the impugned direction to give effect to this Ranked List for
advice on non-existent entities is erroneous and needs to be set aside.

Poonthottam, the learned Senior Advocates, Mr. O. V. Maniprasad and
Mr. B. S. Swathi Kumar, the other learned counsel submitted, in brief, as
follows. Interim orders have been passed to report vacancies and challenge
to the said interim orders have been dismissed. Thus, the Ranked Lists
remain valid. There are other provisions in the Act of 1969 which govern
Amalgamation than Section 74H.
Section 14A(6)
is indicative of the fact
that there is no complete extinction of the District Banks. Section 74H(12)
states that all writ petitions filed before the Amalgamation will continue and
the Court has the power to issue directions to the Bank. The contention of
the Appellants that no appointment can be made to the District Banks in
view of the amalgamation and amendment to
Section 80(3A)
of the Act of
1969 is incorrect. The KPSC is statutorily bound to advise candidates to the
vacancies reported under the said Act, and the overriding effect of Section
74H(18) extends over
Section 80(3A)
. Under Section 74H(12), all legal
proceedings or obligations existing before the amalgamation continue to
bind the transferee bank. Hence, the obligation to report vacancies and the
corresponding power of the KPSC to advice candidates subsist even after
the merger. The order of amalgamation was issued on 29 November 2019,
and Section 74H came into force only from that date. Therefore, till 29
November 2019, appointments were governed by
Section 80(3A)
. The
vacancies that arose prior to the date of amalgamation are liable to be
reported to the KPSC, which, in turn, was bound to advice candidates from
the Ranked Lists that remained valid. The material on record show that 130
vacancies existed in the Kozhikode District Co-operative Bank, though only
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:132:-

2025:KER:94890

40 appointments were made from Exhibits-P3 and P4 Ranked Lists, in
violation of the prescribed 1:5 ratio between promotion and direct
recruitment. The order of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies and the
Vigilance reports further support the contention of the Petitioners that
appointments should have been made from the said Ranked Lists, as several
posts were filled from the list of 2006, which is stated to have expired on 30
July 2014. The Petitioners are meritorious candidates duly selected through
the statutory process, and they cannot be deprived of appointment for
reasons beyond their control. The KPSC has not challenged the impugned
judgments and thus has accepted that it is not divested of the powers to
render advice even after amalgamation, which fact is clear from the
appointments made from such Ranked Lists to some District Banks, such as
the Idukki District Co-operative Bank. The Appellants are acting arbitrarily
under political considerations, picking and choosing candidates from the
Ranked Lists, and the manner in which the State has prosecuted the
litigation is indicative of political interference in the appointment process.
The proposal of the employer Banks for the regularisation of temporary
employees also demonstrates the continued requirement of personnel,
reinforcing the claim for advice and appointment through KPSC from the
valid Ranked Lists. The Petitioners/Candidates placed on record the order
passed by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies on 8 June 2023, giving
effect to the impugned judgment, which was subsequently withdrawn by
the Registrar only on the ground that an appeal had been filed by the Bank
and stay had been granted, but the fact that the vacancies existed and were
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:133:-

2025:KER:94890

duly identified remains on record. Thus, the Appellants are taking divergent
stands in respect of the Ranked Lists and their conduct shows that the
candidates are being subjected to illegal discrimination.

17. We have considered the rival contentions.

18. Though the issued involved in these groups of appeals is narrow, the
debate centres around the rights of the candidates in the select list for
appointment to the post in the District Banks after their merger with the
State Bank. The basic position is that the Kerala Public Service Commission
(KPSC) had invited applications from eligible candidates for appointment
to the post of Clerk/Cashier in the erstwhile District Banks. Pursuant to the
selection process, Ranked Lists were duly published. However, before
appointments could be made, the Kerala Co-operative Societies
(Amendment) Act, 2019 (Act 1 of 2019), which came into force on 14
February 2019, resulted in the amalgamation of the District Banks with the
State Bank. The question that arises in these appeals is the status and rights
of these Petitioners/Candidates on the Ranked Lists for appointments in the
District Banks.

19. The statutory provisions in the subject matter cover two sets of
legislation and rules. One governing the Co-operative Societies, and the
second governing the Public Service Commission. A brief overview would
be necessary.

20. The Co-operative Societies in Kerala, such as the District Banks, are
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:134:-

2025:KER:94890

governed by the provisions of the
Kerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969

(Act of 1969).
The Act
of 1969 provides for the registration, regulation,
and other regulatory provisions relating to the Co-operative Societies. As
regards the recruitment and service conditions of officers and servants of the
Co-operative Societies,
Section 80(3A)
of the Act of 1969 provides that,
except for the Chief Executive Officer of the Society, all appointments to
the posts of officers and servants of the Society specified in Schedule I, for
which direct recruitment is resorted to, shall be made from the select list of
candidates furnished by the KPSC after following the prescribed rules.

Schedule I of the Act
of 1969 included fourteen District Banks, in addition
to the Apex Societies.

21.
Section 14
of the Act of 1969 provides that Co-operative Societies
may, with the prior approval of the Registrar, amalgamate or merge, transfer
their assets and liabilities, and also effect division of the Societies.
In the Act

1 of 2019, new
Section 14A
was also introduced which provides for
provisions regarding transfer of assets and liabilities of the District Banks to
the State Bank.

22. By notification dated 14 February 2019, the Government of Kerala
enacted the Kerala Co-operative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2019 (Act 1
of 2019), which amended
Section 2
of the Act of 1969 by substituting
clause (ia) and inserting clause (ka) regarding the Kerala State Co-operative
Bank. The consequence of Act 1 of 2019 led to the amalgamation of
District Banks to the State Bank.

W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:135:-

2025:KER:94890

23. The Kerala Public Service Commission (Additional Functions as
Respects Certain Societies) Act, 1996 (Act 5 of 1996), the other set, is in
respect of recruitment (at the relevant time) of officers and servants of the
Co-operative Societies.
Section 2(b)
of the Act 5 of 1996 defines "society"
to mean a Co-operative Society mentioned in the
Schedule to the Act
of
1969. Act 1 of 2019 amended
Schedule I of the Act
of 1969, whereby
Serial Nos. 16 to 29 and the entries against them were omitted. The entries
at Serial Nos. 16 to 19 pertained to various District Banks in the State. They
included Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha,
Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram,
Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod District Co-operative Banks
Limited. Consequently, with effect from 14 February 2019, the District
Banks mentioned from Serial Nos. 16 to 29 in the Schedule stood excluded
from the definition of "society" under
Section 2(b)
of the Act 5 of 1996.

24.
Chapter XC of the Act
of 1969 provides for special provisions
relating to amalgamation through transfer of assets and liabilities of the
District Banks to the State Bank. It would be fruitful to reproduce Section
74H, which is relevant to the present controversy and sets out the
consequences of such amalgamation. Section 74H reads thus:

"74H - Amalgamation of District Co-operative
Banks to the Kerala State Co-operative Bank.- (1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any
other law for the time being in force, the Registrar shall
order the amalgamation of District Co-operative Banks in
Kerala with the Kerala State Co-operative Bank on the
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

provided under
Section 14A
of this Act.

1A) On and from the date of the passing of the
order of the merger by the Registrar under sub section
(1) (a), all the assets and liabilities of the District Co-

operative Bank as it should immediately before the order
of merger shall, without any further act, instrument or
deed, stand transferred to and vested in the Kerala State
Co-operative Bank.

2) With the prior approval of the Government the
Registrar shall bring into effect the scheme of
amalgamation, proposed by the Kerala State Co-operative
Bank which is to be presented to the transferor banks.

3) On and from the date of amalgamation, the
shares held by the members of the transferor banks shall
be deemed to be the shares of the transferee bank as such:

Provided that the value of shares shall be on the
basis of face value of shares held by the members of the
transferor banks.

(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in
section
of this Act, on and from the date of amalgamation of
the transferor Banks and the transferee Bank, the
transferor banks cease to exist and its registration stands
cancelled:

Provided further that no new Registration

(13) Every permanent and regular employee of the

***
Section 74H thus also deals with the effect of amalgamation on the
employees.

25. As per Government Order dated 24 March 2023, issued by the
Secretary of the Co-operation Department, Government of Kerala, in
exercise of the powers conferred under sub-section (14) of
Section 74H
of
the Act 1 of 2019, read with sub-rule (5) of Rule 28A in Chapter IIIA of
the Co-operative Societies Amendment Rules, the Government have
notified the Kerala State Co-operative Bank Recruitment Rules, 2023
(Recruitment Rules of 2023), which had come into force on 2 August
2021. The Government Order shows that the State Bank would take steps
to fill up the vacancies strictly in line with the modified Recruitment Rules
against the existing vacancies. Rule II of the Recruitment Rules of 2023
provides for the categorisation of service. Under Rule II, the post of Clerk/
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:139:-

2025:KER:94890

Cashier falls under Category No. 11. Rule III provides for appointment. As
per Rule III, appointments to the post of Clerk/Cashier shall be made by
Direct Recruitment through the KPSC and by transfer appointment on the
basis of combined seniority from among the persons holding lower posts,
who possess the required qualification and three years service in the
respective posts. It is also stated that the ratio for the direct recruitment and
promotion shall be 3:1. This, in brief, is the statutory scheme.

26. As stated earlier, the common factor is that all the Petitioners were
included in the Ranked Lists prior to the amalgamation on 14 February
2019. All the Petitioners, on varying dates, secured interim orders in their
favour, by which their placement in the Ranked Lists was protected subject
to the outcome of the writ petitions, and by virtue of these interim orders,
the life of the Ranked Lists is not deemed to have lapsed. It is pertinent to
note, which we will elaborate on later, that no appeal is filed by the KPSC
even though the KPSC was a party to the writ petitions.

27. The first question, therefore, arises is regarding the right of
candidates who are placed on the Ranked Lists. The Constitution Bench in
the case of
Shankarsan Dash v. Union of India3
, considered a reference
made to it for examining whether a candidate whose name appears on the
merit list on the basis of a competitive examination acquires an indefeasible
right for appointment when a vacancy exists. At paragraph 7, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court observed that even where a number of vacancies are notified

3 (1991) 3 SCC 47
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:140:-

2025:KER:94890

for appointment and an adequate number of candidates are found fit, the
successful candidates do not thereby acquire an indefeasible right to be
appointed, as ordinarily, the notification merely amounts to an invitation to
the qualified candidates to apply for recruitment, and on their selection,
they do not acquire any right to the post also. Unless the relevant
recruitment rules so indicate, the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or
any of the vacancies. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, however, cautioned that
this does not mean that the State instrumentality has the licence to act in an
arbitrary manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies has to be taken
bona fide for appropriate reasons, and if the vacancies or any of them are
filled up, the State is bound to respect the comparative merit of the
candidates as reflected at the recruitment test, and no discrimination can be
permitted.

This position has been consistently followed, as noted in the
decisions in
State of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha4
,
Miss Neelima
Shangla v. State of Haryana5
, or
Jitendra Kumar v. State of Punjab6
.

In the
case of
Asha Kaul (Mrs.) and Another v. State of Jammu and Kashmir
7, a
two-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court took a review of the legal
position on the subject and observed as follows:

"8. It is true that mere inclusion in the select list does not
confer upon the candidates included therein an indefeasible
right to appointment (
State of Haryana v. Subhash Chander
Marwaha
[(1974) 3 SCC 220: AIR 1973 SC 2216]; Mani

Subrat Jain v. State of Haryana [(1977) 1 SCC 486: AIR
1977 SC 276];
State of Kerala v. A. Lakshmikutty
[(1986)
4 SCC 632: AIR 1987 SC 331]) but that is only one aspect
of the matter. The other aspect is the obligation of the
Government to act fairly. The whole exercise cannot be
reduced to a farce. Having sent a requisition/request to the
Commission to select a particular number of candidates for
a particular category, -- in pursuance of which the
Commission issues a notification, holds a written test,
conducts interviews, prepares a select list and then
communicates to the Government -- the Government
cannot quietly and without good and valid reasons nullify
the whole exercise and tell the candidates when they
complain that they have no legal right to appointment. We
do not think that any Government can adopt such a stand
with any justification today.

This aspect has been dealt with
by a Constitution Bench of this Court in
Shankarsan Dash
v. Union of India
[(1991) 3 SCC 47: (1991) 17 ATC 95]
where the earlier decisions of this Court are also noted. The
following observations of the Court are apposite: (SCC pp.
50-51, para 7)
"It is not correct to say that if a number of
vacancies are notified for appointment and
adequate number of candidates are found fit, the
successful candidates acquire an indefeasible right
to be appointed which cannot be legitimately
denied. Ordinarily the notification merely
amounts to an invitation to qualified candidates to
apply for recruitment and on their selection they
do not acquire any right to the post. Unless the
relevant recruitment rules so indicate, the State is
under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the
vacancies. However, it does not mean that the
State has the licence of acting in an arbitrary
manner. The decision not to fill up the vacancies
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:142:-

2025:KER:94890

has to be taken bona fide for appropriate reasons.
And if the vacancies or any of them are filled up,
the State is bound to respect the comparative
merit of the candidates, as reflected at the
recruitment test, and no discrimination can be
permitted.

This correct position has been
consistently followed by this Court, and we do
not find any discordant note in the decisions in

State of Haryana v. Subhash Chander Marwaha

[(1974) 3 SCC 220:
AIR 1973 SC 2216],
Neelima Shangla v. State of Haryana
[(1986) 4
SCC 268] or Jatendra Kumar v. State of Punjab
[(1985) 1 SCC 122: 1985 SCC (L&S) 174]."

(emphasis supplied)
***
Therefore, the legal position is that, though the candidates do not acquire an
indefeasible right merely by being placed on the merit list, the recruiting
authority cannot act arbitrarily, and once it proceeds to make appointments
from the Ranked Lists, the remaining candidates on the list will have to be
treated equally as per their placements.

28. The learned counsel for the Petitioners also have not advanced any
extreme proposition that candidates on the select list have an absolute right
to be appointed. Instead, they relied upon the above legal position to
contend that the Appellants have acted arbitrarily in breach of the rights of
the Petitioners enshrined under
Article 14
of the Constitution of India. It is
their contention that the amalgamation of the Banks is not an absolute
extinction of the District Banks, and that, therefore, out of extraneous
considerations, appointments have been made for some selected District
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:143:-

2025:KER:94890

Banks, for which no explanation has been coming forth. When the selection
process was conducted by the KPSC by notification dated 15 March 2014,
the statutory mandate required that the process under the Rules of 1969
had to be followed.

29. The main contention of the Appellants is the factum of amalgamation
and the legal and factual consequences.
Section 14
of the Act of 1969
provides for amalgamation, merger, transfer of assets and liabilities.
Section
14A
provides for transfer of assets and liabilities of the District Banks to the
State Bank. The Appellants have also relied upon sub-section (13) of
Section 74H to contend that only permanent and regular employees of the
transferee bank, or employees on probation serving in the employment of
the transferor bank, are protected, and that none of the Petitioners fall
within Section 74H(13). The Petitioners have relied upon
Section 14A(6)

of the Act of 1969 which states that on and from the date of approval of the
transfer of assets and liabilities of each District Bank by the Registrar, all
pending suits or legal proceedings by or against such Banks shall be
continued by the State Bank. The Petitioners pointed out that, though this
provision is not directly applicable to the issue at hand, it nevertheless
indicates the legislative intent that there is no complete extinction of all
positions prevailing on the date of amalgamation. The Petitioners have also
relied upon sub-sections (12) and (13) of
Section 74H
of the Act of 1969.
Sub-section (12) of Section 74H states that any proceedings, suits, decrees,
recovery certificates, appeals, and all other legal proceedings pending or
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:144:-

2025:KER:94890

existing immediately before the date of amalgamation before any Court or
Tribunal or any other authority, by or against the transferor banks may, as
from the date of amalgamation be continued and enforced by or against the
transferee bank. Sub-section (13) states that every permanent and regular
employee of the transferor bank or employees on probation, serving in the
employment of the transferor bank immediately before the date of
amalgamation, shall become, on and from the date of amalgamation, an
employee of the transferee bank.

30. We make reference to these provisions in the context of the broader
principle that there can be various types and consequences of amalgamation,
and that no absolute test can be applied uniformly for all forms of
amalgamation under different statutes. This aspect is elaborated by the
Supreme Court in the case of Principal Commissioner of Income Tax
(Central) - 2 v. M/s. Mahagun Realtors (P) Ltd.8, where the Hon'ble
Supreme Court analysed the concept of amalgamation of two or more
entities and observed that amalgamation is unlike the winding up of an
entity. It was observed that in the case of amalgamation, the enterprises lives
on, but within a new residence. The Hon'ble Supreme Court emphasised
that it is, therefore, essential to look beyond the mere concept of destruction
of entity.
In the said decision, reference was made to the decision in the case
of
Saraswati Industrial Syndicate v. Commissioner of Income Tax Haryana,
Himachal Pradesh9
. The basic legal principle emerging from the analysis of
8 AIR 2022 SC 1672
9 1990 Supp (1) SCR 332
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:145:-

2025:KER:94890

law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court is that amalgamation has no precise
meaning, and that the true effect and character of amalgamation depend
largely on the terms of the scheme of merger and the legislation. Thus, the
broader principle is that there is no fixed connotation of amalgamation and,
in the given set of statutory regulation, it need not amount to a complete
extinction. Therefore, the contention of the Appellants that, pursuant to the
amalgamation, everything comes to an end is too absolute a proposition to
be accepted. The issue has to be examined in the backdrop of the facts of the
case and the manner in which the Appellants themselves have understood
and proceeded on the legal position of amalgamation.

31. This brings us to the contention of the Petitioners that the Appellants
have adopted contrary stands after the amalgamation in respect of the
identical Ranked List, acting in a most arbitrary manner. By the
interlocutory application in these appeals, it has been placed on record that
long after amalgamation, the Petitioners have given advices and
appointments from the very same Ranked Lists in various District Banks
across the State between 30 March 2023 and 23 May 2024. The
Respondents have furnished these details in the form of a chart. In some
appeals, the Petitioners have placed on record the appointments made in
respect of the other co-operative banks such as Wayanad and
Thiruvananthapuram. It is also stated that a candidate was adviced by the
KPSC for appointment to the post of Branch Manager in the District Co-
operative Bank, Kasaragod, from the Ranked List of 25 August 2023.

Thereafter, certain other appointments such as the posts of Peon/Watchman
and Driver, were also made. According to the Appellants, these
appointments were made pursuant to the directions issued by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, and no capital can be made out of the same. However, as
the Petitioners point out, the appointments made under the orders of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court are different, and as regards the appointment made
to the post of Clerk/Cashier - Part III in respect of the District Co-operative
Bank, Idukki, nine fresh vacancies were reported on 29 May 2019, 12 June
2019, 20 August 2019, 3 October 2019, and for Clerk/Cashier - Part I,
nine vacancies were reported on 29 May 2019, 12 June 2019, 20 August
2019, and 3 October 2019, and the advices were issued by the KPSC on 29
January 2020, which is beyond the amalgamation. No explanation
whatsoever is coming forth from the Appellants in respect of this, except to
argue that the Petitioners/ Candidates had no legal right and the KPSC
cannot issue advices in respect of the Banks which are no longer in
existence.

32. This position highlights the arbitrariness with which the Appellants
have acted. From the very same Ranked Lists which, according to the
Appellants, do not have any legal force for the KPSC to issue advice,
appointments have nevertheless been made to certain District Banks. The
Appellants have simply sidestepped this glaring discrimination. This
conduct has to be viewed in the backdrop of the allegation of
Petitioners/Candidates that there is political interference in the recruitment
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:147:-

2025:KER:94890

process of officers and staff of the Co-operative Banks, and that the
appointments are being given to a selected few for extraneous reasons. In
light of the appointments of candidates from identical select lists to various
District Banks and the manner in which the State has filed the appeals and
prosecuted the litigation, it cannot be said that the contention of the
Petitioners/Candidates is without merit.

33. Next contention is regarding the power of the KPSC in view of the
amendment to
Schedule I to the Act
of 1969 by Act 1 of 2019. According
to the Appellants, the KPSC has no jurisdiction to issue advice to the
District Banks. For the sake of reiteration, it is to be noted that as against
the direction of the learned Single Judge which would entail the KPSC to
issue advices from the concerned Ranked Lists, the KPSC has not filed an
appeal. Not only it has not filed an appeal but the KPSC has proceeded to
issue advices in respect of Idukki District Co-operative Bank post merger to
which no exception is taken by the Appellants. Therefore, this is the
understanding of the KPSC, which we must take note of.

34. It is quite obvious that the KPSC is a distinct entity, separate from the
Co-operative Banks or the State. Prior to the Act 1 of 2019, appointments
were required to be made through the KPSC. When the notification was
issued on 15 March 2014 and thereafter, the District Co-operative Societies
were under a statutory mandate to follow the procedure prescribed under
the Rules, which involved reporting of vacancies and the issuance of advices
by the KPSC in respect of those vacancies.

W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:148:-

2025:KER:94890

35. The procedure to be followed for recruitment to the Co-operative
Societies (as applicable) is set out in Rule 182(4) of the Rules of 1969. The
KPSC has issued the Rules of Procedure in which
Section 2(g)
defines
"ranked list" to mean, list of candidates arranged in the order of merit, either
on the basis of the interview or examination. "Examination" is defined
under Rule 2(c) to include written, practical, physical efficiency, interview,
and such other examinations which the Commission may deem fit to hold.
The Rule 2(a) defines "Advice list" to mean, the list of candidates drawn
from the ranked list and arranged on the basis of rules of recruitment
relating to the post in respect of vacancies reported from time to time.
Under Rule 14, the Commission shall advise candidates for all the vacancies
reported and pending before them and the vacancies which may be reported
to them for the period during which the ranked lists are kept alive in the
order of priority. Accordingly, after a due selection process, ranked lists were
prepared, and they were in existence on the date when the Act 1 of 2019
was brought into force.

36. The issue is whether the KPSC would lose its jurisdiction to render
advice after the Act 1 of 2019. The Appellants contend that after the
amendment, the powers of the KPSC do not extend to the District Banks.
The question, however, is whether the KPSC ceases to have the power to
advise appointments from the Ranked Lists which were already and validly
prepared before the amending Act 1 of 2019, during the period when the
KPSC admittedly had jurisdiction and power to do so. The legal impact of
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:149:-

2025:KER:94890

the amendment brought into effect by the Act 1 of 2019 to definition of the
"society" under Act 5 of 1996 insofar as the power and jurisdiction of the
KPSC are concerned, the matter can be interpreted in two ways. One
approach can be that after the Act 1 of 2019, the Ranked Lists stood
cancelled and the power of the KPSC was effaced, and second, that the
power and jurisdiction of the KPSC in respect of the District Banks post-
amendment would apply only to fresh selection processes and would not
affect the existing power of the KPSC in respect of Ranked Lists already and
validly prepared prior to the Amendment. This interpretation will sustain
the power of the KPSC for the list already validly prepared. The
interpretation must also be viewed broadly keeping in mind the object and
status of the KPSC. A narrow interpretation that would diminish the role of
the KPSC as an independent entity is to be avoided. When two
interpretations of the legal implications are possible, the one that supports
the continuing authority ought to be preferred.

37. Further, the conduct of the Appellants and KPSC would show that
the second interpretation (that is maintaining the power of KPSC in respect
of the existing list) is a valid one. The KPSC has not filed any appeal
challenging the judgment of the learned Single Judge which would require
it to issue advice from the Ranked Lists post the amendment, but on the
other hand, the KPSC has, in fact, issued advices in respect of some
candidates as referred to earlier. The Appellants themselves, by accepting
the advice issued by the KPSC from the identical Ranked Lists, which were
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:150:-

2025:KER:94890

validly prepared, have already interpreted the legal implications in this
manner. The question, therefore, is whether the Appellants can now take a
contrary position. By accepting the advice of the KPSC for appointments to
the Idukki District Co-operative Bank even after the amendment, the
Appellants have accepted the legal proposition that the KPSC has the power
and jurisdiction to render advice so long as the select list continues to be
valid. Having accepted this legal implication in respect of one set of
candidates, the Appellants cannot now be heard to argue that a different
legal proposition applies to the Petitioners/Candidates. Identical ranked lists
cannot exist and not exist at the same time. This attempt of the Appellants
smacks of complete arbitrariness. Therefore, when Ranked Lists were duly
and validly prepared prior to the Act 1 of 2019, the jurisdiction of the
KPSC did not cease upon the amendment but continues till the validity of
the Ranked Lists expired.

38. This takes us to the judgment of the learned Single Judge disposing of
Group 'A' petitions. The learned Single Judge directed that the Registrar of
Co-operative Societies shall assess the financial position of each erstwhile
District Co-operative Bank, determine the posts notionally available at that
time, and thereafter, issue necessary orders relating to their merger with the
State Bank, while considering the claims of the Petitioners, similarly situated
persons, and all others in the Ranked Lists. The Petitioners were permitted
to file written objections within one month regarding the alleged
unauthorised appointments and promotions made during the subsistence of
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:151:-

2025:KER:94890

the Ranked Lists, in violation of the statutory ratio. The Registrar of Co-
operative Societies was required to examine these contentions, verify the
legality of such appointments, cancel those found irregular, and identify the
vacancies to be earmarked for direct recruitment after hearing all affected
parties. The learned Single Judge also directed that the competent officer of
the State Bank shall also be heard, recognising that the Bank may choose not
to fill even available vacancies while ensuring that no irregular
appointments had been made prior to the amalgamation. It was clarified
that the expiry of the Ranked Lists would not prejudice the eligible
Petitioners with respect to the vacancies already reported pursuant to the
earlier orders, and that if the enquiry into appointments required more time,
the Registrar could first determine vacancies and allow the KPSC to issue
advice. If any promotions or appointments during the currency of the
Ranked Lists were found illegal, corresponding advice would be issued from
the expired Ranked Lists within the limits of the vacancies ordered and
reported. The entire exercise was directed to be completed within six
months, with liberty to act earlier, where issues of promotion or irregular
appointments did not arise, and the Registrar was also instructed to consider
claims regarding Community Quota vacancies upon receipt of written
submissions from the interested Petitioners.

39. Another challenge of the Appellants to these directions in the
judgment in Group 'A' petitions is that the District Banks ceased to exist
upon amalgamation, and the directions issued by the learned Single Judge
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:152:-

2025:KER:94890

in Group 'A' are not practicable. As referred to earlier, the legal implications
of amalgamation do not necessarily result in the complete extinction of the
amalgamated entity, but certain positions may continue depending on the
governing statutory enactments. Even on facts, the contentions of the
Appellants cannot be accepted. The Petitioners/Candidates have pointed
out that pursuant to the impugned judgment in Group 'A' dated 12 July
2022, the Registrar of Co-operative Societies carried out a detailed exercise
and passed the following order dated 8 June 2023:

"xx xxxx

To comply with the order, as per reference No. 5, the Registrar
had given notice to the petitioners and Kerala Bank, for hearing
them on 2/6/2023 11 am. On the said hearing, representing the
candidates, Bindhu P.K, Lenimol, Santhi Krishna, Thriveni.P,
Sajosh.K, Sobha.M.K, Rajeev.P.K, Deepak, Manju Jose,
Anila.K.N, Anto.P.Davis, Prasanna.V.P, Renjini Jose, Divya.V,

Sandhya.S.Nair, Dhanya.G.R, Sunil Kumar, Bindhu.S.M, Baiju.P,
Adv. V.G.Prasad and Jisha.K.C were present and the
representatives of Kerala Bank produced the written arguments.

The arguments of Kerala Bank

On 29/11/2019, the 13 district Co-operative Bank amalgamated
in State Co-operative Bank and formed Kerala Bank. The
Malappuram District Co-operative Bank on 12/1/2023
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:153:-

2025:KER:94890

amalgamated in Kerala State Co-operative Bank also. So there is
no standing for the District Co-operative Bank and also
recruitments to the said bank. Prior to the formation of Kerala
Bank, the direct recruitments except to the post of part time
sweeper, were done as per
Sec. 80(3A)
of the Co-operative
Societies Act, but when the Kerala Bank came in to existence on
29/11/2019, the recruitment rules as per the Co-operative law
amendment became null. So the inclusion of candidate in the list
will not entitle him an assurance for the post, and since the State
Co-operative Bank is a statutory body, all the appointments to it
come under the purview of its powers, as the Bank stated.
Moreover, the Kerala Bank, filed appeal against the order in 26
writ petitions, and obtained stay order on it. They further stated
that, the Registrar, Co-operative Societies could not appoint any
person, as per
Sec.66A
of Co-operative Societies Act, even though
they have such an authority to do so.
The cited references 1 to 4 in different petitions, the High Court
in its order directed as such.

c)
Since this being the situation, as per references 1 to 4 orders, and
on hearing the different parties in the writ petition and the Kerala
Bank, and also on perusing their petition, the data produced by
the Kerala Bank before the commencement of Kerala Bank, the
following are the post for clerks/cashier which was allotted to
them in 14 District Co-operative Banks.

Total 1762 1468 1265 8 154 84

The number of posts for Clerk/Cashier allotted to 14 District Co-
operative Banks prior to the formation of Kerala Banks was 1762.
From this, 1468 posts are appointed through PSC as per 5:1 ratio.
During the Kerala Bank, formed the number of employees
appointed through PSC was 1265 and after its formation the
number of appointees was 8 and also DA/NCA category, 154
vacancies were reported to PSC.

Hence, it is hereby ordered that, the Kerala Bank is directed to
follow 5:1 ratio in the appointment of Clerk/Cashier posts, as
given by the Co-operative Registrar, before the formation of
Kerala Bank and also as per the direction of the High Court of
Kerala and to report 84 vacancies from the reported 154
vacancies of DA/NCA.

Thereafter, on 7 September 2023, the Additional Registrar of Co-operative
Societies took a different stand and issued a letter, which reads as follows:

W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:156:-

2025:KER:94890

"Sir,

Subject: Co-operative - Appointment from the Rank
List of Clerk / Cashier post in old Malappuram
District, Co-operative Bank.

Ref: Application submitted by Sri. Akhil S. before
the Chief Minister of Kerala (G 2230600162)
Turn attention to the reference candidates included
in the Rank Lists of Clerk/Cashier of Malappuram
District Co-operative Banks have filed writ petitions
before Hon'ble Kerala High Court [WP(C)
29938/2019, WP(C) 23089/2019 & Connt. Cases] and
in compliance with the orders/decrees in the above cases,
Registrar has issued order dated 08.06.2023 [No. (1)
7321/2022]. And a contempt Case (No. 1429/23) has
been filed in writ petition No. 29955/19.
Hence, steps have been taken to file appeal in all cases
in clerk/cashier post in Co-operative Bank. Stay order
has been obtained in Writ Appeal No. 1291/23 which
was filed against the order in Writ Petition No.
22690/19. Stay order has obtained and writ appeals are
pending before Hon'ble High Court of Kerala and hence
the temporary order issued by Co-operative Registrar in
withdrawn as per the order in the Writ Appeal filed by
the Bank and Government and this order in numbered
as EM (1) 7321/2022 and this order is issued.

Yours Faithfully
Additional Registrar (Consumer)
(On behalf of Co-operative Registrar)"

***
The order of 7 September 2023 was not withdrawn on the ground of
impracticability or on the ground that it was incorrect, but on the ground
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:157:-

2025:KER:94890

that the State Government has decided to file an appeal. We do not refer to
these documents to hold that the Appellants are estopped from filing the
appeals, but they show that it is clearly possible to give effect to the
judgment of the learned Single Judge in Group 'A' petitions, and that it was,
in fact, sought to be implemented without recording any practical or legal
difficulty. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies had initially given effect
to the direction issued by the learned Single Judge in Group 'A' petitions,
and only thereafter, decided to file an appeal. This indicates that it is both
possible and practicable to identify the vacancies. Therefore, the argument
of impracticability in implementing the judgment of the learned Single
Judge advanced by the Appellants, cannot be accepted.

40. Further, it is not the case of the Appellants that the qualifications for
the post are different. Indeed, some of the candidates have been appointed
after the amalgamation in the District Banks. The Petitioners/Candidates
assert that even the Recruitment Rules of 2023 have not brought about a
change in the qualifications. It is also evident from the order passed by the
Registrar of Co-operative Societies on 8 June 2023 that the vacancies can be
identified. Therefore, the selection of the Petitioners/Candidates was
validly carried out by the KPSC even after the amalgamation and the
framing of the Rules.

41. It is to be noted that during the pendency of the appeals, the
Appellants initiated the process of recruitment and preparation of select list
under the new Rules without obtaining leave of this Court. Though there is
W.A. No. 608 of 2021 & connected cases

-:158:-

2025:KER:94890

an interim order in the appeals staying the judgment of the learned Single
Judge, since the issue was being heard in appeals, this leave ought to have
been taken. Therefore, when this was brought to the notice of the Court, a
direction was issued not to give effect to the new list during the pendency of
the appeals. Once the existence of the earlier select list and the power of the
KPSC are recognised, no right will flow to the candidates on the new list, as
the list itself was made subject to the outcome of the appeals.

42. Therefore, the learned Single Judge in the judgment dated 12 July
2022 in Group 'A' petitions, issued directions to give effect to the rights of
the Petitioners on the Ranked Lists. The learned Single Judge has issued
these directions in the exercise of writ jurisdiction The Petitioners in Group
'A' petitions have accepted these directions as they have not filed any
appeal. Though the Appellants contend that these directions are not
preceded by cogent reasoning, in view of the above mentioned legal and
factual position, we do not deem it appropriate to interfere with the ultimate
directions which have sought to remedy the situation considering the
practicalities. As regards the appeals filed by the Petitioners / Candidates
from Group 'B' petitions, the learned Single Judge has not considered the
various legal and factual issues discussed above, and has summarily
dismissed those petitions. The Appellants in the said appeals are, therefore,
entitled to the directions similar to those issued in the Group 'A' petitions.

43. As a result, W.A. Nos. 1736, 1794, 1805, 1806, 1809, 1815, 1830,
1840, 1843, 1850, 1854, 1859, 1880, 1889, 1904, 1938, 1939, 1943,

2025, and 2135 of 2023 filed by the State (Group A) are dismissed.

44. W.A. Nos. 608, 622, 637 and 853 of 2021 filed by the Petitioners
(Group B) are allowed, in terms of the directions issued in the judgment of
the learned Single Judge in Group 'A' petitions dated 12 July 2022, and the
same methodology shall be followed in the appeals filed by the Petitioners
with suitable modification as the facts of each case will require.

45. The time limits given in the judgment of the learned Single Judge in
Group 'A' petitions dated 12 July 2022 (as now applicable to Group 'B')
shall come into effect from the date of this judgment.
