By Advocate: Shri S.K. Vishwakarma

Smt. Priyanka Tyagi
                                                                 Respondents
By Advocate: Shri Amitabh Kumar Sinha


                                  ORDER



By Hon'ble Mr. Justice B.K. Shrivastava, Member (Judicial)

      This Recall Application No. 828 of 2023 has been filed for recalling

the order dated 08.02.2023 passed by this Division Bench in Contempt

Petition No. 157 of 2022 arising out from O.A. No. 1237 of 2016.



2.    It is submitted by the applicant that upon the basis of order dated

12.01.2023 filed along with the compliance affidavit, the contempt

petition has been disposed of.       The aforesaid order has been passed

without considering whether the compliance has been executed in letter

and spirit of the Court's direction.        In para-11.1 of the M.A. No.

828/2023, the applicant mentioned that the following points should be

considered: -



      (I)     Whether married son is covered in the definition of the family of
              the Central Government employee died in harness?

      (II)    Whether any upper age limit is prescribed for compassionate
              appointment?

                                                                           2


3.       The respondents opposed the aforesaid M.A. and submit that the

recall application is liable to be dismissed because no any reasonable

ground is found for recalling the aforesaid order.





4.       It appears from the record that the contempt petition was filed for

non-compliance of the order dated 04.10.2016 passed in O.A. No. 1237 of

2016. In the aforesaid O.A., the respondents were directed to consider

the case of applicant in the light of D.O.P.T. O.M. dated 25.02.2015.

When the respondents passed an order on 21.04.2017 then, the applicant

challenged the aforesaid order by filing the O.A. No. 582 of 2017 which

was decided by this Tribunal on 13.09.2022. It is found that the speaking

order has not been passed, therefore, the direction was given to pass a

speaking order. In compliance of the aforesaid direction, the respondents

passed the order dated 12.01.2023.       Upon the basis of aforesaid order,

the Court comes to the conclusion that the sufficient compliance has been

made. Hence, the contempt proceedings were dropped.



5.       It appears from the order dated 12.01.2023 that a detailed order

has been passed, which runs about 08 pages. Each and every fact was

considered.     There was a limited scope in the case of contempt.      The

Court was required to see whether the direction was complied with or not.

The direction was related to consider the case and pass a speaking order.

It cannot be said that the speaking order has not been passed.          The

points raised by the applicant are not relevant in the case of contempt. If

the applicant having any grievance by the order dated 12.01.2023 then,

he was free to challenge the aforesaid order and the findings stated in the

aforesaid order.





6.       In view of this court, no any ground is found for recalling the

aforesaid order. Hence, M.A. No. 828 of 2023 is dismissed.

          Member (Admn.)                      Member (Judicial)

/M.M./

                                                                                  3






6.     It is again submitted by the applicant that the respondent No. 4

illegally and arbitrarily issued the appointment letter on contractual basis

in favour of respondent No. 5 Dr. Mehdi Askari.                 The aforesaid

appointment is based on upon the choice of respondent No. 4.                  The

services of applicant could not be terminated. The applicant also filed the

detailed representation dated 10.04.2023. It is submitted that as per the

established law by the Supreme Court and the C.A.T. Full Bench, the ad

hoc appointment cannot be replaced by another ad hoc appointment.



5.     The respondents opposed the O.A. and filed the counter affidavit on

05.07.2023.    It is submitted by the respondents that the appointment

was temporary and upon the contractual basis for 89 days w.e.f.

14.02.2020 to 12.05.2020. The services of applicant were not extended

but he was re-appointed again on temporary and contractual basis w.e.f.

16.05.2020 to 12.08.2020 and thereafter from 17.08.2020 to 13.11.2020

and from 17.02.2021 to 16.05.2021 due to Covid 19 restrictions.               It is

also submitted that on relaxation of Covid 19 restrictions, the provisions

of Central Organization, ECHS letter No. B-49760/AG/ECHS/2017 dated

22.12.2017 was followed for selection/appointment to the post of Dental

Officer on ECHS, P.S., Gazipur. The applicant was selected by the Board

of Officers and appointed by the Station Commander, Varanasi initially for

11 months w.e.f. 24.05.2021 to 23.04.2022 and extension was granted

from 27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023 in accordance with the provisions

contained in aforesaid Central Organization letter.            The applicant's

contractual appointment was only up to 26.04.2023.         The most suitable

candidate has been selected through the Board of Officers in accordance

with   the   provisions   of   Central   Organization   ECHS   letter   No.     B-

                                                                           4



49760/AG/ECHS/2017 dated 22.12.2017.          It is also submitted by the

respondents that the new selection was conducted by following the

existing rule. The applicant himself participated in the aforesaid selection

and the respondent No. 5 has been duly selected while the applicant has

been kept in reserved list at serial No. 2.      After participating in the

selection/appointment, the applicant cannot challenge the aforesaid

selection procedure.





6.    The applicant also filed the supplementary affidavit on 19.04.2023,

second supplementary affidavit on 26.04.2023 and third supplementary

affidavit on 28.04.2023 along with some documents.           The rejoinder

affidavit was filed on 11.07.2023.





7.    The main contention of the applicant is related to appointment of

respondent No. 5. Because as per the applicant, he was appointed on ad

hoc basis and his services were extended from time to time. Therefore,

his services cannot be terminated by replacing him from another

contractual employee. The applicant placed reliance upon 
Ms. Parveen

Khan v. Government of NCT, Delhi
 dated 25.03.2010 passed by the

Full Bench of CAT, New Delhi.
 
It appears from the aforesaid Judgment

that the matter was referred to the Full Bench in the light of 
Harminder

Kaur and others v. Union of India and others
 2009 (7) SCALE

2004.
 
The Full Bench of CAT decided the aforesaid reference in the light

of the Supreme Court Judgment passed in 
Piara Singh v. State of

Haryana
 1992 (4) SLR 770 and Dr. A.K. Jain and others v. Union of

India 1987 (Supp.) SCC 497.          The Court said that the issue is well

settled on the basis of judicial precedent that a set of contractual

employee shall not be replaced by another set of contractual employee

except if the contractual employees are not working satisfactorily.


8.    The applicant also submitted the copies of orders dated 27.02.2018

passed in W.P. (S/S) No. 345 of 2018, 350 of 2018, 353 of 2018 and 352

of 2018 passed by the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital.            The

                                                                           5



aforesaid four orders are related to the interim relief and any law has not

been laid down.     The order passed only for interim measure cannot be

followed as a "principle of law".





9.    As per applicant, he was initially appointed by order dated

13.02.2020 for the period from 14.02.2020 to 12.05.2020. According to

applicant, his services were extended from time to time till 26.04.2023.

But, the respondents did not accept the aforesaid contention.       As per

respondents, the services were not extended but the applicant was re-

appointed.     The letters of appointment are also filed in the record.   It

appears from the aforesaid letters that: -



      (i)      by letter dated 13.02.2020, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 14.02.2020 to 12.05.2020;



      (ii)     by letter dated 16.05.2020, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 16.05.2020 to 12.08.2020;



      (iii)    by letter dated 16.08.2020, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 17.08.2020 to 13.11.2020;

      (iv)     by letter dated 17.11.2020, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 17.11.2020 to 13.02.2021;



      (v)      by letter dated 16.02.2021, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 17.02.2021 to 16.05.2021;



      (vi)     by letter dated 22.05.2021, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 24.05.2021 to 23.04.2022;



      (vii)    by letter dated 26.04.2022, the appointment was granted
               w.e.f. 27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023;



10.   It appears from the last two letters dated 22.05.2021 and

26.04.2022 that for a period of 23 months, the appointment was granted.

By first letter 11 months period was given and by second letter 12

months period was given. Hence, the total period by both letters was 23

months.       Before the aforesaid period, there was no any appointment

during the period from 13.05.2020 to 15.05.2020, 13.08.2020 to

16.08.2020, 14.11.2020 to 17.11.2020, 14.02.2021 to 16.02.2021 and

                                                                                          6



17.05.2021 to 23.05.2021. Therefore, the contention of the respondents

appears to be correct. The services of applicant were not extended but at

every time, fresh contractual appointment was given after some gap.




11.     
In the case of 
Dr. A.K. Jain &Ors. Vs. Union of India

&Ors.
[24/09/1987] 1988 SCR (1) 335 = 1987 SCC Supl. 497 = JT

1987 (4) 445 = 1987 SCALE (2)1002, doctors were appointed on ad

hoc basis. Looking to the peculiar facts and circumstances of cases the

Supreme Court said that no ad hoc Medical officer shall be replaced

by any newly appointed Medical officer on ad hoc basis. The Court

observed and passed the following order:-






      1.           The services of all doctors appointed either, as Assistant
      Medical officers or as Assistant Divisional Medical officer on ad hoc basis
      upto01.10.1984 shall be regularised in consultation with the Union Public
      Service Commission on the evaluation of their work and conduct on the
      basis of their confidential reports in respect of the period subsequent to
      01.10.1982. Such evaluation shall be done by the Union Public Service
      Commission. The doctors so regularised shall be appointed as Assistant
      Divisional Medical officers with effect from the date from which they have
      been continuously working as Assistant Medical officer/Assistant Divisional
      Medical officer. The Railway shall be at liberty to terminate the services of
      those who are not so regularised. If the services of any of the petitioners
      appointed prior to 01.10.84 have been terminated except on resignation
      or on disciplinary grounds, he shall be also considered for regularisation
      and if found fit his services shall be regularised as if there was no break in
      the continuity of service but without any back wages.



      2.           The    Petitions    of     the   Assistant   Medical   officer/Assistant
      Divisional Medical officers appointed subsequent to 01.10.1984 are
      dismissed. But we however direct that the Assistant Divisional Medical
      officers who may have been now selected by the Union Public Service
      Commission shall first be posted to the vacant posts available wherever
      they   may    be.   If   all    those    selected   by    the U.P.S.C.   cannot   be
      accommodated against the available vacant posts they may be posted to
      the posts now held by the doctors appointed on ad hoc basis subsequent
      to 01.10.1984 and on such posting the doctor holding the post on ad hoc
      basis shall vacate the same. While making such postings the principle of
      'last come, first go' shall be observed by the Railways on Zonal basis. If
      any doctor who is displaced pursuant to the above direction is willing to

                                                                                     7




      serve in any other Zone where there is a vacancy he may be
      accommodated on ad hoc basis in such vacancy.



      3.         All   Assistant   Medical   officers/Assistant   Divisional   Medical
      officers working on ad hoc basis shall be paid the same salary and
      allowances as Assistant Divisional Medical officers on the revised scale
      with effect from 1.1.1986. The arrears shall be paid within four months.



      4.         No ad hoc Assistant Medical officer/Assistant Divisional Medical
      officer who may be working in the Railways shall be replaced by any newly
      appointed AMO/AMO on ad hoc basis. Whenever there is need for the
      appointment of any AMO/ADMO on ad hoc basis is any Zone the existing
      ad hoc AMO/ADMOs who are likely to be replaced by regularly appointed
      candidates shall be given preference.



      5.         If the ad hoc doctors appointed after 01.10.1984 apply for
      selection by the Union Public Service Commission the Union of India and
      the Railways Department shall grant relaxation in age, to the extent of the
      period of service rendered by them as ad hoc doctors in the Railways.



12.   Three Judges Bench of Supreme Court 
inState of Haryana

&Ors. Vs. Piara Singh &Ors.
 [12.08.1992] 1992 AIR 2130 = 1992

SCR   (3) 826 = 1992 SCC            (4) 118 = JT 1992 (5)179 =                  1992

SCALE      (2)384, considered the issue of regularisation of ad-hoc/

temporary employees in government service and said that the normal

rule, of course, is regular recruitment through the prescribed agency but

exigencies of administration may sometimes call for an adhoc or

temporary appointment to be made. In such a situation, effort should

always be to replace such an adhoc /temporary employee by a regularly

selected employee as early as possible. Such a temporary employee may

also compete along with others for such regular selection/appointment. If

he gets selected, well and good, but if he does not, he must give way to

the regularly selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly

selected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake of

such an adhoc / temporary employee. The Court said:-


      "Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by
      another adhoc or temporary employee; he must be replaced only by a

                                                                                   8



      regularly selected employee. This is necessary to avoid arbitrary action on
      the part of the appointing authority."



Various direction / Suggestions were given in the aforesaid case:-


      "Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is necessitated
      on account of the exigencies of administration, he should ordinarily be
      drawn from the employment exchange unless it cannot brook delay in
      which case the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no candidate
      is available or is not sponsored by the employment exchange, some
      appropriate method consistent with the requirements of 
Article 16
 should
      be followed. In other words, there must be a notice published in the
      appropriate manner calling for applications and all those who apply in
      response thereto should be considered fairly.

             An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when qualified
      persons are not available through the above processes.

             If for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is continued for
      a fairly long spell, the authorities must consider his case for regularisation
      provided he is eligible and qualified according to rules and his service
      record is satisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the
      reservation policy of the State.

             The proper course would be that each States prepares a scheme, if
      one is not already in vogue, for regularisation of such employees
      consistent with its reservation policy and if a scheme is already framed,
      the same way be made consistent with our observations herein so as to
      reduce avoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person is
      regularised he should be placed immediately below the last regularly
      appointed employee in that category, class or service, as the case may
      be.

             So far as the work-charged employees and casual labour are
      concerned, the effort must be to regularise them as far as possible and as
      early as possible subject to their fulfilling the qualifications, if any,
      prescribed for the post and subject also to availability of work. If a casual
      labourer is continued for a fairly long spell - say two or three years - a
      presumption may arise that there is regular need for his services. In such
      a situation, it becomes obligatory for the concerned authority to examine
      the feasibility of his regularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought
      to adopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the person. As
      has been repeatedly stressed by this court, security of tenure is necessary
      for an employee to give his best to the job. In this behalf, we do
      commend the orders of the Government of Haryana (contained in its letter
      dated 6.4.90 referred to hereinbefore) both in relation to work-charged
      employees as well as casual labour.

             We must also say that the orders issued by the Governments of
      Punjab and Haryana providing for regularisation of adhoc/temporary
      employees who have put in two years/one year of service are quite
      generous and leave no room for any legitimate grievance by any one.

                                                                                            9


              These are but a few observations which we thought it necessary to
      make, impelled by the facts of this case, and the spate of litigation by
      such employees. They are not exhaustive nor can they be understood as
      immutable. Each Government or authority has to devise its own criteria or
      principles   for    regularisation    having      regard    to   all   the   relevant
      circumstances, but while doing so, it should bear in mind the observations
      made herein.



      26.     So   far    as   the   employees          and    workmen       employed     by
      Statutory/Public Corporations are concerned, it may be noted that they
      have not issued any orders akin to those issued by the Punjab and
      Haryana Government. Even so, it is but appropriate that they adopt as far
      as    possible,    keeping   the     exigencies    and     requirements      of   their
      administration in view, the criteria and principles underlying the orders
      issued by their Government in the matter of regularisation and pass
      appropriate orders. 
In short, the Statutory/Public Corporations in Haryana
      will follow the orders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990 
referred to
      above
, as supplemented by the orders in the Notification dated 28.2.1991,
      where as the Statutory / Public Corporations in Punjab shall follow the
      criteria and principles stated in the affidavit of Sri G.K. Bansal, Under
      Secretary to the Government of Punjab, Department of Personnel referred
      to in para 22 above. These directions shall not, however, apply to these
      Statutory/Public Corporations functioning within these States as are under
      the control of the Government of India. These Corporations will do well to
      evolve an appropriate policy of regularisation, in the light of this
      judgment, if they have not already evolved one, or make their existing
      policy consistent with this judgment to avoid litigation."




13.   Recently in Manish Gupta & Anr. Etc. Vs. President, Jan

Bhagidari Samiti & Ors. Etc.[C.A.Nos.3084­3088 of 2022, Arising

out of SLP (Civil) No. 12946­12950 of 2017] [decided by SC on

21.04.2022] the Supreme court also said that an ad-hoc employee

cannot be replaced by another ad-hoc employee and he can be replaced

only by another candidate who is regularly appointed by following a

regular procedure prescribed. In the aforesaid case an advertisement

came to be issued in the year 2014 for appointment of teachers as

guest faculty for the Academic Year 2014­2015 in different Colleges. The

writ petitioners having requisite qualifications, applied to the advertised

positions in pursuance to the said advertisement. Upon their selection by

                                                                               10



the duly constituted Committee, they were appointed. After the end of

the Academic year, the writ petitioners were discontinued from

service. Fresh advertisements were issued for the next Academic Year

2015­ 2016. Being aggrieved thereby, the writ petitioners approached the

High Court and the learned single judge of the High Court of M.P. vide

judgment and order dated 29th September, 2016,allowed the writ

directing that the writ petitioners therein would continue to work on

their respective posts till regular selections were made. It was also

directed that the writ petitioners therein were entitled to get the salary in

accordance with the UGC circular issued in February, 2010. But the

Division Bench of the High Court by order dated 8th February, 2017,

allowed the writ appeals and set aside the judgment and order passed by

the learned single judge of the High Court. The Supreme Court set aside

the Order of Division Bench and confirmed the order of Single Judge with

some modification. The Court said: -





 
"12.   A perusal of the advertisement dated 24th June, 2016 issued by
      the Principal, Government Kamla Raja Girls Post Graduate Autonomous
      College, Gwalior, which is at Annexure P­2 of the Appeal Paper Book and
      the advertisement dated 2nd July, 2016 issued by the Principal, SMS
      Government Model Science College, Gwalior, M.P., which is at Annexure
      P­3 of the Appeal Paper Book, would show that the appointments were to
      be made after the candidates had gone through due selection procedure.
      Though Shri Nataraj, learned ASG has strenuously urged that the
      appointments of the appellants were as guest lecturers and not as ad hoc
      employees, from the nature of the advertisements, it could clearly be seen
      that the appellants were appointed on ad hoc basis. It is a settled
      principle of law that an ad hoc employee cannot be replaced by
      another ad hoc employee and he can be replaced only by another
      candidate who is regularly appointed by following a regular
      procedure prescribed. Reliance in this respect can be placed on the
      judgment of this Court in the case of 
Rattan Lal and others vs. State of
      Haryana and others
, (1985) 4 SCC 43 and on the order of this Court in
      the case of Hargurpratap Singh vs. State of Punjab and others,
      (2007) 13 SCC 292.




      13.    In that view of the matter, we do not find that an error was
      committed by the learned single judge of the High Court by directing the
      writ petitioners to continue to work on their respective posts till regular

                                                                                 11



      selections are made. We, however, find that the direction issued by the
      learned single judge of the High Court that the writ petitioners would
      be entitled to get the salary in accordance with the UGC circular is
      not sustainable. The advertisements themselves clearly provided that
      the selected candidates would be paid the honorarium to be determined
      by the said Committee."



      14.    We are informed at the Bar that the appellants are being paid on a
      per hour basis, i.e., at the rate of Rs.1,000/­ per hour and they are
      continuing to work in pursuance of the order of status quo passed by this
      Court on 28th April, 2017. We also find substance with the submission
      made on behalf of the respondent - State that continuation of the
      appellants would depend on the number of students offering themselves
      for the concerned courses.





      15................





      16.    Accordingly, we pass the following order:

             A.     The appeals are partly allowed.
             B.     The impugned judgment and order dated 8th February,

             2017 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya
             Pradesh, Gwalior Bench in Writ Appeal No.386 of 2016 along with
             companion matters is quashed and set aside;

      C.     The judgment and order dated 29th September, 2016 passed by
      learned single judge of the High Court is modified as under:

             (i) The writ petitioners ­ appellants herein would be entitled to
             continue on their respective posts till they are replaced by regularly
             selected candidates;

             (ii) The writ petitioners ­ appellants herein would be continued on
             their respective posts provided that a sufficient number of students
             are available for the particular course(s) for which the writ
             petitioners -appellants herein are appointed.

             (iii) The writ petitioners - appellants herein would be entitled to
             honorarium at the rate of Rs.1,000/­ per hour as is being paid to
             them presently.



14.   It appears from the record that the appointment was given due to

Covid 19 restrictions.      On relaxation of Covid 19 restrictions, the

provisions    of    Central     Organization       ECHS      letter     No.     B-

49760/AG/ECHS/2017 dated 22.12.2017 was followed for selection/

appointment for the post of Dental Officer at ECHS, Gazipur.                  The

applicant was selected by the Board of Officers and appointed by the

Station Commander, Varanasi initially for the period of 11 months w.e.f.

                                                                                12



24.05.2021    to   23.04.2023     and   the   extension    was   granted     from

27.04.2022 to 26.04.2023.        Therefore, the regular recruitment process

was not followed because of situation arisen due to Covid 19 and the

applicant was appointed by passing the due procedure.



15.   It is also appear from the record that the notification for

employment was issued           on 12.01.2023.       The copy of aforesaid

notification is also enclosed at page 47 of the O.A.         In the aforesaid

notification, the post of applicant was also advertised.         Thereafter, the

applicant himself applied for the aforesaid post. In compliance with the

aforesaid notification 12.01.2023, an interview for the post of Dental

Officer was conducted on 10.03.2023 and the result was declared on

03.04.2023.    The copy of result has been filed along with the fourth

supplementary      affidavit   dated   01.05.2023.    It   appears    that    the

respondent No. 5 has been selected for the aforesaid post and the

applicant gets the status of reserved No. 2. It means that the name of

applicant is in the waiting list at serial No. 2. Therefore, it is also appear

that the applicant himself participated in the aforesaid selection.        When

the notification was issued, the applicant did not challenge the aforesaid

action of the respondents. The applicant himself applied and participated

in the selection procedure. When the applicant was not selected then, he

is stopped to challenge the selection procedure and he cannot challenge

the appointment of respondent No. 5.





16.   The case of 
Pradeep Kumar Rai and Ors. Vs. Dinesh Kumar

Pandey and Ors.
, 2015 (11) SCC 493 [C.A. No.6549 of 2014] [D-

11.05.2015] was related to the promotion of Constables and Head

Constables to the rank of Sub-Inspectors in the State of Uttar Pradesh.

The process of promotion started way back in 1999 and the candidates

appearing for promotion from the rank of Constable or Head Constable to

the rank of Sub-Inspector have challenged the selection and promotion

process at various stages of the promotion process. The court observed

                                                                                   13



that after participating and unsuccessful in the examination, the candidate

cannot be allowed to challenge the examination: -






 
"16. Moreover, we would concur with the Division Bench on one more
         point that the appellants had participated in the process of interview and
         not challenged it till the results were declared. There was a gap of almost
         four months between the interview and declaration of result. However, the
         appellants did not challenge it at that time. Thus, it appears that only
         when the appellants found themselves to be unsuccessful, they challenged
         the interview.This cannot be allowed. The candidates cannot approbate
         and reprobate at the same time. Either the candidates should not have
         participated in the interview and challenged the procedure or they should
         have challenged immediately after the interviews were conducted. (See
         Vijendra Kumar Verma Vs. Public Service Commission, Uttarakhand and
         Ors., (
2011) 1 SCC 150, and K.H. Siraz Vs. High
 Court of Kerala and Ors.
         (2006) 6 SCC 395)"




17.      
In 
Ashok Kumar Vs. State of Bihar, C.A. No.
 9092 of 2012

decided on 21.10.2016, three judges bench of Supreme Court said

that candidates who have taken part in a selection process knowing fully

well the procedure laid down therein are not entitled to question it upon

being declared to be unsuccessful. It was not open to the appellants after

participating in the selection process to question the result, once they

were declared to be unsuccessful.

Development v. S.K. Shiva Subaramanyam, (
2016) 1 SCC 454,

Amlan Jyoti Borrooah v. State of Assam
, (2009) 3 SCC 227 and

said:-




         "11.   The appellants participated in the fresh process of selection. If the
         appellants were aggrieved by the decision to hold a fresh process, they
         did not espouse their remedy. Instead, they participated in the fresh
         process of selection and it was only upon being unsuccessful that they

                                                                                    14



         challenged the result in the writ petition. This was clearly not open to the
         appellants. The principle of estoppel would operate."



18.      In Madan Lal (Madan Lal and Others v. State of J & K and

others, (1995) 3 SCC 486,), it was held that if a candidate takes a

calculated chance and appears at the interview then only because the

result of the interview is not palatable to him he cannot turn around and

subsequently contend that the process of interview was unfair and the

selection committee was not properly constituted.



19.      Therefore, it appears from the entire record that the applicant

having no any authority to challenge the aforesaid selection in which he

was also participated and the respondent No. 5 was selected.              Hence,

the O.A. having no any force is dismissed.
