            (Annexures -III and IV).



      ii)   Writ, order or direction including one in the nature of Mandamus,
            commanding upon the respondents not to give any effect to the

            consideration to the claim of the petitioner for her promotion to
            the post of Head Assistant w.e.f 24-11-2022, without taking into
            consideration the adverse uncommunicated ACR of the year 2020
            and grant her all the benefits of seniority, pay and grade alongwith
            arrears.



FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE


1.   The petitioner, a Senior Assistant in the High Court of J&K and

     Ladakh, challenges the order dated 24.11.2022, whereby she was

     denied promotion to the post of the Head Assistant and superseded by

     her juniors. The respondents justified the denial on the ground that

     the petitioner secured only 54% (19 points) in the assessment of her

     Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the period 2017-2021,

     falling short of the mandatory 65% aggregate marks prescribed under

     Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020. The petitioner contends that the

 3|Page                                                     WP(C)323/2023




     adverse ACRs recorded for 2019-2021 were never communicated to

     her, violating her right to make representations against them. She

     further contends that the guidelines applied for her assessment were

     originally framed for the post of Gazetted staff and could not be

     extended to her post without publication by way of a notification,

     rendering them inapplicable and unenforceable. The petitioner seeks

     directions for her promotion with retrospective effect from the date

     her juniors were promoted.



2.   The respondents, on the other hand, admit that there is no record of

     communication of adverse ACRs but submitted that the petitioner's

     failure to achieve the 65% aggregate marks, disqualified her from

     promotion. The further stand of the respondents 2 to 4 is that the

     petitioner did not challenge the validity of Order No. 415 in her writ

     petition, and as such, no relief can be granted on this ground. They

     further contend that publication of the executive order by way of a

     notification was not required in the absence of any statutory mandate

     and that the order operates both retrospectively and prospectively for

     assessing promotions. Even if Order No. 415 is excluded, the

     respondents submit that promotions to the post of Head Assistant are

     based on seniority-cum-merit, and evaluation of ACRs remains an

     integral part of the process. Accordingly, they pray for dismissal of

     the writ petition while assuring that the petitioner's case for

     promotion will be considered in future as per the applicable rules and

     practices.

 4|Page                                                        WP(C)323/2023




SUBMISSIONS ON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


3.   Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that

     the impugned orders denying promotion to the petitioner are illegal,

     arbitrary, and contrary to settled principles of law, and are liable to be

     quashed. The said orders are based on an adverse Annual

     Confidential Report (ACR) for the year 2020, which was not

     communicated to the petitioner at the relevant time. The failure to

     communicate the adverse ACR deprives the petitioner of an

     opportunity to represent against the same, which is a fundamental

     violation of law.



4.   It is the specific case of the petitioner that the respondents, while

     considering her case for promotion, were not aware of the fact that

     the petitioner had rendered unblemished service for over fifteen

     years, except for the alleged adverse ACR for 2020. This aspect of

     the matter was deliberately concealed and suppressed by the

     authorities in their decision-making process. The respondents failed

     to appreciate that the petitioner was on sanctioned medical leave for a

     substantial period in 2020 and that the entire year was severely

     affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the petitioner was

     not engaged in any misconduct that could justify a "below average"


     rating in her ACR.



5.   The learned senior counsel, Mr. Haqani, further submits that the non-


     communication of the adverse ACR to the petitioner goes to the root

     of the case and renders the denial of promotion legally unsustainable.

 5|Page                                                            WP(C)323/2023





6.   Learned senior counsel also submits that the respondents have

     committed    a   grave   illegality    by     rejecting     the   petitioner's

     representation vide a non-speaking order dated 16.12.2022. Such an

     order, passed without assigning reasons, reflects complete non-

     application of mind and violates the settled principle that reasons are

     the soul of administrative and quasi-judicial decisions.


7.   The learned counsel highlights that the petitioner was senior to

     respondents No. 5 and 6 in the seniority list and was otherwise fully

     eligible for promotion. Denial of promotion to the petitioner, while

     promoting her juniors, is a clear case of supersession and violates the

     principle of seniority-cum-merit applicable in such cases.


8.   It is further submitted that the respondents have mechanically applied

     guidelines for assessment and promotion which were neither

     applicable to the post of the petitioner nor duly published or notified.

     This lack of proper procedure reflects arbitrariness and renders the

     impugned orders legally unsustainable.





9.   Learned Counsel lastly submits that the petitioner has been subjected

     to serious prejudice as a result of the impugned orders and prays that

     the impugned orders be quashed. It is further prayed that the

     respondents be directed to consider the petitioner's claim for

     promotion to the post of Head Assistant w.e.f. 24.11.2022, with all

     consequential    benefits,   without        taking   into     account     the

     uncommunicated and unjustified ACR for the year 2020.

 6|Page                                                       WP(C)323/2023




SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


10.   Per Contra, The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the

      respondents submits that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is

      devoid of merit, misconceived, and liable to be dismissed. The denial

      of promotion to the petitioner is neither arbitrary nor illegal but is

      based on objective criteria and service records duly considered by the

      competent authority.



11.   It is submitted that the petitioner failed to secure the mandatory

      aggregate of 65% marks in her Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs)

      for the preceding five years, as required under Order No. 415 dated

      05.10.2020. This order, issued with the approval of the Hon'ble Chief

      Justice and Administrative Committee of the High Court, lays down a

      uniform standard for evaluating merit in promotions and has been

      consistently applied for all non-gazetted posts in the High Court over

      the last several years.



12.   The learned counsel further submits that the petitioner has not

      challenged the validity or legality of Order No. 415 in her writ

      petition, and no relief has been sought against it in the prayer clause.

      In the absence of such a challenge, the petitioner cannot now contend

      that the said order is inapplicable to her case. Reliance is placed on

      Mukesh Singh Kushwah v. State of MP, 2002 (1) SCC 598, wherein

      it was held that a relief not claimed, cannot be granted by the Court.


13.   It is the specific case of the respondents that the petitioner's adverse

      ACR for the year 2020, though not formally communicated, was duly

      recorded in the service records and formed part of the assessment

 7|Page                                                         WP(C)323/2023




      process for promotions. The absence of formal communication does

      not by itself vitiate the assessment, especially when the evaluation is

      based on cumulative service records.



14.   Learned counsel, Mr. M.I. Qadari, Senior Advocate, submits that the

      stand of the petitioner, requiring publication of executive orders in

      the Gazette is misplaced. There is no statutory mandate under the

      applicable service rules requiring publication of Order No. 415 in the

      official Gazette. The order was issued as an administrative instruction

      to streamline promotions and ensure merit-based advancement.


15.   It is further submitted that even if Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 is

      excluded, the principle of seniority-cum-merit as envisaged under

      Order No. 517 dated 24.10.2008 requires consideration of both

      seniority and merit. The petitioner's merit was duly assessed on the

      basis of her ACRs for the preceding five years, and she did not meet

      the required standard for promotion.



16.   Learned senior counsel further emphasizes that the petitioner's

      supersession does not violate any of her rights, as promotion is not a

      matter of right but is subject to availability of posts and suitability of

      the candidate. The respondents acted in accordance with established

      practice and procedure while denying promotion to the petitioner.


17.   In view of the above, the learned counsel for the respondents submits

      that the impugned orders are legal, justified, and passed after due

      consideration of the petitioner's service record. The writ petition is

      without merit and liable to be dismissed.

 8|Page                                                       WP(C)323/2023




ISSUES TAKEN UP FOR DETERMINATION


18.   Heard learned counsel for both the parties at length and carefully

      perused the material on record. The following issues arise for

      determination:



      Issue no. i: Whether the non-communication of adverse entries
                    in the petitioner's Annual Confidential Reports
                    (ACRs) renders the respondent's decision to deny
                    promotion legally unsustainable.

      Issue no. ii: Whether Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,
                    originally applicable to gazetted staff, could have
                    been extended and applied to non-gazetted staff
                    without proper notification highlighting the revised
                    benchmark for promotion?

      Issue no. iii: Whether Executive Order No. 415 operates
                    retrospectively so as to govern the consideration of
                    promotions pertaining to a period prior to its
                    issuance.

      Issue no. iv: Whether the recording of the petitioner's Annual
                    Confidential Report (ACR) for the year 2020 during
                    the period of her sanctioned medical leave due to
                    COVID-19, without due communication of the
                    recorded remarks irrespective of whether they were
                    favourable, average, or adverse vitiates the
                    procedural fairness required under service
                    jurisprudence.

LEGAL ANALYSIS


19.   The issues framed above are now taken up for determination by us.


      Each issue is examined individually in the following paragraphs,

      upon a careful consideration of the pleadings, the evidence placed on

      record, and the applicable legal principles as expounded in judicial

      precedents.



20.   ISSUE No. I: Whether the non-communication of adverse
      Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) vitiates the respondent's
      decision to deny promotion to the petitioner.



      At the very core of the petitioner's grievance lies the allegation that

      her promotion was denied on the basis of adverse entries in her

 9|Page                                                             WP(C)323/2023




      Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the years 2019-2020 and

      2021, which were admittedly never communicated to her. This Court

      considers it essential to first address this issue, as it strikes at the

      foundation of fairness, transparency, and adherence to the principles

      of natural justice in service jurisprudence. We find it imperative to

      first address the issue of non-communication of adverse ACRs, as it

      strikes at the heart of fairness and natural justice in public service

      law.



21.   Before deciding the above issue, we deem it proper to refer to the

      judgment rendered by The Apex Court in, 
Dev Dutt v. Union of

      India
, (2008) 8 SCC 725, the Hon'ble Supreme Court unequivocally

      held that:






 
"17. In our opinion, every entry in the ACR of a public servant
             must be communicated to him within a reasonable period,
             whether it is a poor, fair, average, good or very good entry. This
             is because non-communication of such an entry may adversely
             affect the employee in two ways: (1) had the entry been
             communicated to him he would know about the assessment of his
             work and conduct by his superiors, which would enable him to
             improve his work in future: (2) he would have an opportunity of
             making a representation against the entry if he feels it is
             unjustified, and pray for its upgradation. Hence, non-
             communication of an entry is arbitrary, and it has been held by
             the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in 
Maneka Gandhi
             v. Union of India
? that arbitrariness violates 
Article 14
 of the
             Constitution."




22.   The Court reasoned that the right of an employee to be informed of

      any adverse material recorded in their service dossier is a

      fundamental facet of fairness, accountability, and transparency in

      service jurisprudence. This right assumes greater significance where

      such adverse material is proposed to be relied upon to deny

      promotional benefits or career advancement. The principles of audi
 10 | P a g e                                                           WP(C)323/2023




        alteram partem, which mandate that no individual shall be

        condemned unheard, apply with full force to service matters where

        adverse entries in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) have a direct

        bearing on the employee's rights and legitimate expectations. Denial

        of such an opportunity not only violates natural justice but also

        renders any decision based on uncommunicated material, legally

        unsustainable.



23.     The law 
laid down by
 the Apex Court in 
Dev Dutt v. Union of India
,

        (2008) has been reiterated in 
Sukhdev Singh vs. Union Of India and

        others
, 2013 (9) SCC 566 as under:






               "5. In paras 37 and 41 of the Report this Court then observed as
               follows:     (Dev     Dutt     case-,    SCC       pp.   737-38)
                    "37. We further hold that when the entry is communicated to
               him the public servant should have a right to make a
               representation against the entry to the authority concerned, and
               the authority concerned must decide the representation in a fair
               manner and within a reasonable period. We also hold that the
               representation must be decided by an authority higher than the
               one who gave the entry, otherwise the likelihood is that the
               representation will be summarily rejected without adequate
               consideration as it would be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar.
               All this would be conducive to fairness and transparency in
               public administration, and would result in fairness to public
               servants. The State must be a model employer, and must act
               fairly towards its employees. Only then would good governance
               be possible


                   41. In our opinion, non-communication of entries in the
               annual confidential report of a public servant, whether he is in
               civil, judicial, police or any other service (other than the
               military), certainly has civil consequences because it may affect
               his chances for promotion or get other benefits (as already
               discussed above). Hence, such non-communication would be
               arbitrary, and as such violative of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution."



24.     It is a well-established principle in service jurisprudence that any

        adverse entry in the Annual Confidential Report (ACR) must be

        communicated to the concerned employee in a timely manner,
 11 | P a g e                                                   WP(C)323/2023




        particularly when such entry is likely to affect the employee's service

        prospects, including promotion.



25.     Keeping in view the above, we find that lowering down of ACRs

        from "very good" to "below average" would require the respondents

        to give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner after conveying the

        said remarks.



26.     In the present case, the respondents have admitted that the adverse

        Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the years 2019-2020 and

        2021 were not communicated to the petitioner, thereby depriving her

        of the opportunity to make a representation or seek their review in

        accordance with law. The consideration of such uncommunicated

        entries while denying her promotion is in violation of the principles

        of natural justice, particularly the rule of audi alteram partem, and is

        manifestly arbitrary, thus offending 
Article 14
 of the Constitution. As

        
laid down in
 
Dev Dutt v. Union of India
 and consistently reiterated

        in subsequent judgments, the reliance on uncommunicated adverse

        remarks in ACRs vitiates the entire promotion process, rendering the

        consequential decision invalid and unsustainable in law. The

        respondents' failure to adhere to the mandatory requirement of

        communication has, therefore, not only infringed the petitioner's

        statutory and constitutional rights but has also tainted the selection

        process with illegality.




27.     Therefore, we hold that the non-communication of the relevant ACRs

        is the most fundamental flaw and strikes at the very root of the

        decision-making process adopted by the respondents. It constitutes a
 12 | P a g e                                                 WP(C)323/2023




        grave violation of the principles of natural justice and renders the

        entire exercise manifestly arbitrary and procedurally unfair. Such a

        fundamental defect cannot be cured or overlooked and decision taken

        by the respondents by virtue of orders impugned, cannot sustain the

        test of law and is liable to be rejected.



        Issue no. I, is decided accordingly.





28. ISSUE No.II: Whether Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,
    originally applicable to gazetted staff, could have been extended
    and applied to non-gazetted staff without proper notification
    highlighting the revised benchmark for promotion?



29. Upon a careful examination of the material on record and in light of

      the settled legal principles, this Court is of the considered view that

      Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, which prescribed a revised

      benchmark of 65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports

      (ACRs) for promotion, was originally intended to apply to gazetted

      staff only, and its subsequent extension to non-gazetted staff without

      any formal notification or publication, amounts to a procedural

      illegality.



30.     The records reveal that there was no contemporaneous notification,

        office memorandum, or circular issued by the Registrar General or

        the Administrative Department that expressly made the said executive

        order applicable to non-gazetted employees. No attempt was made to

        notify or circulate the revised benchmark among non-gazetted

        employees, nor was any opportunity afforded to them to acquaint
 13 | P a g e                                                           WP(C)323/2023




        themselves with or prepare for the application of such an elevated

        standard.



31.     In the absence of any such formal notification, the affected category

        of non-gazetted staff had no reasonable means of knowing that the

        eligibility criteria for promotion had been altered. The fundamental

        principles of natural justice demand that rules or standards that

        impose new obligations or alter existing service conditions, must be

        duly published and communicated to those affected.


32.     With a view to fortify this principle, we deem it proper to refer to the

        judgement passed by the Apex Court in 
Harla v. State of Rajasthan
,

        AIR 1951 SC 467, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court

        authoritatively held:




               9. Natural justice requires that before a law can become
               operative it must be promulgated or published. It must be
               broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know
               what it is; or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or
               regulation or customary channel by or through which such
               knowledge can be acquired with the exercise of due and
               reasonable diligence. The thought that a decision reached in the
               secret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no access
               and to which even their accredited representatives have no access
               and of which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless
               affect their lives, liberty and property by the mere passing of a
               resolution without anything more is abhorrent to civilised man. It
               shocks his conscience. In the absence therefore of any law, rule,
               regulation or custom, we hold that a law cannot come into being
               in this way. Promulgation or publication of some reasonable sort
               is essential.



33.     This principle flows from the broader doctrine of audi alteram

        partem and the right to natural justice, as individuals cannot be

        expected to comply with unknown norms or be penalised for their

        breach.



34.     Similarly, in 
B.K. Srinivasan v. State of Karnataka
, (1987) 1 SCC

        658, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated:


 14 | P a g e                                                           WP(C)323/2023





               15. There can be no doubt about the proposition that where a
               law, whether parliamentary or subordinate, demands
               compliance, those that are governed must be notified directly and
               reliably of the law and all changes and additions made to it by
               various processes. Whether law is viewed from the standpoint of
               the "conscientious good man" seeking to abide by the law or
               from the standpoint of justice Holmes's "unconscientious bad
               man" seeking to avoid the law, law must be known, that is to say,
               it must be so made that it can be known. We know that delegated
               or subordinate legislation is all-pervasive and that there is hardly
               any field of activity where governance by delegated or
               subordinate legislative powers is not as important if not more
               important, than governance by parliamentary legislation. But
               unlike parliamentary legislation which is publicly made,
               delegated or subordinate legislation is often made unobtrusively
               in the chambers of a Minister, a Secretary to the Government or
               other official dignitary. It is, therefore, necessary that
               subordinate legislation, in order to take effect, must be published
               or promulgated in some suitable manner, whether such
               publication or promulgation is prescribed by the parent statute or
               not. It will then take effect from the date of such publication or
               promulgation. Where the parent statute prescribes the mode of
               publication or promulgation that mode must be followed. Where
               the parent statute is silent, but the subordinate legislation itself
               prescribes the manner of publication, such a mode of publication
               may be sufficient, if reasonable. If the subordinate legislation
               does not prescribe the mode of publication or if the subordinate
               legislation prescribes a plainly unreasonable mode of
               publication, it will take effect only when it is published through
               the customarily recognised official channel, namely, the Official
               Gazette or some other reasonable mode of publication. There
               may be subordinate legislation which is concerned with a few
               individuals or is confined to small local areas. In such cases
               publication or promulgation by other means may be sufficient.



        The court further observed that administrative instructions, even if

        validly issued, must be publicised effectively if they alter existing

        rights or impose new burdens.



35.     The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as 
R.Ranjith Singh & Ors

        v State Of Tamil Nadu & Ors.
 reported as 2025 SCC Online SC

        1009, has made it clear that:




                 21. This Court in case of Jaiveer Singh v State of
                 Utrakhand 2023INSC 1204 has held as under:

                     34. It can thus be seen that it is a trite law that the
                     Government cannot amend or supersede statutory
                     rules by administrative instructions, but if the rules
                     are silent on any particular point, it can fill up the
                     gaps and supplement the rules and issue
 15 | P a g e                                                    WP(C)323/2023




                      instructions not inconsistent with the rules already
                      framed. It is a settled proposition of law that an
                      authority cannot issue orders/office memorandum/
                      executive instructions in contravention of the
                      statutory rules. However, instructions can be issued
                      only to supplement the statutory rules but not to
                      supplant it. This Court has again held in the
                      aforesaid case that the Government cannot issue
                      executive instructions in contravention of the
                      statutory rule.



               In the present case, Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,

        which introduced a new benchmark for promotion eligibility, was

        neither traceable to any statutory rule nor duly notified or

        communicated      to   the   affected   employees.    Its   retrospective

        application, therefore, not only offends the principle of administrative

        fairness and transparency but also violates the doctrine of legitimate

        expectation. The attempt to apply the benchmark fixed under

        Executive Order No. 415, originally confined to gazetted staff, to

        non-gazetted employees without any formal notification or

        publication is wholly arbitrary and violates the doctrine of legitimate

        expectation and administrative fairness.



36.     Moreover, nothing has been placed on record to show that the

        Registrar General, after obtaining approval from the Hon'ble Chief

        Justice as the competent authority, ever took steps to formally notify

        this change or to make it applicable to the cadre of non-gazetted

        employees. This constitutes a serious administrative omission,

        particularly when the order was used to deny promotion to the

        petitioner.

 16 | P a g e                                                           WP(C)323/2023





37.     In light of the above, this Court holds that Executive Order No. 415

        could not have been extended to non-gazetted employees without

        formal notification and communication, especially when it introduced

        a substantive change in promotion criteria. The failure to notify the

        same has resulted in denial of due opportunity to the petitioner,

        rendering the action arbitrary and violative of 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of

        the Constitution of India.



38.     ISSUE NO. III: Whether Executive Order No. 415 operates
        retrospectively so as to govern the consideration of promotions
        pertaining to a period prior to its issuance.



        It is now trite in law that executive orders or administrative

        instructions altering service conditions cannot operate retrospectively

        unless the language of the order expressly provides for such an effect.

        Retrospective       application       is     generally      frowned           upon

        as it offends the principles of fairness and violates vested rights.


39.     This principle was reiterated in 
State of Punjab v. Bhajan Kaur
,

        (2008) 12 SCC 112, where the Apex Court observed:


               "9. A statute is presumed to be prospective unless held to be
               retrospective, either expressly or by necessary implication. A
               substantive law is presumed to be prospective. It is one of the
               facets of the rule of law."

40.     Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled 
Madishetti Bala

        Ramul v. Land Acquisition Officer
 reported in (2007) 9 SCC 650

        has held as under:




               19. 
In 
Land Acquisition Officer-cum-SWO v. B.V. Reddy and
               Sons
 this Court opined that Section 25 being not a
               procedural provision will have no retrospective effect, holding :


               (SCC p. 471, para 6)
               "6. Coming to the second question, it is a well-settled principle of
               construction that a substantive provision cannot be retrospective
               in nature unless the provision itself indicates the same. The
               amended provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates that the same
 17 | P a g e                                                       WP(C)323/2023




               would have any retrospective effect. Consequently, therefore, it
               would apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to 24-9-1984,
               the date on which Act 68 of 1984 came into force. The Land
               Acquisition (Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in
               Parliament on 30-4-1982 and came into operation with effect
               from 24-9-1984.



41.     In the present case, Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 introduced a

        new criterion of securing 65% aggregate marks in Annual

        Confidential Reports (ACRs) as a precondition for promotion. The

        petitioner's case for promotion was under consideration for the period

        2017-2021, a substantial portion of which precedes the issuance of

        the impugned order.



42.     The application of the newly introduced ACR criterion of securing

        65% aggregate marks to the period in question effectively alter the

        service conditions of the petitioner in a retrospective manner. Such

        application prejudices her vested right to be considered for promotion

        under the previously existing criteria, which did not prescribe any

        minimum aggregate threshold for ACRs.



43.     In the present case, the application of Order No. 415 introduces a new

        obligation requiring employees to secure a minimum of 65%

        aggregate marks in their Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for

        eligibility to promotion. This requirement is sought to be enforced in

        respect of past years for which the petitioner's ACRs had already

        been recorded without any prior knowledge of such a threshold.

        Imposing this condition retrospectively, squarely falls within the

        mischief of retrospective operation and is legally impermissible.

44.     The Honble Apex court in case titled as 
Land Acquisition Officer

        Cum DSWO, A.P v. B.V. Reddy & Sons
, reported in (2002) 3 SCC

        463 has consistently held that:




 
"6. Coming to the second question, it is a well-settled principle of
               construction that a substantive provision cannot be retrospective
               in nature unless the provision itself indicates the same. The
               amended provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates that the same
               would have any retrospective effect. Consequently, therefore, it
               would apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to 24-9-1984,
               the date on which Act 68 of 1984 came into force. The Land
               Acquisition (Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in
               Parliament on 30-4-1982 and came into operation with effect
               from 24-9-1984. Under the amendment in question, the
               provisions of Section 23(2) dealing with solatium were amended
               and Section 30(2) of the amended Act provided that the
               provisions of subsection (2) of Section 23 of the principal Act as
               amended by clause (b) of Section 15 shall apply and shall be
               deemed to have applied, also to and in relation to any award
               made by the Collector or court or to any order passed by the High
               Court or the Supreme Court in appeal against any such award
               under the provisions of the principal Act, after 30-4-1982 and
               before the commencement of the Act. It is because of the
               aforesaid provision, the question cropped up as to whether in
               respect of an award passed by the Collector between the two
               dates, the amended provision will have an application or not and
               that question has been answered by this Court in the Constitution
               Bench decision in 
Union of India v. Raghubir Singh
. Sub-section
               (2) of Section 30 has at all no reference to the provisions of
               Section 25 of the Act. In that view of the matter, question of
               applicability of the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act to
               an award of the Collector made earlier to the amendment and the
               matter was pending in appeal, does not arise. In our considered
               opinion, the amended provisions of Section 25 of the Act, not
               being retrospective in nature, the case in hand would be
               governed by the unamended provisions of Section 25 of the Act."


 19 | P a g e                                                     WP(C)323/2023





45.     We are firmly of the view that the retrospective application of

        Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 to promotion processes

        covering the period from 2017 to 2021 is neither justified nor legally

        sustainable. The said order introduced a new eligibility condition

        requiring 65% aggregate marks in the ACRs which was neither

        notified nor communicated to the employees concerned at the

        relevant time. As such, the petitioner and similarly placed employees

        were deprived of an fair opportunity to comply with or address this

        new requirement. Imposing such a standard retrospectively not only

        unsettles vested rights but also causes serious prejudice and

        administrative uncertainty. Revisiting settled promotions after several

        years disturbs the finality of service matters, generates avoidable

        litigation, and undermines institutional fairness. In our view,

        enforcing an unpublished and uncommunicated executive instruction

        with retrospective effect is arbitrary, unreasonable, and impermissible

        both in law and in equity.



46.     Accordingly, the respondents' attempt to apply the new standard

        introduced under Executive Order No. 415 requiring a minimum of

        65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) to the

        petitioner's case is legally unsustainable. Such retrospective

        application of a criterion that was neither in existence nor

        communicated during the relevant assessment years directly offends

        the well-settled principle of non- retrospectivity in service law. It also

        violates the guarantee of fairness and equality enshrined under

        
Article 14
 of the Constitution, as administrative authorities are
 20 | P a g e                                                    WP(C)323/2023




        required to act in a just, transparent, and non-arbitrary manner.

        Moreover, this action undermines the doctrine of legitimate

        expectation, which protects employees from arbitrary alterations of

        service conditions and ensures that they are not prejudiced by

        changes introduced without adequate prior notice or opportunity to

        adjust their conduct.



47.     Order No. 415, having been issued on 05.10.2020, cannot lawfully be

        applied to the petitioner's case retrospectively. Thus, we hold that, its

        application to a period prior to its issuance is legally unsustainable,

        arbitrary, and violative of the petitioner's rights.

        Issue no. III is decided, accordingly.



48. ISSUE NO. IV: Whether the recording of the petitioner's Annual
    Confidential Report (ACR) for the year 2020 during the period of
    her sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19, without due
    communication of the recorded remarks irrespective of whether
    they were favourable, average, or adverse vitiates the procedural
    fairness required under service jurisprudence?


49. An ACR is meant to be an objective assessment of an employee's

      performance, conduct, and work output during a defined reporting

      period. When an employee is on sanctioned leave particularly for

      medical reasons such as COVID-19, he or she is not actively

      discharging duties and therefore cannot be evaluated on performance

      metrics during that time. Recording adverse remarks under such

      circumstances can be inherently unfair and arbitrary, as it is not based

      on active service or observable conduct during the period in question.

      Further, the principles of natural justice demand that any evaluation

      which may adversely affect an employee's rights such as eligibility
 21 | P a g e                                                   WP(C)323/2023




      for promotion or career advancement must be transparent, fair, and

      objectively grounded. An adverse ACR recorded while the employee

      was legitimately absent from duty violates this principle, as the

      employee has no opportunity to demonstrate performance or defend

      against subjective assessments.





50. Moreover, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dev Dutt v.


      Union of India [(2008) 8 SCC 725], even non-adverse or 'average'

      entries must be communicated if they can impact promotional

      prospects. It logically follows that adverse remarks recorded during a

      period of sanctioned leave, without any valid basis tied to actual

      performance, must be communicated with reasons and an opportunity

      for the employee to represent against them. Failing to do so renders

      such entries procedurally and substantively defective. In addition,

      departmental rules, executive instructions, and settled judicial

      precedent all underscore that recording of ACRs must reflect actual

      work and conduct not presumptions or administrative convenience.



51. In light of the above, recording an adverse ACR during sanctioned

      leave especially without due communication cannot withstand legal

      scrutiny. It is not only administratively improper, but also vitiates the

      evaluation process, thereby compromising the employee's right to

      fair consideration in matters of promotion, postings, and other

      service benefits.

 22 | P a g e                                                   WP(C)323/2023





52. It is the specific stand of the petitioner that she was on duly

      sanctioned medical leave for a substantial period in 2020 owing to

      COVID-19 and related complications. Despite this, her performance

      for that year was assessed as "below average." Recording an adverse

      Annual Confidential Report (ACR) during a period of sanctioned

      leave raises serious questions about the fairness, legality, and

      propriety of such an evaluation.





53. The law is clear that no adverse remark can be made in an ACR

      unless it is based on concrete material reflecting actual work or

      misconduct during the reporting period.





54. In the present case, there is no material on record to show that the

      petitioner was either engaged in any work or guilty of any misconduct

      during her sanctioned leave. Rather, the respondents appear to have

      mechanically recorded a "below average" rating without assessing

      whether she had an opportunity to demonstrate her performance. Such

      action fails the test of fairness, non-arbitrariness, and application of

      mind, which are cornerstones of service jurisprudence.


55.     This Court also takes judicial notice of the fact that the COVID-19

        pandemic constituted an extraordinary public health emergency,

        wherein employees across the spectrum were affected physically and

        psychologically. Many were absent from work not by choice, but due

        to circumstances beyond their control. To penalise an employee for

        absence during such a period, particularly when the leave was duly
 23 | P a g e                                                      WP(C)323/2023




        sanctioned, is not only legally untenable but also violates the

        principles of equity and humane administration.


56.     In light of the above, recording an adverse ACR during sanctioned

        leave especially without due communication cannot withstand legal

        scrutiny. It is not only administratively improper, but also vitiates the

        evaluation process, thereby compromising the employee's right to

        fair consideration in matters of promotion, postings, and other service

        benefits.



57.     Therefore, we hold that recording a "below average" ACR for the

        petitioner during her period of sanctioned medical leave for COVID-

        19, is patently unjustified, arbitrary, and legally unsustainable. The

        said adverse entry is liable to be set aside, and any reliance on it for

        denying her promotion, is illegal and vitiates the entire process of

        consideration.



        Issue no. IV, is decided accordingly.



CONCLUSION


58.     In light of the foregoing analysis, we find that the denial of

        promotion to the petitioner on the basis of uncommunicated adverse

        Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs), amounts to a gross violation of

        the principles of natural justice. It is a settled position in law that any

        material adverse to the interest of an employee, if relied upon to deny

        promotion or other career advancement must be duly communicated

        so as to enable the employee to make an effective representation. The

        failure of the respondents to communicate such ACRs deprived the
 24 | P a g e                                                   WP(C)323/2023




        petitioner of this vital procedural safeguard and renders the entire

        process unsustainable in law.



59.     Further, we hold that Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020,

        which imposes conditions materially affecting the service rights and

        legitimate expectations of employees, required proper publication,

        either in the Official Gazette or through another effective mode of

        communication.     In   the     absence   of   such    publication   or

        communication, the said order cannot be enforced against the

        petitioner. Administrative instructions that remain un-notified, cannot

        be used to alter the service conditions of employees to their

        detriment.



60.     The retrospective application of Executive Order No. 415, dated

        05.10.2020, to govern promotions for a period predating its issuance,

        is wholly untenable in law. It is a settled principle in service

        jurisprudence that administrative orders or executive instructions

        altering service conditions cannot operate retrospectively unless there

        is clear and express statutory sanction authorising such retrospective

        effect. In the present case, the respondents have sought to apply the

        newly introduced criterion of securing a minimum of 65% aggregate

        marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) to the petitioner's

        promotion assessment for the period 2017-2021. This approach is

        legally impermissible, as it imposes an additional eligibility condition

        for a period during which the petitioner had no notice or opportunity

        to meet such a requirement. The respondents' reliance on this

        uncommunicated and un-notified order to retrospectively deny the
 25 | P a g e                                                       WP(C)323/2023




        petitioner her due consideration for promotion, not only contravenes

        the principles of fairness and non-arbitrariness under 
Article 14
 of the

        Constitution but also prejudices her vested right to be assessed under

        the criteria that was in force during the relevant time.


61.     Further, the stand taken by the respondents that the criteria prescribed

        under executive order no.415 are intended to apply to non-gazetted

        staff, does not absolve them of their obligation to ensure wide

        publicity and due notification of the said order. The respondents were

        duty bound to notify all employees, including those to whom the

        rules would apply, so that they could be made aware of the

        applicability of the benchmark criteria. Mere internal application or

        selective enforcement cannot suffice to meet the requirement of

        transparency and procedural fairness.



62.      If the intention was to extend the applicability of the 65%

        benchmark, which was originally framed for gazetted officers, to

        non-gazetted staff as well, then the respondents ought to have either

        amended the relevant rules or issued a formal corrigendum clarifying

        the same. Only upon such due notification could employees be

        expected to make a conscious and informed effort to achieve the

        prescribed benchmark. Failure to do so renders the application of the

        criteria arbitrary and unsustainable in law.



63.     In the absence of any published notification or formal communication

        extending the applicability of the benchmark to non-gazetted

        employees, it is unreasonable to expect them to anticipate such

        standards or orient their performance accordingly. The retrospective
 26 | P a g e                                                     WP(C)323/2023




        application of the rule that was neither made known nor duly

        enforced is plainly contrary to law. It violates the principle of legal

        certainty, non-arbitrariness and 
article 14
 of the constitution.


64.     We are of the considered view that the respondents were legally

        bound to give vide publicity to the order if they intended to apply it to

        the non-gazetted employees. They cannot rely on internal decisions

        or informal practices when the consequences affect the service rights

        of individuals. Without proper publication, affected employees cannot

        be expected to follow or comply with such criteria.


65.     Critically, the recording of an adverse ACR for the year 2020 when

        the petitioner was on sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19

        pandemic, is patently arbitrary and unsupported by any material.

        Penalising an employee for a period of illness beyond her control,

        particularly during a global pandemic, violates not only established

        legal principles but also the broader tenets of fairness and equity in

        public employment.



66.     Judicial precedents lend unequivocal support to the petitioner's case.


        Courts have consistently held that uncommunicated adverse entries

        and unpublished administrative instructions cannot form the basis for

        adverse   decisions    affecting   employees' service       rights.   The

        petitioner's claim for promotion with retrospective effect from the

        date on which her juniors were promoted is, therefore, well founded

        and deserves to be upheld.



67.     In weighing the equities of the case, we are persuaded that the

        petitioner has suffered substantial prejudice due to administrative
 27 | P a g e                                                    WP(C)323/2023




        lapses, entirely beyond her control. Granting the relief sought would

        not only vindicate her individual rights but also affirm constitutional

        values of fairness, equality, and accountability in public service. It

        would serve as a necessary reminder to the executive of the

        importance of maintaining transparent and just administrative

        practices.



68.     Before parting, we direct the Registrar General of the High Court of

        J&K and Ladakh that if executive order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 is

        to be applied to the non-gazetted staff of the High Court, it shall be

        duly communicated, notified, and published through appropriate

        mode to ensure that all affected employees are given proper notice of

        its contents and implications and issue a formal notification applying

        executive order No. 415 to non-gazetted employees only after

        obtaining approval from Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court.

        The notification shall specifically mention the benchmark criteria and

        its effective date.



69.     Any attempt to enforce the said order without adherence to these

        procedural safeguards, shall render its application vulnerable to legal

        challenge.



70.     In view of the above findings, the writ petition is allowed and

        disposed of in the following manner :



                i)     Quashing the impugned order Annexure-ll rejecting

                       the petitioner's representation without assigning

                       any cogent reasons for such rejection.

               ii)     Quashing the impugned entry of "below average" in

                       the annual confidential report of the petitioner for

                       the year 2020.





71.     We further hold that the impugned action denying the petitioner's

        promotion cannot be sustained in law. Accordingly, the respondents

        are directed to accord consideration to the claim of petitioner for

        promotion to the post of Head Assistant with retrospective effect

        from the date her juniors were promoted i.e. 24.11.2022 as Head

        Assistant, and to grant her all consequential benefits of seniority and

        monetary in accordance with law without taking into consideration

        the adverse ACR of the year 2020.



72.     Disposed of.
