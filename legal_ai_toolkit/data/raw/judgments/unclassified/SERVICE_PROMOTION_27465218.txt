                        CMP(T) No.98 of 2023 in CWPOA No.5054 of

                        2019





                        By way of instant application, prayer has been





             made on behalf of the applicant-petitioner for issuance of

             direction to the non-applicants/respondents to promote her





             pursuant to recommendation of the DPC held on 19th June,

             2023 (Annexures R-3 &4) annexed with the reply to the

             application filed by the non-applicants/respondents.



                        Precisely, the grouse of the applicant-petitioner as

             has been highlighted in the application and further canvassed

             by Mr. Dilip Sharma, learned Senior counsel representing the

             applicant-petitioner, is that once perusal of meeting of DPC

             clearly reveals that promotion to the post of Reader-cum-



             Associate Professor was done on the basis of seniority list of

             Tutor issued in the year 2010, petitioner ought to have been

             promoted against the post in question alongwith other eligible





                                                ::: Downloaded on - 06/09/2023 21:46:13 :::CIS

     candidates. He submitted that bare perusal of proceedings of




                                                         .

    DPC suggests that though petitioner has been found to be





    eligible, but she is not being promoted for the reason that writ





    petition having been filed by her is pending adjudication. He

    further submitted that department being fully aware of the fact




                                 of
    that petitioner is fully eligible against the post in question

    though   has kept one post vacant, but petitioner have been

    denied promotion for her having filed writ petition, which is
               rt
    pending adjudication before this Court.



               Reply to the application stands filed on behalf of the

    non-applicants/respondents under the signature of Special


    Secretary (Health) to the Government of Himachal Pradesh,

    wherein it has been categorically admitted that petitioner




    herein is eligible to be promoted against the post in question in





    terms of the seniority of Sister Tutors issued in the year 2010,

    but since there is a   stay order passed by this Court in the





    petition at hand, she has been not promoted, but one post has

    been kept vacant.



               Having heard learned counsel for the parties and

    perused the material available on record, this Court finds that

    petitioner herein has approached this Court in the instant writ

    petition, laying therein challenge to the order of her reversion

    from the post of Lecturer to Sister tutor, but such order has

    been stayed, meaning thereby petitioner cannot be reverted

    from the post of Lecturer to Tutor, but definitely there is no

    stay with regard to further promotion, if any.             Since non-



    applicants/respondents themselves have admitted in the reply





                                        ::: Downloaded on - 06/09/2023 21:46:13 :::CIS

     that as per seniority list, 2010 petitioner is required to be




                                                          .

    promoted, their cannot be any justification to deny promotion





    to the petitioner at this stage on account of pendency of the





    petitioner, having been filed by the petitioner herein, which is

    subjudice before this Court.



                                   of
                   Consequently, in view of the above, the present

    application is allowed and respondent-Department is directed

    to promote the petitioner to the post of
               rt                                   Associate Professor

    pursuant to the recommendation of the DPC held on 19th June,

    2023, however, same shall be subject to outcome of the

    CWPOA No. 5346 of 2019. The application stands disposed of.



                      CWPOA No.5054 of 2019 with

                      CWPOA No.5346 of 2019

    parties are duly represented, let this case be listed for final





    hearing on 6.12.2023.
