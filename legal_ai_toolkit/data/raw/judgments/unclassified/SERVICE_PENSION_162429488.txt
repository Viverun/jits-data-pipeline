                                   JUDGMENT



1.    Vide the present petition, the petitioner seeks direction thereby

quashing and setting aside impugned orders dated 15.11.2017 and

13.09.2017. Consequently, declare the petitioner to be entitled to the benefit

of judgments in 
Government of Nct of Delhi and Ors. vs. All India Young

Lawyers Association (Registered) and another
: (
2009) 14 SCC 49 and P.

Ramakrishnam Raju vs. Union of India & Ors.
 decided in Supreme Court

in W.P.(C) 521/2002 and further direct the respondents to add ten years

practice of the petitioner as an Advocate at Bar, towards qualifying service.





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                  Page 1 of 30

 Consequently, revised the Pension and Gratuity of the petitioner and arrears

be calculated and disbursed to the petitioner by issuing of a revised PPO,

including incorporation of Family Pension.




2.    The brief facts of this case are that the petitioner is a Law Graduate

and was enrolled as an Advocate with Bar Counsel of Delhi on 12.10.1984.

The   petitioner    was   appointed   as   Member    (Judicial)    in    Central

Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench on 12.10.2000. At the time of

appointment, the petitioner was governed by CAT (Salaries and Allowances

and Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 1985. The petitioner was

treated at par with the Additional Secretary to the Government of India, but

in case of no express provision regarding conditions of service at par with

secretary to the Government of India. The formula for Pension on

completion of two years of service was at a rate of ₹4,716/- per annum for

each completed year of service and the Pension was fixed as per Part III of

Schedule of High Court Judges Conditions of Service Rules, 1954. The

Pension formula was amended on 22.07.2009 by replacement of per annum

amount for pension as ₹14,532/- per annum w.e.f. 01.01.2006. Copy of

Service Rules are at annexure P-3 (Colly).



3.    Further case of the petitioner is that he was initially appointed for a





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                 Page 2 of 30

 term of five years and was extended for another term of five years. The

petitioner demitted office on completion of his tenure on 10.12.2010. The

pension of the petitioner on the formula as per 2009 Rules was fixed as

₹12,110/- per month. 
In a PIL filed on behalf of the Bar regarding addition

of practice of ten years at Bar to the direct recruits to Delhi Higher Judicial

Service was laid at rest by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of 
All India

Young Lawyers Association
 (Supra) by holding that weightage of practice

at Bar while computing pension and other retiral benefits would attract the

best talent. Accordingly, ten years practice at Bar has been given weightage

to direct recruits in Judicial Service. In year 2006, an amendment was

carried out in 
A.T. Act, 1985
 effective from 19.02.2007, whereby the service

conditions of members of the Central Administrative Tribunal were brought

at par with that of High Court Judges.




4.    Mr. Shankar Raju, the petitioner in person submitted that the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in a Constitution Bench Judgment in L.Chandrakumar vs.

UOI: 1997 (3) SCC 261 held the status of Central Administrative Tribunal

as Court of first instance and also upheld the eligibility of an Advocate to be

appointed as Member (Judicial) to be same as eligibility to the High Court

Judge under 
Article 217
 of the Constitution of India. This qualification of





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 3 of 30

 ten years practice at Bar has not been altered as a qualification for a Member

(Judicial) under the 
A.T. Amended Act, 2006
 i.e., post 19.02.2007.


5.    The pension of a Member (Judicial), irrespective of the appointment

under Unamended or 
Amended A.T. Act, 1985
 is fixed on the basis of a

common formula i.e., 
Under Part III of First Schedule of High Court Judges

(Salaries & Conditions of Service) Act, 1954
. This has been admitted by the

DOPT in an information furnished to Ex-Judicial Member, CAT, Sh. J. K.

Kaushik on 08.04.2010 under 
RTI Act, 2005
 which is at Annexure P-5

(Colly). The petitioner demitted office on completion of tenure of ten years

on 10.12.2010. The pension was fixed on the basis of formula adopted by

the DOPT reckoning only ten years service of the petitioner. Before the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in various Writ Petitions including of 
P. Rama

Krishnam Raju
 (supra), a question as to addition of ten years practice for the

purposes of pension to the High Court Judges appointed from Bar was

deliberated and adjudicated.
 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court while discussing

various provisions of Conditions of Service also relied upon the decision in


All India Young Lawyer Association
 (Supra).
 
In this furtherance, the

Hon'ble Court discussed three tier judicial system under the Constitution

and discussed the case of Advocates, being Members of the Bar to join





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                               Page 4 of 30

 Higher Judicial Services and on retirement get benefit of ten years addition

to their service and observed the following in paras 19 and 24 of the

Judgment in 
P. Rama Krishna Raju
 (Supra):-




          "19) The Explanation (aa) appended to 
Article 217(2)
 of
          the Constitution of India envisages that, "in computing
          the period during which a person has been an advocate of
          a High Court, there shall be included any period during
          which the person has held judicial office or the officer of
          a member of a tribunal or any post, under the Union or a
          State, requiring special knowledge of law after he became
          an Advocate." The explanation thus treats the experience
          of an Advocate at the Bar and the period of judicial office
          held by him at par.

          24) when persons who occupied the Constitutional Office
          of Judge, High Court retire, there should not be any
          discrimination with regard to the fixation of their
          pension. Irrespective of the source from where the Judges
          are drawn, they must be paid the same pension just as
          they have been paid same salaries and allowances and
          perks as serving Judges. Only practicing Advocates who
          have attained eminence are invited to accept judgeship of
          the High Court. Because of the status of the office of High
          Court Judge, the responsibilities and duties attached to
          the office, hardly any advocates of distinction declines the
          offer. Though it may be a great financial sacrifice to a
          successful lawyer to accept Judgeship, it is the desire to
          serve the society and the high prestige attached to the
          office and the respect the office commands that propel a
          successful lawyer to accept judgeship. The experience
          and knowledge gained by a successful lawyer at the Bar
          can never be considered to be less important from any
          point of view vis-a-vis the experience gained by a judicial
          officer. If the service of a judicial officer is counter for
          fixation of pension, there is no valid reason as to why the
          experience at Bar cannot be treated as equivalent for the




W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 5 of 30

           same purpose.



6.    Mr. Raju, further submitted that though the issue pertain to Judges

appointed in High Court from the Bar, the Question of Law i.e., ratio

decidendi was regarding counting of service of a Judicial Officer appointed

on direct recruitment basis and counting of experience at Bar, being

equivalent was found to be discriminatory in violation of 
Article 14
 and 
16


of the constitution. The concept of One Rank One Pension was treated as a

must norm.



7.    The petitioner in person further submitted that the Central

Administrative Tribunal was constituted under 
Article 323A
 of the

Constitution of India. The eligibility of a Member (Judicial) appointed from

the Bar was Mutatis-Mutandis as laid down for High Court Judges under


Article 217
 of the Constitution of India. The DOPT vide communication

dated 12.11.2015 addressed to CAT regarding pensionary benefits to

Members (Judicial) coming from Bar, in the light of judgment of the

Hon'ble    Supreme Court consulted the Department of Expenditure and

Justice and forwarded comments to the CAT for furnishing requested

information. Copy of the communication is at Annexure P-7. The CAT

furnished information to the DOPT on 11.01.2016 inter alia, contending that





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                             Page 6 of 30

 prior to the amendment of the 
A.T. Act
, the pension was calculated under

CAT (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1985 and after the amendment, at par

with High Court Judges under Part III of the First Schedule of Act of 1954.

It was further informed that in 2009, 
CAT Act
 was further amended to raise

the amount of pension and recommended addition of ten years practice as

qualifying service, in case of Sh. N. Dharmadan, Retired Member (Judicial)

prior to 19.02.2007 vide Annexure P-8. The petitioner made a representation

to the DOPT on 15.02.2016 for fixation of pension reckoning Full Pension,

as per DOPT OM dated 10.12.2009 as per High Court judges Act, 1954 vide

Annexure P-9 (Colly). The petitioner, by way of a representation dated

07.03.2016 has sought extension of benefit of judgment in 
P. Rama Krishna

Raju and All India Young Lawyers Association
's case on various legal

grounds vide Annexure P-10. The Family Pension was introduced in CAT

and accordingly, a revised PPO was issued to the petitioner on 06.06.2016

vide Annexure P-11. It is further submitted that the CAT forwarded the

representation of Member (Judicial) appointed from Bar for addition of ten

years service as qualifying service to the DOPT. An information sought by

the petitioner under 
RTI Act, 2005
 divulged that a favourable note for

addition of ten years practice to the petitioner, being pre-appointee of





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                             Page 7 of 30

 19.02.2007 was sent to DOPT. Since matter pertaining to the same issue was

sub-judice, before Hon'ble Kerala High Court, the DOPT informed the

petitioner on 06.09.2016 that the matter is under consideration in

consultation with Departments of Justice & Expenditure. The above

documents are at Annexure P-12 (Colly).




8.      It is further submitted that Retired Member (Judicial) from Bar Sh. N.

Dharmadan filed W.P.(C) 30170/2014 before the Hon'ble High Court of

Kerala at Ernakulam. The said petition was disposed of vide order dated

26.10.2016 on the statement of Central Government that the grievance of the

petitioner therein, is being considered, to pass orders on the claim of the

petitioner and other similarly situated persons. The said order is at annexure

P-13.



9.      The CAT in various communications to the DOPT forwarded the

representation for Member (Judicial) appointed from Bar. DOPT vide its

communication dated 02.06.2017 asked for particulars of Member appointed

from Bar post 19.02.2007 only and this information was sent by the CAT,

including the name of the petitioner. A communication from CAT dated

10.07.2017 and 25.08.2017 included the name of the petitioner in the list on

the ground that though the DOPT has sought information regarding





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                               Page 8 of 30

 Members appointed from 19.02.2007 to 31.05.2017, but the petitioner is also

entitled to addition of ten years practice, as they are drawing Pension as per

High Court Judges (Service Condition) Rules. The copy of the above

referred documents are at Annexure P-14 (Colly).



10.   The petitioner with a reference to DOPT letter dated 23.08.2017,

whereby for addition of ten years service, only particulars of Members

appointed from Bar post 19.02.2007 were called from CAT, made a

representation to DOPT on 14.09.2017 taking number of legal grounds and

referring to the discrimination meted out to the petitioner vide Annexure

P-15. However, by an impugned order dated 13.09.2017 issued in reference

to Sh. N. Dharmadan pursuant upon the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of

Kerala to State that only Members who have been appointed from Bar on or

after 19.02.2007 are being considered for addition of ten years practice for

pension, pursuant upon judgment of the Supreme Court.


11.   The petitioner submitted that it was on an irrational and arbitrary

ground that the petitioner and other identical situated were appointed as

Judicial (Member) under the Conditions of Service of 1985 and those

Members appointed post 19.02.2007 had service conditions at par with High

Court Judge. In this decision, the DOPT has violated 
Article 14
 of the





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                               Page 9 of 30

 Constitution of India and in oblivion of the fact that the petitioner's Pension

was also determined under High Court Rules and that addition of ten years

practice has nothing to do that High Court Judge or Conditions of Service.

The discriminatory attitude and misinterpretation of judgment of Hon'ble

Supreme Court resulted in denial of Fundamental Right of the petitioner.

Copy of the impugned order is at Annexure P-2.



12.   The petitioner further submitted that by another impugned

communication/order addressed to Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)

by DOPT dated 15.11.2017, the earlier stand taken in order dated 13.9.2017

has been reiterated and only 17 members (Judicial) appointed from bar, post

19.2.2007 have been made entitled to the benefit vide Annexure P-1.


13.   The petitioner pursuant upon decision of the DOPT dated 15.11.2017

made a representation for reconsideration of the issue vide representation

dated 8.1.2018 which is at Annexure P-16. The said representation was

favorably recommended by the CAT to the DOPT to take a decision vide

communication dated 17.1.2018 vide Annexure P-17.



14.   It is further submitted by the petitioner that in the relevant truncated


High Court Judges, Conditions of Service Act, 1954
, whereby in First

Schedule Part III, the formula for determination of Pension meant for High





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 10 of 30

 Court Judges is mutatis mutandis adopted by DOPT for fixing and revising

the pension of the petitioner which is at Annexure P-18.


15.   Pursuant upon the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in


Ramakrishnam Raju vs. Union of India
: 2014 (2) KLT 218 (Supra), an

amendment has been carried out in the 
High Court Judges Act
, whereby in

Schedule I part III, the minimum pension has undergone and upward

revision to ₹45,016/- per completed year of service. The petitioner made a

representation to the CAT for revising the pension of the petitioner in

accordance with the amendment, which is pending implementation. The

copy and Notification and request of the petitioner is at Annexure P-19

(Colly).




16.   The petitioner further submitted that right to pension is a fundamental

right of the petitioner under the Constitution of India. Above all, entitlement

for correct and appropriate pension without any discrimination is also an

important legal right of the petitioner. The respondents have misinterpreted

and misunderstood the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
P

Ramakrishnam Raju
 (Supra). The respondents have taken the ratio of this

judgment as to applicability only to High Court Judges.                 In this

misconceived stand, the respondents have taken stand that Judicial Members





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 11 of 30

 appointed from Bar, post 19.2.2007 are entitled for addition of ten years

practice towards qualifying service. It is pertinent to note that after

19.2.2007, the service conditions of a member was brought at par with a

High Court Judge. However the amendment has not bestowed a status of

High Court Judge to the Judicial Members appointed on or after 19.2.2007.


17.   In this view of the matter, if the interpretation and understanding of

DOPT is accepted, then even the Judicial Members appointed after

19.2.2007 are not entitled to count ten years practice as they are not High

Court Judges. What went in oblivion of DOPT is a fact that the question of

law decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court was not directed towards only

High Court Judges, but has uniform and universal application to an advocate

appointed on a judicial post directly with more than ten years practice at

Bar. Accordingly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has referred to the decision

pertaining to higher judiciary in the judgment of P Ramakrishnam Raju.

What is required for addition of ten years practice to a Member (Judicial)

appointed on direct recruitment basis towards qualifying service is that he

should have been appointed on a judicial post. In fact, there is virtually no

difference between a member (Judicial) appointed from Bar pre or post

19.2.2007. Both categories hold a judicial post of court of first instance





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                              Page 12 of 30

 under the constitution of India. The eligibility conditions for appointment

are identical. The pension of pre 19.2.2007 appointee Member (Judicial)

from bar is fixed under 
High Court Act
 and Rules.



18.   It is further submitted that the judgment in P Ramakrkrishnam Raju

has laid down the ratio decidendi to the above effect.       However, the

respondents in understanding the judgment arbitrarily discriminated the

petitioner on the facts of the case by misconstruing it in oblivion of

judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
L Chandrakumar and All India

Young Lawyers Association
 (Supra). This has prejudiced the petitioner and

deprived him of Rightful Pension as compared to post 19.2.2007 appointees.

Thus, the present petition deserves to be allowed.




19.   On the other hand, Mr. Abhay Prakash, learned standing counsel for

the Central Government submitted that the conditions of service of

Chairmen and members of CAT were made equivalent to those applicable to

Judges of the High Court pursuant to the amendment Act, 2006. Provisions

of said amendment Act of 2006 came into force with effect from 19.2.2007.

Before this amendment of 2006, the conditions of service of the Chairmen

and members were regulated by the CAT (Service and allowances and

conditions of service and chairman, vice chairman and members), Rules,





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                             Page 13 of 30

 1985. The conditions of service of Chairman and Members of the Central

Administrative Tribunal (CAT) have been amended and made equivalent to

those applicable to Central Group A officers, under 
Finance Act, 2017
 and

under the new rules notified on 1.6.2017 are under judicial review before the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.



20.    Pursuant to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in WP (C)

No. 521/2002 for reckoning 10 years' practice as an advocate for qualifying

service for pensions of Judges of High Courts elevated from the Bar, the

respondents have received representations from Judicial Members of CAT

(appointed from Bar), with a request to grant similar benefits as they have

also been practicing as an Advocate before the appointment to the post of

Judicial Members in CAT and their service conditions were the same as

applicable to Judges of the High Court.



21.   Learned counsel further submitted that the matter was considered by

the respondents in consultation with the Department of Legal Affairs and

Department of Expenditure. As per rules dated 1.6.2017, service conditions

of the Chairman and Members of CAT were amended and the conditions as

applicable to Central Group A officers were made applicable to the

Chairman and Members of CAT.





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                              Page 14 of 30


 22.   Therefore, in the light of the Supreme Court's order in P

Ramakrishna Raju vs. UOI & Ors. (Supra), it was decided that only those

Judicial Members of CAT, who were appointed from Bar between 19.2.2007

to 31.5.2017, are to be considered eligible for grant of pensionary benefits.


23.   Accordingly, the Judicial Members including the applicant, (petitioner

herein), who was appointed before 19.2.2007 and therefore, are covered by

the Central Administrative Tribunal (Salaries and Allowances and

Conditions of Service of Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Members) Rules,

1985 were intimated of the respondent's decision. The true copy of the

intimation to the Judicial Members is annexed as Annexure A-1.


24.   Accordingly, the present petition deserves to be dismissed.


25.   I have heard learned counsel for the parties.



26.   The pension payable to the Members of CAT is linked with the

Pension of High Court Judges under Part III of 1 st 
Schedule of High Court

Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954
. Since the status of

the Member (Judicial) appointed before 19.02.2007 is equal to the

Additional Secretary to the Government of India, the Pension is to be fixed

proportionally to the Pension per annum payable to the Judge of High Court

under Part III of Schedule 1. This fact has been admitted by the DOPT while





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 15 of 30

 answering information sought by Ex-Member (Judicial) Sh. J.K.Kaushik

under 
RTI Act, 2005
 on 8.4.2010.



27.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the case of a direct

recruit to Delhi Higher Judicial Service in 
All India Young Lawyers

Association
 Case referred to in 
Ramakrishnam Raju
's case, held that 10

years practice at the Bar should be added for computing Pension. The said

case did not pertain to a High Court Judge, but concerned higher judicial

services at District Judge level.
 
The Supreme Court in a subsequent

judgement of 
P. Ramakrishnam Raju
 (Supra) upheld and reiterated the

judgement in All India Young Lawyers Association and directed addition of

10 years service in view of Part I and III of the Judges conditions of service

by holding as under:




       "25) The fixation of higher pension to the Judges drawn from the
      Subordinate Judiciary who have served for shorter period in
      contradistinction to Judges drawn from the Bar who have served
      for longer period with less pension is highly discriminatory and
      breach of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution. The classification itself is
      unreasonable without any legally acceptable nexus with the object
      sought to be achieved.



      26) The meager pension for Judges drawn from the Bar and
      served for less than 12 years on the Bench adversely affects the
      image of the Judiciary. When pensions are meager because of the
      shorter service, lawyers who attain distinction in the profession
      may not, because of this anomaly, accept the office of Judgeship.

      When capable lawyers do not show inclination towards Judgeship,




W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 16 of 30

       the quality of justice declines.



      27) In most of the States, the Judgeship of the High Court is
      offered to advocates who are in the age group of 50-55 years,
      since pre-eminence at the Bar is achieved normally at that age.
      After remaining at the top for a few years, a successful lawyer
      may show inclination to accept Judgeship, since that is the
      culmination of the desire and objective of most of the lawyers.
      When persons holding constitutional office retire from service,
      making discrimination in the fixation of their pensions depending
      upon the source from which they were appointed is in breach of
      
Articles 14
 and 
16(1)
 of the Constitution. One rank one pension
      must be the norm in respect of a Constitutional Office.


      28) When a Civil Servant retires from service, the family pension
      is fixed at a higher rate whereas in the case of Judges of the High
      Court, it is fixed at a lower rate. No discrimination can be made in
      the matter of payment of family pension. The expenditure for
      pension to the High Court Judges is charged on the Consolidated
      Fund of India under 
Article 112(3)(d)(iii)
 of the Constitution."


28.   The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in L.

Chandrakumar Vs. UOI & Ors.: 1997 (3) SCC 261 regarding status of the

Central Administrative Tribunal observed as under:



          "99. In view of the reasoning adopted by us, we hold
          that Clause 2(d) of 
Article 323A
 and Clause 3(d) of
          
Article 323B
, to the extent they exclude the jurisdiction of
          the High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles
          226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are unconstitutional.
          
Section 28
 of the Act and the "exclusion of jurisdiction"

          clauses in all other legislations enacted under the aegis
          of 
Articles 323A
 and 
323B
 would, to the same extent, be
          unconstitutional. The jurisdiction conferred upon the
          High Courts under Articles 226/227 and upon the
          Supreme Court under 
Article 32
 of the Constitution is

           part of the inviolable basic structure of our Constitution.
          While this jurisdiction cannot be ousted, other courts and
          Tribunals may perform a supplemental role in
          discharging the powers conferred by Articles 226/227
          and 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals created under
          
Article 323A
 and 
Article 323B
 of the Constitution are
          possessed of the competence to test the constitutional
          validity of statutory provisions and rules. All decisions of
          these Tribunals will, however, be subject to scrutiny
          before a Division Bench of the High Court within whose
          jurisdiction the concerned Tribunal falls. The Tribunals
          will, nevertheless, continue to act like Courts of first
          instance in respect of the areas of law for which they
          have been constituted. It will not, therefore, be open for
          litigants to directly approach the High Courts even in
          cases where they question the vires of statutory
          legislations (except where the legislation which creates
          the particular Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the
          jurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal. 
Section 5(6)
 of the
          Act is valid and constitutional and is to be interpreted in
          the manner we have indicated."



29.   The above observations clearly establishes that, the Central

Administrative Tribunal has been a creation under 
Articles 323-A
 and 
323-B


of the Constitution of India. The Tribunal has been treated as a Court of First

Instance in respect of Service Law. Moreover, the Tribunal has not been

considered as a subordinate Court under the Jurisdiction of High Court as

provided under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India. The High Court has

no power of superintendence over the Tribunal, but the jurisdiction of

scrutiny has been allowed. Thus, the Tribunal has been treated mutatis





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 18 of 30

 mutandis a District Court for the purposes of dispensation of justice as Court

of First Instance though, the Tribunal has been treated at par with the High

Court.



30.          Accordingly, as per 
Section 6
 of A.T.Act, 1985 as amended till

date, the qualification for appointment of a Judicial Member is sina qua non

of qualification of a Judge of a High Court laid down under 
Article 217
 of

the Constitution of India. All Members (Judicial) appointed from the Bar are

eligible to be appointed as High Court Judges. Irrespective of the

amendment of A.T.Act 1985 in 2006 w.e.f. 19.02.2007, the qualification for

a Judge of the High Court has not been altered. 
In such view of the matter,

the observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramakrishnam Raju's

case (supra) with a reference to the judgement in 
All India Young Lawyers

Association
's case makes alternatively, a Judicial member appointed prior to

19.02.2007 at par with a District Judge as the CAT being treated as Court of

First Instance. Addition of ten years of practice to such Member as an

Advocate, towards qualifying service, is also admissible to these Members.


The stand of the DOPT contained in their communication dated 23.08.2017

to restrict the addition of ten years practice to only those Members (Judicial)

appointed from Bar w.e.f. 19.902.2007 is without any logic, rationale and is





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 19 of 30

 rather goes against the dicta in 
Ramakrishnam Raju
's case. The stand

brings inequality among equals and amounts to hostile discrimination

violative of 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution of India. The purported

stand of DOPT appears to be cantered around amendment of A.T.Act, 1985

w.e.f. 19.02.2007 by which, the conditions of service of Member (Judicial)

has been treated at par with a High Court Judge. However, the fact remains

that Judicial Members appointed from the Bar are not High Court Judges

but, by virtue of similarity in Service Conditions, are treated at par with the

High Court Judges. This analogy is palpably arbitrary and promotes

discrimination on the basis of cut-off date of 19.2.2007 without any

reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In fact, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court both in the case of subordinate Judiciary and High Court

Judges, directed addition of ten years practice of an officer appointed from

the Bar towards qualifying service computation of Pension on the ground

that, the maximum age for an entry in service is 45 years and since the

retirement age is 60 years, the incumbent would not be able to get Pension.

The service of a Judicial Member appointed from Bar could not exceed 10

years both under Old and New A.T. Act.
 
In such an event, the benefit of

maximum pension is denied and accordingly, the addition of 10 years





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 20 of 30

 practice to a direct recruit Advocate as Judicial Member in the Tribunal

towards qualifying service of pension is implied and is a discerned principle

on the basis of Ratio decidendi of Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
P.

Ramakrishnam Raju
's case.




31.          Accordingly, the DOPT has to follow the dicta of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. The judgement in 
Ramakrishnam Raju
's case cannot be

interpreted otherwise. The Ratio decidendi is to give added year of

qualifying service of 10 years to an Advocate, as his practice on his being

appointed to a subordinate higher judiciary or High Court. Since the

Members (Judicial) appointed prior to 19.02.2007 fulfil the above criteria

and in all respects including eligibility, discharge of functions and duties are

at par with the Judicial Members appointed post 19.2.2007, no hostility or

invidious discrimination could be meted out to them. In such view of the

matter, the communication of DOPT dated 23.08.2017 does not stand

scrutiny of law and is rather in violation of 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the

Constitution of India.




32.   The RTI received by the petitioner also disclosed a communication

dated 11.1.2016 sent by the Principal Bench of the Tribunal to the DOPT

regarding pensionary benefits to the Judicial members of CAT coming from





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                 Page 21 of 30

 Bar, in the backdrop of judgment in P.Ramakrishnam Raju. In this

information, the CAT has referred to an amendment under Rule 8 of the

CAT (Salaries & Allowances) Rules, amended on 22.7.2009. In this

amendment, there has been a substitution in Sub-Rule 2 of Rule A whereby,

the minimum pension has been increased from ₹7,074/- per annum to

₹14,532/- per annum w.e.f. 1.1.2006.



33.   It is pertinent to mention here that, the pension is at par with pension

of High Court judges' payable under Part III of 1st Schedule under High

Court Judges Service Conditions Act of 1954. This shows that, the Judicial

Members from Bar appointed prior to 19.2.2007 are also entitled to the same

pension.



34.   It is further pertinent to mention here that an order dated 15.11.2017

addressed to the Joint Registrar, CAT by the DOPT, a reference has been

made to 
Section 8(3)
 of A.T. Amendment Act 2006 to contend that

conditions of service of Members appointed post 19.2.2007 shall be at par

with High Court Judges. It was further stated that 17 Members appointed

post 19.2.2007 being eligible are being considered for benefit of addition of

10 years practice as qualifying service, as per the judgement of Hon'ble

Supreme Court 
referred above
. In this communication, CAT, Principal





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                               Page 22 of 30

 Bench has been requested to redress the representation received on the

subject which also includes the representation of the petitioner. 
The stand

taken by the DOPT in its communication dated 15.11.2017 as to non-

applicability of judgement in 
P. Ramakrishnam Raju
 (supra) is both

factually and legally incorrect. The DOPT consistently in response to an

information sought by former Member (Judicial) Sh. J.K. Kaushik, vide its

communications dated 28.1.2010, 4.3.2010 and 8.4.2010 have accepted that

the pension payable to the Members of CAT appointed before 19.2.2007 has

been in proportion to the pension per annum payable to a Judge of High

Court and also that the pension payable to the Members of CAT is being

linked with the pension of High Court Judges payable under the provisions

of 
Par III of First Schedule of the High Court Judges (Salaries & Conditions

of Service) Act, 1954
. It was also admitted that as per the above provisions

of the 
High Court Act
, the pension of Members of CAT appointed before

19.2.2007 has been revised from ₹7,074/- to ₹14,032/- w.e.f. 1.1.2006.


35.   Pursuant upon judgment of Ramakrishnam Raju, representation has

been made by the petitioner to the Tribunal as well as DOPT for addition of

10 years practice as qualifying service and grant of revised pension and

arrears of retiral benefits w.e.f. 1.1.2011. The CAT has taken up the cases of





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                               Page 23 of 30

 Members, including the petitioner with the DOPT for addition of 10 years

practice for pension vide communication dated 10.07.2017. A letter from

DOPT dated 23.8.2017 called for only particulars of Members appointed

from 19.2.2007 to 31.5.2017 for extending the benefit of judgment of

Supreme Court. The Principal Bench of CAT in its communication dated

25.8.2017 addressed to DOPT also recommended for incorporation of the

name of the petitioner and other similarly situated, for extending the benefit

of Hon'ble Supreme Court judgments by addition of 10 years practice

towards qualifying service. 
In this communication, the Ld. Tribunal had

written that the petitioner and others are also entitled to the benefit of

judgment of 
P. Ramakrishnam Raju
 (supra), as they are entitled to draw

pension as per 
High Court Judges Act
. However, the DOPT did not consider

its earlier stand treating the Judicial Member appointed from Bar at par with

Members appointed post 19.2.2007 for the purpose of calculation and

drawal of Pension, in accordance with High Court Judges conditions of

service. In this furtherance, the latest communication of DOPT dated

15.11.2017 addressed to the petitioner and also Principal Bench is silent and

there has been no consideration thereof, of the aforesaid fact.


36.   It is pertinent to mention here that Unamended A.T.Act prior to 2006





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                 Page 24 of 30

 and also post 2006 does not discriminate between the members Judicial

appointed from the Bar, as the eligibility qualifications are identical i.e. 10

years practice as an Advocate. Moreover, in the judgment of P.

Ramakrishnam Raju (surpa), the issue as 
laid down by
 way of ratio

decidendi is that the service of a Judicial Officer is to be counted for fixation

of pension and there was no valid reason as to why the experience at Bar

cannot be treated as equivalent for that purpose. In this furtherance, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court not only allowed addition of 10 years practice for

an Advocate appointed from the Bar on a judicial post as qualifying service

for determination of pension, but also applied uniformly to an Additional

District Judge, High Court Judge as well as Supreme Court Judge. The

petitioner being an appointee, even before 19.2.2007 was an Advocate with

10 years practice at Bar and was appointed on a judicial post under 
Article

323A
 of the Constitution of India. Thus, the stand taken by the DOPT in its

communication dated 15.11.2007 is without consideration of the above facts

and documentary proof and admissions. Mere reliance on Clause 8(3) of


A.T. Amended Act, 2006
 in inconsequential.




37.   The stand of the respondent DOPT is that only those advocates who

have been appointed under the 
AT Act
 of 2006 post 19.2.2007 are only





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                  Page 25 of 30

 entitled to addition of 10 years Bar practice for pension, is a misconceived

misinterpretation of the judgment of Supreme Court in 
P. Ramakrishnam

Raju
 (supra).
 
In 
the said judgment
 another judgement of the Supreme Court

pertaining to District Judges appointed from Bar in Delhi was also involved,

titled 
Govt. of NCT of Delhi Vs. All India Young Lawyer Association
,

whereby a claim for addition of 15 years service was sought for pension by

the District Judges. The Supreme Court in P. Ramakrishnam Raju taking

the logic that the lawyers directly appointed to judicial post from Bar have

few years in judiciary as such the calculated pension is too meagre,

accordingly maximum of 10 years the practice at Bar has been added to as

qualifying service for pension to the District Judges appointed from Bar. In

compliance of the judgement, the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules 1970

under Rule 26B proviso by an amendment dated 6.11.2009 effective from

24.2.2006, allowed addition of 10 years practice at Bar as qualifying service

for pension.




38.   It is also observed by the Supreme Court in 
P. Ramakrishnam Raju


(supra) that in the three-tier judicial system provided by the Constitution,

members of the Bar, who join the Higher Judicial Service at the District

Judges level, on retirement, get the befit of 10 years addition to their service





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                 Page 26 of 30

 of the purposes of pension (Rule 26B of the DHJS Rules). Judges of the

Supreme Court, who are appointed from the Bar given a period of 10 years

to their service for the purposes of pension (
Section 13A
 of the Amendment

Act, 2005). However, the benefit of 10 years addition to their service for the

purposes of pension is being denied to the Judges of the High Court

appointed from the Bar, which is arbitrary and violative of 
Article 14
 of the

Constitution of India.




39.   The Explanation (aa) appended to 
Article 217 (2)
 of the Constitution

of India envisages that, "in computing the period during which a person has

been an advocate of a High Court, there shall be included any period during

which the person has held judicial office or the office of a member of a

tribunal or any post, under the Union or State, requiring special knowledge

of law after he became an advocate." Thus, treats the experience of an

Advocate at the Bar the period of judicial office held by him at par.


40.   The above ratio of the Supreme Court is clear that the Principle

enunciated to count 10 years Bar practice of an advocate has not been

restricted to only High Court Judges but is applicable qua an advocate

having 10 years practice appointed on direct recruitment basis to a Judicial

Post. Once it includes the post of ADJ, it cannot exclude the Judicial





W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                Page 27 of 30

 Members appointed from the Bar in the tribunal even before 19.2.2007. This

cut off date has no reasonable nexus with the object of redeeming an

advocate a right of respectable pension in case of less service by addition of

10 years practice at bar as a qualifying service.



41.   A similar issue came before High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in

WP(C) No. 32047 of 2017 in case of 
N. Dharmadan v. Union of India and

Ors.
 decided on 5.4.2018 whereby the above mentioned High Court has held

as under:




 
"9. The question to be considered is whether there can be
            a classification between the members for the purpose of
            pension reckoning the bar service. It is settled law in the
            light of 
D.S.Nakara v. Union of India
 [AIR 1982 SC 130]
            that there cannot be any invidious classification, on the
            basis of a cut off date. Though the Rules were applicable
            at the time of the appointment of the petitioner and till his
            demitting of office, the qualification prescribed for
            appointment of judicial member continues to be the same
            ever since the administrative Tribunals were established
            under the 1985 Act.
 Section 10 A cannot stand in the way
            of extending the benefit of the judgment in Ramakrishna
            Raju's case. The insertion of Section 10A can only be to
            protect the service conditions of those who were
            appointed before the insertion. It cannot be interpreted to
            deny a benefit which is available to the Members who got
            appointment from the bar as in the case of High Court
            Judges. Even though the salary was prescribed as per
            different rules the petitioner continues to get the pension
            and pensionary benefits as applicable to High Court
            Judges. In the case of applicability of the judgment in
            Ramakrishna Raju's case when all the High Court Judges




W.P.(C) 3223/2018                                                   Page 28 of 30

           are eligible to get their pension fixed from 1.4.2004, it
          cannot be said that that benefit cannot be extended in the
          case of the petitioner just because he happened to be
          appointed before 19.2.2007. The cut off date fixed for the
          purpose of the extension of the benefit of the judgment is
          therefore unreasonable and arbitrary."



42.   Accordingly, in view of the above discussion and the settled legal

position impugned orders dated 15.11.2017 (Annexure P-1) dated

13.09.2018 (Annexure P-2) are hereby set aside. Consequently, it is declared

that the petitioner is entitled to get 10 years of his Bar practice along with

his service as Judicial Member for the purpose of pension, as in the case of

those Judicial Members appointed after 19.2.2007 and in case of High Court

Judges. Consequently, the respondents are directed to add 10 years practice

of the petitioner as an Advocate at Bar towards qualifying service and

consequently revise the pension and gratuity of the petitioner and arrears to

be calculated and disbursed to the petitioner by issuing of a revised PPO

including incorporation of pension. The respondent shall take steps to revise

the pension due to the petitioner within two months.



43.   The writ petition is, accordingly, allowed.
