                          This Civil Revision Petition is filed under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution

                of India, seeking to set aside (i) the ex parte decree dated 29.09.2023 passed in

                O.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the learned District Munsif, Pennagaram and

                          2.0 The brief facts leading to the filing of this Civil Revision Petition are

                as follows:



                          2.1 The 2nd respondent-A.Madhu purchased a property measuring an

                extent of 1.99 Acres of land comprised in S.NO.679/1 situated at Sunjalnatham

                village, by virtue of sale deed dated 27.03.1987 vide Doc.No.346 of 1987; so

                S.No.679/4 at Sunjalnatham village by virtue of registered sale deed dated

                18.01.1991 vide Doc. No.17 of 1991. After having purchased, on 26.07.2013,

                Acres of land comprised in S.No.679/8B; 1.99 Acres of land comprised in

                S.No.679/1 and 0.42 cents of land comprised in S.No.679/4 situated at

                Sunjalnatham village to one D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy

                vide Doc.No.361 of 2013. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu, the

                original owner executed a rectification deed dated 31.08.2015 vide Doc.



                No.3035/2015 in favour of the said D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and

                P.K.Duraisamy to rectify the mistake in respect of the survey number for 1.36

                acres of land. According to the rectification deed, instead of S.NO.679/8A, it

                was wrongly typed out as S.No.679/8B.



                          2.2 Thereafter, one I.Veerasamy, a practising Advocate as plaintiff, filed

                a suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 against his own brother-A.Madhu, the

                2nd respondent herein, and his other family members for partition and also for a

                declaration, declaring the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by the

                2nd respondent in favour of D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy as

                null and void and for permanent injunction which suit was taken on file as O.S.

                No. 21 of 2020.



                          2.3 In the said suit, an interim application was filed by Advocate Mr. I.

                Veerasamy, which was numbered as I.A. No. 131 of 2021, seeking an order of

                interim injunction. The above-said application was heard and dismissed by the

                District Munsif by order dated 29.10.2021 on merits. Pursuant to the dismissal

                of the interim application for ad-interim injunction, Advocate Mr. I.

                Veerasamy, who was the plaintiff in the suit in O.S.No.21 of 2020 and also

                appeared in person, filed a memo dated 15.11.2021 seeking leave of the Court

                to withdraw the suit in O.S.No.21 of 2020. The learned District Munsif,

                acceding to the request of the plaintiff-Advocate-I.Veerasamy, dismissed the

                suit in O.S.No.21 of 2020 as not pressed.



                          2.4 While so, D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy, who

                originally purchased the properties described in the suit schedule measuring an

                extent of 1.30 acres of land in S.No.679/8A; 1.99 Acres of land in S.No.679/1

                and 42 cents of land in S.No.679/4 after having retained 0.06 cents in

                S.No.679/8A by way of sale deed dated 13.12.2021 vide Doc.No.5687 of 2021

                from the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu, in turn, sold the same on 13.12.2021 to the

                revision petitioners by virtue of a registered sale deed bearing Document No.

                5687 of 2021.        Pursuant to the said purchase, the revenue records were

                mutated in their name.



                          2.5 When the matter stood thus, Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein

                engaged Mr. I. Veerasamy, Advocate, to file a suit for specific performance

                against the 2nd respondent in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned

                District Munsif, Pennagaram, based on a bogus and fraudulent agreement of

                sale said to have been executed on 05.05.2011. The said suit was filed on

                09.03.2023 by Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein against the 2nd respondent-

                A.Madhu (who was arrayed as 1st defendant in the suit) and 4 others. The 2nd

                respondent - A.Madhu who was the 1st defendant in the suit had conveniently

                remained ex parte in the said suit, and let the suit decreed ex parte on

                29.09.2023. Thereafter, the 1st respondent—Ganesan filed an execution

                petition, and pursuant to the orders passed therein, a sale deed was executed in

                his favour through the executing court, based on the ex parte decree obtained in

                O.S. No. 16 of 2023.



                          2.6 According to the revision petitioners, the decree obtained in

                O.S.NO.16 of 2023 was nothing but an outcome of fraud and collusion between

                the 1strespondent’s Advocate - I.Veerasamy who was plaintiff in O.S.No.21 of

                2020 on the file of the learned District Munsif, Pennagaram and incidentally, he

                was the Advocate who represented the plaintiff-Ganesan in the in the suit in


                O.S.No.16 of 2023, the 1st respondent herein.



                          2.7 The vendors of the revision petitioners lawfully purchased the

                property on 26.07.2013 under a registered sale deed, which is duly recorded in

                the encumbrance register maintained by the Registration Department.


                          2.8 The suit for specific performance was filed at the instance of Mr. I.

                                                                                              C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                Veerasamy, Advocate, who is the mastermind behind the creation of the alleged

                sale agreement dated 05.05.2011. The 1st respondent was only a name lender.

                Hence, the decree dated 29.09.2023 passed in O.S. No.16 of 2023 on the file of

                the learned District Munsif, Pennagaram is nothing but a product of fraud and is

                a nullity in the eyes of law. As the decree was obtained by practising fraud upon

                the Court, it is rendered void ab initio and can be challenged under 
Article 227


                of the Constitution of India. The learned counsel for the revision petitioners

                submitted that it is highly improbable for a person, who had allegedly entered

                into an agreement for sale in the year 2011, to remain silent for more than

                twelve years and then abruptly file a suit for specific performance in the year

                2023. Such prolonged and unexplained inaction, according to the learned

                counsel, raises grave doubts about the authenticity of the alleged agreement. It

                is further contended that the said agreement appears to have been fabricated

                solely with the intention of defeating and nullifying the valid sale deed already

                executed by A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent herein who is the brother of

                Advocate – I.Veerasamy in favour of D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and

                P.K.Duraisamy.





                          3. This court has heard Mr.N.Manokaran, learned counsel for the revision

                petitioners,      Mr.S.Mukunth,       learned         senior        counsel   on    behalf      of

                                                                                                C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                Mr.R.Vasudevan,          counsel      on      record        for     the   1st   respondent      and

                Mr.T.Arunkumar, learned Additional Government Pleader for the 2nd

                respondent.



                          4.1 The learned counsel for the revision petitioners summarised the

                background of the facts leading to the filing of the revisionpetition in detail

                which read as follows:



                                  (i) Earlier, one Advocate, I. Veerasamy, a practising Advocate,

                instituted a suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 against his brother, the 2nd respondent,

                A. Madhu (2nd defendant), mother Kunjammal and other family members,

                besides the District Collector, Pennagaram, and a few other officials of the

                Registration, Revenue, and Survey Departments, a decree and judgement for

                partition of the family properties; a declaration declaring that the sale deed

                executed in favour of defendants 7 and 8 as null and void; a permanent

                injunction and for mesne profits.



                                  (ii) Along with the suit, Advocate I. Veerasamy, who was the

                plaintiff in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, also filed an application for interim injunction.



                However, the trial court, by a reasoned order dated 29.10.2021 in I.A. No. 131

                of 2021, dismissed the said application on merits. Subsequently, the plaintiff—

                Advocate I. Veerasamy, chose to withdraw the entire suit.


                                  (iii) Thereafter, the very same Advocate filed another suit, which

                7 of 40



https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                 ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )

                                                                                        C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                was taken on file as O.S. No. 16 of 2023, this time in the name of the 1st

                respondent herein – Ganesan, seeking specific performance of an agreement

                allegedly dated 05.05.2011.



                                  (iv) The very nature of the non-judicial stamp paper used for

                engrossment of the alleged agreement of sale would sufficiently indicate that it

                was created solely for the purpose of fabricating an agreement of sale. The

                appropriate stamp duty for engrossing an agreement of sale is twenty rupees, as

                prescribed under 
Article 5(j)
 of the 
Schedule to the Indian Stamp Act
, as

                amended by the Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 2001. However, in the present case, the

                alleged agreement has been engrossed on a non-judicial stamp paper of only ten

                rupees, which is insufficient and improper for such a document. This

                discrepancy, according to the learned counsel, categorically establish that the

                agreement was not executed contemporaneously in 2011 as claimed, but was

                instead created later to suit the convenience of the first respondent.


                                  (v) The very same Advocate — Mr. I. Veerasamy — who had

                earlier instituted a comprehensive suit seeking a judgment and decree for

                partition of the suit properties into six equal shares, allotment of one such share

                to the plaintiff, and for separate possession, had also sought a declaration that

                defendants 7, 8, and 9 was fraudulent, dishonest, null and void. In addition, he

                prayed for a permanent injunction restraining defendants 7 and 8 from entering

                upon or encroaching upon the suit properties and from measuring the same, as

                well as an enquiry into mesne profits. It is this very same Advocate who has

                now filed the present suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, seeking specific performance

                on the basis of an alleged agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, thereby giving

                rise to serious concerns regarding the bona fides and consistency of the legal

                claims advanced. However, in doing so, the said Advocate has deliberately

                failed to implead the purchasers of the property,who are necessary parties to the

                suit. Instead, Mr. I. Periyasamy, who instituted the suit on behalf of Ganesan,

                the 1st respondent herein, chose to implead his own brother, Mr. A. Madhu, and

                four public officials including those from the Registration Department and the

                District Collector, Dharmapuri, without impleading the actual purchasers, who

                are just and necessary parties to the suit.



                          (vi) Such selective impleadment, omitting necessary parties without

                whom the matter could not have been adjudicated effectively, enabled the 1st

                respondent to obtain an ex parte decree. This sequence of events, coupled with

                the procedural omissions, would clearly establish that the decree was obtained

                by playing fraud upon the Court.

                          (vii) Advocate I. Veerasamy, as plaintiff, filed a suit in the year 2020,

                which was taken on file as O.S. No. 21 of 2020 on the file of the learned

                District Munsif, Pennagaram, seeking partition and other reliefs. In that suit, he

                was fully aware of the earlier sale transaction and, in fact, specifically sought a

                declaration that the sale deed dated 26.07.2013, executed by the 2nd respondent

                herein (who was arrayed as the 1st defendant in that suit) in favour of D.

                Madhaiyan and two others, was fraudulent, dishonest, and null and void.


                          (viii) However, subsequently, the same Advocate filed another suit in the

                name of Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein, based on an alleged agreement of

                sale dated 05.11.2011, seeking specific performance, while purportedly

                suppressing all the previous transactions concerning the sale of the property by

                the 2nd respondent to D. Madhaiyan and others.



                          (ix) Such deliberate concealment of material facts and earlier proceedings

                would, by itself, be sufficient to constitute fraud played upon the Court.


                          4.2 In essence, the learned counsel for the revision petitioners submitted

                that


                                  (i) The suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was a fraudulent and collusive

                action filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy in the name of the 1st respondent –

                Ganesan, after having withdrawn an earlier suit (O.S. No. 21 of 2020) in which

                he himself had challenged the same sale deed dated 26.07.2013. In the present

                suit, the said Advocate deliberately suppressed the earlier transactions and

                failed to implead the bona fide purchasers of the property, despite being fully

                aware of their interest. The agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, alleged in

                support of the suit, was not only suspiciously delayed in enforcement but also

                improperly stamped, indicating fabrication. The suit was thus engineered to

                secure an ex parte decree by deceit.



                                  (ii) Such deliberate concealment and procedural manipulation

                amount to fraud on the Court, warranting exercise of powers under 
Article 227


                of the Constitution to set aside the decree and the sale deed executed pursuant

                to it as null and void.



                          4.3 The learned counsel for the revision petitioners in support of his

                above contentions placed reliance upon the following judgements:

                          5.1 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent opposing

                the revision, submitted that the decree obtained in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 is

                lawful, valid, and based on a binding agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011. the

                ex parte decree was passed after service of summons, and no challenge was

                raised at the relevant time. The decree was followed by execution proceedings,

                culminating in the execution of a sale deed through the court, thereby

                transferring valid title to the 1st respondent.





                          5.2 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent further contended that the

                2nd respondent – A. Madhu, as the original owner of the property, had entered

                into a valid agreement for sale with the 1st respondent – Ganesan, and that the

                entire sale consideration was paid at the time of the agreement. Due to delay on

                the part of the vendor in executing the sale deed, the 1st respondent was

                compelled to file the suit for specific performance.



                          5.3 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent furthermore contended that

                the failure to implead subsequent purchasers does not render the decree void, as

                they were neither necessary nor proper parties to a suit between the contracting

                parties, especially when the purchasers had notice of the prior agreement.

                Earlier suit (O.S. No. 21 of 2020) filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy was entirely

                independent and unrelated to the agreement in question and was withdrawn

                voluntarily. The present suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was based on a legally

                enforceable agreement and pursued in accordance with law. The ex parte nature

                of the proceedings, by itself, does not constitute fraud, and that the decree was

                passed following the normal legal process. Merely because Advocate I.

                Veerasamy, who instituted the suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on behalf of the 1st

                respondent—Ganesan, and who was himself the plaintiff in the earlier suit in

                O.S. No. 21 of 2020, happens to be a close relative of Ganesan, such a

                relationship alone cannot form the basis to attribute fraud.



                          5.4 According to the learned counsel for the 1st respondent, the revision

                petitioners cannot invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court

                under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India to challenge the validity of a

                decree that was legally passed, even if it was an ex parte decree. If the revision

                petitioners were truly aggrieved by such decree, the proper course of action

                would have been to file an appeal or an application to set aside the ex parte

                decree, as provided under 
the Code of Civil Procedure
 or to file a separate suit

                for declaration under 
Section 34
 of the Specific Relief Act or otherwise to

                establish that the decree is not binding on them due to fraud, collusion, or

                suppression.





                          5.5 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent lastly contended that

                allegations of fraud, collusion, or suppression of material facts must be

                specifically pleaded and proved by evidence. Such serious allegations cannot be

                raised casually or for the first time in a revision petition. The revision

                petitioners, having failed to challenge the proceedings at the appropriate time,

                cannot now, at this belated stage, seek to unsettle a concluded judicial

                proceeding by making unsubstantiated claims. Therefore, the learned counsel

                prayed that the revision petition be dismissed.





                          6.1 The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent while adopting the

                arguments advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 1st

                respondent would additionally contend that the powers of the High Court under

                
Article 227
 being supervisory, the same has to be exercised sparingly in cases

                where errors are apparent on the face of record, occasioning grave injustice by

                the court assuming jurisdiction which it does not have, failing to exercise

                jurisdiction which it does have, or exercising its jurisdiction in a perverse

                manner. Hence, he would contend that essence of the power under 
Article 227
,

                being supervisory, it cannot be invoked to usurp the original jurisdiction of the

                court which it seeks to supervise.





                          6.2 In support of his above contention, Mr.S.Mukunth, learned senior

                counsel would place much reliance on the very recent judgement of the Hon'ble

                Supreme Court in S.L.P.(C) No.21466 of 2024 dated 29.04.2025 (K.Valarmathi

                and others v. Kumaresan).





                          7. In the light of the rival submissions, the point that arises for

                consideration in this revision petition is:





                                           Whether the Court, while exercising its power

                                    under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India, can set

                                    aside an ex parte decree on the ground of fraud and abuse

                                    of process of law?



                          8. It is apposite to refer to the settled legal principles on the subject.

                or temporal. The 1st paragraph of the judgement reads as follows:


                                        “Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or
                                  temporal” observed Chief Justice Edward Coke of England
                                  about three centuries ago. It is the settled proposition of law
                                  that a judgment or decree obtained by playing fraud on the
                                  court is a nullity and non est in the eyes of law. Such a
                                  judgment/decree by the first court or by the highest court has
                                  to be treated as a nullity by every court, whether superior or
                                  inferior. It can be challenged in any court even in collateral
                                  proceedings.”

In 
Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam v. Raj Kumar Rajinder Singh

                                     been placed on the definition of “fraud” as defined
                                     in Black's Law Dictionary, which is as under:



                                            “Fraud : (1) A knowing misrepresentation of the

                                         69.Halsbury's Laws of England has defined “fraud”
                                  as follows:





                                  “Whenever a person makes a false statement which he
                                  does not actually and honestly believe to be true, for
                                  purpose of civil liability, the statement is as fraudulent as
                                  if he had stated that which he did know to be true, or know
                                  or believed to be false. Proof of absence of actual and
                                  honest belief is all that is necessary to satisfy the
                                  requirement of the law, whether the representation has
                                  been made recklessly or deliberately, indifference or
                                  recklessness on the part of the representor as to the truth
                                  or falsity of the representation affords merely an instance
                                  of absence of such a belief.”



                                        70. In Kerr on the Law of Fraud and Mistake,
                                  “fraud” has been defined thus:





                                         “It is not easy to give a definition of what
                                  constitutes fraud in the extensive significance in which
                                  that term is understood by Civil Courts of Justice. The
                                  courts have always avoided hampering themselves by
                                  defining or laying down as a general proposition what
                                  shall be held to constitute fraud. Fraud is infinite in
                                  variety… Courts have always declined to define it, …
                                  reserving to themselves the liberty to deal with it under
                                  whatever form it may present itself. Fraud … may be said
                                  to include property (sic properly) all acts, omissions, and
                                  concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable
                                  duty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious
                                  to another, or by which an undue or unconscientious

                                  71. 
In 
Ram Chandra Singh v. Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra
                                  Singh
 v. Savitri Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319] , it was observed
                                  that fraud vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice
                                  never dwell together and it cannot be perpetuated or saved
                                  by the application of any equitable doctrine including res
                                  judicata. This Court observed as under : (SCC pp. 327-29,
                                  paras 15-18, 23 & 25)


                                  “15. Commission of fraud on court and suppression of
                                  material facts are the core issues involved in these
                                  matters. Fraud, as is well known, vitiates every solemn
                                  act. Fraud and justice never dwell together.






                                  16.Fraud is a conduct either by letter or words, which
                                  induces the other person or authority to take a definite
                                  determinative stand as a response to the conduct of the
                                  former either by word or letter.





                                  17.It is also well settled that misrepresentation itself
                                  amounts to fraud. Indeed, innocent misrepresentation may
                                  also give reason to claim relief against fraud.





                                  18.A fraudulent misrepresentation is called deceit and
                                  consists in leading a man into damage by wilfully or
                                  recklessly causing him to believe and act on falsehood. It
                                  is a fraud in law if a party makes representations which he
                                  knows to be false, and injury ensues therefrom although
                                  the motive from which the representations proceeded may

                                   23. An act of fraud on court is always viewed seriously.
                                  A collusion or conspiracy with a view to deprive the rights
                                  of the others in relation to a property would render the
                                  transaction void ab initio. Fraud and deception are
                                  synonymous.





                                            ***     ***      ***        ***       ***



                                  25. Although in a given case a deception may not amount
                                  to fraud, fraud is anathema to all equitable principles and
                                  any affair tainted with fraud cannot be perpetuated or
                                  saved by the application of any equitable doctrine
                                  including res judicata.”       (emphasis supplied)

                                  : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 239] , this Court observed that fraud
                                  had been played by showing the records and the orders
                                  obtained unlawfully by the declarant, would be a nullity in
                                  the eye of the law though such orders have attained
                                  finality. Following observations were made : (SCC pp.

                                  “27. The said order is passed by the State Government

                                  in their favour by showing that there is no surplus land

                                  proceedings under 
Section 21
 of the Act, on the basis of
                                  the alleged false declarations filed by the shareholders

Section 6
 of the Act. The plea urged
                                  on behalf of the State Government and the de facto

                                  passed by the State Government on the alleged ground of
                                  fraud played by the declarants upon the Tahsildar and

                                  them to come out from the clutches of the land ceiling
                                  provisions of the Act by creating the revenue records,
                                  which is the fraudulent act on their part which unravels
                                  everything and therefore, the question of limitation under
                                  the provisions to exercise power by the State Government
                                  does not arise at all. For this purpose, the Deputy
                                  Commissioner of Pune Division was appointed as the
                                  enquiry officer to hold such an enquiry to enquire into the
                                  matter and submit his report for consideration of the
                                  Government to take further action in the matter. The legal
                                  contentions urged by Mr Naphade, in justification of the

                                  to show that there are 384 sub-leases of the land involved

                          11. In K.P. Natarajan and another v. Muthuammal and others,

                (2024) 6 CTC 819, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the powers of the

                High Court under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India are in addition to, and

                wider than, the powers under 
Section 115
 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the

                Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the High Court can invoke its jurisdiction

                under 
Article 227
 to set aside an ex parte decree in a revision arising out of the

                dismissal of an application under 
Section 5
 of the Limitation Act, in order to

                correct gross errors of jurisdiction committed by a subordinate court. Para 21

                of the judgement reads as follows:



                                      “21. The contention that in a revision arising out of the
                                  dismissal of a petition under 
Section 5
 of the Limitation
                                  Act, 1963, the High Court cannot set aside the ex parte
                                  decree itself, by invoking the power under 
Article 227
,
                                  does not appeal to us. It is too well-settled that the powers

                                  went as far as to hold that even certiorari under 
Article
                                  226
 can be issued for correcting gross errors of
                                  jurisdiction of a subordinate court. But the correctness of
                                  the said view insofar as it related to 
Article 226
, was
                                  doubted by another Bench, which resulted in a reference

                (C.R.P.No.2672 of 2019 dated 19.09.2023), this court has held that the High

                Court under 
Article 227
 has the jurisdiction to set aside a decree while dealing

                with a revision under 
Section 5
 of the Limitation Act.



                          15. All the above precedents make it abundantly clear that a decree

                obtained by playing fraud upon the Court or by abuse of the process of law is a

                nullity in the eyes of law. In such cases, the supervisory jurisdiction of the High

                Court under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution can rightly be invoked to set aside

                such an illegal and void decree, in order to uphold the sanctity of the judicial

                process and prevent miscarriage of justice.





                          16. In K. Valarmathi and others v. Kumaresan [S.L.P. (C) No. 21466 of

                respondent placed much reliance, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that a

Article 227

                the Constitution of India. In the said judgement, the Hon'ble Supreme Court

                emphasized that 
Article 227
 confers supervisory jurisdiction, not appellate or

                revisional jurisdiction, and cannot be invoked to substitute statutory remedies or

                to set aside a decree passed by a competent civil court in the exercise of its

                original jurisdiction.





                          17. On a careful perusal of the recent judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court in K. Valarmathi and Others v. Kumaresan (cited supra), this Court

                finds that none of the earlier judgements rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme

                Court were brought to the notice of the Court. In particular, the earlier binding

                precedent of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Natarajan v. Muthuammal, (2021)

                15 SCC 817, wherein it was categorically held that the powers of the High

                Court under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India are in addition to, and

                wider than, the power under 
Section 115
 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and

                that such power can be exercised even to set aside a decree in exceptional

                circumstances, was not considered.



                          18. In the case of Natarajan v. Muthuammal (supra), the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court examined and relied upon several earlier decisions and

                reaffirmed the settled legal position regarding the scope of 
Article 227.


                Accordingly, this Court is inclined to consider the facts of the present case



                25 of 40

                bearing in mind the law laid down in Natarajan's case and the binding

                precedents in few other cases which have consistently interpreted the scope and

                extent of supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under 
Article 227
 of the

                Constitution.



                          19. Ordinarily, a challenge to a decree on the ground that it was obtained

                by fraud must be raised by way of an appeal or appropriate proceedings wherein

                the alleged fraud must be specifically pleaded and established by evidence.

                Mere allegations of fraud and collusion are not sufficient and there must be

                concrete facts to substantiate the allegations of fraud and collusion. However, in

                cases where the fraud is evident on the face of the judgment and decree, or

                discernible from the conduct of the parties, it may not be necessary to await a

                full-fledged trial for determination. In such exceptional circumstances, where

                the decree itself is a product of fraud and amounts to an abuse of the process of

                court, the High Court, in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction under 
Article

                227
 of the Constitution of India, is empowered to intervene and set aside such

                decree. The jurisdiction of the High Court under 
Article 227
 is not ousted in

                cases where the decree is a nullity in law owing to fraud perpetrated upon the

                court itself.

                          20. Let this Court now advert to the facts of the present case, wherein the

                decree dated 29.09.2023 is sought to be assailed, in the light of the settled legal

                position discussed above.



                          21. On a careful perusal of the judgment and decree dated 29.09.2023

                made in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned District Munsif,

                Pennagaram, it is seen that the 1st respondent filed the suit on the basis of an

                unregistered agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, allegedly entered into

                between the 1st respondent (purchaser) and the 2nd respondent (vendor). It is

                pertinent to note that although the agreement is dated 05.05.2011, the suit came

                to be filed only in the year 2023.



                          22. The pleadings in the plaint reveal that no steps were taken by the

                plaintiff from the date of the alleged agreement, despite claiming that the entire

                sale consideration of Rs. 80,000/- for the purchase of 3.77 acres was paid in full

                on the date of execution of agreement of sale itself. It is pleaded in the plaint

                that the 1st respondent herein issued a legal notice to his vendor, the 2nd

                respondent herein only on 01.03.2023, nearly twelve years later, calling upon

                him to appear before the Sub-Registrar for execution of the sale deed.


                          23. A photocopy of the so-called agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011 has

                been placed before this Court for perusal. On a careful examination of the same,

                it is seen that the said agreement was typed on a non-judicial stamp paper of

                Rs.10/-, which appears to have been purchased in the name of the 1st

                respondent – Ganesan.



                          24. It is relevant to place on record that, as per 
Article 5(j)
 of 
Schedule-I

                to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899
, as amended by the Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 2001,

                the stamp duty for an agreement for sale was prescribed as Rs. 20/-, with effect

                from 11.07.2002. Therefore, the fact that the alleged agreement of sale dated

                05.05.2011 was executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of only Rs. 10/-, instead

                of the statutorily required Rs. 20/-, raises a serious doubt about the genuineness

                and authenticity of the document.



                          25. Be that as it may, though the agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011

                states that the entire sale consideration of Rs. 80,000/- for the sale of 3.77 acres

                of land had been paid in full, there is no recital in the agreement regarding

                delivery of possession of the subject properties to the purchaser. Furthermore,

                the agreement does not stipulate any specific time frame within which the sale

                transaction was to be completed by execution and registration of the sale deed.


                          26. This Court is of the view that the absence of a specific time limit

                prescribed in the agreement of sale clearly indicates that such omission was

                deliberate, with the apparent intention of bringing the suit within the period of

                limitation as contemplated under Part II of 
Article 54
 of the 
Limitation Act,

                1963
.



                          27. It is relevant to note that the conduct of a person who claims to have

                parted with the entire sale consideration, yet remains silent for more than

                twelve years without initiating any action, is wholly inconsistent with the

                conduct expected of a prudent person. The prolonged inaction on the part of the

                1st respondent, including the failure to issue even a legal notice during this

                entire period demanding execution of the sale deed, assumes considerable

                significance when viewed in the context of the other attending circumstances of

                the case. Such unexplained delay raises serious doubts about the bona fides of

                the alleged agreement and the claim arising therefrom.


                          28. It is also relevant to note that the suit properties were sold by the 2nd

                respondent by way of a registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, vide Document

                No. 361 of 2013, in favour of D. Maddhaiyan, G. Rajendran, and P.K.

                Duraisamy. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent executed a rectification deed on

                31.08.2015, vide Document No. 3035 of 2015, to correct an error in the survey

                number mentioned in the original sale deed. Thus, as early as 26.07.2013, the

                2nd respondent, the vendor of the vendors of the revision petitioner under the

                agreement dated 05.05.2011 had already conveyed the suit properties by way of

                                                                                       C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                a valid registered sale, and it is this sale that was sought to be annulled in the

                suit filed in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 by Advocate I. Veerasamy, who had arrayed

                himself as the plaintiff.



                          29. It is pertinent to note that Advocate I. Veerasamy, a practising

                lawyer, is none other than the brother of the 2nd respondent, A. Madhu. In his

                plaint in O.S.No.21 of 2020, Advocate-I.Veerasamy not only sought relief

                against the 2nd respondent but also against the other family members.


                          30. In the plaint filed in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, Advocate I. Veerasamy

                alleged that the suit properties were joint family properties, though purchased in

                the name of the 2nd respondent. It was further contended that the 2nd

                respondent had executed the sale deed with the intention of defeating the rights

                of the other family members. Accordingly, he prayed for a judgement and

                decree declaring the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 as null and void, in addition to

                seeking the reliefs of partition and permanent injunction.


                          31. Along with the suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, Advocate I. Veerasamy

                also filed an application in I.A. No. 131 of 2020 under Order XXXIX Rules 1

                and 2 
of the Code of Civil Procedure
, seeking an ad-interim injunction.

                However, the said application was dismissed on merits by the learned District

                Munsif by order dated 29.10.2021.Subsequently, Advocate I. Veerasamy filed a

                memo expressing his intention not to pursue the suit any further and sought

                                                                                         C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                permission to withdraw the same. Notably, he did not seek to reserve his right

                to institute a fresh suit on the same cause of action. Accepting his request, the

                learned District Munsif dismissed the suit as not pressed by judgement dated

                15.11.2021.



                          32. From the foregoing facts, it is evident that Advocate I. Veerasamy, a

                practising Advocate who is the brother of the 2nd respondent, was well aware

                of the sale of the suit property as early as July 2013. He had himself instituted a

                suit challenging the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by his brother, the 2nd

                respondent – A. Madhu, in favour of D. Madhaiyan and two others. However,

                the said suit was later withdrawn by Advocate I. Veerasamy on his own

                volition, without reserving liberty to file a fresh suit on the same cause of

                action. Thereafter, Advocate I. Veerasamy himself instituted the suit in

                O.S.No.16 of 2023 on behalf of the 1st respondent – Ganesan, seeking specific

                performance of the so-called agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011.


                          33. It is pertinent to note that the 1st defendant in the said suit, A. Madhu,

                is none other than the brother of Advocate I. Veerasamy. The suit in O.S.No.16

                of 2023 came to be filed for specific performance by the very same advocate

                who had earlier challenged the sale deed executed by his own brother in the suit

                in O.S.No.21 of 2020 and subsequently withdrew that suit without reserving

                any liberty. However, while drafting the plaint in O.S. No. 16 of 2023,

                                                                                        C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                Advocate I. Veerasamy deliberately maintained complete silence with respect

                to the prior transactions involving the very same properties. He conveniently

                omitted any reference to the earlier sale deed dated 26.07.2013, which he had

                himself challenged in his own suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020. Such suppression is

                glaring and cannot be overlooked, particularly when the same advocate, fully

                aware of the prior transaction, chose not to disclose it in the subsequent suit.

                The deliberate omission raises serious concerns and casts a shadow over the

                bona fides of the suit, suggesting that the suppression was intentional and for

                reasons best known to Advocate I. Veerasamy, his brother A. Madhu.


                          34. Despite being fully aware of the registered sale deed executed by his

                brother, A. Madhu, on 26.07.2013 in favour of D. Madhaiyan, G. Rajendran,

                and P.K. Duraisamy, Advocate I. Veerasamy, while filing the suit in O.S. No.

                16 of 2023 for specific performance, deliberately chose not to implead the said

                purchasers as parties to the suit. Instead, he arrayed only his brother, A. Madhu,

                the 2nd respondent herein as a defendant, along with certain Government

                officials. The conscious omission of necessary parties, despite knowledge of

                their direct interest in the subject matter, further reinforces the inference of

                deliberate suppression and calls into question the bona fides of the suit. This

                court is unable to comprehend how the Sub Registrar, Pennagaram, District

                Registrar, Dharmapuri and District Collector, Dharmapuri were                  necessary

                parties to the issue relating to enforcement of a contract.


                          35. Having chosen to implead his brother-A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent

                herein and certain government officials of the State as party defendants in the

                suit in O.S.No.16 of 2023,          Advocate - I. Veerasamy, however, failed to

                implead the purchasers - D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy, who

                had acquired the suit properties from the said A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent

                herein under the registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, as well as the

                subsequent purchasers, namely the revision petitioners herein, who had

                purchased the same properties on 13.12.2017 from D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran

                and P.K.Duraisamy. Despite their clear and direct interest in the subject matter

                of the suit, those purchasers were deliberately omitted from the array of parties

                in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, thereby rendering the suit defective for non-joinder of

                necessary parties.



                          36. In the suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the 2nd respondent, A. Madhu—

                who was arrayed as the 1st defendant, conveniently remained ex parte, thereby

                allowing the suit to be decreed ex parte. It is not in dispute that A. Madhu, the

                2nd respondent herein had already sold the subject properties as early as July

                2013 to D. Maddhaiyan, G. Rajendran, and P.K. Duraisamy. His brother,

                Advocate I. Veerasamy, who is a practising lawyer, was fully aware of the said

                33 of 40

                                                                                        C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                transaction and had even instituted a suit (O.S.No.21 of 2020) challenging the

                said sale, which he later withdrew.



                          37. However, in the subsequent suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, Advocate I.

                Veerasamy, while acting as counsel for the plaintiff—Ganesan (1st respondent

                herein), conveniently omitted to implead the subsequent purchasers, including

                the revision petitioners herein, who had acquired the properties on 13.12.2017,

                as party defendants. This Court is of the considered view that such omission

                was not inadvertent but a deliberate act aimed at suppressing material facts

                relating to the prior alienation of the suit properties. The suppression of the

                subsequent sale transactions, particularly in a suit for specific performance,

                amounts to a clear and calculated act of fraud.



                          38. Had the subsequent purchasers been impleaded as parties in the suit,

                they would have had the opportunity to contest the claim and establish that the

                properties were transferred to them for valuable consideration, in good faith,

                and without notice of any prior agreement. The failure to implead them,

                coupled with the ex parte conduct of the 1st defendant, leads this Court to

                conclude that the decree was obtained by playing fraud upon the Court, thereby

                vitiating the very foundation of the judgement and decree passed in O.S. No. 16

                of 2023.

                          39. It is now well settled that an agreement for sale can be enforced

                against a subsequent purchaser only if it is shown that such purchaser had

                notice of the prior agreement and that the purchase was not made in good faith

                or for valuable consideration. Only in order to circumvent such legal

                complications, the suit for specific performance in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was

                cleverly instituted without impleading the subsequent purchasers as party

                defendants.



                          40. The pleadings in the earlier suit, O.S. No. 21 of 2020, filed by

                Advocate I. Veerasamy as plaintiff, clearly indicate that the subject properties

                were sold on 26.07.2013. Significantly, it was not his case in that suit that the

                sale consideration was not paid by the purchasers. If the agreement of sale dated

                05.11.2011 had in fact been executed in favour of the 1st respondent and was in

                existence, such a vital fact ought to have been disclosed, in all fairness, in the

                pleadings of O.S. No. 21 of 2020.



                          41. The omission to mention the alleged agreement dated 05.05.2011 in

                the earlier suit and the subsequent filing of O.S. No. 16 of 2023 without

                impleading the known purchasers clearly reveal a concerted effort to suppress

                material facts. These circumstances strongly suggest that the 1st respondent is

                merely a name-lender, and that the suit is a result of collusion between the 2nd



                35 of 40

                respondent and his brother, Advocate I. Veerasamy.


                          42. This conclusion is further fortified by the inherently improbable

                conduct of the 1st respondent, who, despite allegedly paying the entire sale

                consideration of Rs. 80,000/- on 05.05.2011, failed to take any steps whatsoever

                for over twelve years to enforce the agreement. Such prolonged and

                unexplained silence is wholly against with the normal conduct of an ordinary

                prudent man, which casts serious doubt on the genuineness of the alleged

                transaction.



                          43. The cumulative facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove lead

                to the inescapable conclusion that the suit for specific performance in O.S. No.

                16 of 2023 was clearly an afterthought, and the agreement of sale dated

                05.05.2011 is antedated with the sole object of achieving, through indirect

                means, what could not be achieved directly through the earlier suit in O.S. No.

                21 of 2020 filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy.



                           44. The very pleadings in the plaint in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the conduct

                of the parties, the deliberate non-joinder of necessary parties, and the manner in

                which the 1st respondent – Ganesan obtained an ex parte decree and

                subsequently got a sale deed executed in his favour through the executing court,

                all point to a clear abuse of process.

                          45. Such a sale deed, executed in furtherance of a decree obtained by

                suppressing material facts and without impleading the true and lawful

                purchasers of the suit properties, cannot confer any valid title upon the 1st

                respondent. Merely because an ex parte decree was passed in the suit for

                specific performance and a sale deed was executed in pursuance thereof, it does

                not ipso facto confer any valid title upon the 1st respondent. It is an undisputed

                fact that the 2nd respondent – A. Madhu, had already conveyed the subject

                properties by way of a registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, and therefore, on

                the date when the executing court purported to execute a sale deed in favour of

                the 1st respondent pursuant to the decree in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the 2nd

                respondent no longer held any title to convey.



                          46. In the absence of impleadment of the subsequent bona fide

                purchasers, and in view of the fraudulent suppression of these transactions, the

                entire proceedings culminating in the ex parte decree and execution thereof are

                vitiated. Consequently, the decree for specific performance and the sale deed

                executed pursuant thereto are liable to be set aside as nullities in the eye of law.


                          47. In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the considered

                opinion that the decree for specific performance obtained in O.S. No. 16 of

                2023 was the result of a calculated and deliberate suppression of material facts,

                                                                                         C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025



                including the prior alienation of the suit properties and the purchasers were not

                impleaded as parties. The suit was engineered in collusion between the 1st and

                2nd respondents, with the active connivance of Advocate I. Veerasamy, who

                had personal knowledge of all relevant transactions but chose to withhold the

                same from the Court. Such conduct constitutes a clear abuse of the process of

                court and amounts to playing fraud upon the court. It is a settled principle of

                law that a decree obtained by fraud is a nullity and can be declared as such even

                in collateral proceedings. Therefore, this Court finds that the ex parte decree

                dated 26.09.2023 passed in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned

                District Munsif, Pennagaram, and the consequential sale deed executed by the

                executing court in favour of the 1st respondent, are vitiated by fraud and are

                hence null and void in the eye of law. This is a fit case warranting the exercise

                of this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of

                India. This Court is therefore of the considered view that the extraordinary

                supervisory jurisdiction under 
Article 227
 of the Constitution of India is

                required to be exercised in this case. Accordingly, the impugned decree and sale

                deed are hereby set aside.



                          In the result, the civil revision petition is allowed in the following terms:

                Son of Selvam is hereby declared as null and void and non-est in the eye of law.


                          Considering the special circumstances of the case, this court is not

                their own costs incurred on this revision petition.


                          Consequently, connected CMP is closed.
