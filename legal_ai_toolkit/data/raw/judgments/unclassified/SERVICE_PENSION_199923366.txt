                     in the interregnum reached superannuation. Therefore, he would submit that

                     respondents may be refrained from conducting verification of the petitioners'

                     caste status, since they have retired from service. The petitioners have also

                     filed affidavits of undertaking, respectively, stating that they will not make

                     any claim or concession based on their community certificates.

                                         “4. This litigation has something to do with Caste
                                   Certificate. It is the case of the respondent herein that she
                                   belongs to Hindu Konda Reddis Community (Scheduled
                                   Tribe).

                                         5. She applied for a caste certificate for her son. The
                                   same was declined after an inquiry undertaken by Revenue
                                   Divisional Officer (for short the “RDO”). In such
                                   circumstances, the respondent preferred a writ petition in
                                   the High Court. The High court disposed of the writ petition
                                   observing the following in para 7:-

                                                 “7. Be that as it may. As on date, the
                                          Community Certificates issued to the Petitioner, her
                                          sister, her brother and also of her close relatives,
                                          were not cancelled and when they were not
                                          cancelled, there cannot be any impediment in issuing
                                          the Community Certificate to the Petitioner's son.
                                          Accordingly, the Respondent RDO Mettur Dam,
                                          Salem District, is directed to issue a Community
                                          Certificate to the Petitioner's son S.P. Yesvanth,

                                        of a copy of this order. Thereafter, the Respondent-
                                        RDO, Mettur Dam, Salem District is directed to refer

                                        State Level Scrutiny Committee shall verify the

                                        orders on or before 31.10.2019.”

                                        6. Para 7 is in two parts. The first part of the para 7
                                  says that the necessary certificate be issued in favour of the
                                  son of the respondent herein and the second part says that
                                  after the same is issued let there be a thorough inquiry at
                                  the end of the State Level Scrutiny Committee whether the
                                  entire family belongs to the Hindu Konda Reddis
                                  Community (ST) or not.

                                        7. Caste Certificate seems to be a big big problem in
                                  the State of Tamil Nadu. It appears that thousands of such
                                  certificates have been issued certifying people to be
                                  members of the Hindu Konda Reddis Community falling
                                  within Scheduled Tribe.

                                        8. It is a different thing to say whether RDO could
                                  have inquired into the genuineness of the claim or not. We
                                  do not propose to get into this controversy for the present.

                                        9. However, we would like to ensure whether these
                                  certificates are genuine or not. We would also like to know
                                  in what manner such caste certificates have been procured
                                  by thousands of people in the area.

                                        10. For the present, we do not level any allegations
                                  but prima facie it appears to be a huge racket. This is
                                  something extremely dangerous.

                                        11. In such circumstances, we propose to pass an
                                  interim order today.

                                        12. We are conscious of the fact that the State has
                                  been able to obtain an interim order by which the operation
                                  of the impugned judgment has been stayed. However, we
                                  modify the order to the extent that let the State Level
                                  Scrutiny Committee undertake an extensive inquiry into this
                                  issue at the earliest and file its report before us to enable us
                                  to proceed further in the matter. We direct the State Level
                                  Scrutiny Committee to undertake this exercise at the earliest
                                  and file its appropriate report within six weeks from today
                                  without fail. The Report should be exhaustive supported by
                                  some contemporaneous record and it should be in correct
                                  english.

                                        13. Once the report comes on record, we shall
                                  thereafter proceed to look into each of the petitions
                                  independently and decide them on their own merits.

                                            14. It goes without saying that in the course of the
                                   inquiry all stake holders in other words all those who claim
                                   to be members of this Hindu Konda Reddis Community shall
                                   be heard.

                                            15. The Committee shall undertake a fair, transparent
                                   and impartial inquiry without being influenced in any
                                   manner by any of the observations made in the impugned
                                   order or by any other extraneous consideration including
                                   any observation made by this Court on merits in the present

                                            16. We expect the State level Scrutiny Committee to

                                            17. Rest of the interim order shall continue to
                                   operate.

                                            18. The impugned order of the High Court is modified
                                   to the extent indicated above.

                     30.06.1986. She has sought for a similar certificate for her son on

                     20.10.2016, by enclosing necessary documents including Community

                     Certificates of herself, her sister, her brother and other close relatives, which

                     came to be rejected by the official respondent therein. The counsel for the

                     petitioner therein has submitted that a common impugned order was passed

                     in respect of several individuals who applied along with the petitioner by

                     assigning stereo-typed reasons and the respondent has summarily rejected

                     the petitioner's request. Considering the same, this Court, vide its order dated

                     22.04.2019, has directed the respondents to issue community certificate to

                     the petitioner's son, which shall be sent to the State Level Scrutiny

                     brother and other close relatives. The facts of the present writ petitions are

                     totally different to that of the writ petition cited by the Hon'ble Supreme

                     attaining superannuation, the genuineness of the community certificates of

                     the petitioners have been questioned by the respondents, which this Court

                     feels is purely academic.



                                  9. A similar issue was considered by this Bench in W.P.No.31452 of

                     2022, in which I was one of the parties to the said order. I allowed the claim

                     made by the petitioner therein, holding that the action of the respondent in

                     initiating a vigilance enquiry after the petitioner’s superannuation, and in

                     passing the impugned order after an unexplained and inordinate delay of

                     seven years, was not sustainable. It was observed that such delay could not

                     be construed as falling within a reasonable time and was therefore

                     unjustifiable. However, the other learned Judge constituting the Division

                     Bench rendered a divergent view and dismissed the petitioner’s claim. In

                     view of the difference of opinion, the writ petition was placed before a Third

                     Judge for resolution of the point of divergence. The learned This Judge of

                     this Court, vide its order dated 20.09.2024, concurred with the views

                     expressed by me.

10.   It is also pertinent to note that in the decision rendered by the

                     Hon'ble Apex Court in 
Union of India vs. S.Renuka (S.L.P.(C)

                     No.24458/2019
) vide order dated 03.03.2023, the Hon'ble Apex Court has

                     recorded the submissions made by the learned senior counsel for the first

                     respondent, held that the respondent No.1, who served in the Railways has

                     superannuated on 28.02.2022 and therefore, the exercise in this case would

                     largely be academic on the aspect of whether she belonged to the claimed

                     Scheduled Tribe category, and considering the above, closed the

                     proceedings.




                                  11. It is seen from the records that the petitioners in W.P.Nos.24381 &

                     24387 of 2025 have rendered nearly 37 years of service to the Government

                     and attained superannuation in their service on 30.06.2021 and 31.12.2018

                     respectively. Therefore, questioning the genuineness of their community

                     certificates, after a long time, that too, after a lapse of more than nearly 4

                     years and 7 years respectively, after their retirement, is definitely uncalled

                     for.

12. The Apex Court in the case of 
R.Sundaram vs. The Tamil Nadu

                     State Level Scrutiny Committee and Others
 dated 17.03.2023, in Paragraph

                     No.16 held as follows:-




                                         “16. It has been explicitly stated by this court that the
                                  exercise of verification of community certificate must be
                                  completed expeditiously. In the present case, however, as has
                                  been mentioned above, there has been an inordinate and
                                  unexplained delay of 19 years, an amount of time which cannot
                                  be fathomed, within the ambit of 'reasonable time'.”
                                  In the present cases on hand, it can be seen that the petitioner in

                     W.P.No.24381 of 2025 has entered government service in the 1984 and

                     retired on 30.06.2021, after rendering 37 years of service. Likewise, the

                     petitioner in W.P.No.24387 of 2025 has entered government service in the

                     1981 and retired on 31.12.2018, also after rendering 37 years of service. The

                     inordinate delay on the part of the respondents in initiating any enquiry into

                     the genuineness of the community certificates of the petitioners from the

                     dates of their initial appointment until their respective dates of

                     superannuation is highly unreasonable and cannot be justified under any

                     acceptable standard of prompt administrative action.



                                  13. In yet another case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

                     SLP(C) No.24458/2019 dated 03.03.2023, was pleased to hold as under:



                                         “It is submitted that the respondent No.1 who served in
                                  the Railways has superannuated on 28.02.2022 and therefore,
                                  the exercise in this case would largely be academic on the
                                  aspect of whether she belonged to the claimed Scheduled Tribe
                                  category. Considering the above, we deem it is appropriate to
                                  order for closure of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Special
                                  leave Petition stands disposed of.”



 
14. The decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case

                     of 
Kumari Madhuri Patil vs. Additional Commissioner
, reported in 1995

                     AIR 94 weighs much importance in the cases on hand, had elaborately dealt

                     with the issue of community certificate and observed that as per 
Article

                     15(4)
 of the Constitution of India, it is for the State to make special

                     provisions for advancement of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.




 
Further, it was observed that in the light of 
Article 16(1)
, equality of

                     opportunity to all citizens in matters of appointments to an office or a post

                     under the Union or a State Government or public undertakings etc., should

                     be ensured. For that purpose, 
Article 16(4)
 empowers the State to make

                     provisions for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of classes of

                     citizens not adequately represented in the services under the State. The

                     Hon'ble Supreme Court, in 
the said judgment
 while issuing certain

                     guidelines, insisted that the community certificate in respect of SC/ST

                     should be scrutinised at the earliest. For the sake of convenience, relevant

                     paragraphs of the judgment are reproduced below:




                                         “It is, therefore, necessary that the certificates issued are
                                  scrutinised at the earliest and with utmost expedition and
                                  promptitude. For that purpose, it is necessary to streamline the
                                  procedure for the issuance of social status certificates, their
                                  scrutiny and their approval, which may be the following:

                                        Commissioner and the certificate shall be issued by
                                        such officer rather than at the Officer, Taluk or
                                        Mandal level.

                                        certificate by the Scrutiny Committee shall be filed at

                                        2. Keeping in view the above mentioned facts, it is
                                  requested that the concerned State Level Scrutiny Committee
                                  be directed to verify the ST caste certificates of only those
                                  employees who were appointed after the year 1995 and the
                                  process of verification should be completed within two
                                  months. The Action Taken Report in this regard may be please

                                  16. The above referred Office Memorandum makes it very clear that

                     community certificates of employees, who were inducted into Government

                     Service after 1995 can alone be subjected for scrutiny / verification. To be

                     more precise, it is incumbent on the employers / authorities to conduct

                     verifications ideally at the time of an employee's entry into service, so as to

                     ensure the accuracy and integrity of personnel records.



                                  17. In furtherance thereof, the Government of India, Ministry of

                     Personnel, PG & Pensions, Department of Personnel and Training issued

                     instructions dated 21.10.2022 to all State / UT Governments, insisting upon

                     the need for timely verification of Caste / Community certificates, indicating

                     as follows:

                                         “3. In this regard, it is reiterated that the responsibility
                                  for the issue and verification of Caste Certificate lies with the
                                  concerned State / UT Government. The Hon'ble Supreme
                                  Court, vide its order dated 02.09.1994 in the matter of 
Kumari
                                  Madhuri Patil vs. Addl
. Commissioner, has laid down the
                                  detailed guidelines for effective verification of the Caste
                                  Certificates of the employees by the State Government, so that
                                  no person, on the basis of fake caste certificate, may secure
                                  employment wrongfully in the Government.”


                                  18. On a reading of the aforesaid instructions, it is apparent that the

                     Government of India is very keen in curbing the wrongful entry of an

                     employee in the Government Service based on the fake community

                     certificate and issued instructions to all State / UT Governments for

                     verification of the community certificates at the earliest point of time.



                                  19. In an another Office Memorandum dated 30.11.2021, issued by

                     the Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, PG & Pensions,

                     Department of Pension & Pensioner's Welfare strictly instructed concerned

                     Departments that unless departmental or judicial proceedings are pending

                     against a retired employee, the pensionary / retirement benefits due to the

                     retiring employee should not be withheld or delay on the ground of

                     pendency of verification of caste certificate.

                                  20. Learned counsel for the petitioners drew our attention to the

                     Government Order dated 15.10.2012 issued by the Government of Tamil

                     Nadu, constituting a District Level Vigilance Committee and State Level

                     Scrutiny Committee to verify the genuineness of the community certificates.



                     Vigilance Cells at Chennai, Salem, Trichy and Madurai were also formed to

                     verify the community status and submit a report to the Committee. In the

                     Government Order, the functions of the Vigilance Cells have been

                     enumerated and a time frame has also been fixed for completion of enquiry,

                     which reads as follows:



                                        “vii) The inquiry should be completed as expeditiously
                                  as possible preferably by day to day proceedings within such
                                  period not exceeding two months. If after inquiry, the
                                  competent committee finds the claim to be false or spurious,
                                  they should pass an order cancelling the certificate issued and
                                  confiscate the same. It should communicate within one month
                                  from the date of the conclusion of the proceedings the result of
                                  enquiry to the parent / guardian and the applicant.”



                                  21. In the light of various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

                     and also the guidelines / instructions / GO issued by both Government of

                     India and State Government, from time to time, we are of the view that the

                     respondents cannot keep the matter pending for months / years together in

                     the garb of verification of community certificates, especially when there is a

                     specific time frame fixed for completion of such verification.



                                  22. In the present cases, the petitioners have entered Government

                     service and subsequently, got retired, after rendering nearly 37 years of

                     service. Therefore, the verification of the community certificates at this

                     belated stage will be a futile exercise and is not in consonance with the

                     various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the guidelines issued

                     by the Government. Hence, we have no other option, but to set aside the

                     impugned proceedings.



                                  23. Learned counsel for the petitioners would state that the petitioners,

                     at this age are finding difficult to appear for enquiry before the officials and

                     therefore, the petitioners would state that they are willing to surrender their

                     community certificates and they will not claim concessions to their children

                     on the basis of their community certificate, which is given solely to avoid

                     further harassment at the hands of the respondents under the pretext of

                                  25. Once a government servant has retired and completed all service

                     verifications during his tenure, reopening of the community certificate issue

                     amounts to re-litigation. It is pertinent to note that the employer accepted the

                     community certificates at the time of appointment of the petitioners and did

                     not raise any issue during the long years of service of the petitioners. A

                     retired employee has a legitimate expectation that benefits earned during

                     service will not be taken away arbitrarily after retirement.                              When a

                     community certificate is issued and accepted for decades, and no concerns

                     are raised, then there is a presumption that such certificates are valid and the

                     information contained within it are accurate. Post-retirement verification of a

                     community certificate is inherently burdensome, as it involves practical

                     difficulties such as loss of records, fading memories, and changed

                     circumstances, making it unjustly onerous for the individual to establish the

                     certificate’s authenticity.

                                  alone is binding. It is only the reason assigned in the ratio
                                  decidendi of a judgment.
 
The judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
                                  Court in 
S.Renuka
's case without considering the spirit of
                                  several judgments including larger Bench of Hon'ble Supreme
                                  Court, need not be followed.
 
Therefore, we have no hesitation to
                                  hold that those three judgments may not be binding precedents as
                                  they were rendered without noticing the binding precedents on
                                  principles reiterated by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of
                                  
Kumari Madhuri Patil, R.Vishwanatha Pillai, and Food
                                  Corporation of India
 (supra). Verification once started shall
                                  continue till its logical end and retirement of an employee during
                                  enquiry as to his community status does not affect the
                                  proceedings.




                                          Issue No.(B): Whether the verification of Community
                                  Certificate or community status of any individual who secured
                                  employment under SC or ST quota before 1995, can be
                                  permitted/directed ?

                                          32.When the Hon'ble Supreme Court has rendered a
                                  judgment which is reiterated in several judgments of the Hon'ble
                                  Supreme Court, there cannot be an Office Memorandum which
                                  would whittle down the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court
                                  which is binding as a law declared in terms of 
Article 141
 of the
                                  Constitution. When the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is
                                  binding not only as a precedent, but as a law declared, there
                                  cannot be an official instruction on the interpretation of the
                                  judgment so as to limit its operation. This is the mischief that was

                                  done by way of the Office Memorandum dated 24.12.2020.

                                         33.Therefore, this Court is unable to agree with the
                                  submission of the learned counsels appearing for the petitioners
                                  that there cannot be verification of Community Certificates which
                                  were obtained prior to 1995. Equally, merely because
                                  appointment was before 1995, it cannot be said that verification
                                  in those cases cannot be done, as rightly pointed out by Hon'ble
                                  Mrs. Justice N.Mala while expressing dissenting view that this
                                  Court cannot declare or legitimise fraud committed by a person
                                  merely because he obtained the false certificate or got
                                  employment based on a false claim before 1995. It is settled that
                                  fraud vitiates every solemn transaction and there cannot be a
                                  legal sanction to condone fraud if it is committed before 1995.
                                  Therefore, irrespective of date of Community Certificate or date
                                  of appointment before or after 1995, verification as to the
                                  genuineness of Community Certificate or claim as to one's
                                  community status shall continue to its logical end.



                                          Issue No.(C): Whether a time limit should be prescribed
                                  for initiating proceedings for verification of community status
                                  or Community Certificate of an employee ?

 
37.As it was pointed out by the Constitution Bench of the
                                  Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
State of Maharashtra v. Milind

                                  reported in (2001) 1 SCC 4, which is clarified by later judgments,
                                  no person can take advantage of the Scheduled Tribes Order for
                                  any other purpose, merely because he has been shown indulgence

                                  producing false certificate. Mere delay in making a reference
                                  does not invalidate the order on scrutiny by competent authority.
                                  Since we have held that verification can continue even after
                                  retirement of an employee, this Court finds no logic to accept the
                                  arguments of learned counsels appearing for the petitioners that
                                  there must be time limit or limitation to be prescribed.




                                          Issue No.(D): Whether terminal benefits of employees
                                  can be withheld on account of pendency of proceedings for
                                  verification as to the genuineness of Community Certificate or
                                  community status of an employee who secure employment
                                  under SC or ST quota ?

                                         38.This Court, in several cases, finds that the delay is
                                  caused mainly due to the recalcitrant and non-cooperative
                                  attitude of the employees who refuse to cooperate with the
                                  enquiry under some pretext or the other. Despite the Government
                                  spending huge money for establishing a machinery to verify the
                                  genuineness of the certificates or the claims as to one's
                                  community status, the manner in which the employees adopt
                                  delaying tactics, precludes us from holding that the employee
                                  should be given benefit of his employment or terminal benefits
                                  even during the pendency of verification of community status.

                                         39.In a case where the verification was initiated just
                                  before retirement on the basis of a stale claim or a complaint
                                  without any verifiable material, the terminal benefits of an
                                  employee cannot be withheld merely because the enquiry has
                                  been commenced. In all other cases, where delay is attributable to

                                  employer in the matter of disbursement of retirement benefits.
                                  Depending upon the individual cases, this Court can direct
                                  provisional pension to be disbursed to the employee subject to the
                                  outcome of verification process either by State Level Scrutiny

                     to whether the Office Memorandum dated 24.12.2020 prohibits the scrutiny

                     of caste certificate issued prior to 1995 and there can be any limitation for

                     answers to the above questions are given, are extracted hereunder:

                                  18.    It is most relevant to cite that the Hon'ble Division Bench of

                     this Court in W.P.No.11336 of 2019 vide order dated 22.04.2019 had issued

                     (Hindu Konda Reddis (ST) Community). The relevant portion of the said

                     order is extracted hereunder:



                                        ''2. It is the case of the petitioner that her family belongs to
                             Konda Reddis Community, which is classified as a Scheduled Tribe
                             Community. The petitioner was issued with Community Certificate
                             on 30.06.1986 by the Tahsildar, Mettur Dam. The petitioner's own
                             brother B.Vinothkumar was also issued with a Community
                             Certificate in the year 1989 by the Tahsildar. All of them, including
                             the petitioner, had been described as belonging to the Konda Reddis
                             Community in their educational and land records. It is also stated
                             that the petitioner's close relatives possess Community Certificates
                             describing them as belonging to Konda Reddis Community.

                                        3. On 20.10.2016, the petitioner applied to the respondent for
                             issuance of Community Certificate for her minor child, viz.,
                             S.P.Yesvanth,       by     enclosing        necessary        documents      including
                             Community Certificates of herself, her sister, her brother and other
                             close relatives. By the impugned order dated 23.03.2018, the
                             petitioner's application stated above, was rejected. Hence, the

                                      4. When the Writ Petition is taken up for hearing, the learned
                             counsel for the petitioner made his submissions adverting to the
                             averments made in the affidavit filed in support of the Writ Petition.

                                      5. This Court also heard the submissions of the learned

                             above aspects.

                                      6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that by the
                             impugned order, a common order has been passed in respect of
                             several individuals who applied along with the petitioner by
                             assigning stereo-typed reasons and the respondent has summarily
                             rejected the petitioner's request. However, learned counsel for the
                             petitioner submitted that the respondent/RDO has made discreet
                             enquiry behind the back of the petitioner and placed reliance on such
                             materials. Learned counsel for the petitioner further stated that the
                             impugned order was passed by the RDO, Sankagiri, who was holding
                             the additional charge of the post of RDO, Mettur Dam.

                                      7. Be that as it may. As on date, the Community Certificates
                             issued to the petitioner, her sister, her brother and also of her close
                             relatives, were not cancelled and when they were not cancelled,
                             there cannot be any impediment in issuing the Community
                             Certificate to the petitioner's son. Accordingly, the respondent-

                             RDO Mettur Dam, Salem District, is directed to issue a Community
                             Certificate to the petitioner's son S.P.Yesvanth, within a period of

                             Officer (for short the “RDO”). In such circumstances, the
                             respondent preferred a writ petition in the High Court. The High
                             court disposed of the writ petition observing the following in para
                             7:-

                                          “7. Be that as it may. As on date, the Community
                                   Certificates issued to the Petitioner, her sister, her
                                   brother and also of her close relatives, were not cancelled
                                   and when they were not cancelled, there cannot be any
                                   impediment in issuing the Community Certificate to the
                                   Petitioner's son. Accordingly, the Respondent RDO
                                   Mettur Dam, Salem District, is directed to issue a
                                   Community Certificate to the Petitioner's son S.P.

                                    6. Para 7 is in two parts. The first part of the para 7 says that
                             the necessary certificate be issued in favour of the son of the
                             respondent herein and the second part says that after the same is
                             issued let there be a thorough inquiry at the end of the State Level
                             Scrutiny Committee whether the entire family belongs to the Hindu
                             Konda Reddis Community (ST) or not.

                                    7. Caste Certificate seems to be a big big problem in the State
                             of Tamil Nadu. It appears that thousands of such certificates have
                             been issued certifying people to be members of the Hindu Konda
                             Reddis Community falling within Scheduled Tribe.

                                    8. It is a different thing to say whether RDO could have
                             inquired into the genuineness of the claim or not. We do not propose
                             to get into this controversy for the present.

                                    9. However, we would like to ensure whether these
                             certificates are genuine or not. We would also like to know in what
                             manner such caste certificates have been procured by thousands of
                             people in the area.

                                    10. For the present, we do not level any allegations but
                             prima facie it appears to be a huge racket. This is something
                             extremely dangerous.

                                    11. In such circumstances, we propose to pass an interim
                             order today.

                                    12. We are conscious of the fact that the State has been able
                             to obtain an interim order by which the operation of the impugned
                             judgment has been stayed. However, we modify the order to the

                                        14. It goes without saying that in the course of the inquiry

                             of this Hindu Konda Reddis Community shall be heard.

                     certificate by the Tahsildar, Mettur, on 14.09.1978, based on which, he was

                     appointed as Time Scale Clerk in the Department of Telecommunication on

                     on the basis of the letter of the Collector and thereafter, the petitioner therein

                     challenged the same before this Court and the same was transferred to the

                     Central Administrative Tribunal in T.A.No.6 of 1992, which was allowed on

                     16.03.1994. When the District Level Vigilance Committee attempted to

                     verify the petitioner's community certificate, he had challenged the same in

                     W.P.No.6404 of 2004 on the ground that the District Level Vigilance

                     Committee did not have jurisdiction to verify the community certificate. The

                     said writ petition came to be allowed stating that the competent authority

                     was the State Level Scrutiny Committee. Meanwhile, the petitioner therein

                     superannuated from service on 30.11.2014. After superannuation, the

                     petitioner therein had received summons from the Vigilance Cell for enquiry

                     in February 2019. Finally, the Tamil Nadu State Level Scrutiny Committee-

                     they have not been summoned for verification and in the interregnum

                     reached superannuation. For consideration of this Court, they also filed

                     affidavits of undertaking.



                                  25.   It is not the case of the petitioners that there is a violation of

                     principle of natural justice and there is a defiance of the guidelines issued by

                     the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the Hon'ble Division Benches of this Court

                     and the impugned noticed issued by the authorities are not in consonance

                     with issuance and verification of Scheduled Caste(s) and Scheduled Tribe(s)

                     ensure implementation of constitutional reservation benefits to the
