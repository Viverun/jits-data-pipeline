                          JYOTI SINGH, J.

                          1.    By this writ petition, Petitioner seeks quashing of the order
                          dated 21.01.2019, whereby his representation for treating the
                          suspension period as period in service and payment of balance salary
                          has been rejected. A writ of certiorari is also sought for quashing the
                          order dated 11.02.2019, by which Petitioner was informed that the
                          period of suspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 would be treated
                          as period of service without break and counted towards qualifying
                          service for calculation of terminal dues but from the date of acquittal
                          of the Petitioner in the criminal case i.e. 25.05.2018. Writ of
                          Mandamus is sought directing the Respondent to release to the
                          Petitioner the difference between full salary and subsistence allowance
                          with interest for the suspension period and also to treat the length of

                           service as 31 years instead of 25 years for computation of pension.

                          2.    The factual score that emerges from the writ petition is that
                          Petitioner joined the Respondent/Punjab National Bank as an Officer
                          in September, 1976. On 31.08.1992, Central Bureau of Investigation
                          ('CBI') registered an FIR against few officials of the Bank including
                          the Petitioner for alleged irregularities in some loan accounts of M/s
                          Pankaj Finance & Leasing Ltd. (PFLL). In September, 1993, New
                          Bank of India was merged with Respondent/Punjab National Bank and
                          in October, 1994, sanction was given for prosecution of some
                          employees of the Bank, including the Petitioner and a charge sheet
                          was issued thereafter.

                          3.    On 17.12.1994, Petitioner was placed under suspension, which
                          was revoked on 13.12.2000, without prejudice to the criminal
                          proceedings/disciplinary action pending/contemplated against him
                          with a further direction in the order to post him at a non-sensitive post
                          on the administrative side. One month before his superannuation, a
                          show-cause notice was served on the Petitioner on 30.05.2007 for
                          certain irregularities to which a reply was sent by the Petitioner on
                          12.06.2007. On 28.06.2007, Petitioner was informed that in the wake
                          of contemplated disciplinary proceedings, his superannuation benefits
                          shall be withheld. Petitioner superannuated on 30.06.2007.

                          4.    Challenging the show-cause notice and the order dated
                          28.06.2007, Petitioner filed a writ petition in this Court being W.P.(C)
                          1290/2008, which was disposed of on 15.09.2008 with a direction to
                          the Respondent to take a decision on the show-cause notice within
                          four weeks. Instead of deciding the show-cause notice Respondent
                          served a charge sheet on the Petitioner on 06.10.2008.

                           5.       On 29.11.2009, Respondent gave a second option for pension to
                          the Petitioner on deposit of Bank's contribution of Provident Fund and
                          Petitioner opted for pension and deposited the desired amount.
                          Consequent thereto, Respondent started paying pension to the
                          Petitioner w.e.f. 29.11.2009 but without taking into consideration the
                          period of 6 years during which Petitioner was placed under suspension
                          and hence the total period computed for pension was taken as 25
                          years.

                          6.       In the meantime, Petitioner challenged the charge sheet by
                          filing W.P.(C) 7481/2008 before this Court, which was allowed vide
                          judgement dated 29.10.2013, quashing the charge sheet as being
                          without jurisdiction, with a further direction that Petitioner be paid the
                          retirement benefits along with interest @ 6% p.a. w.e.f 01.07.2007.
                          Admittedly, this judgement was never assailed by the Respondent and
                          was implemented by paying the retirement dues along with interest.

                          7.       Significantly, vide judgement dated 25.05.2018, the CBI Court
                          acquitted the Petitioner of all criminal charges while some of the
                          co-accused were convicted. Armed with the judgement, Petitioner sent
                          a representation dated 04.06.2018 to the Respondent requesting for
                          treating the suspension period from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 as spent
                          on duty and payment of the difference between the salary and
                          subsistence allowance already paid, as also to treat the length of
                          service as 31 years for computation of pension, in accordance with
                          Regulation 15 of the Punjab National Bank Officer Employees'
                          (Discipline and Appeal) Regulations, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as
                          'Regulations 1977').

                           8.    On 21.01.2019, Respondent passed an order rejecting the
                          request of the Petitioner and Petitioner made further representations
                          citing certain judgements in his favour. An order was passed by the
                          Respondent on 11.02.2019, partly accepting the request of the
                          Petitioner and agreeing to treat the suspension period as service
                          without break for calculation of pension albeit from the date of
                          acquittal and not from 29.11.2009, the date from which the Petitioner
                          has started getting his pension, on the ground that Petitioner was not
                          honourably acquitted in the criminal case and the acquittal was by
                          giving benefit of doubt. Further representations of the Petitioner failed
                          to evoke any positive response, constraining him to file the present
                          writ petition.

 
9.    Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that Regulation
                          15(1) of the Regulations 1977 provides that where the employee is
                          fully exonerated or the suspension is unjustifiable, he shall be granted
                          full pay for the intervening period. Regulation 15(3)(a) further
                          provides that where Regulation 15(1) applies, period of absence from
                          duty shall, for all purposes, be treated as period spent on duty.
                          The ground for denying the full salary for the suspension period is that
                          the Petitioner has not been fully exonerated and was acquitted by
                          giving benefit of doubt and 'no work no pay'. The stand of the
                          Respondent is completely misconceived. Petitioner stands fully
                          exonerated since the charge sheet in the disciplinary proceedings was
                          quashed and the CBI Court has also acquitted him while convicting
                          the others, where criminality and culpability was found by the Court,
                          after detailed examination of the evidence, both oral and documentary.
                          43 witnesses were examined by the prosecution and documentary

                           evidence runs into hundreds of exhibits. The acquittal is not based on
                          any flaw in the prosecution case or on ground of non-examination of
                          witnesses and/or any witness turning hostile. The Supreme Court in
                          
Union of India and Others v. Methu Meda
, (
2022) 1 SCC 1 and
                          Commissioner of Police, New Delhi and Another v. Mehar Singh
,
                          (2013) 7 SCC 685, has held that the expressions 'honourable
                          acquittal', 'acquitted of blame' and 'clean acquittal' have been coined
                          by judicial pronouncements and in cases where accused is acquitted
                          due to technicalities on account of faulty prosecution, compromise,
                          etc., it can be said that accused is not honourably acquitted, however,
                          acquittal on account of benefit of doubt is a complete acquittal on
                          merits as observed in Mohan Lal, Constable No. 744/L, 283/Sd,
                          Delhi Police, Delhi v. Union of India & Others, 1981 SCC OnLine
                          Del 213.


                          10.    Respondent has gravely erred in not treating the period of
                          suspension towards calculation of the computation of pensionary
                          benefits. There is no law which permits the Respondent to reckon the
                          period from the date of acquittal by the Criminal Court instead of from
                          the date of retirement of an employee. No provision of law or
                          judgement has been cited by the Respondent for linking the
                          computation of the period to the date of acquittal by the Criminal
                          Court. 
In the order dated 21.01.2019, reliance is placed by the
                          Respondent on the judgement of the Supreme Court in 
Union of India
                          and Others v. Jaipal Singh
, (2004) 1 SCC 121, however, the said
                          judgement is wholly inapplicable to the present case. First and
                          foremost, it does not deal with the provision such as Regulation 15 of
                          Regulations 1977. Secondly, it is not in the hands of an accused to

                           control the length of time for which a criminal trial proceeds and
                          therefore it is extremely dangerous to link the date of the judgement
                          for the purpose of commencement of the period which is to be counted
                          for pensionary benefits. Thirdly and importantly, in the said case the
                          accused was convicted by the Trial Court and then suspended and
                          finally reinstated on acquittal by the Sessions Court. In this
                          background, the Supreme Court held that if an employee is convicted
                          by the Trial Court and subsequently acquitted in an appeal, department
                          cannot be faulted for having kept him out of service, since the law
                          obliges a person convicted of an offence to be kept out and not
                          retained in service. In this background, the Supreme Court held that
                          the department cannot be made liable to pay for the period for which it
                          did not avail the services of the employee and the High Court erred in
                          allowing back wages. In the present case, Petitioner was acquitted by
                          the Trial Court as contrasted to the facts in the aforementioned case.


                          11.   It was further submitted that Petitioner is now 75 years of age
                          and suffering from various ailments. He has already suffered for
                          several years on account of a false and illegal charge sheet issued by
                          the department as well as by the CBI, both of which stand quashed by
                          the respective Courts, vindicating the stand of the Petitioner that he
                          was innocent. There is thus no impediment in the way of the Petitioner
                          in getting the reliefs sought for in the present petition.

                          12.   Per contra, learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that
                          most of the terminal dues of the Petitioner have been released, details
                          of which have been given in the short affidavit. After the decision on
                          11.02.2019 to treat the period of suspension as period of service
                          without any break from the date of acquittal, further amounts towards

                           gratuity and commutation of pension/monthly pension have also been
                          released. However, Petitioner is not entitled to terminal benefits from
                          the date of superannuation for the reason that the revocation of
                          suspension was made subject to the outcome of criminal proceedings,
                          which have ended in acquittal but by giving benefit of doubt. The
                          acquittal of the Petitioner is not honourable and cannot be termed as a
                          case of "full exoneration". To support the contention, learned counsel
                          had taken the Court through the relevant passages of the judgement of
                          the Criminal Court delivered on 25.05.2018.

                          13.   It was further urged that Regulation 15(1) provides that where
                          the Competent Authority is of the view that the employee has been
                          fully exonerated or the suspension was unjustifiable, the employee
                          will be entitled to full pay together with allowances. Since in the
                          present case, it cannot be said that the Petitioner is fully exonerated,
                          he cannot be held entitled to full benefits and it is on this count that
                          the difference in the full salary and subsistence allowance has been
                          denied to the Petitioner. 
In support, reliance is placed on the
                          judgement of the Supreme Court in 
Jaipal Singh
 (supra).


 
14.   Learned counsel also placed reliance on the judgement of the
                          Supreme Court in 
Baldev Singh v. Union of India and Others
, (2005)
                          8 SCC 747, to contend that once an employee is not in actual service
                          for the period he is in custody, merely because there is an acquittal
                          does not automatically entitle him to salary for the period concerned
                          applying the principle of "no work no pay".
 
For the same proposition,
                          reliance was placed on the judgement in 
Banshi Dhar v. State of
                          Rajasthan and Another
, (2007) 1 SCC 324 and it was argued that it
                          was only from the date the CBI Court acquitted the Petitioner that his

                          reliance was placed on the judgements in 
C.R. Radhakrishnan v.
                          State of Kerala and Others
, (
2017) 13 SCC 365, Management of

SCC 541 and Methu Meda

                          15.   I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and examined
                          their contentions.

                          16.   Two issues arise for consideration before this Court originating
                          from the grievances ventilated by the Petitioner: (a) whether the
                          Petitioner is entitled to full salary for the suspension period between
                          17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000; and (b) correctness of the action of the
                          Respondent to treat the length of service as 25 years instead of 31
                          years in failing to reckon the suspension period 17.12.1994 to
                          13.12.2000, for purpose of computation of pension for the period
                          29.11.2009 to 25.05.2018.

                          17.   Narrative of facts shows that Petitioner was placed under
                          suspension on 17.12.1994 pursuant to a criminal case in which charge
                          sheet was filed in October, 1994. He remained under suspension till
                          the suspension order was revoked and he was reinstated on
                          14.12.2000, pending final adjudication in the criminal case and subject
                          to outcome of contemplated disciplinary action. Respondent initiated
                          departmental proceedings against the Petitioner by issuing a charge
                          sheet on 06.10.2008, which was quashed by this Court by a judgment
                          dated 29.10.2013 in W.P.(C) 7481/2008. Subsequently, Petitioner was
                          acquitted in the criminal case on 25.05.2018. Pertinently, Respondent

                           did not challenge the judgment dated 29.10.2013 quashing the charge
                          sheet in the departmental proceedings and the State did not challenge
                          the judgment in the criminal case, acquitting the Petitioner and thus
                          both judgments have attained finality.

                          18.   Rejection of the claims of the Petitioner by the Respondent is
                          primarily predicated on its understanding that Petitioner was not
                          'honourably' acquitted by the Trial Court and therefore does not fit in
                          the four corners of Regulation 15(1) of Regulations 1977, under which
                          an employee is entitled to full salary and allowances only upon 'full
                          exoneration' and/or where the 'suspension is found to be
                          unjustifiable'. It is on this score that the Petitioner has been denied the
                          benefit of counting the suspension period for the purpose of
                          computation of pension resulting in loss of six years and
                          allowances/increments etc. minus the payments towards subsistence
                          allowance. Counsel for the Petitioner laboured hard to establish that
                          Petitioner's acquittal was a clean acquittal and not by giving benefit of
                          doubt as the CBI Court had conducted a full-fledged trial examining
                          43 witnesses and hundreds of documents as exhibits and only on
                          detailed examination of evidence had acquitted the Petitioner, while
                          convicting 4 co-accused. In order to so demonstrate, learned counsel
                          had taken the Court through the judgment of the Criminal Court,
                          which is appended to the writ petition.

                          19.   To test the contentions of the Respondent, Regulation 15 of
                          Regulations 1977 would require an examination and the same is
                          extracted hereunder, for ready reference:-

                                        employee has been fully exonerated or that the suspension
                                       was unjustifiable, the officer employee concerned shall be
                                       granted the full pay to which he would have been entitled,
                                       had he not been suspended, together with any allowance of
                                       which he was in receipt immediately prior to his suspension,
                                       or may have been sanctioned subsequently and made
                                       applicable to all officer employees.

                                (2)    In all cases other than those referred to in sub-regulation (1),
                                       the officer employee shall be granted such proportion of pay
                                       and allowances as the competent authority may direct:

                                       Provided that the payment of allowances under this sub-
                                       regulation shall be subject to all other conditions to which
                                       such allowances are admissible;

                                       Provided further that the pay and allowances granted under
                                       this sub-regulation shall not be less than the subsistence and
                                       other allowances admissible under regulation 14.
                                (3)    (a)     In a case falling under sub-regulation (1), the
                                       period of absence from duty shall, for all purposes, be
                                       treated as a period spent on duty;

                                       (b)     In a case falling under sub-regulation (2), the period
                                       of absence from duty shall not be treated as a period spent
                                       on duty, unless the competent authority specifically directs,
                                       for reasons to be recorded in writing, that it shall be so
                                       treated for any specific purpose."

                          20.   Plain reading of Regulation 15 (1) of Regulations 1977 shows
                          that an employee concerned is entitled to full pay and allowances, if
                          he is fully exonerated or his suspension is found to be unjustifiable. It
                          is not in dispute that Respondent initially made payments to the
                          Petitioner on account of Provident Fund (Petitioner's contribution),
                          Gratuity, Leave Encashment, commutation of Pension and monthly
                          pension is also being paid. Thereafter, a decision was taken that the
                          period of suspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 will be treated as
                          period of service without any break for the purpose of Gratuity and
                          Pension from the date of acquittal in criminal proceedings i.e.
                          25.05.2018 and pursuant thereto additional terminal benefits towards

                           paid. Therefore, the dispute that remains to be resolved between the
                          parties is with respect to the salary for the suspension period minus the
                          subsistence allowance paid and counting of the period for computation
                          of Pension, which is required to be decided in light of the defence of
                          the Respondent that Petitioner's acquittal is not a clean acquittal and
                          doctrine of 'no work no pay'.

 
21.   Impugned order shows that Respondent has placed reliance on
                          the judgment of the Supreme Court in 
Jaipal Singh
 (supra), where the
                          Supreme Court held that where an employee gets involved in a
                          criminal case and after initial conviction gets acquitted on an appeal,
                          Department cannot be faulted with for having kept him out of service
                          and cannot be made liable to pay for the period for which it could not
                          avail the services of the employee. Much was argued by the
                          Respondent that the acquittal of the Petitioner is not a clean or
                          honourable acquittal and therefore no interference is warranted in the
                          exercise of discretion by the Respondent in treating the period of
                          suspension as 'not on duty' and denying the balance wages for that
                          period. In the short affidavit filed by the Respondent, a stand is taken
                          that it is only upon 'full exoneration' or in a case where period of
                          suspension is found to be unjustifiable under Regulation 15(1) read
                          with 15(3)(b) of Regulations 1977 that period of absence from duty
                          can be treated as period spent on duty and that in the present case,
                          reading of the judgement of the criminal case would show that
                          Petitioner's acquittal was not honourable so as to be termed as a case
                          of 'full exoneration'.


                          22.   Before proceeding further to examine the meaning and

                           bone of contention between the parties, Regulation 15(1) needs to be
                          seen. A plain and a close reading of the said Regulation shows that an
                          employee will be entitled to full pay and allowances on termination of
                          suspension if he is fully exonerated 'or' his suspension was
                          unjustifiable. Use of the word 'or' shows that the conditions are in the
                          alternative, which means that even where the suspension is
                          unjustifiable but an employee is fully exonerated, he would be entitled
                          to wages for the suspension period. Therefore, it needs to be examined
                          whether the Petitioner's suspension was unjustifiable and to my mind,
                          the answer to this question cannot be in favour of the Petitioner. As a
                          matter of fact, Petitioner was placed under suspension on 17.12.1994
                          in view of a charge-sheet filed by the CBI for penal offences as well
                          as for alleged acts of corruption under the 
Prevention of Corruption
                          Act, 1988
. The suspension was revoked on 16.12.2000, without
                          prejudice       to     the       criminal/disciplinary      proceedings
                          pending/contemplated with further stipulation that payment of
                          salary/wages for suspension period shall be decided upon final
                          outcome of the pending criminal proceedings and contemplated
                          disciplinary action. In view of the seriousness of the charge-sheet filed
                          by the CBI, it cannot be held that the suspension was unjustified.
                          However, the provision is not restricted to 'unjustified suspension'
                          since 
Regulation 15(1)
 entitles payment of pay and allowances where
                          there is 'full exoneration' and in light of this stipulation, the moot
                          question that requires consideration is whether Petitioner can be stated
                          to be 'fully exonerated'. The expressions 'honourable acquittal', 'fully
                          acquitted' and 'clean acquittal', were held to be unknown to 
Code of
                          Criminal Procedure
 or 
Indian Penal Code
 and were developed by

                                    the appellant, believed it to be true and considered that it ought
                                    to have been accepted by the government authorities and by the
                                    Magistrate. Further we decided that the appellant had not
                                    misappropriated the monies referred to in the charge. It is thus
                                    clear that the effect of our judgment was that the appellant was
                                    acquitted as fully and completely as it was possible for him to be
                                    acquitted. Presumably, this is equivalent to what the government
                                    authorities term "honourably acquitted"."



                          23.   
In 
Methu Meda
 (supra), the Supreme Court once again
                          examined the expression 'honourable acquittal' and held as under:-


                                "12. In view of the above, if the acquittal is directed by the court on
                                consideration of facts and material evidence on record with the
                                finding of false implication or the finding that the guilt had not been
                                proved, accepting the explanation of accused as just, it be treated as
                                honourable acquittal. In other words, if prosecution could not prove
                                the guilt for other reasons and not "honourably" acquitted by the
                                court, it be treated other than "honourable", and proceedings may
                                follow.

 
13. The expression "honourable acquittal" has been considered in
                                S. Samuthiram [State v. S. Samuthiram, (2013) 1 SCC 598 : (2013) 1
                                SCC (Cri) 566 : (2013) 1 SCC (L&S) 229] after considering the
                                judgments in RBI v. Bhopal Singh Panchal [RBI v. Bhopal Singh
                                Panchal, (1994) 1 SCC 541 : 1994 
SCC (L&S) 594] and R.P. Kapur

                                SCC OnLine SC 1 : (1972) 7 SLR 44] ; this Court observed that the
                                standard of proof required for holding a person guilty by a criminal
                                court and enquiry conducted by way of disciplinary proceeding is
                                entirely different. In a criminal case, the onus of establishing guilt of
                                the accused is on the prosecution, until proved beyond reasonable
                                doubt. In case, the prosecution failed to take steps to examine
                                crucial witnesses or the witnesses turned hostile, such acquittal
                                would fall within the purview of giving benefit of doubt and the
                                accused cannot be treated as honourably acquitted by the criminal
                                court. While, in a case of departmental proceedings, the guilt may be

                                provide so."




                          24.   
In 
Deputy Inspector General of Police and Another v. S.
                          Samuthiram
, (2013) 1 SCC 598, the Supreme Court held that if a
                          person is acquitted or discharged, it cannot always be inferred that he
                          was falsely implicated and unless it is an honourable acquittal,
                          benefits cannot be claimed. In 
the said judgment
, the Supreme Court
                          once again examined the meaning and connotation of the expression
                          'honourable acquittal' and held as follows:-


                                "10. Shri C. Paramasivam, learned counsel appearing for the
                                appellant, submitted that the High Court was not justified in
                                interfering with disciplinary proceedings and setting aside the order
                                of dismissal of the respondent. The learned counsel submitted that
                                the High Court overlooked the fact that the standard of proof in a
                                domestic enquiry and criminal enquiry is different. The mere
                                acquittal by the criminal court does not entitle the delinquent for
                                exoneration in the disciplinary proceedings. The learned counsel
                                also submitted that the case in hand is not where punishment of
                                dismissal was imposed on the basis of conviction in a criminal trial
                                and only in such situation, acquittal by a court in a criminal trial
                                would have some relevance. Further, it was also pointed out that, in
                                the instant case, the respondent was not honourably acquitted by the
                                criminal court, but was acquitted since the complainant turned
                                hostile."

 
25.   From the conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, the principles
                          that cumulatively emerge are that where the acquittal by a criminal
                          court is on consideration of facts and evidence on record, both oral
                          and documentary, with the finding that the guilt has not been proved,
                          accepting the stand of the accused as just it will be treated as
                          honourable acquittal. As held in 
Methu Meda
 (supra), if the
                          prosecution is unable to prove the guilt for other reasons then it is not
                          an honourable acquittal and for coming to this conclusion, the
                          Supreme Court took strength from the observations of an earlier

                           judgment in S. Samuthiram (supra), wherein the Supreme Court held
                          that if the prosecution fails to take steps to examine crucial witnesses
                          or where the witnesses turn hostile, such acquittal would fall within
                          the purview of giving benefit of doubt and the accused cannot be
                          treated as honourably acquitted.


                          26.   I have perused the judgement of the criminal court in light of
                          the above principles. It is seen from the judgement that CBI had
                          charge-sheeted several people including the accused for offences
                          punishable under Sections 420/467/468/471 read with 120-B 
IPC
 and
                          
Section 13(i)(d)
 read with 
Section 13(2)
 of the Prevention of
                          Corruption Act, 1988. In a nutshell, the charge was that during 1989,
                          M/s PFLL represented by its Director conspired with officers of the
                          Respondent Bank and obtained loan of Rs.26,67,694/- on the basis of
                          forged documents and advance to the tune of Rs.16,30,900/- was
                          given against five vehicles to M/s Geetanjali Motors Ltd. on the basis
                          of forged bills and an amount of Rs.10,36,794/- was given for
                          purchase of three vehicles on duplicate bills of Rasna Automobile (P)
                          Ltd. and neither of the two firms purchased or sold the vehicles. There
                          were 8 accused in the matter and the prosecution examined 43
                          witnesses along with a plethora of documentary evidence. Defence
                          also examined several witnesses and produced documentary evidence.
                          By a detailed judgement dated 25.05.2018, the Trial Court held that
                          prosecution had succeeded in proving its case against 4 accused
                          beyond reasonable doubt and convicted them whereas the Petitioner
                          along with Kuldeep Singh Malik were acquitted of all charges by
                          giving benefit of doubt. From paragraph 155 onwards, the Trial Court
                          has dealt with the case of the Petitioner who was working as Manager

                           (loans) in the Bank and after examining the entire evidence and the
                          arguments of the prosecution and the defence, rendered a finding that
                          loan amounts with respect to five vehicles were already processed and
                          released prior to the joining of the Petitioner as admitted by the
                          prosecution and proved by D2W1 through mark 'D2W1/3' that
                          Petitioner took charge of the Department of Loans on 22.07.1989 prior
                          to which drawing power with respect to five vehicles was already
                          entered into and released and therefore he could have no role or
                          authority for approval of the agreements relating to the first five
                          vehicles. Trial Court concluded that the act of the Petitioner in signing
                          the agreements at subsequent stage can be termed as an irregularity on
                          his part but criminality cannot be attributed to him on this account and
                          the only role that comes up in relation to the transaction of five
                          vehicles is that Petitioner signed the agreements considering it a mere
                          formality and therefore he cannot be held accountable.

                          27.   Insofar as the transaction with respect to the second tranche of
                          three vehicles is concerned, the Trial Court noted that during October,
                          1989, documents were submitted in the Bank relating to finance of
                          three vehicles, loans No.169, 170 and 171, which were not purchased
                          by M/s. PFLL and it is also true that Petitioner had signed and
                          approved the three agreements and drawing powers were accordingly
                          enhanced. Having so observed, the Trial Court further notes that the
                          relevant documents i.e. invoices, receipts and insurance cover notes
                          annexed to the agreements were not forged as they were procured
                          from authorized places and persons, but later the payments were
                          stopped towards the seller and insurer, resulting in cancellation of
                          invoices and the documents were misused by Sushil Kumar Gupta,

                           accused No.4, to cheat the Bank. In this backdrop, Trial Court held
                          that it is quite possible that Petitioner was not personally knowing
                          about the factum of stop payment of cheques by M/s. PFLL towards
                          purchase money of vehicles and insurance premium and therefore
                          element of doubt arises and it cannot be concluded that Petitioner has
                          acted dishonestly in favour of M/s. PFLL, particularly, when it is
                          evident that Senior Officer V.K. Bhutiani, accused No.1 was
                          instrumental in handling the accounts of PFLL. It was further held that
                          the Directors of M/s. PFLL have successfully defrauded the Bank with
                          collusion of Senior Manager and the role of the Petitioner appears to
                          be doubtful in the entire transaction and he is therefore entitled to
                          benefit of doubt.

                          28.   On a close examination of the findings of the Trial Court, I am
                          of the view that there is merit in the contention of the Petitioner that
                          the prosecution despite producing 43 witnesses and hundreds of
                          documents, was unable to establish the guilt of the Petitioner. The
                          Trial Court has, upon examination of evidence, both oral and
                          documentary, held that Petitioner cannot be held accountable for
                          signing the agreements with respect to five vehicles, pertaining to
                          which all necessary formalities stood completed even before he joined
                          the Bank and therefore had no role in the transactions. With respect to
                          the second transaction of three vehicles, it is clearly brought forth in
                          the judgment that while the Petitioner had signed the agreements, the
                          documents pertaining thereto such as the invoices, etc. were neither
                          forged nor procured from unauthorized places/persons and it was later
                          that accused No.4 had misused the documents to cheat the Bank and
                          the Petitioner perhaps had no knowledge either of the stop payment of

                           cheques by M/s. PFLL towards purchase money or insurance premium
                          of the vehicles and it cannot be concluded that he had acted
                          dishonestly. Trial Court found culpability with respect to 6 accused
                          and convicted them while acquitting the Petitioner and to my mind,
                          the mere use of the words 'benefit of doubt' cannot be read out of
                          context and superfluously and will have to be given a meaning on a
                          holistic reading of the judgement, where the Trial Court did not find
                          that any culpability could be attached to the Petitioner.

                          29.   Furthermore, it is not a case where the prosecution has failed to
                          take steps to examine crucial witnesses or the witnesses turned hostile,
                          etc., which are the category of cases in which the Supreme Court has
                          held that an acquittal will not be termed as an honourable acquittal.

 
30.   There is yet another aspect of the matter. It is true that even
                          after an acquittal in a criminal case, an employee can be subjected to
                          departmental proceedings and if found guilty of the misconduct,
                          action can be taken in accordance with the rules and regulations
                          governing disciplinary proceedings. Once a departmental proceeding
                          is initiated, even on the same allegations for which there is acquittal
                          and results in a finding of guilt and imposition of penalty, it is
                          certainly open to an employer to pass an order directing that the
                          employee will not be entitled to back wages for the suspension period
                          and treat the suspension period as not spent on duty and/or any other
                          consequence permissible in law. However, in the present case

                                    performance of an officer is unsatisfactory or inadequate or
                                    where there is a bona fide suspicion about his integrity or where
                                    his retention in the Bank's service is prejudicial to interests of
                                    the disciplinary procedure. Other sub-regulations of Regulation
                                    20 provide for the mode and manner in which such termination
                                    may be effected as also his entitlement to prefer an appeal

                                    prescribes a period of notice.

                                    15. Sub-regulation (3) of

, however, places an

                                    authority and a notice or resignation given by such an officer
                                    before or during the disciplinary proceedings shall not take

                                 substance acts as a proviso to Clause (i) thereof.

                                16. Clause (iii) of sub-regulation (3) of 
Regulation 20
 is an
                                independent provision. It provides for continuation of the
                                disciplinary proceedings. Such disciplinary proceedings
                                indisputably for the purpose of applicability of sub-regulation
                                (3) must have been initiated in terms of the 1976 Regulations.

                                17. It is worth noticing the distinction between terminologies
                                "proceeding pending" or "proceeding initiated". Clause (ii) of
                                sub-regulation (3) of 
Regulation 20
 defines what would be
                                pending viz. for the purpose of attracting Clause (i) thereof.

                                18. A disciplinary proceeding is initiated in terms of the 1976
                                Regulations, which are applicable only in a case where a
                                proceeding is initiated for the purpose of taking disciplinary
                                action against a delinquent officer for the purpose of imposing a
                                punishment on him. Disciplinary proceedings, thus, are initiated
                                only in terms of the 1976 Regulations and not in terms of the
                                1979 Regulations.

                                19. It is worth noticing that the 1979 Regulations would be
                                attracted when no disciplinary proceeding is possible to be
                                initiated. The 1976 Regulations, however, on the other hand,
                                would be attracted when a disciplinary proceeding is initiated.
                                Both operate in separate fields. We do not see any nexus
                                between Regulations 20(1) and 20(2) of the 1979 Regulations
                                and the 1976 Regulations.

                                20. The 1976 Regulations provide for the mode and manner in
                                which a disciplinary proceeding is initiated. It expressly
                                provides for service of charge-sheet. Service of charge-sheet is a
                                necessary ingredient for initiation of disciplinary proceedings. A
                                preliminary enquiry is not contemplated under the 1976
                                Regulations. If such an enquiry is held, the same is only for the
                                purpose of arriving at a satisfaction on the part of the
                                disciplinary authority to initiate a proceeding and not for any
                                other purpose.

                                21. If it is found that a disciplinary proceeding can be and
                                should be initiated, recourse to the 1976 Regulations would
                                have to be taken, if not, the 1979 Regulations may be resorted to
                                if the conditions precedent therefor are satisfied. It is only with
                                a view to put an embargo on the officer to leave his job, Clause

                                 Regulations are required to be resorted to.

                                23. The 1979 Regulations would be attracted only for the
                                purpose of termination of service. Had the intention of the
                                regulation-making authority been that the legal fiction created
                                under Clause (ii) of sub-regulation (3) of 
Regulation 20
 would
                                cover both Clauses (i) and (iii), the same should have been
                                placed only after Clause (iii). In such an event, Clause (ii) of
                                sub-regulation (3) of 
Regulation 20
 should have been differently
                                worded. Some non obstante clause would have been provided
                                for making an exception to the applicability of the 1976
                                Regulations when a legal fiction is created, although it is
                                required to be taken to the logical conclusion (see East End
                                Dwellings Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury Borough Council [1952 AC 109
                                : (1951) 2 All ER 587 (HL)] ), but the same would not mean that
                                the effect thereof would be extended so as to transgress the
                                scope and purport for which it is created.

                                           xxxx           xxxx            xxxx            xxxx

                                29. In terms of the 1976 Regulations drawing up of a charge-
                                sheet by the disciplinary authority is the first step for initiation
                                of a disciplinary proceeding. Unless and until, therefore, a
                                charge-sheet is drawn up, a disciplinary proceeding for the
                                purpose of the 1976 Regulations cannot be initiated. Drawing
                                up of a charge-sheet, therefore, is the condition precedent for
                                initiation of a disciplinary proceeding. We have noticed in para
                                15 of our judgment that ordinarily no disciplinary proceedings
                                can be continued in absence of any rule after an employee
                                reaches his age of superannuation. A rule which would enable
                                the disciplinary authority to continue a disciplinary proceeding
                                despite the officers reaching the age of superannuation must be
                                a statutory rule. A fortiori it must be a rule applicable to
                                disciplinary proceedings.

                                30. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the employer
                                may take resort to a preliminary inquiry, but it will bear
                                repetition to state that the same has a limited role to play. But,
                                in absence of the statutory rules operating in the field, resorting
                                to a preliminary enquiry would not by itself be enough to hold
                                that a departmental proceeding has been initiated.

                                31. Initiation of a disciplinary proceeding may lead to an evil or
                                civil consequence. Thus, in absence of clear words, the court
                                must lean in favour of an interpretation which has been applied
                                by this Court in the main judgment." (underlining added).

 
8.     Since the admitted facts in this case are that chargesheet was
                           issued to the petitioner only on 06.10.2008 i.e well after
                           superannuation of the petitioner on 30.06.2007, therefore, in terms

                                 proceedings are initiated only on issuance of a chargesheet and not
                                on issuing of show cause notice, and therefore, disciplinary
                                proceedings could not be validly initiated in terms of the chargesheet
                                issued after the superannuation of the petitioner. The impugned
                                chargesheet is therefore liable to be and is accordingly quashed for
                                this reason itself.


                                9.      I may note that the basic charges against the petitioner with
                                respect to the chargesheet issued on 06.10.2008 were with respect to
                                factual allegations of the year 1989 i.e roughly 19 years earlier and
                                when petitioner was the employee of his then employer M/s New
                                Bank of India and which bank subsequently merged with the present
                                respondent no. 1-Punjab National Bank. Since the charge sheet itself
                                is quashed, and therefore there are no valid disciplinary proceedings
                                against the petitioner, the respondent no. 1-bank also cannot invoke
                                
Regulation 20(3)(iii)
 to retain the retirement benefits of the
                                petitioner.

                                10.     In view of the above, writ petition is allowed by quashing of
                                the charge sheet dated 06.10.2008 issued against the petitioner and
                                directing that petitioner be paid his retiremental benefits alongwith
                                interest @ 6% per annum simple on the retiremental dues payable
                                with effect from 01.07.2007 and till the amount is paid to the
                                petitioner. Parties are liable to bear their own costs."

                          31.   From a reading of the judgement, it is explicitly clear that the
                          charge sheet was quashed by the Court on the ground that the
                          Regulations did not permit the issuance of the same and since it was
                          without jurisdiction, no liberty was granted to the Respondent to
                          reinitiate the disciplinary proceedings by issuing a fresh charge sheet.
                          It is an admitted position that the judgement was not challenged by the
                          Respondent perhaps because it was realized that the issuance of the
                          charge sheet was illegal. The net result is that neither in the
                          departmental proceedings nor before the criminal court, Respondent
                          has succeeded in proving the allegations/culpability against the
                          Petitioner and he will be covered under the expression 'fully
                          exonerated' within the meaning of 
Regulation 15(1)
 and therefore the
                          impugned action of denying him the back wages for the suspension
                          period minus the subsistence allowance is illegal and unjustified.

                           32.   Insofar as the claim of the Petitioner for computing the period
                          of suspension from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 for the purpose of
                          pension is concerned, the same is also valid. Respondent has already
                          treated the said period towards qualifying service for pension but has
                          denied the same for computation of pension as a result of which the
                          length of service for calculation has been taken as 25 years instead of
                          31 years. Order dated 11.02.2019 counting the period of suspension
                          towards qualifying service for calculation of terminal dues is extracted

In 
Dinesh Kumar Kain v. Assistant General Manager, Corpn
                          Bank & Anr.
, 2006 SCC OnLine Del 448, this Court while dealing
                          with a similar issue pertaining to a pari materia regulation, held the
                          Petitioner entitled to counting the suspension period for the purpose of
                          seniority, increments, etc. In the said case, Petitioner sought quashing
                          of an order by which his claim for treating the period of suspension on
                          duty with consequential benefits of back wages etc. was rejected.
                          Petitioner was arrested and remanded to judicial custody for alleged
                          offences under 
Prevention of Corruption Act
. He was placed under
                          suspension on arrest awaiting the outcome of the trial but no
                          departmental proceedings were initiated. Petitioner was reinstated into

                           service and subsequently he was acquitted of the charges. Invoking
                          
Regulation 15 (1)
 of the Corporation Bank Officer Employees'
                          (Discipline & Appeal) Regulations, 1982, Respondent decided not to
                          treat the period of suspension on duty and pay and allowances for the
                          said period were also declined. Period of suspension was, however,
                          reckoned for limited purpose of continuity of service for Gratuity and
                          Pension and no other purpose. It needs a mention that Regulations
                          15(1) and (2) in the said case are pari materia to the Regulations in
                          this case. The stand of the Respondent was that on a combined reading
                          of Regulations 15(1) and (2), no employee can claim full back wages
                          for the suspension occasioned by the criminal trial where the acquittal
                          was after giving benefit of doubt.


                          34.    The Court after examining the Regulations and the facts of the
                          case including the order passed by the Respondent, whereby the
                          period of suspension was treated to reckon for limited purpose of
                          continuity of service for Gratuity and Pension and no other purpose,
                          held that depriving the Petitioner of continuity of service for the
                          purpose of consequential benefits of seniority, increments and other
                          normal benefits would be oppressive and arbitrary.

                          35.   This Court cannot disagree with the Respondent on the
                          proposition of law that grant of back wages and/or treatment of
                          suspension period as spent on duty or otherwise is a discretion which
                          the employer is entitled to exercise and in fact, is the domain of the
                          employer. To this extent, the judgements relied upon by the
                          Respondent need not be again referred to as the principle is fairly well
                          settled to be open to any debate. However, it is equally well settled
                          that discretion has to be judiciously exercised and an arbitrary exercise

                           of discretion is open to interference by a Court in judicial review
                          under 
Article 226
 of the Constitution of India which is an equity
                          jurisdiction. The impugned order shows that the Respondent has not
                          exercised the jurisdiction judiciously and has applied the doctrine of
                          'no work no pay' without examining the facts of the present case. It is
                          true that the Petitioner was not working during the suspension period
                          but that was on account of the suspension order issued by the
                          Respondent since at that stage the criminal case was pending.
                          However, when the impugned order was passed, the facts were on
                          record and in knowledge of the Respondent that the criminal case had
                          resulted in an acquittal and the charge sheet in the departmental
                          proceedings stood quashed. At this stage, to invoke the doctrine of 'no
                          work no pay', in my view, was completely arbitrary and illegal.
                          
Regulation 15(1)
 and (3) of Regulations 1977 does entitle the
                          Respondent to deny back wages for the suspension period and/or
                          treating the period as not spent on duty, but by a plain reading of the
                          Regulation, it is clear that the provisions do not fetter grant of the said
                          reliefs. These are enabling provisions permitting the Respondent to
                          grant relief to an employee in case of full exoneration or where the
                          suspension period is unjustified. In light of the two judicial orders in
                          favour of the Petitioner, the question that begs an answer is whether
                          the exercise of discretion to deny reliefs to the Petitioner was judicious
                          and the answer can only be in the negative.

                          36.   Learned counsel for the Respondent placed reliance on several
                          judgements of the Supreme Court which are 
referred to above
 in
                          paragraphs 13 and 14. The common thread that runs in the said
                          judgements is that in case the acquittal is not honourable, the

                           employer has the discretion to deny benefits to the employee and the
                          grant of service benefit is not automatic. It bears repetition to state that
                          there can be no quarrel on this binding dictum of the Supreme Court.
                          However, in the facts of the present case and in the light of the two
                          judgements in favour of the Petitioner, one of this Court pertaining to
                          disciplinary proceedings and the other of the Trial Court with respect
                          to criminal proceedings, the Respondent cannot take the aid of these
                          judgements to deny the benefit of reliefs claimed by the Petitioner in
                          the present petition.

                          37.   For all the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition is allowed
                          quashing the impugned order dated 21.01.2019 and holding that
                          Petitioner will be entitled to back wages for the suspension period,
                          minus the amounts paid towards subsistence allowance and the
                          suspension period from 17.12.1994 to 13.12.2000 will be treated as
                          spent on duty. Accordingly, this period will be computed towards
                          calculation of pensionary benefits and in light of this, Respondent is
                          directed to refix the salary and emoluments of the Petitioner from
                          1994 giving benefits of increments and pay revisions, wherever
                          applicable and release the arrears of pension calculated after taking six
                          additional years of service towards computation of pensionary
                          benefits.

                          38.   Writ petition stands disposed of with no orders as to costs.
