 ORAL JUDGMENT:-


 1.        This is an Application moved by the State, seeking recall

 of the order dated 24th February 2025 passed by the

 Additional Sessions Judge at Dindoshi (Borivali Division),

 Goregaon, Mumbai in Criminal Bail Application No.119 of

 2025 in C.R. No.1309 of 2024 registered with D.N. Nagar

 Police Station. Vide the said order, the Sessions Court,

 Mumbai has enlarged the Respondent-Accused on bail subject

 to the conditions mentioned therein. By way of the present

 Application, the State seeks cancellation of the said bail order

 on several grounds. The Respondent-Accused, along with 2

 other accused, is alleged to have committed offences

 punishable under Sections 70(1), 115(2), 351(2), 123, 3(5)

 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.





 2.        There is also an Intervention Application (St) No.19317

 of 2025 made on behalf of the Victim-Complainant seeking to

 intervene in the present Application and advance submissions.

 The said Intervention Application is allowed.

 3.         As per the prosecution, the offending part of the

 Impugned Order is contained in paragraph nos.5, 6 and 7

 which read as thus:





           "5.       The learned Advocate for accused drawn
           attention to the medical papers filed alongwith charge-
           sheet and submitted that medical examination of the
           victim was immediately conducted and no fresh injury
           was found, which prima facie show that there was no
           such incident happened as alleged by the informant.



           6.       From the story narrated in first information
           report prima facie it appears that relations between
           informant and accused Shabbir Rangunwala were since
           long Informant was knowing him since ten years. She
           went to him on his call voluntarily. In the history no
           previous incident from him is narrated. On the basis of
           medical evidence though there are external injuries
           found    on     person        of    informant,    then       also     on
           examination of private parts of the informant no fresh
           injuries was seen. Informant was examined by medical
           officer immediately on 10.12.2024. It is within 24
           hours of the alleged incident.

           7.       Investigation of the case is now completed.
           Trial would take its own time. In such circumstances. I
           am of the opinion that basis allegations are against
           accused Mustafa Rangunwala of assault and forceful
           sexual     intercourse          with         informant.       In      such
           circumstances indefinite detention of the applicant is
           not required. Taking into consideration the grounds
           that marriage of the applicant is scheduled on 01.03.
           2025, I am of the opinion that by imposing stringent
           conditions applicant may be released on bail. Hence, I
           proceed to pass the following order:"



 4.         Ms. Megha Bajoria, learned APP representing the State,

 submits that there are several infirmities in the said bail order,

 which are as follows:





 (i)        According to her, the Trial Court has not appreciated the

 medical evidence in respect of the Victim-Complainant in its

 proper perspective inasmuch as that the Trial Court has held

 that although, there are external injuries found on the person

 of the Victim-Complainant, no fresh injuries are seen on her

 private parts;

 (ii)      The Trial Court failed to appreciate the statement of the

 Victim-Complainant recorded under 
Section 164
 of the Code

 of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ('
Cr.P.C
.' for short);




 (iii) That the marriage of the Respondent-Accused is

 scheduled on 1st March 2025 cannot be the basis for grant of

 bail to the Respondent-Accused;





 (iv) The premises in which the alleged act/offence took

 place, were rented premises of the Respondent-Accused;




 (v)       A Mobile phone containing indecent photos of the

 Victim-Complainant, was recovered from Accused no.1. The

 said photographs were part of the supplementary charge-

 sheet, yet the Trial Court failed to consider them;




 (vi) The statement of the uncle of the Victim-Complainant

 specifically stating that the Victim-Complainant tried to

 contact him for help, lending credibility to the story of the

 victim, has not been considered at all by the Trial Court;

 (vii) Medical report of the Victim-Complainant clearly shows,

 injuries on her head. The final opinion of the Doctor also

 records evidence of physical violence in terms of the head

 injury, scratch marks, etc., on her person, which has been

 totally overlooked by the Trial Court;





 5.        In support of her submissions, Ms. Bajoria has tendered

 the entire charge-sheet including the supplementary charge-

 sheet. The same are taken on record. She thus, submits that

 despite all the aforesaid aspects being part of the charge-

 sheet/supplementary charge-sheet and despite the fact that

 minimum punishment for the said offence is 20 years, the

 Trial Court allowed the Bail Application. She submits that the

 Trial Court thus, erred in granting bail to the Respondent-

 Accused.





 6.        Mr. Shivamsinh Deshmukh, learned counsel appearing

 for the Intervenor, supports the contentions of Ms. Bajoria.

 Additionally, he submits that common intention of committing

 the offence of gang rape is implicit, right from the beginning

 as seen from the conduct of all three Accused. He drew my

 attention to the spot panchanama, which reveals that there

 was a ladies undergarment, found at the spot of the incident.

 He also drew my attention to the statement of the owner of

 the flat, who states that the flat was rented out to the

 Respondent No. 1- Accused. He placed on record several

 decisions of the Supreme Court, in support of his arguments.

 He thus, prays that the bail granted to the Respondent-

 Accused, be cancelled.





 7.        Per contra, Mr. Shlok Saraogi, learned counsel appearing

 for the Respondent-Accused defended the impugned order. He

 submits that there are discrepancies in the FIR and the

 statement of the Victim-Complainant recorded under 
Section

 164
 of the Cr.P.C. inasmuch as the victim has improved her

 story in her 164 statement. He also submits that the Victim-

 Complainant is said to have telephoned her brother before

 11.30 p.m. but in the CCTV footage, she was seen entering the

 building at 11.31 p.m. He thus, supports the order passed by

 the Trial Court and prays that the Application be rejected.




 8.        Heard all the counsels for the parties and perused the

 record with their assistance. Upon taking into account the

 entirety of the case, it appears that the impugned order

 requires intercession. A plain reading of the order reveals that

 the Respondent-Accused was enlarged on bail, without

 examining all material aspects placed by the prosecution

 before the Trial Court by way of filing the charge-sheet and

 the supplementary charge-sheet.





 
9.        Recently, the Supreme Court in the case of 
Shabeen

 Ahmad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.1
 while placing

 reliance upon the case of 
Ajwar v. Waseem2
, cancelled the bail

 granted to the accused in a dowry death case, observing as

 follows:




 
"15...... A superficial application of bail parameters
           not only undermines the gravity of the offence itself
           but also risks weakening public faith in the judiciary's

           resolve to combat the menace of dowry deaths. It is
           this very perception of justice, both within and outside
           the courtroom, that courts must safeguard, lest we
           risk normalizing a crime        that continues to claim
           numerous innocent lives. These observations
           regarding grant of bail in grievous crimes were
           thoroughly dealt with by this Court in 
Ajwar v.
           Waseem
 in the following paras:


 
"26. While considering as to whether bail ought to
               be granted in a matter involving a serious criminal
               offence, the Court must consider relevant factors
               like the nature of the accusations made against the
               accused, the manner in which the crime is alleged
               to have been committed, the gravity of the offence,
               the role attributed to the accused, the criminal
               antecedents of the accused, the probability of
               tampering of the witnesses and repeating the
               offence, if the accused are released on bail, the
               likelihood of the accused being unavailable in the
               event bail is granted, the possibility of obstructing
               the proceedings and evading the courts of justice
               and the overall desirability of releasing the accused
               on bail. [Refer : 
Chaman Lal v. State of U.P.
               [Chaman Lal
 v. State of U.P., [(2004) 7 SCC 525];
               
Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan
 [(2004) 7
               SCC 528]; 
Masroor v. State of U.P.
 [(2009) 14 SCC
               286]; 
Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee

               [(2010) 14 SCC 496]; 
Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P.

) [(2018) 12 SCC 129]; 
Mahipal v.
               Rajesh Kumar
 [(2020) 2 SCC 118].


              27. It is equally well settled that bail once granted,
              ought not to be cancelled in a mechanical manner.

              However, an unreasoned or perverse order of bail
              is always open to interference by the superior
              court. If there are serious allegations against the
              accused, even if he has not misused the bail
              granted to him, such an order can be cancelled by
              the same Court that has granted the bail. Bail can
              also be revoked by a superior court if it transpires
              that the courts below have ignored the relevant
              material available on record or not looked into the
              gravity of the offence or the impact on the society
              resulting in such an order. 
In 
P v. State of M.P.

              [(2022) 15 SCC 211] decided by a three-Judge
              Bench of this Court [authored by one of us (Hima
              Kohli, J.)] has spelt out the considerations that
              must weigh with the Court for interfering in an
              order granting bail to an accused under 
Section
              439(1)
CrPC in the following words : (SCC p. 224,
              para 24)
                   "24.
 
As can be discerned from the above
                   decisions, for cancelling bail once granted, the
                   court must consider whether any supervening
                   circumstances have arisen or the conduct of the
                   accused post grant of bail demonstrates that it
                   is no longer conducive to a fair trial to permit
                   him to retain his freedom by enjoying the
                   concession of bail during trial [
Dolat Ram v.
                   State of Haryana
, (1995) 1 SCC 349] . To put it
                   differently, in ordinary circumstances, this Court
                   would be loathe to interfere with an order
                   passed by the court below granting bail but if
                   such an order is found to be illegal or perverse
                   or premised on material that is irrelevant, then
                   such an order is susceptible to scrutiny and

              Considerations for setting aside bail orders

              28.        The considerations that weigh with the
              appellate court for setting aside the bail order on
              an application being moved by the aggrieved party
              include any supervening circumstances that may
              have occurred after granting relief to the accused,
              the conduct of the accused while on bail, any
              attempt on the part of the accused to
              procrastinate, resulting in delaying the trial, any
              instance of threats being extended to the witnesses
              while on bail, any attempt on the part of the
              accused to tamper with the evidence in any
              manner. We may add that this list is only
              illustrative and not exhaustive. However, the court
              must be cautious that at the stage of granting bail,
              only a prima facie case needs to be examined and
              detailed reasons relating to the merits of the case
              that may cause prejudice to the accused, ought to
              be avoided. Suffice it is to state that the bail order
              should reveal the factors that have been
              considered by the Court for granting relief to the
              accused."                      (Emphasis Supplied)



 10.       I have gone through the FIR as well as the statement of

 the Victim-Complainant recorded under 
Section 164
 of the

 Cr.P.C. The Victim-Complainant has narrated the entire sordid

 ordeal faced by her at the hands of the three accused in the

 criminal case. A plain reading of the FIR as well as the

 statement of the Victim-Complainant recorded under 
Section

 164
 of the Cr.P.C. clearly reveal that although she went to the

 said flat voluntarily with           Accused no.1, being her friend,

 accompanied by the Respondent-Accused, she was given a

 spiked drink, after which she was taken to the bathroom and

 beaten up by accused no.1. She fell and banged her head on

 the commode. Thereafter, she was disrobed, brought on the

 bed, her hands were tied, her mobile phone was taken away

 and she was brutally raped by all the three accused. The 164

 statement is consistent with the averments in the FIR. The

 medical report shown to me by Ms. Bajoria also indicates an

 injury on left side of her head. Findings of the doctor also

 demonstrate evidence of physical violence in terms of a head

 injury along with other scratches and other injuries found on

 her person. The statement of the Victim-Complainant's uncle

 also corroborates that of the Victim-Complainant. The spot

 panchanama of the incident also records the items found lying

 in the house, which include a pink colour ladies underwear

 along with an old monk bottle, some cigarrette buds, a hair

 scrunchy, bed-sheet, etc. Statement of the landlord of the flat

 also makes it clear that the said flat was rented out to the

 Respondent-Accused.





 11.       I have also perused the decisions of the Supreme Court

 relied upon by the Intervenor.





 12.       What bothers me the most is the considerations which

 are weighed by the Trial Court while writing the impugned

 order. The Trial Court has considered only two aspects;

 Firstly, that there are no injuries on the private part of the

 Victim-Complainant albeit, the Trial Judge does record

 injuries on the person of the Victim-Complainant as

 appearing in the medical report; Secondly, the Trial Court

 appears to have been swayed by the fact that the marriage

 of the Respondent-Accused is scheduled in the near future.

 Ms. Bajoria insists, even if that ground is considered as

 tenable, it was a misleading statement as till date, no

 marriage         of    the    Respondent-Accused         is    solemnized.

 However, the fact that the Trial Court has considered this as

 a parameter for grant of bail itself, is somewhat troubling.

 The Respondent-Accused was arrested on 9 th December

 2024 and was released on bail on 24 th February 2025, i.e.,

 within a period of 2 and half months from the date of his

 arrest on the ground that his marriage was scheduled in

 March 2025, despite all the material on record prima facie

 indicting the Respondent-Accused. Furthermore, the offence

 is that of gang rape. The alleged acts attributed to the

 Respondent-Accused are heinous. Considering the totality of

 the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Trial Court has

 ignored the relevant material available on record and failed

 to consider the gravity of the offence.



 13.       The statute as well as a series of decision of the apex

 court and various high court have well settled the

 parameters for the grant of bail to an under trial.

 Impending marriage of an accused is not one of them.

              14.       Accordingly, for the reasons as stated aforesaid, the

              impugned order is set aside and the order granting bail to

              the Respondent-Accused is cancelled.



              15.       The Respondent-Accused is directed to surrender

              before the Investigating Officer latest within two days from

              the date of uploading of this order.
