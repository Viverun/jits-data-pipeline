                 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE HARISH KUMAR
                                       ORAL ORDER
3   27-01-2025
                   Heard learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the

                   petitioner and Mr. Satyendra Narayan Singh, learned Additional

                   Public Prosecutor for the State.



                                2. The application for grant of bail to the petitioner

                   who is in custody in connection with Balia P.S. Case No. 89 of

                   2022 registered for the offence punishable under 
Sections 302
,

                   
304B
, 
498A
, 
201
, 
120B
 and 
34
 of the Indian Penal Code.


                                3. Based upon the written report the prosecution

                   alleges that the marriage of the daughter of the informant was

                   solemnized with the petitioner five years ago. On 30.03.2022, at

                   about 02:00pm, the petitioner has informed the informant that

                   some dispute has arisen between the petitioner and his wife and

                   thus, request has been made to her to materialize the same.

                   Despite the effort taken by the informant to contact her

                   daughter, she could not contact as her mobile phone came to be

                                            2/4





          switched off. Soon thereafter, the informant alongwith other

          family members reached at the matrimonial home of the victim,

          but they did not find her. It is further alleged that the petitioner

          alongwith other accused have killed the victim and her two

          female children and left the home. Prior to the alleged

          occurrence the deceased was subjected to demand of dowry.


                       4. Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the

          petitioner contended that admittedly even as per the narrations

          made in the FIR the informant was informed on 30.03.2022 and

          soon thereafter she rushed to the matrimonial home, but

          surprisingly, the FIR has been instituted on 01.04.2022, after a

          delay of three days. The falsity of the case is also writ large for

          the simple reason that during the course of investigation it has

          transpired that the two daughters of the victim has been yet

          residing with their grand-mother. It is the contention of the

          petitioner that in fact the victim has left her matrimonial home

          without giving any information to anyone on account of a trifle.

          The dead body of the victim has neither been recovered, nor her

          trace out could be find out during the course of investigation

          and, as such, there is no material to constitute any offence much

          less under 
Section 302
 and 
304B
 of the Indian Penal Code. It is

          lastly contended that the petitioner has been incarcerated since

          18.07.2024, having absolutely fair antecedent and he undertakes

                                            3/4





          before this Court that he will fully cooperate in the proceeding

          of the Court.



                       5. On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor

          for the State vehemently opposes the bail application and submits

          that the petitioner happens to be husband of the deceased and his

          complicity cannot be ruled out, as he himself admitted the dispute

          between him and his wife, which resulting into causing her

          disappearance. Moreover, there is a demand of dowry soon before

          her disappearance and, as such, an offence of dowry death as

          provided under 
Section 304B
 of the Indian Penal Code, cannot be

          ruled out.



                       6. Regard being had to the submissions made on behalf of

          the parties and considering the written report not based on correct facts

          of causing the death of two children; in as much there is no trace out of

          the victim, whether alive or dead and the materials collected during the

          course of investigation are primarily based on suspicion of the

          complicity of the petitioner in the crime, coupled with the fair

          antecedent, let the petitioner, named above, be released on bail on or

          after framing of the charge from the Court below itself on furnishing

          bail bonds of Rs. 10,000/- (Rupees ten thousand) with two sureties of

          the like amount each to the satisfaction of learned Chief Judicial

          Magistrate, Begusarai in connection with Balia P.S. Case No. 89 of

          2022, subject to the condition that one of the bailors will be the close

                       relatives of the petitioner with further conditions which are as

                       follows:-



                                    (i) The petitioner will cooperate in conclusion of the

                       trial.

                                    (iii) He will not try to tamper with the evidence or

                       intimidate the witnesses to delay the disposal of trial.


                                    (iv) In the event of default of two consecutive dates

                       without any cogent reason, his bail bonds will liable to be

                       cancelled.



                                    (v) The court below shall verify the criminal

                       antecedent of the petitioner and in case, at any stage, it is found

                       that the petitioner has concealed his criminal antecedent, the

                       court below shall take immediate step for cancelling the bail

                       bond of the petitioner. However, the acceptance of bail bonds, in

                       terms of the above-mentioned order, shall not be delayed for this

                       purpose or in the name of verification.
