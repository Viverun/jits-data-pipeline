                           Learned Fourth Additional Sessions Judge, Bhind after trial in S.T. No.
                           237/2015 acquitted Naval Singh of alleged offence and directed lodging a
                           complaint under 
Section 340(2)(b)
 of the Cr.P.C for offence punishable under
                           
Sections 177
, 
193
, and 
195
 of the IPC against applicant Jasrath @ Dashrth and
                           his wife Laxami. Accordingly, private complaint was registered. Applicant did
                           not appear despite service of summon. Therefore, warrant of arrant and
                           permanent warrant of arrest were issued against the applicant. In compliance of
                           permanent warrant of arrest, he was arrested on 20/03/2024. He is in custody
                           ever since. The trial on complaint is underway.

                                 Learned Counsel for the applicant, in addition to the grounds mentioned

                           in the application, submits that learned Chief Judicial Magistrate has taken
                           cognizance against the applicant on 11/01/2016. Applicant was not aware of the
                           prosecution. He was never served summon or arrest warrant, therefore, he
                           could not appear before the Court. The non-appearance of the applicant is not
                           deliberate. He is ready to abide all the condition of bail imposed by the Court
                           and he will cooperate in the trial. No criminal antecedent is reported against the
                           applicant. Applicant is labourer by profession and sole bread earner of the
                           family. There is no likelihood of his absconsion leaving his family, home and
                           profession. Trial would take time to conclude. Therefore, applicant may be
                           extended the benefit of bail.

                                 Per contra, learned Counsel for the State opposes the bail application
                           on the ground of gravity of alleged offence.

                                 Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.
                                 Considering the arguments advanced by both the parties and overall
                           circumstances of the case but without commenting on merits of the case, this
                           Court is inclined to release the applicant on bail. Thus, the application is
