                          Agreement itself. Clause 2 of the Agreement provided that the balance
                          amount of Rs. 1,00,00,000/- would be paid by the plaintiff within 15 days of

                          name of the defendant by Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation
                          (hereinafter referred to as "D.S.I.D.C.") and the defendant shall deliver the
                          vacant possession of the suit property to the plaintiff thereof.

                          3.    Clause 7 of the Agreement provided that if the Conveyance Deed is
                          not received from D.S.I.D.C by 30.04.2006, the Agreement shall be treated
                          as cancelled and the first party (defendant) shall be entitled to the refund of
                          entire amount. However, it is also stated that the Agreement may be
                          extended at the discretion of the plaintiff herein. Further, Clause 9 of the
                          Agreement provided that it is an irrevocable Agreement. The three clauses
                          read as under:

                                "2. That the balance amount of Rs. 1,00,00,000/- (Rupees

                                Party after getting the Conveyance Deed in favour of the
                                First Party of the said property and within 15 days of

                                9. That this Agreement is irrevocable and if any of the parties
                                fails to complete the transaction, the aggrieved party shall
                                get it enforced through court of law and the defaulting party
                                shall be liable for all expenses, costs, incurred and damages
                                suffered."

                          4.    Admittedly, on 30.04.2006, the parties mutually consented to extend
                          the Agreement upto 30.06.2006. The plaintiff has claimed that the defendant
                          on an erroneous interpretation of the Agreement, wrote a letter dated
                          06.07.2006 stating that since the Conveyance Deed from D.S.I.D.C. has not
                          been received on 30.04.2006 and thereafter till 30.06.2006, the Agreement
                          has come to an end in terms of the Clause 7 of the Agreement and the
                          amount of Rs. 24,00,000/- was returned by way of Bank Pay Order.

                          5.    The plaintiff on receipt of the said letter gave a Legal Notice through
                          his counsel dated 12.07.2006 to the defendant stating that it was the
                          discretion of the plaintiff to extend the time as per Clause 7 of the
                          Agreement and the time stood extended to such time till the Conveyance
                          became available to the defendant and that the plaintiff was ready and
                          willing to complete the transaction as he had sufficient funds for completion
                          of the transaction; time was not the essence of the Contract and that the
                          refund of the amount was on false and frivolous assertions. The plaintiff
                          called upon the defendant to complete the transaction, lest he would initiate
                          legal proceedings for Specific Performance of the Agreement to Sell. The
                          defendant reiterated vide letter dated 28.07.2006 asserting that the
                          Agreement has come to an end as no Conveyance Deed has been received
                          from D.S.I.D.C.

                          6.    The plaintiff has claimed that the defendant has interpreted the
                          Agreement incorrectly since Clause 7 provided for extension of the

                          Agreement by the plaintiff and Clause 9 specifically provided that the
                          Agreement was irrevocable. The plaintiff till date has not encashed the Pay
                          Orders.

                          7.    It is asserted that the defendant has taken a false plea of D.S.I.D.C.
                          not having given any Conveyance Deed; rather the defendant has become
                          dishonest as he wants more money. The plaintiff has asserted that the
                          damages can neither be computed in terms of money nor is it an adequate
                          compensation for the failure on the part of the defendant to perform the
                          Agreement. The plaintiff has thus sought Specific Performance of the
                          Agreement dated 09.02.2006 and Permanent Injunction for restraining the
                          defendant from selling, alienating, transferring, parting with possession or
                          creating any third-party rights, by way of this suit.

                          8.    The defendant in his Written Statement has admitted having
                          entered into an Agreement dated 09.02.2006. It is explained that the sheds
                          were made available by D.S.I.D.C. to various entrepreneurs on Hire-
                          Purchase basis. However, the terms of Hire-Purchase Agreement could not
                          be finalized by D.S.I.D.C., thought it continued to charge the monthly lease
                          rent from the entrepreneurs with the understanding that the same would be
                          adjusted against the cost of Hire-Purchase.

                          9.    Eventually, D.S.I.D.C. made some offer of Hire-Purchase to the
                          defendant, but like many other entrepreneurs, he did not accept the offer.
                          Litigation was commenced under 
Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized
                          Occupants) Act, 1971
 which continued for more than a decade at various
                          legal fora.

                          10.   D.S.I.D.C. vide its Letter dated 27.07.2005 sought acceptance by
                          10.08.2005 of its offer given vide Letter dated 29.01.2004, so that thereafter

                          the dues statement could be made available to the allottees. The defendant
                          accepted the offer vide Intimation Letter dated 10.08.2005 and requested
                          D.S.I.D.C. to send the statement of account at the earliest. However, because
                          of the background of the litigation and the manner it had culminated, there
                          was uncertainty whether D.S.I.D.C. would agree to sell the suit property to
                          the allottees. The defendant thus, entered into the Agreement to Sell with the
                          plaintiff.

                          11.    The defendant did not receive the offer from D.S.I.D.C. till
                          30.04.2006. Mutually, parties agreed to extend the Agreement till 30.6.2006
                          with an endorsement to that effect on the Agreement which was signed by
                          both the parties. Even thereafter no offer was received from D.S.I.D.C. till
                          30.06.2006 and accordingly in terms of the Clause 7 of the Agreement, the
                          defendant refunded the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- by way of Pay Orders along
                          with the Letter dated 06.07.2006 informing the plaintiff that the Agreement
                          stood cancelled as final purchase offer from D.S.I.D.C. had not been
                          received till 30.06.2006 and the plaintiff had also not exercised his
                          discretion to extend the Agreement. The plaintiff responded through a Legal
                          Notice dated 12.07.2006 incorrectly claiming that it was in the discretion of
                          the plaintiff that time was extended till 30.06.2006, when in fact, it was
                          extended by mutual consent of the parties. The defendant has denied that he
                          ever made any representation to the plaintiff that the Conveyance Deed shall
                          become available to him by 30.06.2006 after which the transaction may be
                          completed. The defendant has further asserted that it was incorrectly claimed
                          by the plaintiff that the time was not the essence of the Contract. Earlier too,
                          on 30.04.2006 which was the date of expiry stipulated under Clause 7 of the
                          Agreement, the plaintiff met the defendant and extended the date further till

                          30.06.2006, by mutual consent. The subsequent conduct of the parties makes
                          it abundantly clear that time was the essence of Contract. The receipt of the
                          Pay Order in the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- has also been acknowledged by the
                          plaintiff. Though in the Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006, the plaintiff had
                          asserted that the Conveyance Deed may be executed and physical possession
                          be handed over within 15 days of receipt of the reply failing which a Suit for
                          Specific Performance of the Contract shall be filed against the defendant,
                          but there is no explanation as to why the plaintiff continued to retain the Pay
                          Order or not inform the defendant of his intention to not encash it. The
                          plaintiff‟s conduct in retaining the Pay Order clearly conveys his acceptance
                          of revocation of Agreement to Sell.

                          12.   The defendant has further asserted that the Contract was a contingent
                          Contract and the amount was liable to be refunded to the plaintiff in the
                          event the terms of the Contract did not materialize within the fixed time. It is
                          further asserted that since the Agreement was extended with the mutual
                          consent of both the parties on the first occasion on 30.04.2006, the clause
                          leaving the discretion to the plaintiff to extend the Agreement automatically
                          stood rescinded and modified to the extent that the mutual consent of both
                          the parties became necessary for further extension of the Agreement. It is
                          claimed that even if it is assumed that the plaintiff had discretion to extend
                          the Agreement, this should have been exercised by 30.06.2006 as was done
                          before the earlier deadline, and on his failure to do so, the Agreement stood
                          cancelled. The defendant became bound to refund money within 7 days
                          according to terms of the Agreement, which was refunded by way of Pay
                          Order to the plaintiff. This also reaffirms that time was the essence of the
                          Agreement.

                          13.      The defendant has also stated that on account of his strenuous and
                          sustained efforts and various letters, D.S.I.D.C. ultimately sent a Letter
                          dated 11.08.2006 in which it made a reference to the defendant‟s Letter
                          dated 24.07.2006 addressed to the Chief Secretary, Government of N.C.T. of
                          Delhi and the Chairman, D.S.I.D.C., and informed that the request of the
                          allottees had been acceded to, meaning thereby that D.S.I.D.C. agreed to
                          give the suit property to the allottees on their making one time full payment.
                          The defendant vide his Letter dated 14.08.2006 informed D.S.I.D.C. about
                          the co-allottees, namely, Shri B.K. Gupta, Smt. Chitra Chaudhry and Shri
                          K.C. Bothra, having retired voluntarily from the partnership business and
                          sought the transfer in his name vide Letter dated 14.08.2006. The request
                          was accepted by the D.S.I.D.C. vide its Letter dated 22.08.2006. The total
                          cost of suit property and the transfer charges was calculated as Rs.
                          73,38,096.38/- and after adjustments of various amounts, the total demand
                          of Rs. 18,82,375.62/- was raised on the defendant. The defendant paid the
                          entire amount by arranging the requisite amount through loan of Rs.
                          16,00,000/- by mortgaging the suit property from Jain Co-operative Bank
                          Limited.

                          14.      The defendant has asserted that it was not within the power of the
                          defendant to get the Conveyance Deed executed within the period as
                          mentioned in the Legal Notice, and infact, no Conveyance Deed till date has
                          been executed in his favour by D.S.I.D.C. Irrespective of this, no further
                          communication was received from the plaintiff after his Legal Notice, and
                          the present Suit was filed by the plaintiff on 15.10.2008 i.e. after about 2½
                          years.

                          15.   The defendant has further explained that during the period between
                          1983 and 2005, the defendant was consistently getting bulk orders for
                          manufacturing electronic and electro-mechanical equipment for Indian Air
                          Force. However, the defendant‟s business suddenly dried up from October,
                          2005 and did not foresee any improvement in future and on account of sheer
                          frustration, the defendant decided to sell the suit property and entered into
                          the Agreement with the plaintiff. However, the sluggishness of the business
                          was a temporary phase and thereafter, the business again picked up. Since
                          the plaintiff did not extend the Agreement after its expiry on 30.06.2006, it
                          led the defendant to believe that the plaintiff has accepted that the
                          Agreement no longer survived, and the defendant decided to retain the suit
                          property. It is asserted that Specific Performance of the Agreement would
                          now result in extreme hardship. Moreover, since the terms of the Contract
                          were never complied with, the plaintiff is not entitled to any Decree of
                          Specific Performance.

                          16.   The plaintiff in his Replication has reaffirmed his assertions as
                          contained in the Plaint.

                          17.   The issues were framed on 22.09.2009 which read as under:

                                "1. Whether the plaintiff proves that he was ready and
                                willing to perform his part ofthe contract and continues to be so
                                (to perform his part of the contract) dated09.02.2006? OPP;

                                2.    Whether by reason of clause-9 of the agreement to sell
                                dated 09.02.2006, the contract is irrevocable? OPP;



                                3.     Whether time was the essence to the contract, as claimed
                                by the defendant? OPD.

                                not seek extension of the contract beyond the extended period
                                i.e., 30.06.2006;

                          Government of N.C.T. of Delhi is Ex. DW1/7. The testimony and the
                          documents in detail shall be considered subsequently.

                          20.    Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has submitted
                          that essentially the facts are not in dispute; no time was prescribed for
                          concluding the Sale and in terms of Clause 4, all the formalities were to be
                          fulfilled by the defendant. The Agreement could have been cancelled in
                          accordance with Clause 7 only if D.S.I.D.C. refused to execute the
                          ownership documents in favour of the defendant. Admittedly, the defendant
                          has acquired ownership in the suit property and since the Contract never
                          stood rescinded and was irrevocable in terms of Clause 9 of the Agreement
                          where no time limit was prescribed for its execution, the plaintiff is entitled
                          to the execution of the Sale Deed. It is further argued that the plaintiff by not
                          encashing the Pay Order in the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- clearly manifested his
                          intention of not recalling the Agreement. Clause 7 of the Agreement was
                          explicit in providing that the Agreement could be cancelled if the offer was
                          not received from the D.S.I.D.C. Admittedly, the defendant has received the
                          Conveyance Deed and has also been handed over the possession.

                          21.    According to the terms of the Agreement, if any of the party failed to
                          complete the transaction, the aggrieved party had a right to get it enforced
                          through court of law and the defaulting party was liable for all expenses
                          incurred and damages suffered.

                          22.    It is further argued on behalf of the plaintiff that the time was not the
                          essence of the Agreement to Sell and the same still subsists, giving the right
                          to the plaintiff to seek a Decree for Specific Performance of the Agreement
                          to Sell.

                          on the decisions in

 (2017) 4 SCC 654.


                          24.   Learned counsel on behalf of the defendant has contended that the
                          Agreement to Sell was extended till 30.06.2006 mutually by the parties by
                          an endorsement made on the Agreement to Sell/Ex. PW1/1. In terms of the
                          Agreement, since the Conveyance Deed was not forthcoming from
                          D.S.I.D.C., the Contract stood rescinded as is evident from the conduct of
                          the parties. The defendant immediately refunded the sum of Rs. 24,00,000/-
                          on 06.07.2006 in terms of the Agreement to Sell vide Pay Order which was
                          admittedly received by the plaintiff. The plaintiff thereafter did not express
                          any readiness and willingness but merely claimed that the Sale Deed may be
                          executed in his favour after the Conveyance Deed is received by the
                          defendant from D.S.I.D.C. There is no equity in favour of the plaintiff in
                          terms of the unamended 
Specific Relief Act, 1963
.

                          25.   It is further submitted that in terms of the Agreement, the payment
                          had been returned to the plaintiff through Pay Order and was not aware of
                          non-encashment of the Pay Order. The plaintiff maintained stoic silence
                          after his Legal Notice and the present suit was filed after 28 months in 2008.

                          26.   It is submitted that the plaintiff had sought re-validation of Pay Order
                          during the trial, but the same was rejected vide Order dated 16.01.2019 in
                          terms of 
Section 22
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.

                          27.   It is further argued that after the expiry of the Agreement on
                          30.06.2006 about which a definite Notice was given by the defendant, there
                          was no renewal/extension of the Agreement by the plaintiff and the
                          Agreement stood concluded on 30.06.2006. No Agreement to Sell survived
                          thereafter for the plaintiff to claim its execution. Moreover, the plaintiff
                          never ever made any enquiry about the execution of the Conveyance Deed
                          by D.S.I.D.C in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff has also failed to show
                          that he had the funds available or that he was ready and willing to perform
                          his part of the Agreement.` Moreover, the plaintiff has not sought any
                          declaration that determination of Contract was bad in law. In the absence of
                          any such declaration, the Suit for Specific Performance is not maintainable.

                          28.   The fundamental requirements of specific performance of an
                          Agreement to Sell as mentioned in 
Section 55
 of the Specific Relief Act,
                          1963 have neither been pleaded nor proved; for which reason the Suit is
                          liable to be dismissed.

                                "10. It is a settled principle of law that the grant of relief of
                                specific performance is a discretionary and equitable relief. The
                                material questions, which are required to be gone into for grant
                                of the relief of specific performance, are First, whether there
                                exists a valid and concluded contract between the parties for
                                sale/purchase of the suit property; Second, whether the plaintiff
                                has been ready and willing to perform his part of contract and
                                whether he is still ready and willing to perform his part as
                                mentioned in the contract; Third, whether the plaintiff has, in
                                fact, performed his part of the contract and, if so, how and to
                                what extent and in what manner he has performed and whether
                                such performance was in conformity with the terms of the

                                 whether the plaintiff is entitled for grant of any other alternative
                                 relief, namely, refund of earnest money etc. and, if so, on what
                                 grounds.

                                 11. In our opinion, the aforementioned questions are part of the
                                 statutory requirements (See 
Sections 16 (c)
, 
20
, 
21
, 
22
, 
23
 of
                                 the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and the forms 47/48 of Appendix A
                                 to C 
of the Code of Civil Procedure
). These requirements have
                                 to be properly pleaded by the parties in their respective
                                 pleadings and proved with the aid of evidence in accordance
                                 with law. It is only then the Court is entitled to exercise its
                                 discretion and accordingly grant or refuse the relief of specific
                                 performance depending upon the case made out by the parties
                                 on facts."

                          33.    Admittedly, there was a valid and concluded Agreement to Sell dated
                          09.02.2006 between the parties in respect of the suit property, which
                          satisfies the first condition.

                          34.    
Section 16(c)
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, though does not
                          require any specific phraseology, but it mandates that the plaintiff has to
                          necessarily aver that he has performed or has always been willing and ready
                          to perform his part of the Contract.

                          35.    The second aspect which is of extreme significance is whether the
                          plaintiff had been, and is still ready and willing to perform his part as
                          mentioned in the Agreement. The extent and the manner in which the
                          Agreement has been performed and whether it was in conformity with the
                          terms of the Contract, needs to be further considered.

                          36.    The legislature has chosen to use two phrases, namely readiness and
                          willingness. The readiness indicates the financial capacity of the plaintiff to
                          perform the Agreement, while the willingness indicates his state of mind. 
In
                          so far as readiness is concerned, further question is required to be proved

                          through evidence that he had the financial capacity, as has been explained in
                          the case of 
K.V. Balan (Dead) Through Legal Representatives v. Bhavyanath

                          2015 SCC OnLine Kel 298.


                          37.   In Syed Dastagir v. T.R. Gopalakrishna Setty (1999) 6 SCC 337, the
                          Apex Court while construing the connotation of readiness and willingness,
                          observed that the compliance of "Readiness and willingness has to be in
                          spirit and substance and not in letter and form. So to insist for mechanical
                          production of the exact words of a statute is to insist for the form rather than
                          essence. So absence of form cannot dissolve an essence if already pleaded."
                          It was also observed that the plea of readiness and willingness is not an
                          expression of art and science, but an expression through words to place fact
                          and law of one‟s case for a relief. In order to gather true spirit behind a plea
                          it should be read as a whole and to test whether the plaintiff has performed
                          his obligations, one has to see the pith and substance of the plea. Unless
                          statute "specifically require a plea to be made in any particular form, it can
                          be in any form. No specific phraseology or language is required to take such
                          a plea."

                          38.   
In 
H.P. Pyarejan v. Dasappa (Dead) By L.Rs. &Ors.
 (2006) 2 SCC
                          496, the Apex Court observed that the plaintiff is required to prove
                          continuous readiness and willingness from the date of the contract to the
                          time of the hearing, to perform the contract on his part. Failure to make good
                          that averment brings with it and leads to the inevitable dismissal of the
                          Suit.
 
In 
Motilal Jain v. Ramdasi Devi
 (2000) 6 SCC 420, the Apex Court
                          had expounded the same principle that averments in the plaint must reflect
                          the readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff.

39.   The connotation of readiness in the context of 
Section 16
 was
                          explained in 
Raghunath Rai & Another v. Jageshwar Prashad Sharma

                          (1999) 50 DRJ 751 that the intending purchaser need not produce the money
                          or to vouch a concluded scheme for financing the transaction; it is sufficient
                          for the purchaser to establish that he has the capacity to pay. The financial
                          capacity has to be however, proved strictly and self-serving statements
                          cannot discharge the burden of proving existence of financial capacity as
                          noted by this Court in the case of Baldev. v. Bhule (2012) 132 DRJ 247.


 
40.   Similar view has been expressed in M/s 
Hotz Industries Pvt. Ltd. v.
                          Dr. Ravi Singh
 2018 SCC OnLine Del7618 and Manhor Lal Khetrapal and
                          Ors. v. Hari Chand and Ors. MANU/DE/2934/2018.


 
41.   Mere establishing "readiness" in the plaint itself is not sufficient to
                          meet the rigors of 
Section 16
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. It has to be
                          continuous as explained by the Apex Court in the case of 
N.P. Thirugnanam
                          v. Dr. R. Jagan Mohan Rao
 (1995) 5 SCC 115, by stating that "the
                          continuous readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff is a
                          condition precedent to grant the relief of specific performance..... If the
                          plaintiff fails to either aver or prove the same, he must fail. To adjudge
                          whether the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract,
                          the court must take into consideration the conduct of the plaintiff prior and
                          subsequent to the filing of the suit along with other attending circumstances.
                          The amount of consideration which he has to pay to the defendant must of
                          necessity be proved to be available. Right from the date of the execution
                          till date of the decree he must prove that he is ready and has always been
                          willing to perform his part of the contract. As stated, the factum of his

                          adjudged with reference to the conduct of the party and the attending
                          circumstances. The court may infer from the facts and circumstances
                          whether the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of the
                          contract."


                          42.   
In 
Aniglase Yohannan v. Ramlatha and Others
 (2005) 7 SCC 534, the
                          Apex Court further observed that the court has to grant relief on the basis of
                          the conduct of the persons seeking relief. If the pleadings manifest that the
                          conduct of the plaintiff entitles him to get the relief on perusal of the plaint,
                          he should not be denied the relief. The averments in the plaint as a whole
                          must clearly indicate the readiness and the willingness. 
Section 16(c)
 of the
                          Specific Relief Act, 1963 mandates the plaintiff not only to make averments
                          in the plaint but also to establish fact by evidence aliunde about his
                          readiness and willingness to perform the Contract.


                          43.   In Man Kaur (Dead) By LRs. v. Hartar Singh Sangha (2010) 10 SCC
                          512, it was further qualified by the Supreme Court that even assuming that
                          the defendant has committed breach, it is for the plaintiff to aver in the plaint
                          and prove that he has always been ready and willing to perform the essential
                          terms of the contract which required to be performed by him.

 
44.   The Supreme Court in 
Madhukar Nivrutti Jagtap v. Pramilabai
                          Chandulal Parandekar2019
 SCC OnLine SC 1026 held that the requirement
                          to prove readiness and willingness is not that the plaintiff should
                          continuously approach the defendant with payment or make incessant
                          requests for performance. The requirement of readiness and willingness of
                          the plaintiff is not theoretical in nature but is essentially a question of fact
                          which needs to be determined in reference to the pleadings and the evidence
                          led by the parties.

45.    Similar observations were made by the Apex Court in 
Bhavyanath v.
                          K.V. Balan (Dead) Through Legal Representatives
 (2020) 11 SCC 790
                          where the Apex Court, while considering the financial capacity to pay the
                          consideration, explained that the law is not that the plaintiff must prove that
                          he has cash in his hand from the date of Agreement till the relevant date. But
                          what is important to be proved is that he had the capacity to allow the deal to
                          go through. Therefore, if the plaintiff is able to prove his assets which can be
                          converted into cash either by sale or by loan, it is sufficient to prove the
                          financial capacity of the plaintiff. Even if the plaintiff is able to establish
                          that the defendant has refused to execute the Sale Deed and thereby
                          committed a breach, is not sufficient to entitle him for specific performance
                          unless he is also able to prove his own readiness and willingness.


                          46.    
In the recent judgment of 
U.N. Krishnamurthy (Since Deceased) v.
                          A.M. Krishnamurthy
 2022 SCC OnLine SC 840, the Apex Court has
                          reiterated that in order to prove "readiness and willingness" to perform the
                          obligation to pay money in terms of the contract, the plaintiff would have to
                          not only make the requisite averments in the plaint but also adduce evidence
                          to show the availability of funds to make payment in terms of the contract.
                          The plaintiff would have to prove that he had sufficient funds or was in a
                          position to raise funds in time to discharge his obligations under the
                          contract. If he does not have sufficient funds with him to make the required
                          payment of money, he would have to specifically show how the funds would
                          be made available by him. Such readiness and willingness have to be proved
                          all along till the decision of the Suit.


                          47.    In view of the above discussed cases, the law of evidence of the
                          parties may be considered.

                          48.    The plaintiff has stated one line in his plaint and his affidavit of
                          evidence Ex. PW1/A that he is ready and willing to perform his part of the
                          Contract, but the same is not supported by any details as to whether he has
                          the financial capacity or has sufficient means/money to pay the balance
                          consideration amount.

                          49.    The plaintiff, except a bald averment, has failed to substantiate his
                          assertions or to prove the same with any evidence whatsoever. The only
                          conclusion that can be drawn out is that there was no "readiness" on the part
                          of the plaintiff to honour the Agreement to Sell.

                          50.    The other aspect which needs consideration is whether or not the
                          plaintiff was willing to perform his part of the Contract.

                          51.    As already noted above, the „willingness‟ is in reference to conduct,
                          past and future, of the plaintiff.

                          52.    It would be pertinent to refer to the affidavit of evidence of the
                          plaintiff Ex.      PW1/A, where he has deposed that the defendant had
                          deliberately and intentionally delayed in getting the permissions form
                          D.S.I.D.C for execution of Conveyance Deed with a view to avoiding the
                          extension of the Agreement, but he has himself admitted in his cross-
                          examination that after the termination of the Agreement on 30.06.2006, he
                          did not write any letter seeking extension of the Agreement in terms of
                          Clause 7 of the Agreement to Sell. The plaintiff has deposed that he had
                          approached the defendant on 30.06.2006, but he was not found available in
                          the factory. He has also claimed that he had visited the defendant after
                          30.06.2006 to state that he intended the Agreement to be extended but he has
                          admitted that neither he wrote any letter nor gave any Notice to the
                          defendant expressing his intention to extend the Agreement to Sell.

                          53.   The defendant has categorically deposed that immediately after
                          30.06.2006 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement to Sell, he not
                          only wrote a letter informing the plaintiff about termination of the
                          Agreement, but also returned a sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- which he had
                          received from the plaintiff.

                          54.   The defendant has further deposed that a sum of Rs. 24,00,000/- had
                          got debited from his account on preparation of the Pay Order. The defendant
                          could not have possibly known about the non-encashment, especially unless
                          he was informed by the plaintiff which he admittedly did not do.

                          55.   Interestingly,   the     plaintiff   himself   has   admitted      in    his
                          cross-examination his intention to not continue with the Agreement and the
                          same is also evident from the fact that despite having received Pay Orders
                          along with Letter dated 06.07.2006 Ex. P3 from the defendant, he admittedly
                          did not mention about non-encashment of the Pay Orders in his Legal Notice
                          dated 12.07.2006 Ex PW 1/4. Had there been any intention on the part of
                          the plaintiff to continue with the Agreement, there was nothing which
                          prevented him from mentioning the same in his Legal Notice dated
                          12.07.2006 Ex PW 1/4. The very fact that there is no mention of extension
                          of the Agreement reflects the conduct of the plaintiff that he had intention to
                          extend the Agreement beyond 30.06.2006. In addition to this, it is the
                          plaintiff‟s own admission in his cross-examination that he retained the Pay
                          Order of Rs. 24,00,000/- even after sending the Legal Notice dated
                          12.07.2006/ Ex PW 1/4. This act of retaining the Pay Order lends no
                          credibility to the intention of extending the Agreement that was expressed
                          through Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006 and the testimony of the plaintiff.

                          56.   Another significant admission made by the plaintiff in his
                          cross-examination is that after receiving the Pay Orders in the sum of Rs.
                          24,00,000/- sent by the defendant, he went to meet the defendant who told
                          him that as per the instructions of his wife, the suit property was not to be
                          sold. According to the plaintiff himself, the defendant had claimed that he
                          did not want to sell the suit property, though it is denied by the defendant in
                          his testimony that the plaintiff ever met him after 30.06.2006. But even if
                          this assertion of the plaintiff is accepted, it only conveys that he did not seek
                          any further extension as the defendant also did not want to continue with the
                          Agreement.

                          57.   In the end, the cross-examination of the defendant to the effect that
                          neither did he try to find out the status of the suit property nor did he make
                          any enquiry from D.S.I.D.C as to whether the Sale Deed has been executed
                          in favour of the defendant reflects his inaction and disinterest to continue
                          with the Agreement to Sell. This fact was also admitted by the plaintiff in
                          his cross-examination. The subsequent conduct of the plaintiff reaffirms that
                          he had no intention to continue with the Agreement to Sell.

                          58.   There is abundant evidence on record and the admissions made by the
                          plaintiff himself to prove that he himself had no intention or willingness to
                          continue with the Agreement.

                          59.   It is thus proved that the plaintiff was neither willing nor ready for the
                          execution of the Agreement to Sell, and for this reason, he did not seek any
                          extension of the Contract beyond 30.06.2006 which disentitles him from
                          seeking specific performance of the Agreement to Sell.

                          60.   The Issue No. 1 is decided against the plaintiff.

                          "3.   Whether time was the essence to the contract, as claimed by the
                                defendant?"

                          "5.   Whether the plaintiff is disentitled to any relief as he did not seek
                                extension of the contract beyond the extended period i.e.,
                                30.06.2006."

                          61.   An objection has been taken by the defendant that the time as
                          prescribed under the Agreement was the essence and since the plaintiff did
                          not come forth till 30.06.2006 which was agreed to be the date for execution
                          of the Agreement as was provided in Clause 7, the Agreement stood vitiated.

                          62.   To appreciate this contention, it would be pertinent to reproduce the
                          relevant clause of the Agreement to Sell Ex. P1 which is as under:

                                "Clause 7-
                                       In case the offer from D.S.I.D.C is not received by the
                                first party by 30.04.2006 then this agreement will be treated as
                                cancelled and first party will refund the entire amount received
                                from the second party to the second party within 7 days or the
                                Agreement will be extended at the discretion of the second
                                party."

                          63.   Before considering this contention on the facts of this case, it would
                          be pertinent be consider whether the time principally, is the essence of an
                          Agreement to Sell. In earlier days, Time for performance of Agreement to
                          Sell was not considered as essence.

 
64.   The Madras High Court in 
S.V. Sankaralinga Nadar v. P.T.S.
                          Ratnaswami Nadar
 AIR 1952 Mad 389 observed that the time difference of
                          six months that was agreed in the Agreement to Sell for execution of the
                          Sale Deed may not amount to essence of Contract, but it must have some
                          meaning. Not for nothing could such time-limit would have been prescribed.
                          Neither can it be posted as a rule of law or rule or prudence where time is

                          not made the essence of Contract, all stipulations of time provided in the
                          Contract would have no significance or meaning or that they are as good as
                          non-existent. All it means is that while exercising its discretion, the Court
                          should also bear in mind that when the parties have prescribed certain
                          limits for taking steps by one or the other party, it must have some
                          significance and the time limits cannot be ignored altogether on the ground
                          that the time has not been made the essence of the Contract where there is
                          total inaction on the part of the plaintiff for two and a half years which itself
                          is in clear violation of the terms of the Agreement which required him to do
                          certain things, such delay along with other accompanying circumstances
                          which would make it inequitable to grant the relief of Specific Performance,
                          would become relevant in a case of Specific Performance.


 
65.   The logic as to why in earlier judgments, time was not being held as
                          of essence in the Agreement to Sell, was given by the Apex Court in 
K.S.
                          Vidyanadam and Others v. Vairavan
 (1997) 3 SCC 1, wherein it was
                          observed that the Courts of India following certain early decisions of
                          English Courts have held that in the Agreement to Sell, time is not an
                          essence of the Contract unless specifically provided to that effect. However,
                          the Court cannot be oblivious to the reality of the constant and continuous
                          rise in the values of urban property fueled by the large-scale migration of the
                          people from rural areas to urban centers and by inflation and thus, the rigor
                          of rule evolved by the court that the time is not an essence of the Contract in
                          the case of immoveable properties requires to be relaxed, if not modified,
                          particularly in the case of urban immoveable properties.


 
66.   It was further observed in 
K.S. Vidyanadam
 (supra) that there was
                          total inaction on the party of the plaintiff for two and a half of years to

                          perform his party of the Agreement and such delay between the date of
                          Agreement and the filing of the Suit would make it inequitable to grant the
                          relief of Specific Performance to the plaintiff.


 
67.   Similar explanation prevailed with the Apex Court in 
Saradamani
                          Kandappan Kandappan v. S. Rajalakshmi and Others
 (2011) 12 SCC 18
                          where it was observed that the assumption for holding that time was not an
                          essence for the grant of specific performance would not prejudice the vendor
                          defendant financially as there would not be much difference in the market
                          value of the property even if the Contract was performed after a few months.
                          This principle made sense during the first half of the twentieth century,
                          when there was comparatively very little inflation in India. The third quarter
                          of the twentieth century saw a very slow but steady increase in prices. But a
                          drastic change occurred from the beginning of the last quarter of the
                          twentieth century. There has been a galloping inflation and prices of
                          immoveable properties have increased steeply by leaps and bounds. Market
                          values of properties are no longer stable or steady. A judicial notice can be
                          taken and, in such scenario, the readiness and the willingness on the part of
                          the plaintiff. The conduct of delay, laches and prejudice has become relevant
                          to ascertain if the time was the essence in the Agreement.


 
68.   The change in the prevailing market scenario has brought a change in
                          perspective as is reflected in

 (supra) where the Apex Court
                          observed that it may not be correct to say that the time is not the essence for
                          performance of the Contract of an immoveable property, but whether the
                          time is an essence would depend upon the nature of delay and the terms of
                          Agreement, especially the readiness and willingness of the plaintiff to
                          execute the Agreement. It was observed that the time can be said to be the

                          essence where the purchaser does not take steps to complete the sale within
                          the stipulated period and the vendor is not responsible for any delay. The
                          fact that there has been a steep rise in the price within the stipulated time
                          would be a circumstance which may make it inequitable to grant the relief of
                          specific performance. Thus, time for performance as stipulated in the
                          Agreement, may be assumed to be not material, or at all events be
                          considered as merely indicating the reasonable period within which the
                          Contract should be performed.


                          69.   
In 
Ferrodous Estates (Pvt.) Ltd. v. P. Gopirathnam (Dead) and
                          Others
 2020 SCC OnLine SC 825, the Supreme Court after referring to the
                          aforesaid judgments observed that while exercising discretion in the Suit for
                          Specific Performance, the Court must keep in mind the time/period
                          prescribed by the parties for taking certain steps or for completion of the
                          transaction which must be given significance and the prescribed time limits
                          are not to be ignored.


 
70.   The time frames for performance of Agreement to Sell has to be
                          evaluated in conjunction with the conduct and intention of the parties in the
                          context of surrounding circumstances and the prevailing market scenario. As
                          observed in the case of 
Ferrodous
 (supra), the greatest scrutiny and
                          strictness of readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff may be
                          applied to ascertain the time-frames.


                          71.   In this case, the Agreement provided the extended date of
                          performance as 30.06.2006. The significant aspect is that after receipt of the
                          letter dated 06.07.2006/Ex. PW1/3 from the defendant specifically
                          indicating that since the Conveyance Deed had not been received from
                          D.S.I.D.C on 30.06.2006 and the plaintiff had not extended the Contract

                          further, he was returning the money received by him under the Agreement
                          and it has come to an end. In response thereto, the plaintiff sent the Legal
                          Notice dated 12.07.2006/ Ex. PW1/4 claiming that the time stood extended
                          under Clause 7 and called upon the defendant to complete the transaction
                          within a period of 15 days, failing which the plaintiff shall institute a Suit for
                          Specific Performance. The defendant vide Reply dated 28.07.2006/Ex.
                          PW1/5 to the said Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006, reiterated that the
                          Agreement had come to an end as the Conveyance Deed had not been
                          finalized by the D.S.I.D.C.

                          72.   The Agreement to Sell/ Ex. PW1/1 had stipulated in Clause 7 that if
                          the offer from D.S.I.D.C was not received till 30.04.2006, then the
                          Agreement were being treated as cancelled and the money shall be refunded
                          by the second party within 7 days or unless the Agreement is extended at the
                          discretion of the second party (plaintiff). Though the plaintiff had served the
                          defendant with the Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006/ Ex PW 1/4 about the
                          extension of the time for execution of the Conveyance Deed, but the conduct
                          of the parties needs to be further considered to ascertain the true intention.

                          73.    In the first instance, the Agreement was to get concluded on
                          30.04.2006 and admittedly, the Agreement was extended by mutual consent
                          by both the parties on 30.04.2006 by making an endorsement Ex. PW1/2 on
                          the Agreement to Sell/ Ex. PW1/1. No such extension was made either by
                          the plaintiff or mutually after 30.06.2006. Nothing prevented the plaintiff to
                          have sought extension or to make an endorsement to that effect before or
                          upon expiry of the relevant date i.e., 30.06.2006. But no endeavour
                          whatsoever was made by the plaintiff for extension of the date, the second
                          time. There being no extension by the plaintiff or mutually by both the

                          parties as was done in the first instance, clearly reflects that there was no
                          intention to further extend the Agreement by the plaintiff.

                          74.   The conduct of the plaintiff after termination of the Contract further
                          reinforces that the "time" in this particular case became an essence of the
                          Contract since the plaintiff had no further intention of extension of the time.

                          75.   The defendant on the other hand, on expiry of the date i.e., 30.06.2006
                          for the execution of the Sale Deed, immediately informed the plaintiff vide
                          Letter dated 06.07.2006 Ex. P3 about the termination of the Agreement and
                          also returned Rs. 24,00,000/- by way of Pay Orders in terms of Clause 7 of
                          the Agreement. It is the defendant‟s Letter dated 06.07.2006 which
                          promoted the plaintiff to immediately resort to a Legal Notice dated
                          12.07.2006/ Ex. P4 asserting that the time stood extended and called upon
                          the defendant to complete the transaction within a period of 15 days. The
                          contents of the Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006/ Ex. P4 itself was merely an
                          endeavour to meet the legal requirement of there being some expression of
                          intention to continue in terms of 
Section 16
 of the Specific Relief Act. The
                          pre-requisite for performance of the Agreement was execution of the Sale
                          Deed by D.S.I.D.C which did not happen till the contemplated date i.e.,
                          30.06.2006 and there was no question of execution of Sale Deed by
                          defendant in the circumstances. It is only to meet the legal requirement that
                          perfunctory Legal Notice was sent without any genuine intention to continue
                          with the Agreement.

                          76.   This becomes evident as interestingly, the plaintiff has not referred to
                          the contention of the defendant about non-execution of Conveyance Deed by
                          D.S.I.D.C, but merely has stated that there is an extension of time under
                          Clause 7 of the Agreement. Furthermore, even though Rs. 24,00,000/- that

                          had been paid by the plaintiff in part performance were returned by way of
                          Pay Orders, the plaintiff has not uttered a word in respect of the Pay Orders
                          in his Legal Notice. The plaintiff has failed to indicate whether he was
                          encashing or refusing to accept the money. The consequence of the same
                          was that the Pay Orders had been retained in his possession by the plaintiff.
                          Though the plaintiff may not have encashed them, but he failed to so inform
                          the defendant. The money has already been debited from the account of the
                          defendant and he had no way to know that the Pay Orders have not been
                          encashed. The only inference that could have been drawn by the defendant
                          was that the return of money has been accepted by the plaintiff, and the
                          Agreement to Sell stands concluded.

                          77.   Further, the defendant in his evidence has explained that there was
                          much litigation/ correspondence exchanged with D.S.I.D.C. for clarity on
                          conferment of ownership rights in respect of suit property and uncertainty
                          shrouded about acquisition of ownership rights. Therefore, the plaintiff, who
                          was aware of uncertainty about the defendant ever being able to get
                          ownership rights, insisted on insertion of Clause 7 fixing the deadline for
                          concluding the Agreement. For this reason, the extension was made only for
                          two months as plaintiff was not inclined to be bound with this transaction for
                          a long time. Also, it was at his insistence that clause giving him unilateral
                          right to extend the Agreement was inserted subsequently in writing instead
                          of being typed in the main body. The circumstances coupled with the
                          conduct of plaintiff and term of Agreement was explained by defendant lead
                          to only one conclusion that once the offer from D.S.I.D.C. was not received
                          till 30.06.2006, the plaintiff decided not to seek further extension and let the

                          Agreement lapse on account of uncertainty around the D.S.I.D.C. executing
                          the Deed in favour of defendant.

                          78.   The conduct of the plaintiff thereafter is equally significant to gather
                          his intention. The plaintiff, despite being informed about the cancellation of
                          Agreement immediately on expiry of stipulated time, maintained stoic
                          silence for 28 months to institute the Suit on 06.10.2008. Though the Suit
                          may have been filed within the period of limitation, but it is a case of total
                          inaction on the part of the plaintiff for almost 28 months, which itself speaks
                          of the intention of the plaintiff not to extend the Agreement beyond the
                          stipulated time.

 
79.   Similar facts as in hand came up for consideration in 
Atma Ram v.
                          Charanjit Singh
 (2020) 3 SCC 311. After issuing a Legal Notice on
                          12.11.1996, the petitioner filed the Suit after the long delay of three years.
                          The Supreme Court observed that there was no explanation forthcoming for
                          such inordinate delay. The conduct of the plaintiff is very crucial in a Suit
                          for Specific Performance. A person who issues a Legal Notice on
                          12.11.1996 claiming readiness and willingness, but institutes a Suit only on
                          13.10.1999 and that too only with a prayer for a mandatory injunction
                          carrying a fixed court fee, would not be entitled to the discretionary relief of
                          Specific Performance.


 
80.   The timelines to be adhered by the parties and their intention to
                          conclude the Agreement in a time bound manner, are circumscribed by their
                          conduct. To grant a Decree for Specific Performance lies in the discretion of
                          the Court which the Court may not exercise due to the conduct of the
                          plaintiff, as observed by the Apex Court in 
Nirmala Anand v. Advent
                          Corporation (P) Ltd.

81.   Similar observations were made in 
Zarina Siddiqui v. A. Ramalingam

                          (2015) 1 SCC 705 that the equitable discretion to grant a relief for specific
                          performance depends upon the conduct of the parties. Though efflux of time
                          and escalation of price of the property by itself cannot be a valid ground to
                          deny the relief of Specific Performance, but it is necessary on the part of the
                          plaintiff to establish and prove the circumstances so that the discretion can
                          be judiciously exercised in his favour.


                          82.   
In 
Ferrodous Estates (Pvt.) Ltd.
 (supra), it was observed that mere
                          delay by itself without more, cannot be the sole factor to deny specific
                          performance. The greater scrutiny and strictness of "readiness and
                          willingness" on the part of the plaintiff may be applied to ascertain the
                          time-frames.


 
83.   The facts, as in hand, came up for consideration in 
Koli
                          Satyanarayana (Dead) by LRs v. Valuripalli Kesava Rao Chowdary (Dead
)
                          through LRs & Ors. 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1306, wherein the Supreme
                          Court observed that the defendant had communicated to the plaintiff on
                          12.04.1982 that since the requisite permission from the concerned authority
                          could not be obtained, as the plaintiff cancelled the Agreement. The
                          plaintiff, however, did not initiate any proceedings against the defendant. It
                          was almost after a period of two years after the defendant gave the
                          intimation about cancellation of their Agreement that the plaintiff chose to
                          file the Suit. The learned Single Judge considered it relevant as the conduct
                          of the plaintiff disentitling him from exercising discretion in favour of the
                          plaintiff in the Suit for Specific Performance even though it had been filed
                          within the period of limitation as prescribed for filing such Suit. This
                          conclusion not only met with approval by the Division Bench of the High

                          Court, but was also upheld by the Apex Court which observed that despite
                          being intimated about the cancellation of the Agreement, the plaintiff‟s
                          conduct in not taking any action for more than two years, disentitled him
                          from exercising discretion in his favour.


                          84.   
In 
Gulshan Kumar & Ors vs. Sat Narain Tulsian (Deceased
) 206
                          (2014) DLT 443, reference was made to the observations of the Apex Court
                          in 
K.S. Vidyanadam
 (supra) and 
Sardamani Kandappan vs. Rajalakshmi

                          (2011) 12 SCC 18, that the courts frown upon Suits which are not filed
                          immediately after breach/refusal and the fact that limitation is three years
                          does not mean that a purchaser can wait for one year or two years to file a
                          Suit and obtain specific performance. It was held that the three-year period
                          is provided to assist the purchasers in special cases, where major part of the
                          consideration has already been paid and possession delivered in part
                          performance thereof.


                          85.   Similarly, the defendant in the present case, was duly informed by the
                          plaintiff about the cancellation of the Agreement to Sell on account of
                          Conveyance Deed being not received by D.S.I.D.C by 30.06.2006 vide his
                          Letter dated 06.07.2006/Ex. P3 despite which the plaintiff did not take any
                          steps whatsoever, for more than 28 months before filing the Suit on
                          06.10.2008. Therefore, even though the present Suit has been filed within
                          the limitation, there is an unexplained delay of more than 28 months which
                          disentitles the plaintiff from exercise of discretion to grant the relief of
                          Specific Performance to him.

                          86.   It may, thus, be summed up that though time in given cases may not
                          be an essence of Agreement to Sell, but herein the present case, since it was
                          linked to getting a Conveyance Deed by 30.06.2006 which actually did not

                          happen, and further considering that the defendant cancelled the Agreement
                          to Sell vide his Letter dated 06.07.2006/ Ex. P3 and also returned the amount
                          of ₹24,00,000/- by way of Pay Orders which were not repudiated by the
                          plaintiff, except that he sent a Legal Notice dated 12.07.2006 Ex. P4
                          claiming specific performance, but he remained silent about cancellation or
                          return of money received by him by way of Pay Orders, clearly reflects that
                          the time was treated as an essence in the Agreement to Sell which was
                          cancelled on expiry of the stipulated time. Accordingly, the plaintiff was not
                          entitled to seek extension of time beyond 30.06.2006.

                          87.      Moreover, the plaintiff‟s conduct in not taking any concrete steps
                          until about 28 months further corroborates not only that the Agreement to
                          Sell stood cancelled on 30.06.2006 but also delayed action on the part of the
                          plaintiff disentitles him to exercise discretion in his favour.

 
88.      Reliance for coming to this conclusion, may be placed on the
                          observations of Apex Court in 
Ramathal v. Maruthathal
 (2018) 18 SCC
                          303, that the specific performance is an equitable relief and granting relief is
                          the discretion of the Court which has to be exercised judicially within the
                          settled principles of law.


                          89.      Accordingly, the issue no. 3&5 are decided against the plaintiff.

                                   ISSUE NO. 2:

                          "2.      Whether by reason of clause-9 of the Agreement to Sell dated
                                   09.02.2006, the contract is irrevocable?"

                          90.      The plaintiff has referred to Clause 9 of the Agreement to claim that
                          this Agreement is irrevocable. Clause 9 of the Agreement to Sell reads as
                          under:

                                "Clause 9-
                                       That this Agreement is irrevocable and if any of the
                                parties fails to complete the transaction, the aggrieved party
                                shall get it enforced through court of law and the defaulting
                                party shall be liable for all expenses, costs incurred and
                                damages suffered."

                          91.   It is not doubt true that this Clause 9 of the Agreement to Sell
                          provided that the Agreement would be irrevocable, but it was circumscribed
                          by Clause 7 of the said Agreement which clearly provided that in case offer
                          from D.S.I.D.C was not received by the first party by 30.04.2006, the
                          Agreement shall be treated as cancelled and the first party i.e., the defendant
                          shall refund the entire amount received under the Agreement. Clause 7
                          contained a condition precedent and unequivocally provided the
                          circumstance when the Agreement shall be treated as cancelled. Since no
                          offer was received from D.S.I.D.C till 30.06.2006, the defendant repudiated
                          the Contract vide his Letter dated 06.07.2006/ Ex. P3 which was not
                          seriously contested by the plaintiff who merely sent a Legal Notice dated
                          12.07.2006 Ex. P4 seeking specific performance of the Agreement. The
                          requisite offer from D.S.I.D.C was a condition precedent and till such time
                          the offer was received, the defendant would not have acquired any
                          ownership right by virtue of which he could have executed the Sale Deed in
                          favour of the plaintiff.

                          92.   Clause 9 of the Agreement would have kicked in only if the
                          permission had been received within the time frame after which neither
                          party would have had any occasion to revoke the Agreement to Sell. Since
                          the condition precedent, which was to get the Conveyance Deed from
                          D.S.I.D.C was not fulfilled within the given time frame, Clause 9 would not

                          become applicable. Therefore, Clause 9 cannot be read dehors the other
                          clauses of the Agreement and it is, therefore, held that Clause 9 did not
                          make the Contract irrevocable under all circumstances.

                          93.   The Issue No.2 is decided against the plaintiff.

                                ISSUE NO. 4:

                          "4.   Whether the contract between the parties cannot be enforced, as
                                claimed for the reason that it was a contingent contract?"

                          94.   A preliminary objection has been taken on behalf of the defendant
                          that the Agreement inter se the parties was a contingent contract and its
                          performance was dependent on the receipt of the offer by the defendant from
                          D.S.I.D.C by 30.06.2006 and in the absence thereof, the period for execution
                          of the Sale Deed could not be extended by mutual consent beyond
                          30.06.2006.

                          95.   The term "contingency" is defined in the Concise Oxford English
                          Dictionary, Indian Edition Revised Eleventh Edition at Page 308, as a
                          future event or circumstance which is possible but cannot be predicted with
                          certainty. Black's Law Dictionary by Bryan A. Garner Eighth Edition
                          defines contingent at Page 338 as (1) an event may or may not occur, a
                          possibility, (2) the condition of being dependent on chance; uncertainty.
                          Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar 3 rd Edition defines
                          contingency at Page 1012 as (1) a situation in which may an event may or
                          may not happen, (2) something that is liable, but not certain, to happen at
                          some time in the future.

                          Contract as under:

                                "31. "Contingent Contract" defined.--A "contingent contract"

                                is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event,
                                collateral to such contract, does or does not happen. --A

                                something, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or

                                contract."



                          97.   The contingency is thus, essentially based upon uncertainty,
                          independent of the Contract of the parties. If the contingency occurs, the
                          Contract may be affected as has been provided under 
Section 32
 of the
                          Indian Contract Act, 1872.

                          98.   In the present case, as per Clause 7 of the Agreement to Sell Ex. PW
                          1/1, it was to be treated as cancelled in case no offer was received by the
                          defendant from D.S.I.D.C by 30.04.2006 and the defendant was liable to
                          refund the entire amount received from the plaintiff within 7 days unless the
                          Agreement was extended by the second party in its discretion.

                          99.   Admittedly, D.S.I.D.C had sent its offer on 27.07.2005 much prior to
                          the execution of the Agreement, which was accepted by the defendant vide
                          his Letter dated 10.08.2005. Since the offer was already received by the
                          defendant at the time of execution of Agreement on 09.02.2006, it cannot be
                          said that it was a contingent Contract dependent on some uncertain event.
                          The execution of the offer to execute the conveyance deed may have been
                          delayed, but this is not a situation where there existed no property or where
                          there were no proprietary rights in the defendant. Mere delay cannot make
                          any agreement as dependent on uncertain terms.

                          100. The offer of letter had already been received and it was the defendant
                          who had to do the needful. Therefore, the execution of the requisite
                          documents in favour of the defendant was not an uncertain event, but was
                          well-defined with the only variable being the time. It cannot be said that it
                          was a contingent Contract and, therefore, void as claimed by the defendant.

                          101. The issue is decided against the defendant.

                                ISSUE NO. 6:

                          "6.   Is the plaintiff entitled to a decree for specific performance of the
                                agreement to sell dated 09.02.2006? OPP"

 
102. Another aspect which has been argued by the defendant and needs
                          consideration is that even though the defendant vide his Letter dated
                          06.07.2006/ Ex. P3 had cancelled the Agreement, but no relief for
                          declaration that the cancellation of the Agreement to Sell by the defendant
                          was void and illegal, has been sought by the plaintiff. Without first
                          challenging the cancellation, no specific performance of the cancelled
                          Agreement can be sought as has been held in 
I.S. Sikandar (Dead) By Lrs.&
                          Ors. vs. K. Subramani & Ors.
 (2013) 15 SCC 27.


                          103. The plaintiff has failed to seek the relief of declaration that the
                          termination of the cancellation of Agreement to Sell by the defendant was
                          illegal and non-est. In the absence of any such prayer, the Suit filed by the
                          plaintiff for grant of Decree of Specific Performance is not maintainable in
                          law, for the simple reason, that a Decree for Specific Performance is sought
                          in respect of the Agreement to Sell which has become non-existent pursuant
                          to its cancellation. The plaintiff was, thus, required to seek a specific
                          declaration in respect of the cancellation of the Agreement as void and in the
