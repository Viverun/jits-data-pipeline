                                      applicant got married on 26.04.2021.                                                 The deceased was
                                      subjected to cruelty and harassment and was also tortured for
                                      dowry within a few days of marriage. A car and ₹2,00,000/- were
                                      demanded by the applicant and his parents and they even tried to
                                      strangulate the deceased. The complainant's daughter died after
                                      forty days of hospitalization, that is, on 21.06.2022.

                                      by the applicant and his parents which led to the registration of
                                      the present FIR.

                                      6.          During the course of the investigation, the statements of
                                      the family members of the deceased were recorded under

                                      the husband/ applicant, Mother-in-Law, and Father-in-Law of the
                                      deceased. It was alleged that the deceased was harassed by the
                                      applicant and her In-Laws for dowry. They demanded a car and
                                      ₹2,00,000/- and often taunted her and even tried to strangulate
                                      her. Due to the alleged behavior of the applicant and his parents,
                                      the deceased was compelled to commit suicide.

                                      7.          The applicant was arrested on 22.06.2022 and the co-

                                      10.         The applicant had preferred two bail applications before
                                      the learned Trial Court, which were dismissed, firstly, on
                                      12.07.2023 and, then on 18.12.2023. Being aggrieved, the
                                      applicant has preferred the present application.

                                      11.         The learned senior counsel for the applicant submits that
                                      the applicant and the deceased shared a good relationship with
                                      each other and she never complained of any altercations or
                                      disputes. The allegations of cruelty and demand for dowry are
                                      made for the first time in the present FIR. He submits that there
                                      was no demand for dowry by the applicant or any of his family
                                      members soon before the death of the deceased.

                                      12.         He submits that the deceased shared a cordial relationship
                                      with her in-laws and they used to encourage her to pursue her
                                      further studies. Furthermore, they were the ones who on seeing
                                      the deceased hanging from the fan, untangled her, rushed her to
                                      the hospital, and attended to her needs during her hospitalisation.

                                      13.         He submits that the deceased committed suicide due to her
                                      hyper and sensitive nature which is evident from the fact that on
                                      an earlier occasion also, she tried to pressurize the applicant by
                                      cutting her wrist and uploading its photograph on WhatsApp.
                                      The said fact was duly admitted by the complainant during his
                                      examination before the learned Trial Court.

                                      14.         He submits that the testimonies of all the material
                                      witnesses have already been recorded in the present case, and
                                      there is no likelihood of the applicant influencing the witnesses.
                                      He further submits that there are inherent contradictions in the
                                      testimony of the complainant recorded before the learned Trial
                                      Court as only vague allegations are made against the applicant
                                      without attributing any specific role in the alleged incident or

                                       stating any date/time where any such incident happened.

                                      15.         He submits that even though the complainant had met the
                                      SDM on the fateful day on which her daughter committed suicide
                                      i.e., on 12.05.2022, however, he did not raise any grievance on
                                      the said day and had only lodged the complaint after the death of
                                      her daughter.

                                      16.         He submits that the investigation is complete and the
                                      chargesheet has already been filed. He states that as per the FSL
                                      Report, nothing incriminating has been found against the
                                      applicant. He further submits that the co-accused persons, being
                                      the parents of the applicant, have already been enlarged on bail
                                      by orders dated 23.05.2023 passed by the learned ASJ-02,
                                      Dwarka Courts, New Delhi. Therefore, the applicant is entitled to
                                      be released on bail on the ground of parity.

                                      17.         Per contra, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for
                                      the State opposes the grant of bail to the present applicant on the
                                      ground that there are serious allegations against him. It is pointed
                                      out that the deceased suffered harassment at the hands of the
                                      applicant and his family members and was compelled to commit
                                      suicide because of their behaviour.

                                      18.         The learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State
                                      further submits that by virtue of 
Section 113B
 of the Indian
                                      Evidence Act,1872, there is a presumption against the applicant
                                      that he caused death owing to the demand for dowry.

                                      19.         I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have
                                      perused their record.

                                      20.         It is not in dispute that the allegations made by the
                                      complainant are that of demand for a car and ₹2 lakhs from the
                                      deceased. It is further alleged that accused persons harassed her
                                      on several occasions which led to the deceased committing

                                      BAIL APPLN. 125/2024                                                                 Page 4 of 8

                                       suicide.

                                      21.         However, it cannot be disputed that there is no previous
                                      complaint against the applicant with respect to alleged
                                      harassment in relation to the demand for dowry. The statements
                                      of the family members of the deceased are also bereft of any
                                      particulars in terms of the date or time with regard to the
                                      instances of demand for dowry.

                                      22.         It is not denied that even though an incident of attempt to
                                      commit suicide took place on 12.05.2021, no complaint or
                                      allegation was made by the complainant till 21.06.2021.

                                      23.         The complainant has also stated in his testimony that he
                                      cannot tell any date, month, or an occasion as to when the
                                      demand of ₹2,00,000/- and for a car was raised by the applicant
                                      and his family members. He also has not been able to say as to
                                      which of the accused persons demanded the money and a car.

                                      24.         
Section 304
 of the IPC reads as under:

                                                  "304B. Dowry death. -- (1) Where the death of a woman is
                                                  caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise
                                                  than under normal circumstances within seven years of her
                                                  marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was
                                                  subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any
                                                  relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any
                                                  demand for dowry, such death shall be called "dowry death",
                                                  and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused
                                                  her death.



                                                  Explanation: For the purposes of this sub-section, "dowry"

                                                  shall have the same meaning as in 
section 2
 of the Dowry
                                                  Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).



                                                  (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with
                                                  imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven
                                                  years but which may extend to imprisonment for life."



                                      25.         The basic ingredient to attract presumption in terms of
                                      
Section 304B
 of the IPC is that the death should have occurred
                                      under circumstances which are not normal within seven years of
                                      her marriage and the victim was subjected to cruelty or

                                       harassment by her husband or any of her husband's relative in
                                      connection with any demand for dowry soon before the death.

                                      26.         It is not a case of the prosecution that the applicant or his
                                      family members have been alternatively charged for offences
                                      under Section 302 or 306 of the 
IPC
. In fact, the other co-
                                      accused persons are stated to have been enlarged on bail by the
                                      learned Trial Court. As pointed out by the learned counsel for the
                                      applicant, at this stage, the FSL Report does not point out
                                      towards any incriminating material against the applicant.

 
27.         It is pointed out that only 10 out of 20 prosecution
                                      witnesses have been examined. It is, however, not disputed that
                                      all the prime witnesses have been examined. The Hon'ble Apex
                                      Court in 
Sajid Khan v. State of Rajasthan & Anr.
: SLP (Crl.)
                                      No. 2290/2023 had granted bail to the accused husband charged
                                      for offences punishable under 
Section 498A
 and 
304B
 of the IPC
                                      considering that all the vital witnesses have been examined and
                                      the accused husband was in custody for around 15 months. It
                                      was noted that conclusion of the trial will take some time.


                                      28.         The object of judicial custody is to secure the presence of
                                      the accused persons during the trial. The object is neither
                                      punitive nor preventive and the deprivation of liberty has been
                                      considered as a punishment. Delay in the commencement and
                                      conclusion of the trial is a factor to be taken into account and the
                                      accused cannot be kept in custody for an indefinite period if the
                                      trial is not likely to be concluded within a reasonable time. The
                                      presence of the accused can be secured at the time of trial by
                                      putting appropriate conditions.

                                      29.         Therefore, in the above circumstances, in the absence of
                                      any specific allegation of demand of dowry or causing
                                      harassment to the deceased soon before her death in connection

                                      BAIL APPLN. 125/2024                                                                 Page 6 of 8

                                       with any demand of dowry; and considering that the applicant
                                      has been in custody since 22.06.2022; and the fact that the
                                      chargesheet has already been filed, I am inclined to grant bail to
                                      the present applicant. Any apprehension of the applicant
                                      absconding or fleeing can also be taken care of by putting
                                      appropriate conditions.

                                      30.         Without commenting further on the merits of the case,
                                      keeping the facts and circumstances in mind and the fact that the
                                      trial is likely to take some time, I am satisfied that the applicant
                                      has made a case for the grant of regular bail.

                                      31.         In view of the above, the applicant is directed to be
                                      released on bail on furnishing a bail bond for a sum of ₹50,000/-
                                      with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of learned
                                      Trial Court / Duty MM / Link MM on the following conditions:

                                                   a. The applicant shall not leave the country without prior
                                                         permission of the learned Trial Court;

                                                   b. The applicant shall cooperate in the trial and appear
                                                         before the learned Trial Court as and when directed;
                                                   c. The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any
                                                         inducement,                threat or promise to any                person
                                                         acquainted with the facts of the present case;
                                                   d. The applicant shall not, in any manner, try to contact
                                                         any of the witnesses;

                                                   e. The applicant shall provide his mobile number to the
                                                         concerned Investigating Officer /SHO at the time of
                                                         his release and the mobile shall be kept in working
                                                         condition at all times;

                                                   f. The applicant shall, in case of change of residential
                                                         address and/or mobile number, intimate the concerned
                                                         Investigating Officer regarding the same.

                                      BAIL APPLN. 125/2024                                                                 Page 7 of 8

                                       32.         In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/ complaint
                                      lodged against the applicant, it would be open to the State to seek
                                      redressal by filing an appropriate application for cancellation of
                                      bail.

                                      33.         It is also made clear that the observations made in the
                                      present case are only for the purpose of considering the bail
                                      application and should not influence the outcome of the trial and
                                      also not be taken as an expression of opinion on the merits of the
                                      case.

                                      34.         The present application is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
