                                CORAM: JUSTICE V. NARASINGH

                                          ORDER

                                         04.07.2023
Order No.

  01.       1.         Heard learned counsel for the Petitioner and learned
            counsel for the State.

            2.         The Petitioner is an accused in connection with 2 (a) C.C.
            Case No.06 of 2023, pending in the Court of the learned Sessions
            Judge-cum-Special Judge, Cuttack, arising out of P.R. No.429 of
            2023, for alleged commission of offences under 
Section
            20(b)(ii)(C)
 of NDPS Act.

            3.         Being aggrieved by the rejection of his application for bail
            U/s.439 
Cr.P.C
. by the learned Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge,
            Cuttack, by order dated 17.05.2023 in the aforementioned case, the
            present BLAPL has been filed.

            4.         It is submitted by the learned counsel that the Petitioner
            along with three others were taken into custody on 17.01.2023 on
            the accusation of possessing contraband to the tune of 60Kgs
            (Ganja).

            5.         It is stated with vehemence that independent seizures have
            been clubbed together so as to attract the rigors of 
Section 37
 of the
            NDPS Act.

                                                                               Page 1 of 2


                                  6.           Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the orders
                                 passed by this Court dated 21.06.2023 and 23.06.2023 in BLAPL
                                 Nos.6242 & 3033 of 2023 respectively and seeks release inter alia
                                 on the ground of parity.

                                 7.           It is further submitted by the learned counsel that the since
                                 final form has already been submitted as evident from the order of
                                 rejection and as the Petitioner is the first offender, he may be
                                 released on bail.

                                 7.           Per contra, learned counsel for the State opposes the prayer
                                 for bail in view of the bar contained in 
Section 37
 of the NDPS Act
                                 and the seizure being a common one, the defence of the Petitioner
                                 does not stand to reason and hence the bail application does not
                                 deserve consideration.

                                 8.           Taking into account the release of the co-accused and
                                 bleak chance of early trial, this Court directs the Petitioner to be
                                 released on bail on such terms to be fixed by the learned Court in
                                 seisin.

                                 9.           Before releasing the Petitioner on bail, learned Court in
                                 seisin is called upon to verify criminal antecedent of the Petitioner.
                                 If it comes to the fore that the Petitioner has any criminal
                                 antecedent, this order shall stand recalled.

                                 10.          Additionally, it is directed that the Petitioner shall appear
                                 before the jurisdictional police station once every week on such date
                                 and time to be fixed by the learned Court in seisin till conclusion of
                                 trial. Certification of such appearance shall be submitted to the Court
                                 in seisin.

                                 11.          The BLAPL thus stands disposed of.

                                 12.          Urgent certified copy of this order be granted as per rules.
