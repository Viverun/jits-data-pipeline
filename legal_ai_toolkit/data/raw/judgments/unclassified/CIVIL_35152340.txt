C/ARBI.P/159/2022                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023

                                                                                  undefined





1.     Heard learned Senior Counsel Mr. Devang Nanavati

     assisted by learned counsel Mr. Tabish Samdani appearing

     for the petitioner, and learned counsel Mr. Mohit Gupta

     appearing for the respondent.





2.             In the instant petition, seeking for appointment of

     arbitrator under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Arbitration and

     Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act,

     1996', for short), two issues have been raised by the learned

     counsel for the respondent for consideration, raising an

     objection with regard to appointment of Arbitrator on the

     dispute arising out of the Maintenance and Amenities

     Agreement (hereinafter referred to as 'M & E Agreement',

     for short) dated 07.05.2018, and further with regard to the

     territorial jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the petition

     under 
Section 11
 of the Act, 1996.





3.             Contesting the claim of the petitioner to appoint

     Arbitrator, to deal with the dispute arising out of the M & E

     Agreement, it is argued by the learned Senior Counsel for

     the petitioner that M & E Agreement contains no arbitration

                                                                                  undefined




     clause and the arbitration clause in the Lease Agreement

     dated 01.03.2018 cannot be invoked to refer the dispute to

     the Arbitrator.   Second submission is that, even if it is

     assumed for a moment without admitting that the arbitration

     clause under the Lease Agreement dated 01.03.2018 can be

     invoked for appointment of Arbitrator to deal with the above

     noted dispute, this Court does not have territorial jurisdiction

     to entertain the petition under 
Section 11
 of the Act, 1996,

     inasmuch as, the seat of the arbitration as agreed is at

     Bangalore, as per Clause '25' of the agreement.                   It was

     argued that a bare reading of the Clause 25(ii) of the Lease

     Agreement indicates that the parties had agreed that the

     arbitration proceedings will be conducted at Bangalore, and

     hence, the seat of the arbitration having been agreed, the

     jurisdiction to entertain the petition under 
Section 11
 of the

     Act, 1996 can only be with the Karnataka High Court.

5.             In reply to the objections raised by the learned

     counsel appearing for the respondent, it was argued by the

     learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner that the

     petitioner and the respondent had executed a Lease

     Agreement dated 01.03.2018 for leasing of the premises

     admeasuring 68,890 sq. feet at Building No. 12, Jupiter

     Industrial & Logiparks, Survey No. 607, Vadala Road, Village

     Hariyala, District Kheda, Gujarat - 387120 for warehouses.

     Another agreement named as M & E Agreement dated

     07.05.2018 was executed between the parties, whereunder

     the respondent had agreed to maintain the premises under

     Lease and provide various common services and amenities

     there. Some dispute has arisen between the parties, as a

     result of which, the petitioner had terminated the Lease

     Agreement      as   also     the    Maintenance      Agreement              on

     07.07.2021, asking the respondent to take the possession of

     the premises-in-question and also to refund the security

     deposit paid by the petitioner under the M & E Agreement.



6.             It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel

     appearing for the petitioner that the respondent had failed to

     perform their contractual obligations and stopped the water

     supply in the premises. The petitioner had issued pre-

     arbitration notice dated 16.05.2022 disclosing its intention of

     amicable settlement of disputes in terms of Clause '25' of the

     Lease Agreement.           By the reply dated 22.06.2022, the

     respondent had denied the petitioner's stance mainly on the

     ground that the Lease Agreement and M & E Agreement are

     separate agreements and that though the disputes arising

     out of the Lase Agreement are subject to arbitration, the

     arbitration proceedings with respect to the disputes arising

     out of the M & E Agreement, cannot be referred to the

     arbitration by invoking Clause '25' of the Lease Agreement.

  petitioner that M & E Agreement is an ancillary agreement,

  which is related to the principal agreement (which is Lease

  Agreement) and performance of one agreement was being

  intrinsically related to another agreement.                  Clause '25' of

  the Lease Agreement can be invoked. The Clause 25 of the

  Lease Agreement and the clauses of M & E Agreement

  placed        before   the   Court,      are   relevant      to     be      noted

             to, and be finally settled by arbitration proceedings.

             arbitrator mutually agreeable to, and appointed by,
             the Parties. In the event the Parties fail to appoint a
             single arbitrator due to non-cooperation from the
             other Party, post due discussions, the other party shall
             be free to appoint a sole arbitrator to conduct the
             Proceedings. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
             final and binding on the Parties. Each Party shall be

             the common area of the Jupiter Industrial & Logiparks.



             2)      TERM:

             This Agreement shall be operative & co-terminus from
             the date of the operation of the Agreement to Lease dt.
             1st March 2018 (01.03.2018) and shall be operative

             case may be."



8.             The submission of the learned Senior Counsel

     appearing for the petitioner is that the fact that the M & E

     Agreement has been made operative and co-terminus from

     the date of operation of the agreement to lease dated

     01.03.2018, and further has been made operative only under

     the terms of the Lease Agreement, makes it clear that M & E

     Agreement is an ancillary agreement, which was intrinsically

     related to principal agreement.              In absence of M & E

     Agreement, the petitioner was not in position to enjoy the

     premises as the responsibilities of the respondent in carrying

     out the operation as contemplated by M & E Agreement were

     to be discharged with respect to the premises on lease. The

     Lease     Agreement     being      the      Mother     agreement,             the

     arbitration clause therein would have to be invoked for

     deciding the disputes arising out of the ancillary agreement,

     which is M & E Agreement.            The claims of the petitioner

     cannot be bifurcated in two different jurisdictions.

     Gangavaram Port Ltd.
 reported in (2017) 9 SCC 729, to

     submit that the question whether or not the arbitration

     clause contained in another document is incorporated in the

     contract, is always a question of construction of document

     with reference to the intention of the parties.               In a case,

     where several parties are involved in a single transaction, or

     commercial project, all the parties can be covered by the

     arbitration clause in the main agreement. In cases involving

     execution of multiple agreements between the same parties,

     two essential features are to be seen; firstly, that all ancillary

  agreements are related to Mother agreement and, secondly,

  performance of one is so intrinsically interlinked with the

  other agreement that they are incapable of being beneficially

  performed without performance of the others or severed

  from the rest. The intention of the parties to refer all the

  disputes of the parties to the Arbitral Tribunal is one of the

  determinative factor.      Where agreements are consequential

  and in the nature of a follow-up to the principal or mother

  agreement, the latter containing the arbitration agreement

  and such agreement being so intrinsically intermingled or

  interdependent that it is their composite performance which

  shall discharge the parties to their respective mutual

  obligations and performances, that would be a sufficient

  indicator of intent of the parties to refer signatory as well as

  non-signatory parties to arbitration.


10.            On the question of territorial jurisdiction of this

  Court, according to Clause '25' of the Lease Agreement, it is

  argued by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that

  the statement in Clause '25' that "the parties agree that the

  arbitration proceedings will be conducted at Bangalore", will

  'venue', and not the 'seat' of arbitration. 
Section 20(3)
 of the

  Act, 1996 gives freedom to the Arbitral Tribunal to meet at

  any      place    for   conducting      hearings    at    the      place        of

  convenience in the matter, such as, consultation among its

  members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties. It is

  further submitted that same clause '25' states with regard to

  jurisdiction that "Courts at Ahmedabad only shall have

  exclusive jurisdiction in all matters arising out of this

  agreement." If both the above statements in Clause 25 (ii)

  and (iii) are read together and analysed to ascertain the

  intention of the parties, it can be seen that Bangalore was

  chosen as the 'venue' and not the 'seat'.                The arbitration

  agreement at Clause '25' provides that exclusive jurisdiction

  vests with Courts at Ahmedabad; the agreement was

  executed and stamped in Gujarat; the respondent is situated

  in Ahmedabad            and the     petitioner has its Corporate

  headquarters in Ahmedabad; the premises in dispute is

  indicative that the stated place of arbitration is merely a

             "73. A non-signatory or third party could be subjected
             to arbitration without their prior consent, but this
             would only be in exceptional cases. The Court will
             examine these exceptions from the touchstone of direct
             relationship to the party signatory to the arbitration
             agreement, direct commonality of the subject matter
             and the agreement between the parties being a
             composite transaction. The transaction should be of a
             composite nature where performance of mother
             agreement may not be feasible without aid, execution
             and performance of the supplementary or ancillary
             agreements, for achieving the common object and
             collectively having bearing on the dispute. Besides all
             this, the Court would have to examine whether a
             composite reference of such parties would serve the
             ends of justice. Once this exercise is completed and the
             Court answers the same in the affirmative, the
             reference of even non-signatory parties would fall
             within the exception afore-discussed.



             74. In a case like the present one, where origin and
             end of all is with the Mother or the Principal
             Agreement, the fact that a party was non-signatory to
             one or other agreement may not be of much
             significance. The performance of any one of such
             agreements may be quite irrelevant without the
             performance and fulfillment of the Principal or the
             Mother Agreement. Besides designing the corporate
             management to successfully complete the joint
             ventures, where the parties execute different
             agreements but all with one primary object in mind, the
             Court would normally hold the parties to the bargain of
             arbitration and not encourage its avoidance. In cases
             involving execution of such multiple agreements, two
             essential features exist; firstly, all ancillary agreements
             are relatable to the mother agreement and secondly,
             performance of one is so intrinsically inter- linked with
             the other agreements that they are incapable of being
             beneficially performed without performance of the
             others or severed from the rest. The intention of the
             parties to refer all the disputes between all the parties
             to the arbitral tribunal is one of the determinative

15.            
In 
Duro Felguera S.A. versus Gangavaram Port

  Ltd.
 (supra), it was held in paragraph 35 as under : -


               "35. 
Section 7(5)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
               (Amendment) Act, 2015 reads as under:-



               "7. Arbitration agreement.--(1)-(4)


               (5) The reference in a contract to a document
               containing an arbitration clause constitutes an
               arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and
               the reference is such as to make that arbitration
               clause part of the contract."



               As per 
Section 7 (5)
 of the Act, even though the
               contract between the parties does not contain a
               provision for arbitration, an arbitration clause
               contained in an independent document will be
               imported and engrafted in the contract be- tween the
               parties, by reference to such independent document
               in the contract, if the reference is such as to make the
               arbitration clause in such document, a part of the
               contract. Section 7(5) requires a conscious
               acceptance of the arbitration clause from another
               document, as a part of their contract, before such
               arbitration clause could be read as a part of the
               contract between the parties. The question whether
               or not the arbitration clause contained in another
               document, is incorporated in the contract, is always a
               question of construction of document in reference to
               intention of the parties. The terms of a contract may
               have to be ascertained by reference to more than one
               document."

               (05.03.2012) does not have any arbitration clause, by
               the above clauses, it is clearly linked with the main

               the purpose of onward transmission of leasing of the
               goods by Rishabh to Dante Energy. There is no merit
               in the contention that the Sale and Purchase
               Agreement is not connected with the Equipment
               Lease Agreement with Dante Energy."





               21. Mr. Sibal, learned senior counsel for the
               respondents submitted that the High Court rightly
               relied upon Sukanya Holdings as it relates to 
Part-I of
               the Act
 that the parties who are not signatories to the
               arbitration agreement (in this case, Astonfield under
               Sale and Purchase Agreement) cannot be referred to
               arbitration. It was further submitted that Chloro
               Controls arises under 
Part-II of the Act
 and was
               rightly distinguished by the High Court and Sukanya
               Holdings was not overruled by Chloro Controls and
               hence, the appellants cannot rely upon Chloro
               Controls. It was contended that the Sale and
               Purchase Agreement (05.03.2012) under which huge
               money was parted with, is the main agreement
               having no arbitration clause cannot be referred to
               arbitration. It was submitted that the subject matter
               of the suit cannot be bifurcated between the parties

               22. In Chloro Controls, this Court was dealing with
               the scope and interpretation of 
Section 45
 of the Act -
               
Part-II of the Act
 and in that context, discussed the
               scope of relevant principles on the basis of which a
               non-signatory party also could be bound by the
               arbitration agreement. Under 
Section 45
 of the Act,
               an applicant seeking reference of disputes to
               arbitration can either be a party to the arbitration

               through or under him....." includes non-signatory

                    It was finally held in paragraph 24 therein in

       the facts of that case that though there are different

       agreements involving several parties, but they pertain to a

       single commercial transaction and as per the commercial

       understanding between the parties, the project has been

       effected through several agreements, the agreement -

       Equipment Lease Agreement for commissioning of the

       Solar Plant is the principal / main agreement. The other

       two agreements; (i) Equipment and Material Supply

       Contract       and    (ii)      Engineering,       Installation            and

       Commissioning Contract were ancillary agreements which

       led to the main purpose of commissioning the Photovoltaic

       Solar Plant.          Even though, the sale and projects

       agreements did not contain arbitration clause, it being

       integrally connected with the commissioning of the Solar

17.            We may note further decision in the case of 
M.R.

  Engineers and Contractors Private Limited versus Som

  Datt Builders Limited
 reported in (2009) 7 SCC 696,

  relied on by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner,

  referring to the wordings of 
Section 7(5)
 of the Act, 1996,

  wherein it is held that : -






             "15. Section 7(5) therefore requires a conscious
             acceptance of the arbitration clause from another
             document, by the parties, as a part of their contract,
             before such arbitration clause could be read as a part
             of the contract between the parties. 
But the Act
 does
             not contain any indication or guidelines as to the
             conditions to be fulfilled before a reference to a
             document in a contract, can be construed as a
             reference incorporating an arbitration clause
             contained in such document, into the contract. In the
             absence of such statutory guidelines, the normal
             rules of construction of contracts will have to be
             followed.

                                                                                       undefined




             another document in a contract and incorporation of
             another document in a contract, by reference. In the
             first case, the parties intend to adopt only specific
             portions or part of the referred document for the
             purposes of the contract. In the second case, the
             parties intend to incorporate the referred document
             in entirety, into the contract. Therefore when there is
             a reference to a document in a contract, the court has
             to consider whether the reference to the document is
             with the intention of incorporating the contents of
             that document in entirety into the contract, or with
             the intention of adopting or borrowing specific
             portions of the said document for application to the
             contract.



18.            Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has

  further relied upon the decision in the 
State of M.P. and

  another versus Mahendra Kumar Saraf and Others


  reported in 2005 (3) M.P.L.J. 578, to submit the meaning

  of co-terminus as it should mean to imply two things or

  objects having the same end, same finishing point or same

  terminating point. It is argued that both the agreements

  namely Lease Agreement and M & E Agreement have 'co-

  terminus' and integrally related to each other, performance

  of Lease Agreement being dependent upon the M & E

  Agreement, both being part of the same transaction, the

  arbitration clause '25' in the Lease Agreement will have to

  be invoked to refer the dispute to the Arbitrator.

19.            From the above noted discussion, taking note of the

  decisions of the Apex Court, this Court finds itself in

  complete agreement with the contention of the learned

  Senior Counsel for the petitioner that performance of the

  Lease Agreement was not possible without performance of

  the M & E Agreement. They being integrally related to each

  other, even if there is no separate arbitration clause in M &

  E Agreement, the intention of the parties can be ascertained

  from the Lease Agreement that they had agreed to refer the

  disputes arising out of the transaction, which is lease of the

  premises-in-question to arbitration. The petitioner cannot be

  forced to submit to two different Forums to determine the

  disputes arising out of one single transaction.                            The

  arbitration clause '25' of the Lease Agreement is a conscious

  acceptance of the agreement clause as part of the M & E

  Agreement between the parties in view of the above noted

  facts and the language employed in 
Section 7(5)
 of the Act,

  1996. The objections raised by the learned Counsel for the

  respondent with regard to invocation of Clause '25' of the

  Lease Agreement seeking to refer the disputes arising out of

  the M & E Agreement to the Arbitrator, therefore, is liable to

  be turned down.





20.            Coming to the question of territorial jurisdiction of

  this Court to entertain the application under 
Section 11
 of

  the Act, 1996, the contention of the learned counsel for the

  respondent that this Court lacks jurisdiction to appoint

  Arbitrator under Section 11, is based on the statement in the

  Lease Agreement, noted above, which states that "the parties

  agree that the arbitration proceedings will be conducted at

  Bangalore". The contention is that this statement in the

  Lease Agreement not only decides the "venue" but also the

  "seat" of arbitration.





21.            Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, however,

  relied upon various judgments of the Apex Court and Delhi

  High Court as noted above to submit that reference to the

  decision of the Apex Court in 
BGS SGS Soma JV versus

  NPHC Ltd.

  place of arbitration, the venue, is really the seat of

  arbitration is misplaced. The submission is that these

  judgments are distinguishable in the facts and circumstances

  of the case as a result of misreading of the decision of the

  Apex Court.






22.            To examine the issue, this Court is required to note

  the decision of the Apex Court 
BGS SGS Soma JV versus

  NPHC Ltd.
 (
supra), Mankastu Impex Private Limited

  versus Airvisual Limited
 reported in (2020) 5 SCC 399,

  wherein the question of "seat" and "venue" with reference to

  the arbitration proceedings has been decided.
 
In 
BGS SGS

  Soma JV versus NPHC Ltd.
 (supra), the issue was

  pertaining to maintainability of appeal under 
Section 37
 of

  the Act, 1996, on the premise that in view of the arbitration

  clause, whether the seat of arbitration proceedings was New

  Delhi or Faridabad, consequent upon which the petition

  under 
Section 34
 of the Act, 1996 may be filed dependent on

  where the seat of arbitration was located.

  judgment impugned, the Punjab and Haryana High Court

  referred two earlier decisions of the Apex Court in 
Bharat

  Aluminum Co.(BALCO) vs. Kaiser Aluminum
 reported

  in (
2012) 9 SCC 522 and Indus Mobile Distribution (P)

  Ltd. versus Datawind Innovations (P) Ltd.
 reported in

  (2017) 7 SCC 678, along with other decisions to arrive at a

  conclusion that the arbitration clause 
in that case
 did not

  refer to the seat of arbitration, but only referred to the

  "venue" of arbitration. Consequently, since a part of the

  cause of action had arisen in Faridabad, the Faridabad

  Commercial Court alone would have jurisdiction over the

  arbitral proceedings, and the Courts at New Delhi would

  have no such jurisdiction. The correctness of the said

  proposition was assailed before the Apex Court.                 The Apex

  Court has proceeded to lay down the law on what constitutes

  the "juridical seat" of arbitration proceedings, and whether,

  once the seat is delineated by the arbitration agreement,

  courts at the place of the seat would alone, thereafter, have

  exclusive jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings.

  adopted by the United Nations Commission on International

25.            It was further discussed in paragraph '31' and '32' in

  
BGS SGS Soma JV versus NPHC Ltd.
 (supra) that from

  the above noted provisions, the new concept of "juridical

  seat" of the arbitration proceedings has been given by the

  Act, 1996 and the arbitral award is now not only to state its

  date, but also the place of arbitration as determined in

  accordance with Section 20.                   However, the definition of

  "Court" has been narrowed down to mean only principal civil

  court and the High Court in exercise of their original

  ordinary civil jurisdiction.       Thus, the concept of "juridical

  seat" of the arbitral proceedings, and its relationship to the

  jurisdiction of the courts which are then to look into matters

  relating to the arbitral proceedings including challenges to

  arbitral awards had to be developed in accordance with

  international practice on a case by case basis by the Apex

  Court.






 
Noticing that in some of the earlier decisions of the

  Apex Court, no proper distinction between the "seat" and

  "venue" of arbitral proceedings was made, the observations

  in the judgment in the case of 
Union of India versus

  McDonnell Douglas Corporation
 reported in (1993) 2

  Lloyd's Rep 48, were noted that the provisions of 
Section

  2(1)(e)
 of the Act, 1996 had been considered therein to

  provide jurisdiction of the original Civil Court and the High

  Court to decide the question forming "the subject matter of

  the arbitration", if the same had been the subject matter of a

  suit. The term "subject matter of the arbitration" cannot be

                                                                                       undefined




  confused with "subject matter of the suit". The term "subject

  matter" in 
Section 2(1)(e)
 is confined to 
Part I of the Act,

  1996
. It has a reference and connection with the process of

  dispute resolution. It's purpose is to identify the courts

  having supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings.

  Hence, it refers to a court which would essentially be a court

  of the seat of the arbitration process. It was noted that the

  provisions of 
Section 2(1)(e)
 have to be construed keeping in

  view the provisions in Section 20, which give recognition to

  party autonomy. It was further noted that the legislature has

  intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court

  which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is

  located and the courts where the arbitration takes place.

  Therefore, the Courts where the arbitration takes place,

  would be required to exercise supervisory control over the

  arbitral process. It was observed : -

               interim order Under 
Section 17
 of the Arbitration
               Act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order
               under Section 37 must lie to the Courts of Delhi
               being the Courts having supervisory jurisdiction over
               the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This
               would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations
               to be performed under the contract were to be
               performed either at Mumbai or at Kolkata, and only
               arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such
               circumstances, both the Courts would have
               jurisdiction, i.e., the Court within whose jurisdiction
               the subject matter of the suit is situated and the
               courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute
               resolution, i.e., arbitration is located."



26.            It was further noted that a plain reading of the

  Section 20 leaves no room for doubt that where the place of

  arbitration is in India, the parties are free to agree to any

  "place" or "seat" within India. In absence of the agreement

  of the parties thereto, Sub-section (2) of Section 20

  authorizes the tribunal to determine the place / seat of such

  arbitration. Section 20(3), however, enables the tribunal to

  meet at any place for conducting hearings at a place of

  convenience in matters such as consultations among its

  members for hearing witnesses, experts or the parties.                          The

             "99. The fixation of the most convenient "venue" is taken
             care of by Section 20(3). Section 20, has to be read in
             the context of 
Section 2(2)
, which places a threshold
             limitation on the applicability of Part I, where the place
             of arbitration is in India. Therefore, Section 20 would
             also not support the submission of the extra-territorial
             applicability of Part I, as canvassed by the Learned

27.            While examining the concept of "juridical seat" of the

  arbitral proceedings and the important test 
laid down in
 the

  decision of the English Courts and the Apex Court, in order

  to determine whether the "seat" of the arbitral proceedings

  has, in fact, been indicated in the agreement between the

  parties, it was observed by the Apex Court in BGS SGS

  Soma JV versus NPHC Ltd. (Supra), in paragraph '82' as

  under : -





             "82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it
             may be concluded that whenever there is the
             designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration
             clause as being the "venue" of the arbitration
             proceedings, the expression "arbitration proceedings"

             would make it clear that the "venue" is really the
             "seat" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid
             expression does not include just one or more
             individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration
             proceedings as a whole, including the making of an
             award at that place. This language has to be
             contrasted with language such as "tribunals are to
             meet or have witnesses, experts or the parties" where
             only hearings are to take place in the "venue", which

                                                                                        undefined




             may lead to the conclusion, other things being equal,
             that the venue so stated is not the "seat" of arbitral
             proceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting.
             Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings "shall
             be held" at a particular venue would also indicate that
             the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to
             a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place
             is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled
             with there being no other significant contrary indicia
             that the stated venue is merely a "venue" and not the
             "seat" of the arbitral proceedings, would then
             conclusively show that such a clause designates a
             "seat" of the arbitral proceedings. In an International
             context, if a supranational body of rules is to govern
             the arbitration, this would further be an indicia that
             "the venue", so stated, would be the seat of the
             arbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would
             be replaced by the 
Arbitration Act, 1996
 as applying
             to the "stated venue", which then becomes the "seat"
             for the purposes of arbitration."

Section 2(2)
, Part - I, shall apply where the place of

  arbitration is in India.            If the "international commercial

  arbitration" is seated in India, then Part - I of the Act shall

  apply. It was observed in paragraph '19' and '20' therein as

  under : -





                "19. The seat of arbitration is a vital aspect of any
                arbitration proceedings. Significance of the seat of
                arbitration is that it determines the applicable law
                when deciding the arbitration proceedings and
                arbitration procedure as well as judicial review over
                the arbitration award. The situs is not just about
                where an institution is based or where the hearings
                will be held. But it is all about which court would
                have the supervisory power over the arbitration
                proceedings. 
In 
Enercon (India) Limited and others
                v. Enercon GMBH and another
, (2014) 5 SCC 1, the
                Supreme Court held that


                      "The location of the Seat will determine the
                courts that will have exclusive jurisdiction to
                oversee the arbitration proceedings. It was further
                held that the Seat normally carries with it the
                choice of that country's arbitration/curial law".


                (emphasis supplied)



                20. It is well-settled that "seat of arbitration" and
                "venue of arbitration" cannot be used inter-
                changeably. It has also been established that mere
                expression "place of arbitration" cannot be the
                basis to determine the intention of the parties that
                they have intended that place as the "seat" of
                arbitration. The intention of the parties as to the
                "seat" should be determined from other clauses in
                the agreement and the conduct of the parties."

  agreement entered into between the parties provided Hong

  Kong as the place of arbitration, however that fact by itself

  will not be lead to the conclusion that the parties have

  chosen Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration. However, by

  reading further clauses of the arbitration agreement, it was

  observed that reference to Hong Kong as "place of

  arbitration" is not a simple reference as the "venue" for the

  arbitral proceedings; but a reference to Hong Kong is for

  final resolution by arbitration administered in Hong Kong.

  The agreement between the parties that the dispute "shall be

  referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in

  Hong Kong" clearly suggests that the parties have agreed

  that the arbitration be seated at Hong Kong and that laws of

  Hong Kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as well

  as have power of judicial review over the arbitration award.

                      seat of arbitration is Mumbai and Clause 19
                      further makes it clear that jurisdiction
                      exclusively vests in the Mumbai courts. Under
                      the Law of Arbitration, unlike 
the Code of Civil
                      Procedure
 which applies to suits filed in courts,
                      a reference to "seat" is a concept by which a
                      neutral venue can be chosen by the parties to
                      an arbitration clause. The neutral venue may
                      not in the classical sense have jurisdiction - that
                      is, no part of the cause of action may have
                      arisen at the neutral venue and neither would
                      any of the provisions of 
Sections 16
 to 
21
 of
                      CPC be attracted. In arbitration law however, as
                      has been held above, the moment "seat" is
                      determined, the fact that the seat is at Mumbai
                      would vest Mumbai courts with exclusive
                      jurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral
                      proceedings arising out of the agreement
                      between the parties."



30.            From the reading of the above noted decisions, it can

  be seen that mere designation of a place of arbitration in

  arbitration clause as being "venue of the arbitration

  proceedings", would not be determinative factor to decide

  the "seat of the arbitral proceedings". The language of the

  arbitral agreement has to be read on case by case basis to

  determine as to whether "venue" so stated is "seat" of

  arbitral proceedings, or it is only convenient place of

  meeting. The moment the seat is designated, it is akin to an

  exclusive jurisdiction clause for the purpose of regulating

  arbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement between

  the parties.





31.            Taking note of the above, this Court is further

  required to go through the recent decision of the Apex Court

Ravi Ranjan Developers Pvt. Ltd.

  versus Aditya Kumar Chatterjee
 passed in Civil Appeal

  arising out of Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s).

  17397-17398/2021 decided on 24.03.2022. The question

  before the Apex Court in 
the said decision
 was with respect

  to the maintainability of the application under 
Section 11(6)


  of the Act, 1996, for appointment of Arbitrator.                         The

  challenge was to the order of the Calcutta High Court in

  rejecting the review application seeking for recall of the

  order of appointment of Arbitrator.        In the context of the

  arbitration clause therein, which stated that "seat of the

  arbitral tribunal shall be at Calcutta", the dispute with

  regard to the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High

  Court examined. It was contended that the development

  agreement (in question therein) is in respect of the property

  situated at Muzaffarpur in Bihar outside the jurisdiction of

  the Calcutta High Court. The development agreement was

  executed and registered in the State of Bihar, outside the

  jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court.             The appellant

  therein had its registered office at Patna, outside the

  jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, and has no

  establishment or does not carry on any business within the

  jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. It was, thus, argued

  by the learned counsel for the appellant therein that no part

  of the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of

  Calcutta High Court. 
Section 2(1)(e)
 of the Act, 1996 defines

  the Court, in case of arbitration other than international

  commercial arbitration, to mean Principal Civil Court of

  Original jurisdiction in a district and would include the High

  Court in exercise of its ordinary original jurisdiction, having

  jurisdiction to decide the question forming the subject matter

  of arbitration, if the same had been the subject matter of the

  suit. The contention, thus, was that subject to the pecuniary

  or other limitations prescribed by law, suits for recovery of

  immovable property or determination of any other right to or

  interest in any movable property or compensation for wrong

  to immovable property, is to be instituted in the Court, within

  the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated.

  Certain specific suits relating to immovable property can be

  instituted either in the Court within the limits of whose

  jurisdiction the property is situated, or in the Court within

  the local limits of whose jurisdiction the Defendant actually

  or voluntarily resides or carries on business. All other suits

  are to be instituted in a Court, within the local limits of

  whose jurisdiction the Defendant voluntarily resides or

  carries on business. A suit may also be instituted in the Court

  within whose jurisdiction, the cause of action arises either

  wholly or in part. In the said case, no suit could have been

  filed in any court over which the Calcutta High Court

  exercises jurisdiction, since the suit pertaining to immovable

  property situated at Muzaffarpur in Bihar, would be outside

  the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. No

  part of cause of action had arisen therein within the

  territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court and the

  appellant therein, who would be in position of Defendant in a

  suit, neither resides nor carries on any business within the

  jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. It was, thus, argued

  that an application for appointment of Arbitration under

  Section 11(6), necessarily has to be moved in the High Court,

  irrespective of whether the High Court has supervisory

  jurisdiction to decide the suit in respect of the subject matter

  of arbitration situated and irrespective of whether the High

  Court at all has Original jurisdiction to entertain and decide

  suits. Dealing with this contention therein, it was observed

  in paragraph Nos. 26, 27 and 28 as under : -


           "26. Of course, under Section 11(6), an application for
           appointment of an Arbitrator necessarily has to be moved
           in the High Court, irrespective of whether the High Court
           has the jurisdiction to decide a suit in respect of the
           subject matter of arbitration and irrespective of whether
           the High Court at all has original jurisdiction to entertain
           and decide suits. As such, the definition of Court in 
Section
           2(1)(e)
 of the A&C Act would not be applicable in the case
           of a High Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6)
           of the A&C Act to appoint an Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal.

           initiated in any High Court in India, irrespective of
           whether the Respondent resided or carried on business
           within the jurisdiction of that High Court, and irrespective

             facts and circumstances of that case this Court found

33.            The decision of the Apex Court in the case of

  
Mankastu Impex Private Limited versus Airvisual

  Limited
 (supra), was also noted by the Apex Court therein

  to record that : -






            "46. In this case, the Development Agreement provided
            that the sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal would be
            conducted in Kolkata. As observed above, the parties
            never agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Calcutta
            High Court in respect of disputes, nor did the parties 12
            agree upon Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. Kolkata
            was only the venue for sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal.



            47. It is well settled that, when two or more Courts have
            jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising out of an
            arbitration agreement, the parties might, by agreement,
            decide to refer all disputes to any one Court to the
            exclusion of all other Courts, which might otherwise
            have had jurisdiction to decide the disputes. The parties
            cannot, however, by consent, confer jurisdiction on a
            Court which inherently lacked jurisdiction, as argued by
            Mr. Sinha.



            48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not
            agree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the
            Courts in Kolkata. It was not the intention of the parties
            that Kolkata should be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata
            was only intended to be the venue for arbitration
            sittings.   Accordingly,    the    Respondent      himself
            approached the District Court at Muzaffarpur, and not a
            Court in Kolkata for interim protection under Section 9
            of the A&C Act. The Respondent having himself invoked
            the jurisdiction of the District Court at Muzaffarpur, is
            estopped from contending that the parties had agreed to

            confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Calcutta High Court
            to the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the parties to
            the agreement construed the arbitration clause to
            designate Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. We are
            constrained to hold that Calcutta High Court inherently
            lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application of the
            Respondent under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Arbitration Act.
            The High Court should have decided the objection raised
            by the Appellant, to the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High
            Court, to entertain the application under Section 11(6) of
            A&C Act, before appointing an Arbitrator."



34.            The appeal was ultimately allowed and the order of

  appointment of Arbitrator and dismissal of the review

  application was set aside on the ground that the order of

  appointment of Arbitrator was without jurisdiction. It was

  held that the parties did not agree to submit to the

  jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court and they had only agreed

  that the sitting of the Arbitral Tribunal would be in Kolkata.



35.            Further, this Court may note some other decisions of

  other High Courts relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel

  for the petitioner.

BGS SGS Soma JV versus

   NPHC Ltd.
 (

   Limited versus Airvisual Limited
 (supra), as also other

   decisions of other High Courts has held in paragraph 19 and

   20 as under : -






               "19. I find myself in consonance with the above
               view. In circumstances where a place is designated
               merely as a 'venue' and courts of another place
               have been granted the exclusive jurisdiction, the
               latter is a clear 'contrary indicia'. It can be inferred
               from a comprehensive reading of such clauses, that
               the 'venue' is a convenient place of arbitration and
               not the seat.

            arbitration to be New Delhi, but in the other Clause, they
            had agreed that all actions and proceedings arising out
            of/related to the Contract shall lie in the Courts of
            competent jurisdiction at Guwahati.
 The Court held that
            since the Clauses of the Agreement expressly provided
            that the Courts at Guwahati would have exclusive
            jurisdiction, it was a contrary indicator coming within
            the exception as held by the Supreme Court in the case
            of DSG SGS Souma (supra).





 
29. Similarly, in 
Cravants Media Pvt. Ltd. vs. Jharkhand
            State Cooperative Milk Food Federation Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.
            Arbitration
 petition No. 915/2021 decided on 06.12.2021
            by the Coordinate Bench, the Dispute Resolution Clause
            provided that the venue of arbitration shall be Ranchi,
            but any disputes arising out of this agreement shall be
            subject to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of Courts in
            Delhi. It was held that the intention of the parties was
            clear that the seat would be in New Delhi and the Court
            at New Delhi was held to have the jurisdiction.


            30. In the facts in hand, the relevant Clause 48 and
            Clause 49 read as under:





                    48. All or any dispute arising out of touching upon
                    or in relation to the terms of the Lease Deed
                    including the interpretation and validity of the
                    terms thereof and the respective rights and
                    obligations of the parties shall be settled amicably
                    by mutual discussion failing which the same shall
                    be settled through arbitration. The arbitration
                    shall be governed by the 
Arbitration and
                    Conciliation Act, 1996
 or any statutory
                    amendments/modifications thereto for the time
                    being in force. The arbitration proceedings shall
                    he held at an appropriate location in New Delhi by
                    a Sole Arbitrator who shall be appointed by the
                    Lessee and whose decision shall be final and
                    binding upon Lessor.



                      The Lessor hereby confirms that it shall have no

                    so appointed, as the Arbitrator, is an employee or

                       Advocate of the Lessee or is otherwise connected
                       to the Lessee and the Lessor confirms that
                       notwithstanding such relationship/ connection,
                       the Lessor shall have no doubts as to the
                       independence or impartiality of the said

                       High Court at Chandigarh alone shall have
                       jurisdiction.





                       49. That the Civil Courts at Gurgaon and High

                       jurisdiction."





            31. It is quite evident that there is a contraindication in
            the registered Agreement that while the venue of
            arbitration may be New Delhi, but the seat of arbitration
            shall be Gurgaon and High Court at Chandigarh. In the
            circumstances, it has to be held that this Court has no
            jurisdiction and it is the Courts at Gurgaon/High Court of
            Chandigarh which have the exclusive jurisdiction for
            entertaining the disputes arising out of the registered
            Lease Agreement."





37.            The view taken by the High Court of Delhi in 
IGSEC

  Heavy Engineering Ltd. versus Indian Oil Corporation

  Ltd.
 (supra) in paragraph Nos. 8, 12, 13, 14, 15 is also

  relevant to be noted as hereinunder : -






                    "8. There can be no doubt on the proposition that
                    the word 'seat' and 'venue' have different
                    connotations. They are not synonymous, in so far as
                    the arbitration proceedings are concerned, although,
                    they have often been used interchangeably. The law
                    on 'seat' and 'venue' of arbitration proceedings is
                    fairly well-defined in view of several judgments of
                    the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has clearly
                    held that where the parties have determined the
                    'seat' in their agreement, the same is akin to
                    conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the court(s)

C/ARBI.P/159/2022                                        CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/10/2023

                                                                                             undefined




                    thereof.5 The expression 'venue' and 'seat' do not
                    find any mention under the Act. The expression used
                    under the Act is 'place', which finds mention under
                    
Section 20
 of the Act. In BALCO v. Kaiser Aluminium
                    Technical Services Inc., 6 the Apex Court made it
                    clear that sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 20,
                    where the word 'place' is used, refer to juridical
                    'seat'; whereas, in sub-section (3) of Section 20, the
                    word 'place' is equivalent to 'venue', i.e., the location
                    of the meeting of arbitral proceedings.



                    12. To answer the afore-mentioned question - What
                    constitutes the 'seat' of arbitral proceedings - the
                    intention of the parties is germane and that can be
                    gathered from the terms of the Contract. Let's have
                    a closer look at the clause. The clause provides a
                    general stipulation that the 'venue' so designated
                    can be changed by the Arbitrators, with the consent
                    of the parties. This, prima facie, suggests that the
                    'venue' specified is not really envisaged as the 'seat'
                    of the proceedings, which should be specified in
                    certain terms. This interpretation is also in sync with
                    
Section 20(3)
 of the Act, which provides that
                    notwithstanding anything contained in Section 20(1)
                    and (2) - the Arbitral Tribunal can meet at any place
                    it considers appropriate for hearing witnesses,
                    experts, etc. In fact, the language used in the
                    present clause seems to be a replication of the
                    language used in Section 20(3). For this reason, as
                    well, the Court is inclined to agree that in the
                    present case, Clause 9.1.2.0 of the GCC specifies
                    New Delhi only as a geographically convenient place
                    where Arbitral Tribunal can hold meetings.



                    13. The above position gets reinforced upon a plain
                    reading of 
Article 4
 of the Contract. This clause vests
                    exclusive jurisdiction at the civil court(s) at
                    Guwahati for - all actions/proceedings, including
                    arbitration, and reads as under: -

                      forming the subject-matter of the reference if the
                      same had been the subject-matter of a suit, any
                      and all actions and proceedings arising out of or
                      relative to the contract (including any arbitration
                      in terms thereof) shall lie only in the Court of
                      Competent Civil Jurisdiction in this behalf at
                      GUWAHATI (where this contract has been signed
                      on behalf of the Owner) and the said Court(s) shall
                      have jurisdiction to entertain and try such actions
                      and/or proceeding(s) to the exclusion of all other
                      Courts."                      [Emphasis supplied]



                    14. As opposed to the general stipulation in Clause
                    9.1.2.0, 
Article 4
 is worded in clear, unambiguous,
                    and directory terms. In fact, it serves as the
                    'contrary indica', which further demonstrates that
                    the 'venue' in Clause 9.1.2.0 is only a physical place
                    of meeting under 
Section 20(3)
 of the Act. 
Article 4


                    -leaves no room that all actions and proceedings
                    arising out of the Contract, including arbitration,
                    shall have to necessarily be tried by the civil court(s)
                    at Guwahati exclusively, and does not lead to
                    jurisdiction being vested in the court(s) at Delhi.



                    15. For the reasons laid out above, this Court is of
                    the view that Clause 9.1.2.0 only provides a 'venue'
                    of arbitration, and the juridical 'seat' shall vest with
                    the civil court(s) at Guwahati."

                                                                                         undefined




                    a seat/place of arbitration has to be ascertained
                    from the language of the arbitration agreement."



39.            In light of the above discussion, this Court may

  record that law on "seat" and "venue" of arbitration

  proceedings is fairly well settled.                The cases, where the

  parties have determined "seat" in their agreements, the

  same is akin to conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the

  Court(s) thereof.            The expression 'place' occurring in Sub-

  section (1) and (2) of the Section 20, where the word 'place'

  is used, refers to "juridical seat"; whereas, expression

  "place" occurring in sub-section (3) of Section 20, is

  equivalent to 'venue', i.e., the location of the meeting of

  arbitral proceedings, as per the convenience of the parties or

  the arbitrators. The "place" mentioned in 
Section 20(3)
 of

  the Act, 1996 is only a physical place of meeting and has no

  relevance insofar as "juridical seat", which shall vests

  exclusive jurisdiction with the Court of competent civil

  jurisdiction or High Court of original jurisdiction;

Chatterjee
 (Supra), Section 11(6) and 
Section 2(1)(e)
 of

   the Act, 1996, have to be harmoniously read and construed

   to mean, the High Court which exercises superintendence /

   supervisory jurisdiction over a Court within the meaning of

   
Section 2(1)(e)
 of the Act, 1996. Meaning thereby, where a

   clause in the contract vests exclusive jurisdiction at a Civil

   Court for all actions / proceedings arising out of the

   contract, the Court of the 'place' located as having exclusive

   jurisdiction over the disputes should be considered as "seat"

   and having jurisdiction to entertain applications under the

   the Courts of competent jurisdiction at place 'A' and have
