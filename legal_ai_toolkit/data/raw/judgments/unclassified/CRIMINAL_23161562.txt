   For Petitioner          :         Mr. R.K. Sahoo, Advocate

         1.        This is bail application U/
S.483
 of BNSS by

         the petitioner for grant of bail in connection with

         Birmitrapur P.S. Case No.177 of 2024 corresponding

         to S.T. Case No.151/11 of 2024 pending in the file of

         learned Ad-hoc ADJ (FTSC) POCSO, Rourkela, for

         commission of offences punishable U/Ss. 376(D)/

         committing Gang Rape upon the victim.

 BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025


         2.        In the course of hearing, Mr. Ramesh Kumar

        Sahoo, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

        since chemical examination report has not yet been

        filed by the prosecution, the charge sheet which has

        been filed in this case is incomplete one, but the

        petitioner having detained in custody beyond the

        statutory period as prescribed for default bail, he may

        kindly be granted default bail. In support of his

        contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner

        relies upon the decision in Ritu Chhabaria Vrs.

        Union of India; Writ Petition (Criminal) No.60 of

        2023. On the sole plea of default bail, Mr. Ramesh

        Kumar Sahoo, prays to grant bail to the petitioner.

        2.1.      On the other hand, Mr. P. Satpathy, however,

        opposes such plea of the petitioner by stating that

        merely because chemical examination report has not

        yet been filed, it cannot be construed that the charge

        sheet is incomplete and the petitioner is entitled to

        default bail. Mr. Satpathy, accordingly, prays to reject

        the bail application of the petitioner.





BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                              Page 2 of 12


         3.        After having considered the rival submissions

        upon perusal of record, there appears allegation

        against the petitioner for committing gang rape upon

        the victim, but the plea of the petitioner is for default

        bail on the ground of non-submission of chemical

        examination report. Undoubtedly, learned counsel for

        the petitioner has relied upon the decision in Ritu

        Chhabaria        (supra),    but   in   Directorate        of

        Enforcement        Vrs.     Manpreet    Singh      Talwar;

        Special leave to criminal No.5724 of 2023(with IA

        No.90183 of 2023), a three judge bench of the Apex

        Court has been pleased to held as under:-


              "1. we clarify that the order shall not
              preclude any trial Court or, as the case may
              be, High Court for considering an application
              for grant of default bail U/
S.167
 of the Code
              of Criminal Procedure 1973 independent of
              and without relying on the judgment dated
              26th April 2023 in Writ Petition (Criminal)
              No.60 of 2023."



        4.       In regard to plea for default bail to the

        petitioner, who is mainly accused of committing Gang

        Rape upon the victim for want of CE report, this Court

        considers it useful to refer to the following decisions

        of the Apex Court:-



BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                  Page 3 of 12


         4.1.     
In 
K. Veeraswami vs. Union of India
;




        (1991) 3 SCC 655,         while explaining the scope of

        
Section 173(2)
 of the CrPC, a Constitutional Bench of

        Apex Court in paragraph 76 has held as under:-


               "76. The charge-sheet is nothing but a final
               report of police officer under 
Section 173(2)
 of
               the Code. The 
Section 173(2)
 provides that on
               completion of the investigation the police
               officer investigating into a cognizable offence
               shall submit a report. The report must be in the
               form prescribed by the State Government and
               stating therein (a) the names of the parties;

               (b) the nature of the information; (c) the
               names of the persons who appear to be
               acquainted with the circumstances of the
               case; (d) whether any offence appears to
               have been committed and, if so, by whom

 
(e) whether the accused has been
               arrested; (f) whether he had been
               released on his bond and, if so, whether
               with or without sureties; and (g) whether
               he has been forwarded in custody under
               
Section 170
. As observed by this Court in
               
Satya      Narain     Musadi     v.   State    of
               Bihar
;1980 3 SCC 152 that the statutory
               requirement of the report under 
Section
               173(2)
 would be complied with if the
               various details prescribed therein are
               included in the report. This report is an
               intimation to the magistrate that upon
               investigation into a cognizable offence the
               Investigating Officer has been able to procure
               sufficient evidence for the court to inquire into
               the offence and the necessary information is
               being sent to the court. In fact, the report
               under 
Section 173(2)
 purports to be an opinion
               of the Investigating Officer that as far as he is
               concerned he has been able to procure
               sufficient material for the trial of the accused


BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                 Page 4 of 12

                by the court. The report is complete if it is
               accompanied with all the documents and
               statements of witnesses as required by 
Section
               175(5)
. Nothing more need be stated in the
               report of the Investigating Officer. It is also not
               necessary that all the details of the offence
               must be stated. The details of the offence are
               required to be proved to bring home the guilt
               to the accused at a later stage i.e. in the
               course of the trial of the case by adducing
               acceptable evidence."




        4.2.     
In the context of this matter, this Court

        considers it profitable to refer to the decision in

        
Central      Bureau      of   Investigation      v.     Kapil

        Wadhawan and another
; (2024) 3 SCC 734

        wherein in a similar situation, the Apex Court has

        held as under:-




               "23. The benefit of proviso appended to sub-
               section (2) of 
Section 167
 of the Code would be
               available to the offender only when a charge-
               sheet is not filed and the investigation is kept
               pending against him. Once however, a charge-
               sheet is filed, the said right ceases. It may be
               noted that the right of the investigating officer
               to pray for further investigation in terms of
               sub-section (8) of 
Section 173
 is not taken
               away only because a charge-sheet is filed
               under sub-section (2) thereof against the
               accused. Though ordinarily all documents relied
               upon by the prosecution should accompany the
               charge-sheet, nonetheless for some reasons, if
               all the documents are not filed along with the
               charge- sheet, that reason by itself would not
               invalidate or vitiate the charge-sheet. It is also
               well settled that the court takes cognizance of
               the offence and not the offender. Once from


BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                   Page 5 of 12

                the material produced along with the
               charge-sheet, the court is satisfied about
               the commission of an offence and takes
               cognizance of the offence allegedly
               committed by the accused, it is immaterial
               whether the further investigation in terms
               of 
Section 173(8)
 is pending or not. The
               pendency of the further investigation qua the
               other accused or for production of some
               documents not available at the time of filing of
               charge-sheet would neither vitiate the charge-
               sheet, nor would it entitle the accused to claim
               right to get default bail on the ground that the
               charge-sheet was an incomplete charge- sheet
               or that the charge-sheet was not filed in terms
               of 
Section 173(2)
 Code."



        4.3.     
In 
Dinesh Dalmia vs. CBI
.; (2007) 8 SCC

        770, while discussing the scope of 
Section 167(2)


        vis-à-vis 
Section 173(8)
 of the CrPC, the Apex Court

        has held the followings in paragraphs-19, 20 and 22:-


               "19. A charge-sheet is a final report within the
               meaning of sub-section (2) of 
Section 173
 of
               the Code. It is filed so as to enable the court
               concerned to apply its mind as to whether
               cognizance of the offence thereupon should be
               taken or not. The report is ordinarily filed in the
               form prescribed therefor. One of the
               requirements for submission of a police
               report is whether any offence appears to
               have been committed and, if so, by whom.
               In some cases, the accused having not been
               arrested, the investigation against him may not
               be complete. There may not be sufficient
               material for arriving at a decision that the
               absconding accused is also a person by whom
               the offence appears to have been committed. If
               the investigating officer finds sufficient
               evidence even against such an accused who



BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                   Page 6 of 12

               had been absconding, in our opinion, law does
              not require that filing of the charge-sheet must
              await the arrest of the accused.

              20.    Indisputably,   the   power   of   the
              investigating officer to make a prayer for
              making further investigation in terms of sub-
              section (8) of 
Section 173
 is not taken away
              only because a charge-sheet under sub-section
              (2) thereof has been filed. A further
              investigation is permissible even if order of
              cognizance of offence has been taken by the
              Magistrate.

              22. It is true that ordinarily all documents
              accompany the charge- sheet. But, in this case,
              some documents could not be filed which were
              not in the possession of CBI and the same were
              with GEQD. As indicated hereinbefore, the said
              documents are said to have been filed on 20-1-
              2006 whereas the appellant was arrested on
              12-2-2006. The appellant does not contend
              that he has been prejudiced by not filing of
              such documents with the charge-sheet. No
              such plea in fact had been taken. Even if all the
              documents had not been filed, by reason
              thereof submission of charge- sheet itself does
              not become vitiated in law. The charge-sheet
              has been acted upon as an order of
              cognizance had been passed on the basis
              thereof. The appellant has not questioned
              the said order taking cognizance of the
              offence. Validity of the said charge-sheet
              is also not in question."



 
5.        In the aforesaid situation and on a careful

        consideration of the provision governing the default

        bail and investigation, it appears to the Court that

        there is a difference between filing a charge sheet

        and forwarding of the documents together with the



BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                Page 7 of 12

         charge sheet, since the charge sheet is filed upon

        completion of investigation after the Investigating

        Officer finding sufficient evidence to prosecute the

        accused for offences and the documents collected by

        the Investigating Officer is only corroborative in

        nature      to    the   accusations.    Further,   
Section

        173(2)(i)(d)
 of the CrPC/193(3)(i)(d) of the BNSS

        discloses that while submitting a Police report, it is

        the duty of the Investigating Officer to state whether

        any offence appears to have been committed and if

        so, by whom and the forwarding of documents

        referred to in 
Section 173(5)
 of the CrPC[193(6) of

        the BNSS] along with police report U/
S. 173(2)
 of the

        CrPC[193(3) of the BNSS] is only directory in nature,

        but not mandatory as held by the Apex Court in

        
Narendra Kumar Amin v. Central Bureau of

        Investigation and others
; (2015) 3 SCC 417.

        Moreover,        when   the   further   investigation     as

        contemplated U/
S. 173(8)
 of the CrPC/193(9) of the

        BNSS is permissible, the Investigating Officer, if

        situation so calls for can conduct further investigation



BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                 Page 8 of 12

         and thereby, no statutory Bar having been imposed

        for collection of further evidence in the form of

        additional documents which are gathered prior to or

        subsequent to the investigation can be produced

        before the Court. In this situation, there being no

        statutory Bar for production of additional documents

        before the Court, mere non-filing of full set of

        documents with police report/charge sheet within

        statutory period does not entitle the accused to

        default bail, unless the police report is not a complete

        report in terms of 
Sec. 173(2)
 of the CrPC/193(3) of

        the BNSS.




        6.        In the present case, the undisputed facts

        disclose that soon after receipt of the report styled as

        charge sheet on 20.07.2024, cognizance of the

        offences U/ss. 376(D)/376(2)(1)/114 of the 
IPC
 was

        taken on the same day, but the petitioner by then

        having not completed the statutory period of 120

        days for default bail, the right to default bail had not

        accrued to the petitioner on the date of taking

        cognizance of offences on presentation of report U/S.



BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                              Page 9 of 12

         173(2) of the 
CrPC
/193(3) of BNSS and thereafter,

        his right to default bail would not revive. 
In this

        regard, this Court considers it appropriate to refer to

        the decision in 
Mohamed Iqbal Madar Sheikh and

        others v. State of Maharashtra
; (1996) 1 SCC

        722, wherein the appellants were taken into custody

        on 16.01.1993 and charge sheet was submitted on

        30.08.1993;      which   was   obviously   beyond      the

        statutory period U/
S. 20(4)(b)
 of the Terrorists and

        Disruptive Activities (Prevention Act) (in short "the

        
TADA Act
") and, though the appellants therein were

        entitled to be released on default bail in view of the

        charge sheet not being filed within the statutory

        period prescribed U/
S. 20(4)(b)
 of the TADA Act r/w.

        proviso (a) to Section 167(2) of the Code, but they

        did not make an application for release on bail on the

        ground of default in completion of investigation within

        the statutory period. In such situation, the Apex

        Court in paragraph-11 therein has held as under:-


              "11. xx xx xx It is now settled that this right
              [U/S. 167(2) of the Code(
CrPC
)] cannot be
              exercised after the charge sheet has been
              submitted and cognizance has been taken,


BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                               Page 10 of 12

               because in that event the remand of the
              accused concerned including one who is alleged
              to have committed an offence under TADA, is
              not U/S. 167(2), but under other provisions of
              the Code (
CrPC
)."



 
7.       Thus, on a careful conspectus of facts of the

        present case and the law 
laid down by
 Apex Court in

        
Madar Sheikh
 (supra), it can be well considered

        that the right to statutory bail becomes unenforceable

        after cognizance having been taken on the Police

        report U/
S. 173(2)
 of the CrPC/193(3) of BNSS. In

        view of the precedents 
laid down by
 the Apex Court

        in the decisions 
referred to above
 together with

        consideration of facts involved in this case, it is

        crystal clear that the non-submission of CE report in a

        case of this nature where allegation against the

        petitioner is for committing Gang Rape would not

        automatically      render   the   charge    sheet     to    be

        incomplete charge sheet and make the petitioner

        entitled to default bail inasmuch as the CE report is a

        corroborative piece of evidence and the report U/
S.

        173(2)
     of    the   CrPC/193(3)   of   BNSS    does     not

        contemplate production of CE report to make the




BLAPL No. 8470 of 2025                                   Page 11 of 12

                                     report as a complete report. Consequently, the plea

                                    advanced for the petitioner to treat the charge sheet

                                    as incomplete charge sheet for want of CE report so

                                    as to enable him to default/compulsive bail is

                                    unmerited and liable to be rejected.




                                              In the result, the bail application of the

                                    petitioner stands rejected. Accordingly, the BLAPL

                                    stands disposed of.





                                                                             (G. Satapathy)
                                                                                  Judge
