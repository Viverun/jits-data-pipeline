                           Geeta Colony.

                          Factual Background

                          2.       Brief facts, as set out by the prosecution, is as follows:

                          2.1.    On 19th March, 2024, a PCR call, recorded vide DD No. 08A,
                          reported the suspected suicide of a woman named Shivani Singh. The
                          assigned ASI immediately reached Makkar Multi-Specialty Hospital,
                          located in Priyadarshini Vihar, Delhi, where he obtained MLC No. 580/23-

                          24, which recorded that Shivani Singh, aged 32, had been brought dead to
                          the emergency department.

                          2.2.    Upon inspection of the matrimonial home, where the incident
                          allegedly occurred, it was found that the deceased had died by hanging
                          herself during the late hours of 18th March, 2024. A ligature and a vegetable-
                          cutting knife were recovered from the scene and seized.
                          2.3.    Investigation revealed that the deceased married the Applicant on 8 th
                          November, 2019. Since the death occurred within seven years of the
                          marriage, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Gandhi Nagar, was informed
                          telephonically in compliance with 
Section 174
 of the CrPC. Statements of
                          the deceased's father, mother, and sister were recorded. They alleged that
                          the deceased had, during telephonic conversations, disclosed that the
                          Applicant was having an extra-marital affair with his office colleague named
                          Sarita. When confronted, the Applicant allegedly began physically abusing
                          the deceased. It was further claimed that, in the year preceding her death,
                          she had been regularly subjected to domestic violence. They also alleged
                          that the Applicant, having purchased a car, repeatedly pressured the
                          deceased to secure EMI payments from her family, and that he had
                          threatened to kill her if the money was not arranged.

                           2.4      The Complainant (father of the deceased) stated that on 18th March,
                          2024, at about 10:25 PM, he received a WhatsApp call from his daughter,
                          during which she said that her husband was pressuring her to arrange the car
                          loan instalment payments. The call was traced on his mobile phone, which
                          was subsequently seized and forwarded to the FSL for data retrieval and
                          expert examination.

                          2.5.     During the investigation, the Complainant submitted photographs,
                          chat transcripts, and two video recordings, allegedly showing the
                          Applicant's relationship with Sarita. One of the videos also purportedly
                          captures the Applicant verbally abusing and physically assaulting the
                          deceased. These materials were sent to the FSL for forensic authentication.
                          2.6.     The accused persons also submitted two video recordings in their
                          defence. On examination, these were found to relate to the retirement
                          celebration of the Applicant's father. In one of the recordings, the deceased
                          is seen stating that she entered the family as a daughter-in-law and was
                          treated by her father-in-law as his own daughter. However, no reference to
                          the Applicant is made in the video.

                          2.7.     Following completion of investigation, a chargesheet was filed and by
                          order dated 13th February, 2025 charges against the Applicant under
                          
Sections 498A
 and 
304B
 of the IPC, and, in the alternative, under 
Section
                          306
 IPC, have been framed. The Applicant has pleaded not guilty and has
                          sought to stand trial.

                          Applicant's Case

                          3.       Mr. Ramesh Gupta, Senior Counsel for the Applicant, contends that
                          the Applicant has been falsely implicated and seeks bail on the following
                          grounds:

                           3.1.     The case of prosecution, rests largely on uncorroborated allegations
                          made by the deceased's family. The FIR, in broad terms, implicates all
                          family members and attributes the Applicant's role without any direct or
                          substantive evidence. The core allegation, that the Applicant compelled the
                          deceased to seek financial assistance from her parents to pay instalments for
                          a car is wholly unsupported by the material on record.
                          3.2      The marriage between the Applicant and the deceased was a love
                          marriage, solemnised after a period of mutual acquaintance during college,
                          and with the consent of both families. At no point, it is urged, was there any
                          demand for dowry, either directly or indirectly, by the Applicant or his
                          relatives. Consequently, the essential ingredients for invoking 
Section 304B

                          IPC are plainly absent.

                          3.3.     As per the chargesheet, in his statement recorded during investigation,
                          the Complainant himself admitted that no dowry was ever demanded by the
                          Applicant's family members.

                          3.4.     As regards the car instalments, it is submitted that the EMI payments
                          were made by the Applicant himself, a fact verified and recorded by the
                          Investigating Officer. This conclusively discredits the allegation that the
                          deceased was pressurised to arrange funds from her parental home.
                          3.5.     The prosecution has relied upon a video, allegedly depicting an
                          incident of abuse. However, according to the Applicant, the video is over a
                          year old and lacks contextual relevance. It is submitted that, in the said clip,
                          the deceased is seen provoking and verbally abusing the Applicant, and the
                          incident cannot be treated as indicative of events "soon before death," as
                          required under 
Section 304B
 IPC.

                          3.6.     The Applicant had gifted a motorcycle worth INR 2,00,000/- to his

                           father-in-law and the vehicle remains in the possession of the Complainant.

                          A copy of the Registration Certificate has been annexed with the bail
                          application.

                          3.7.   The FIR records that the deceased had called her father around 8:30
                          PM on the night of the incident. However, the call detail records, examined
                          and verified during investigation, show that the only WhatsApp calls made
                          by the deceased to her father occurred at approximately 10:25 PM. This
                          discrepancy, it is urged, raises doubts about the accuracy of the prosecution
                          narrative and is recorded in the chargesheet.

                          3.8.   On 03rd March, 2024, at retirement party of her father-in-law, the
                          deceased gave a speech where she stated that she was happy to be a part of
                          the family and grateful for his father-in-law, who had given his full support
                          and treated as her own daughter. As per the sister of the deceased, she met
                          the deceased on 17th March, 2023 i.e., one day prior to her death, and she
                          was in very happy state of mind. Thus, she shared a civil and cordial
                          relationship with her in-laws and there is no indication that there was a
                          demand for dowry soon before her death or that she had been driven to
                          commit suicide by the Applicant or his family.

                          3.9.   On 12th March, 2024, the deceased had posted a story on WhatsApp
                          where she mentioned "I am proudly to announce that both Parthu and I
                          have decided to part ways with Anshul soon we will be legally separated".
                          This message indicates that parties' decision to part ways was an amicable
                          one, and not driven by harassment or cruelty.

                          3.10. As per the mortem report, the cause of death is asphyxia as a result of
                          ante mortem hanging and there were no external and internal injuries on the
                          rest of the body. This negates any allegation of physical cruelty in the

                           immediate lead-up to the incident.

                          3.11. While the prosecution claims that the deceased had earlier disclosed
                          acts of physical abuse to her mother, no contemporaneous complaint was
                          ever lodged, either by the deceased or her family, during the course of the
                          marriage.

                          3.12. Even if the Applicant is assumed to have maintained a relationship
                          with one Sarita, such a relationship, by itself, would not constitute cruelty
                          under 
Section 498A
 IPC. In the absence of any cogent evidence showing
                          that this alleged affair was pursued with the intent to torment the deceased or
                          drive her to suicide, the essential ingredient of mens rea is absent. As such,
                          invocation of 
Section 498A
 IPC, it is contended, is legally untenable.
                          Respondents' Case

                          4.      On the other hand, Mr. Hemant Mehla, APP for the State, and Mr.
                          Sarvesh Kumar, counsel for the Complainant, oppose the request and
                          contend:

                          4.1.    The allegations levelled against the Applicant concern the grave
                          offence of dowry death under 
Section 304B
 of the IPC, a charge that
                          invokes a reverse presumption of culpability under 
Section 113B
 of the
                          Indian Evidence Act, 1872,4 where the death of a woman occurs under
                          suspicious circumstances within seven years of marriage.
                          4.2.    The material collected during investigation, including the statements
                          of the deceased's parents and sister, video footage allegedly showing the
                          Applicant physically assaulting the deceased, and digital communications
                          indicating an extramarital affair, collectively suggest a pattern of sustained
                          physical and emotional cruelty. The prosecution maintains that the deceased

                           was subjected to persistent harassment, both on account of dowry demands
                          and emotional neglect, which cumulatively led to her unnatural death.
                          4.3.      The testimonies of the deceased's family members, clearly point to
                          episodes of cruelty and coercion faced by the deceased in the period
                          immediately preceding her death, thereby fulfilling the legal threshold of
                          "soon before death" under 
Section 304B
 IPC. In such circumstances, the
                          statutory presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act is squarely
                          attracted, shifting the burden on the Applicant to rebut the inference of
                          culpability.

                          4.4.      In view of the seriousness of the charge, the nature of the evidence
                          gathered, and the statutory presumption that now operates against the
                          Applicant, no case for bail is made out at this stage, and the application
                          deserves to be rejected.

                          Analysis

                          5.        The Court has given careful consideration to the rival submissions and
                          examined the material available on record. The allegations pertain to the
                          unnatural death of a married woman within seven years of her marriage,
                          attracting the rigours of 
Section 304B
 of the IPC and the statutory
                          presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Indian Evidence Act. The combined
                          effect of these provisions places a significant evidentiary burden on the
                          accused in such cases, where the death is alleged to have occurred under
                          suspicious circumstances and is preceded by cruelty or harassment related to
                          a dowry demand.

                          6.        The Applicant has been charged under 
Sections 498A
/
304-B
 IPC, and
                          alternatively under 
Sections 306
 IPC. The ingredients of the offence under

Section 304B
 IPC, as elucidated by the Supreme Court in 
Rajinder Singh v.
                          State of Punjab
, and consistently reaffirmed in a catena of judgments,5 are
                          as follows:


                                      "9. The ingredients of the offence under 
Section 304-B
 IPC have
                                      been stated and restated in many judgments. There are four such
                                      ingredients and they are said to be:

                                             (a) death of a woman must have been caused by any
                                             burns or bodily injury or her death must have occurred
                                             otherwise than under normal circumstances;

                                             (b) such death must have occurred within seven years
                                             of her marriage;

                                             (c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected
                                             to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative
                                             of her husband; and

                                             (d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection
                                             with the demand for dowry."



                          7.        These elements form the statutory threshold for invoking the
                          presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act. However, this
                          presumption is not automatic. It is contingent upon the establishment of
                          foundational facts, particularly that the alleged cruelty was both linked to a
                          dowry demand and temporally proximate to the death. At the stage of bail,
                          the Court is not to undertake a detailed evaluation of evidence or return
                          conclusive findings. However, a prima facie assessment is warranted to
                          determine whether continued incarceration is justified.

                          8.        In the present case, it cannot be disputed that the deceased died under
                          unnatural circumstances within approximately five years of her marriage.
                          Thus, the first two limbs of 
Section 304B
 IPC are met. The question that
                          arises is whether the remaining ingredients, particularly dowry-related
                          harassment or cruelty "soon before her death" are supported by credible

                           material, so as to deny bail to the Applicant.

                          9.       The prosecution case hinges largely on post-incident statements made
                          by the deceased's parents and sister. The allegations of dowry harassment
                          are specifically tied to the claim that the Applicant pressurised the deceased
                          to arrange funds for the payment of car instalments. However, no complaint,
                          appears to have been made by the deceased or her family, during her
                          lifetime,      regarding     this   alleged   demand.   The   absence      of   any
                          contemporaneous grievance prima facie dilutes the immediacy and
                          plausibility of the dowry-related harassment claim.

                          10.      Further, as per the chargesheet, the car was purchased on 8 th
                          November, 2023, and the EMIs of the same have been paid by the
                          Applicant. This has been verified by the Investigating Officer and
                          acknowledged in the chargesheet. While the Complainant alleges that
                          certain bank transfers and cash payments were routed through the deceased
                          to support the EMI payments, the evidence cited in this regard is prima facie
                          inconclusive at this stage and will require substantiation during trial.

                          11.      As regards the video in which the Applicant is allegedly seen beating
                          the deceased, it must be emphasised that for 
section 304B
 IPC to be
                          invoked, such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand
                          for dowry. The video in question is said to be over a year old, and whether it
                          indicates that the alleged harassment was indeed connected to a dowry
                          demand is also a matter that must be examined at trial.

                          12.      The prosecution also relies on materials to suggest that the Applicant
                          was involved in an extramarital relationship with a woman named Sarita.
                          Certain videos and chat records have been cited in support. However, even
                          assuming such a relationship existed, the law is settled that an extramarital

                           affair, per se, does not amount to not, cruelty under 
Section 498A
 IPC or
                          abetment under 
Section 306
 IPC, unless it is shown that the relationship was
                          pursued in a manner calculated to harass or torment the deceased.

                          13.         
In 
Parul v. State (NCT of Delhi
),6 this Court observed that an extra-
                          marital relationship cannot be a ground to implicate the accused under
                          
Section 304B
 IPC. The Court held that harassment or cruelty should be
                          linked to dowry demands or sustained mental cruelty that occurred "soon
                          before the death." In the present case, the deceased is said to have disclosed
                          the alleged affair nearly a year prior to her death. There is no
                          contemporaneous material or specific conduct cited that would prima facie
                          establish a nexus between the alleged relationship and the dowry demand.


                          14.         Similarly, with respect to the alternative charge under 
Section 306

                          IPC, the law requires a clearly discernible act of instigation, provocation, or
                          intentional omission. Mere suspicion of an affair or even strained relations,
                          without more, does not meet this threshold. The Supreme Court has
                          consistently emphasized that, for a charge under 
Section 306
 IPC to be
                          sustained, the accused must have instigated, provoked, or engaged in
                          facilitating or encouraging the commission of suicide. 
In 
K.V. Prakash
                          Babu v. State of Karnataka,7
 Supreme Court observed as follows:


 
"15. The concept of mental cruelty depends upon the milieu and the
                                     strata from which the persons come from and definitely has an
                                     individualistic perception regard being had to one's endurance and
                                     sensitivity. It is difficult to generalize but certainly it can be appreciated
                                     in a set of established facts. Extra-marital relationship, per se, or as such
                                     would not come within the ambit of 
Section 498-A
 IPC. It would be an
                                     illegal or immoral act, but other ingredients are to be brought home so
                                     that it would constitute a criminal offence. There is no denial of the fact
                                     that the cruelty need not be physical but a mental torture or abnormal

                                 behaviour that amounts to cruelty or harassment in a given case. It will
                                depend upon the facts of the said case. To explicate, solely because the
                                husband is involved in an extra-marital relationship and there is some
                                suspicion in the mind of wife, that cannot be regarded as mental
                                cruelty which would attract mental cruelty for satisfying the ingredients
                                of 
Section 306
 IPC."



                          15.   Thus, the Supreme Court clarified that, an extra-marital relationship
                          per se may not come within the ambit of 
Section 498-A
 IPC. In order to
                          determine as to whether such a relationship amounts to cruelty to attract the
                          offence under 
Section 306
 IPC, the other essential ingredients of the said
                          offence will also need to be satisfied, which will depend upon the specific
                          facts and circumstances of each individual case.

                          16.   In the present case, prima facie, there is no indication of affirmative
                          acts, whether by commission or omission, that drove the deceased to a state
                          of desperation immediately preceding her death. Consequently, the statutory
                          threshold for invoking 
Section 306
 IPC prima facie remains unsatisfied. The
                          existence and fulfilment of such ingredients are issues to be adjudicated after
                          conclusion of the trial.

                          17.   The Applicant has remained in custody since 20 th March, 2024. The
                          investigation stands concluded, the chargesheet has been filed, and the case
                          is currently at the stage of prosecution evidence. Given the volume of
                          evidence and number of witnesses cited, the trial is not likely to conclude in
                          the near future. No risk of tampering with evidence or fleeing from justice
                          has been demonstrated. In these circumstances, continued incarceration of
                          the Applicant would serve no fruitful purpose.

                          18.   It is well-established that the object of granting bail is neither punitive
                          nor preventative. The primary aim sought to be achieved by bail is to secure
                          the attendance of the accused person at the trial. Accordingly, in light of the

                          a.       The Applicant will not leave the country without prior permission of

                          regarding any change in his residential address.

                          c.       The Applicant shall appear before the Court as and when the matter is
                          taken up for hearing.

                          d.       The Applicant shall provide all mobile numbers to the concerned IO,
                          which shall be kept in working condition at all times.
                          e.       The Applicant shall not switch off his phone or change his mobile
                          number without prior intimation to the concerned IO.
                          f.       The Applicant will report to the concerned IO on the first Friday of
                          every month, and will not be kept waiting for more than an hour.
                          g.       The Applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity and shall not
                          communicate with or come in contact with any of the prosecution witnesses,
                          or tamper with the evidence of the case.

                          19.      In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry / complaint lodged
                          against the Applicant, it would be open to the State to seek redressal by
                          filing an application seeking cancellation of bail.
