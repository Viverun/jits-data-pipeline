                            Sikarwar (applicant) entered her room and closed the door from inside. As she
                            tried to shout, Aman gagged her mouth and committed rape on her. Hearing the
                            sound, her mother and sister knocked the door. Meanwhile, her father also
                            came. His father pushed the door to open. Aman Sikarwar started scuffling with
                            her parents and threatened to kill her brother. Meanwhile, police also arrived on
                            spot. Aman was handed over to the police. On such allegation, PS- Jaura
                            registered FIR at Crime No.201/2024 for offence punishable under 
Sections
                            376
, 
450
 and 
506
 of IPC. Applicant was arrested on 04.05.2024, he is in
                            custody ever since. Statements of prosecutrix were recorded under 
Sections
                            161
 and 
164
 of CrPC. Investigation is underway.



                                  Learned Counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is falsely
                            implicated in this matter. Prosecutrix is aged 18 years, whereas applicant is aged
                            19 years. It is a case of romantic relationship between two young persons. False
                            allegations of rape are made against the applicant under the pressure of the
                            family members of prosecutrix. Learned Counsel submits that the applicant is
                            manager of a Cafe. There is no likelihood of his absconsion leaving his family,
                            home and profession. No criminal antecedent is reported against the applicant.
                            There is no likelihood of tampering with the evidence as both the parties relate
                            to same socio-economic status. Jail incarceration is causing hardship to the
                            young applicant. Trial would take time to conclude. Therefore, applicant may
                            be extended the benefit of bail.

                                  Per contra, learned Counsel for the State opposes the bail application on
                            the ground of gravity of alleged offence.

                                  Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.
                                  Considering the arguments advanced by both the parties and overall
