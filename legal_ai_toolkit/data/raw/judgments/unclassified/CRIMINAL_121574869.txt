                              judicial custody. Learned advocate submitted that
                              the applicant is not named in the FIR and only on
                              the basis of the statement of the co-accused, the
                              applicant            is      arraigned              as     accused.           Learned
                              advocate           submitted           that      the     applicant          was       not
                              found in conscious possession of the prohibited
                              contraband articles and there is no recovery or
                              discovery at the instance of the present applicant

                              - accused.

                      4.      Learned advocate, at this stage, submitted that
                              this is a successive bail application preferred by
                              the     application           after          the    rejection          of     earlier
                              bail application being Criminal Misc. Application
                              No.18701/2023 vide order dated 04.12.2023, however
                              while rejecting said application, the aspect of
                              non-compliance              of         the       mandatory        provision             of
                              
Section 52A
 of the NDPS                          has not been considered
                              and wrongly rejected the said application because
                              the communication in that regard, which had been
                              undertaken by the IO for complying with the said
                              provision,            is      not       part        and        parcel        of       the
                              chargesheet           papers.          It     is,       therefore,        submitted
                              that only on that count, the bail application of
                              the applicant may be considered and the applicant
                              may      be       granted      bail.         Learned       advocate           further
                              submitted          that      the       applicant          is    in     jail       since




                                                                 Page 2 of 7

                              11.01.2023 and thus, more than 12 months are over
                              and,      therefore,           the      applicant        may     not      be      kept
                              behind the bar for indefinite period. He further
                              submitted that even in recent past, the Hon'ble
                              Supreme Court has also issued guidelines in case
                              of delay in trial and the fact that "bail is a
                              rule"        and        "jail          is    an     exception".            It       is,
                              therefore, urged that the present application may
                              be allowed.

                      5.      On the other hand, learned APP, Mr. Joshi for the
                              respondent-State has opposed grant of regular bail
                              looking to the nature and gravity of the offence.
                              He submitted that in fact, at the time of hearing
                              of     earlier          bail       application,          all      the       aspects
                              raised by learned advocate for the applicant have
                              been considered and as stated above, this is a
                              successive            bail      application             preferred          by       the
                              applicant but there is no changed circumstances
                              for filing such application. He further submitted
                              that in fact, the aspect of non-compliance of the
                              provision          of    
Section            52A
   of   the    NDPS       has      been
                              considered by the Coordinate Bench of this Court
                              while        passing          an       order      dated       21.08.2024              in
                              Criminal Misc. Application No.19761/2023 in case
                              of co-accused and the Coordinate Bench of this
                              Court          has       rejected             the       said        application
                              considering             the    said         fact,      therefore,         reliance
                              placed by learned advocate for the applicant on
                              that aspect cannot be considered at this stage.

                      6.      Learned APP submitted that the present application

                              is      a     successive             bail        application         after          the
                              rejection          of    earlier         bail      application,           however,
                              the      present          application             is    preferred           without
                              disclosing any changed circumstance except abvoe
                              and, hence, this application can be said to be
                              'review            application'             and        power        of         review
                              application             is    very      limited        and   when        there        is
                              technical            and/or            arithmetical          error,            review
                              application             can      be      preferred,          which         can        be
                              entertained but in the present case, the applicant
                              has failed to show any changed circumstance and
                              the reasons, which are mentioned in the memo of
                              application, were at all available at the earlier
                              point of time when earlier bail application was
                              rejected.

                      7.      I have heard the learned advocates appearing on
                              behalf of the respective parties and perused the
                              papers        of    the      investigation             and   considered             the
                              allegations levelled against the applicant and the
                              role        played        by     the        applicant.         I      have        also
                              considered the reasoning given by the concerned
                              court while rejecting the bail application and the
                              affidavit          filed        by      the      IO    opposing          the      said
                              application.

                      8.      It is the settled position of the law that, at
                              this juncture detailed discussion of evidence and
                              canvassing of the allegations contained in FIR as
                              well as affidavit of the concerned Investigating

9.      It is a well settled principle of law that when
                              the successive application comes before the Court,
                              the        Court        would          be        very     conscious               while
                              considering            the      same.        It     is    also          a     settled
                              position of law that successive bail applications
                              are permissible under the change circumstances and
                              the change circumstances must be substantial one
                              which has direct impact on the earlier decision
                              and not merely a cosmetic changes which are of
                              little or no consequences. As held by the Apex
                              Court        in      
State        of        Maharashtra            Vs.        Captain
                              Buddhikota           Subha      Rao
,        reported      in       AIR       1989       SC
                              2292,       that      successive            bail    application               can       be
                              entertained by the Court when substantial change
                              is established by the accused, which would entitle
                              him        for       getting           bail        in     successive                bail
                              application. The Court should not pass the order
                              of     releasing          him      on       bail    in        successive            bail
                              application            merely          establishing             some        cosmetic
                              change between time gap of two applications. There
                              should be drastic change during the period between
                              two applications, which would entitle the accused
                              for       bail.
       The       Apex        Court        in      the        case        of
                              Kalyanchandra Sarkar Vs. Rajesh Ranjan, reported
                              in (2005) 2 SCC 42 while dealing with the issue of
                              successive           bail       application             has     observed            that
                              without           change         in         the     circumstances,                    the
                              subsequent bail application would be deemed to be
                              seeking a review of the earlier rejection order
                              which is not permissible under the criminal law.

                                                                                                                          undefined




                              The Apex Court has further observed that while

                              application, the Court has a duty to consider the
                              reasons           and    grounds        on        which      the     earlier         bail
                              application was rejected and what are the fresh
                              grounds            which        persuade               it     warranting               the
                              evaluation               and        consideration               of       the         bail
                              application afresh and to take a view different
                              from one taken in the earlier application.

                      10.     It is found out from the arguments canvassed by
                              learned           advocate       for        the        applicant         that        main
                              argument of learned advocate for the applicant is
                              with      regard         to    non-fulfillment                of     the     required
                              procedure as envisaged under 
Section 52A
 of the
                              NDPS Act and on the strength of the said argument,
                              bail is sought for. It is, however, required to be
                              noted that as can be found from the submissions
                              canvassed           by    learned           APP     that      in     case      of      co-
                              accused, who had filed Criminal Misc. Application

                              after considering the submissions and considering
                              the said aspect, has rejected the said application
                              by     detailed          order.        It    is     submitted          that      it      is
                              specifically observed in the said order that the
                              procedure under 
Section 52A
 of the NDPS has been
                              carried out by the Investigating Agency belatedly
                              but the said aspect is a matter or proof and would
                              required consideration at the time of trial. Thus
                              the said view adopted by the Coordinate Bench of

                              proper, which in my considered opinion, applies in
                              the facts of the present case. Over and above,
                              learned           advocate         has    failed           to     point        out       any
                              changed circumstances. Therefore in absence of any
                              changed            circumstances,                 once           again           present
                              application is preferred agitating same grounds,
                              which       in      the       opinion       of        this        Court,         is      not
                              available to the applicant in a successive bail
                              application.

                      11.     Over and above that, strong apprehension has been
                              shown       by     prosecution           that         if    the       applicant            is
                              released on bail then, there is possibility of
                              tampering with the evidence and fleeing away from
                              the     trial.         Therefore         considering               the      nature         of
                              offence,           role       attributed          to       the      applicant            and
                              played        by       him,    I    am    of      the       opinion          that        the
                              present application deserves to be rejected.

                      12.     In     view       of    the    facts       and        circumstances               of     the
                              present case, this Court is of the view that after
                              the rejection of earlier regular bail application,
                              there         is       no      change            in     the         circumstances.
                              Accordingly, the present application is rejected.

                      13.     Needless to say that any expression of opinion
                              given in this order does not mean an expression of
                              opinion on the merits of the case and the trial
                              Court will not be influenced by any observations
                              made therein.
