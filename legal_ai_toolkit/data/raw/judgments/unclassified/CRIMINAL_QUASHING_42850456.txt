      THIS CRIMINAL PETITION IS FILED UNDER SECTION 482 OF

PETITIONERS/ACCUSED NOS. 1 TO 6 AND 8 TO 9 IS CONCERNED
IN C.C.NO.2338/2015 (CRIME NO.11/2015) PENDING ON THE FILE
OF THE JMFC II COURT, HUBBALLI, FOR THE OFFENCE
PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTION 78 (3) OF KARNATAKA POLICE ACT
1963.

     THESE PETITIONS HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED
FOR ORDERS ON 23.03.2018 AND COMING ON FOR
PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE
FOLLOWING:
                                : 28 :


                           COMMON ORDER



     In this batch of petitions, the petitioners have sought

to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against them for

the alleged offences punishable under 
Sections 78(3)
 of the

Karnataka Police Act, 1963 ('the 
KP Act
', for short) on the

ground of non-compliance of the mandatory requirements

prescribed under 
Section 155(2)
 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure.





     2.      (i) The common contentions urged in all these

petitions are that, the offence alleged against the respective

petitioners is a non-cognizable offence and by virtue of the

safeguard provided under 
Section 155(2)
 of Cr.P.C., the

respondent    -   Police   could   not   have   embarked   upon

investigation into the alleged offence, without the order of a

Magistrate having power to try such case.



     (ii) In Support of this contention, the learned counsel

has referred to the decisions of this Court in the case of

Nabisab S/o Shek Imamsab V/s State of Karnataka

(Crl.P.3365/2016    and    connected     matters   disposed   on

07.04.2017) as well as the other decisions rendered by this

Court in the Case of Sharath @ Salim V/s The State of

Karnataka (Crl.P.No.101833/2015 and connected petitions

                               : 29 :



disposed on 18.12.2015), wherein this Court following the

decision passed by this Court in batch of petitions in

Crl.P.No.100319/2014 has held that non-compliance of the

mandatory requirements under 
Section 155(2)
 of Cr.P.C.

would render the proceedings illegal and invalid.


      (iii) The learned counsel has also produced a copy of

the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in

S.L.P.Nos.8567-8580/2016 arising out of the common order

passed by this Court in Crl.P.No.100319/2014. The said

S.L.P.Nos.8567-8580/2016     is   dismissed   by    the   Hon'ble

Supreme Court of India, thereby confirming the orders

passed by this Court in Crl.P.No.100319/2014.



      3.    In Crl.P.No.3365/2016 and connected matters,

this Court followed the decision rendered by the Coordinate

Bench of this Court in Moin Basha Kurnooli Vs. The State

of Karnataka by Cowl Bazaar Police Station, Bellary,

reported in 2014(4) KCCR 3355, wherein on analysing the

relevant provisions   of the Code of Criminal Procedure and

the Karnataka Police Act, 1963, it is held that the offence

under 
Section 78(3)
 of the KP Act is a non-cognizable

offence, the investigation whereof by a Police Officer is

prohibited without prior order of the concerned Magistrate.

                                  : 30 :



Further this Court has laid down that the provisions of


Section 155(2)
 of Cr.P.C. is mandatory in nature and failure

to comply with the said mandatory requirement is an

incurable defect amounting to illegality vitiating the entire

proceedings.





         4.   In Praveen Basavanneppa Shivalli Vs. State

of Karnataka and Others reported in 2017(1) AKR 461,

this Court has laid down that a mere endorsement made by

the Magistrate on the application submitted by the Police

Officer under 
Section 155
 of Cr.P.C. as "permitted" is not an

"order" in the eye of law and on that ground also, the

proceedings initiated against the accused are rendered illegal

and are liable to be quashed.





         5.   Undisputedly, in all these proceedings, the FIR

came to be registered against the petitioners on the basis of

the complaint lodged by the Inspector of the Police of the

respective police stations alleging that on receipt of credible

information that the accused herein were involved in playing

a game of chance by name Matka and were soliciting

customers for the said purpose, the PSI of the respective

police    stations   made   an   application   to   the   concerned

                                                 : 31 :



      Magistrate seeking permission to investigate into the matter

      and thereafter rushed to the spot along with his team and

      the panchas and found the accused engaged in the alleged

      activities, and accordingly, panchanamas were drawn at the

      spot and incriminating materials were seized from the spot of

      occurrence and FIRs were registered against the respective

      accused persons alleging commission of offence punishable

      under 
Section 78(3)
 of KP Act.





              6.      The details of the cases registered against the

      petitioners, respective crime Nos. and the date of the FIR

      and the endorsement made by the concerned Magistrate on

      the application submitted by the complainant are detailed in

                     P.S.





              7.      Undeniably, the offence alleged in each of the

      above cases is a non-cognizable offence. 
Section 155
 of the

      Cr.P.C. deals with the procedure of Investigation and

      cognizance of non-cognizable cases. It reads as under:


              "
Section 155
 Information as to non-cognizable
              cases and investigation of such cases.

              (1) When information is given to an officer in charge
              of a police station of the commission within the limits

                                 : 33 :



      of such station of a non- cognizable offence, he shall
      enter or cause to be entered the substance of the
      information in a book to be kept by such officer in
      such form as the State Government may prescribe in
      this behalf, and refer the informant to the Magistrate.
      (2) No police officer shall investigate a non- cognizable
      case without the order of a Magistrate having power to
      try such case or commit the case for trial.
      (3) Any police officer receiving such order may
      exercise   the   same   powers     in   respect   of   the
      investigation (except the power to arrest without
      warrant) as an officer in charge of a police station may
      exercise in a cognizable case.

      (4) Where a case relates to two or more offences of
      which at least one is cognizable, the case shall be
      deemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that
      the other offences are non- cognizable."



      8.    As per the above provision, when an Officer-in-

charge of the police station received the information as to the

commission of non-cognizable offence, (i) he shall enter or

caused to be entered the substance of the information in a

book to be maintained by the said Officer in a prescribed

form and (ii) refer the informant to the Magistrate. Further,

Sub-Section (2) of 
Section 155
 Cr.P.C. mandates that no

Police Officer shall investigate a non-cognizable offence

without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such

case or commit such case for trial.

                                  : 34 :


      9.    In the instant case, the respondent police have

utterly failed to comply with the requirements laid down in


Section 155(1)
 and 
155(2)
 of Cr.P.C.             Reading of the

complaints lodged in each case indicate that on receipt of

information, the complainant informed the matter to his

superior officer and thereafter made separate applications to

the   concerned     Magistrate   seeking    necessary   order   for

investigation into the allegations.       But before securing the

necessary "order", the complainants in the above cases,

rushed to the spot and commenced investigation even

without registration of the FIR as mandated under 
Section

154
 of Cr.P.C. There is nothing on record to show that the

respondent has referred the informant to the concerned

Magistrate as required under 
Section 155(1)
 of Cr.P.C. or

obtained necessary order as envisaged under 
Section 155(2)


of Cr.P.C. before embarking upon investigation. Thus, on the

face of it, the respondents are seen to have committed

blatant violation of the provisions of Sections 155(1) and

155(2) of Cr.P.C.





 
10.   The learned HCGP appearing for the State,

however, has tried to take shelter under the endorsement

obtained by the respondents - Police on the applications

                              : 35 :



wherein, the learned Magistrate is seen to have made an

endorsement as "permitted".           It is argued that this is

substantial compliance of the requirements laid down under


section 155
 of Cr.P.C.   It is the submission of the learned

HCGP that, in the decision referred to by the learned counsel

for the petitioner, in 
Moin Basha Karnooli Vs. State of

Karnataka
 (2014 (4) KCCR 3355, as well as in Sharath @

Salim Vs. The State of Karnataka (Crl.P.No.101833/2015 &

connected matters), the Investigating Officer failed to submit

the necessary application and did not obtain any order from

the concerned Magistrate and in that circumstance, this

Court found it appropriate to quash the proceedings on the

ground that the Police failed to comply with the mandatory

requirements prescribed under 
Section 155(2)
 of Cr.P.C. In

other words, the submission of the learned HCGP is that, in

the instant case, by making necessary application to the

concerned Magistrate, the respondents have substantially

complied with the requirements of 
Section 155
 of Cr.P.C. and

therefore, there is no irregularity much less any illegality

whatsoever in the action initiated by the respondents against

the petitioners.


                                 : 36 :


     11.   I am unable to accept the contention urged by

the learned HCGP.         This contention has already been

considered by this Court in the case of Praveen B. Shivalli

(supra). Even in the said case, endorsement was made by

the learned Magistrate on the application submitted by the

police as "permitted". Considering the purport of the above

provision and the purpose and object of prescribing such a

pre-requisite, this Court in para 15 of the aforesaid judgment

has observed as under:





     "15. In the present case, 2nd respondent having acted
     contrary to sub-section (1) of 
Section 155
 Cr.P.C. and
     the learned Magistrate having not passed 'an order',
     instead, having made an entry 'permitted', being not
     'an order' in the eye of law and in view of the
     prohibition contained in sub-section (2) of
 S.155

     Cr.P.C., the investigation; made and the consequential
     charge-sheet filed for the offences under Ss.504, 506
     and 323 of 
IPC
 and the taking of cognizance of those
     offences and the issue of non-bailable warrant in the
     first instance itself for proceeding further with the case
     against the accused are absolutely illegal.         It is
     obvious that the police and the Magistrate have not
     bothered to look into
 S.155
 Cr.P.C. before proceeding
     further in the matter.    Non application of mind and
     mechanical approach to the case are apparent."

                               : 37 :


      12.   In view of the above factual and legal defects

which amount to incurable illegalities and blatant violation of

the   mandatory    requirements        of   law,   all   the   above

proceedings are liable to be quashed.





      13.   Resultantly, all the petitions are allowed.          the

FIRs filed in all the above cases as detailed in the table

hereinabove at para 6 and consequent proceedings arising

therefrom are hereby quashed.





                                                Sd/-

                                               JUDGE
