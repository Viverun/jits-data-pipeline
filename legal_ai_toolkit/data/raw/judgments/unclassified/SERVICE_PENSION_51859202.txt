                      "Heard learned Assistant Government Pleader

                      respondent No.1 and learned advocate
                      Ms.Trusha Patel for the respondent No.2.



                      2. This Letters Patent Appeal under Clause 15
                      of the Letters Patent Act, is directed against
                      order dated 11.8.2021 of learned Single Judge
                      whereby the Special Civil Application filed by
                      the petitioner- respondent No.1 herein came to
                      be allowed. The respondents were directed to
                      grant benefit of one increment to the petitioner
                      and accordingly revise his pension.



                      2.1 The petitioner prayed in his petition to set
                      aside communication dated 6.1.2021. By the
                      said communication the petitioner was refused
                      to benefit of notional increment falling due on
                      1.7.2020 on the ground that the petitioner had
                      retired with effect from 30.6.2020. It was stated
                      in the said order that since the petitioner
                      ceased to remain in employment he could not
                      be considered as employee from 1st July, with
                      effect from having retired a day prior, he
                      acquires the status of pensioner and
                      consequentially would not be entitled to the
                      increment. The said communication dated
                      1.6.2021 was addressed to the Registrar
                      General of the respondent No.1 by the under
                      Secretary of the Legal Department of the State
                      Government.



                      3. The relevant facts to be noticed are that the

                   petitioner joined his services under respondent
                   No.2 as Chowpdar cum Driver on 19.2.1983.
                   He was appointed as Driver with effect from
                   1.4.1987. As the date of birth of the petitioner
                   was 10.6.1960, he retired on 30.6.2020, upon
                   attaining the age of superannuation. The
                   petitioner had rendered one full year of service
                   from 1.7.2019 to 30.6.2020 in the said last
                   year. It is his case that he was entitled to get
                   benefit of annual increment for the said period
                   of service. The increment for the said period of
                   service, it was stated, falls due on 1.7.2

                   3.1 The petitioner made representation dated
                   31.7.2020 to respondent No.1 State requesting
                   to     release   the   increment,     alongwith
                   representation also produced by the petitioner
                   were the instances where increment was
                   granted to the similarly situated employees
                   retiring on 30th June. It is the averment of the
                   petitioner that pursuant to the said
                   representation, respondent No.2 made proposal
                   to respondent No.1, however at the end of
                   correspondence the benefit was denied as per
                   the decision reflected in the impugned
                   communication dated 6.1.2021.



                   3.2 Learned Single Judge referred to Rule 39 of
                   the Gujarat Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 2002
                   which provides for services which may be
                   counted for increment. Rule 39(1) provides for
                   release of increment on the first date of every
                   month. The relevant part of Rule 39 is as under,
                         "39. Service which counts for increment:
                         The following provisions prescribe the
                         conditions subject to which service
                         counts for increments in a time-scale;-
                         (I) Subject to the provisions of
                         rules11,13,15,16,19,23,30 and 44 all
                         periods of duty discharged in a post on a
                         time-scale shall count for increments in

                         that time-scale. For the purpose of
                         arriving at the date of next increment in
                         that timescale, the total of all such
                         periods as to do not count for increment
                         in that time-scale shall be added to the
                         normal dates of increment. Provided that
                         the increment shall be admissible from
                         the 1st of the month in which it accrues."



                   3.3 Learned Single Judge held noticing the
                   facts of the case and the aforesaid Rule, held
                   that the Rule was misread and misinterpreted in
                   denying the increment to the petitioner, to
                   observe, (Para 8)

                         "The proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule 39
                         stipulatesthat the increment shall be
                         admissible from the 1st of the month, in
                         which, it accrues. The petitioner has
                         been denied the benefits of the increment
                         for the services which he rendered prior
                         to his retirement i.e. from 01.07.2019 to
                         30.06.2020 on the ground that the same
                         accrued on 01.07.2020. The respondents
                         have      indubitably     misread      and
                         misinterpreted the rule since it is not the
                         case of the petitioner that he is claiming
                         increment of one year after the date of
                         retirement. The petitioner has become
                         entitled for one increment during one
                         year of service in the time pay-scale
                         prior to his retirement and only because
                         the same has accrued on 1st of every
                         month, such benefits could not be denied
                         by applying the rule prospectively
                         resulting into wiping out the entire
                         service of one year, which he has
                         rendered in a particular time-scale. "



 
3.4. While holding as above, learned Single
                   Judge relied on the decision of the Madras

 C/SCA/13955/2022                             ORDER DATED: 18/08/2022




                   High Court in 
P.Ayyamperumal Vs. The
                   Registrar and Others
 being Writ Petition
                   No.15732 of 2017 decided on 15.9.2017. The
                   Madras High Court dealt with and interpreted
                   Rule 10 of the Central Civil Services (Revised
                   Pay) Rules, 2008 which is similar. In that case,
                   the petitioner had retired as Additional
                   Director General, Chennai on 30.6.2013 on
                   attaining the age of superannuation. After the
                   Sixth Pay Commission the Central Government
                   fixed 1st July to be the date of increment for all
                   employees by amending Rule 10 of the Rules.


                   This amendment resulted into denial of the
                   benefit of the last increment. Though petitioner
                   has completed full year of service on 1.7.2012
                   to 30.6.2013 and had retired on 30.6.2013, in
                   view of the provisions and rules, that increment
                   would be given only on 1.7.2013, the petitioner
                   was treated not eligible to earn the increment.



                   3.4.1 The Madras High Court considered it to
                   be a decisive circumstance that employee had
                   completed full year of service for which the
                   increment had become due, observing as under,
                   (para 7)

                         "The petitioner herein had completed
                         one full year service as on 30.06.2013,
                         but the increment fell            due on
                         01.07.2013, on which date he was not in
                         service. In view of the above judgment of
                         this Court, naturally he has to be treated
                         as having completed one full year of
                         service, though the date of increment
                         falls on the next day of his retirement.
                         Applying 
the said judgment
 to the present
                         case, the writ petition is allowed and the
                         impugned order passed by the first
                         respondent Tribunal dated 21.03.2017 is
                         quashed. The petitioner shall be given

                   relied on the decision of the Himachal Pradesh

                   the said decisions, the High Courts had taken a
                   contrary view holding that there would occur
                   no entitlement to get the increment.

The Delhi High Court
                   in 
Gopal Singh
 (supra) taking same view as
                   that of Madras High Court in 
P.Ayyamperumal

                   (supra) explained that the entitlement of
                   government servant to receive the increment,
                   though may not be a matter of course, but is
                   dependent upon good conduct of the central
                   government servant and that he earns
                   increment on the basis of his good conduct for
                   specified period. (Para 20)

                         "Payment of salary and increment to a
                         central government servant is regulated
                         by the provisions of F.R., CSR and
                         Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules.
                         Pay defined in F.R. 9(21) means the
                         amount drawn monthly by a central
                         government servant and includes the
                         increment. A plain composite reading of
                         applicable      provisions   leaves     no
                         ambiguity that annual increment is given
                         to a government servant to enable him to
                         discharge duties of the post and that pay
                         and allowances are also attached to the
                         post. 
Article 43
 of the CSR defines
                         progressive appointment to mean an
                         appointment wherein the pay is
                         progressive, subject to good behaviour of
                         an officer. It connotes that pay rises, by
                         periodical increments from a minimum to
                         a maximum. The increment in case of
                         progressive appointment is specified in
                         
Article 151
 of the CSR to mean that
                         increment accrues from the date
                         following that on which it is earned. The
                         scheme, taken cumulatively, clearly
                         suggests that appointment of a central
                         government servant is a progressive
                         appointment and periodical increment in
                         pay from a minimum to maximum is part
                         of the pay structure.

                         contemplates that increment accrues
                         from the day following which it is
                         earned. This increment is not a matter of
                         course but is dependent upon good
                         conduct of the central government
                         servant. It is, therefore, apparent that
                         central government employee earns
                         increment on the basis of his good
                         conduct for specified period i.e. a year in
                         case of annual increment. Increment in
                         pay is thus an integral part of
                         progressive appointment and accrues
                         from the day following which it is
                         earned. "




                   5.1 It was stated that where a government
                   servant observes good conduct for entire year
                   before increment accrues, it is logical and
                   normal that he earns the increment. Dealing
                   with the situation where the government servant
                   has retired on 30th June and the increment is
                   payable on 1st July, the High Court stated thus,
                   (Para 23)

                         "Annual increment though is attached to
                         the post & becomes payable on a day
                         following which it is earned but the day
                         on which increment accrues or becomes
                         payable     is    not    conclusive   or
                         determinative. In the statutory scheme
                         governing      progressive   appointment
                         increment becomes due for the services
                         rendered over a year by the government
                         servant subject to his good behaviour.
                         The pay of a central government servant
                         rises, by periodical increments, from a
                         minimum to the maximum in the
                         prescribed scale. The entitlement to
                         receive increment therefore crystallises
                         when the government servant completes
                         requisite length of service with good

                         conduct and becomes payable on the
                         succeeding day. "



                   5.1.1 It was further observed by the Delhi High
                   Court that denial of the entitlement to receive
                   benefit when is crystallized in law could be
                   arbitrary if it is denied unless there is valid
                   reason. Though the increment was earned for
                   past period it is denied on the ground that on
                   the date when the increment becoming payable
                   the government servant was not holding the
                   post as he had retired, such has to be viewed to
                   be not the valid ground to deny the increment.
                   The High Court observed that 'the concept of
                   day following which the increment is earned
                   has otherwise no purpose to achieve'. It was
                   stated, (Para 24)

                         "In isolation of the purpose it serves the
                         fixation of day succeeding the date of
                         entitlement has no intelligible differentia
                         nor any object is to be achieved by it.
                         The central government servant retiring
                         on 30th June has already completed a
                         year of service and the increment has
                         been earned provided his conduct was
                         good. It would thus be wholly arbitrary if
                         the increment earned by the central
                         government employee on the basis of his
                         good conduct for a year is denied only on
                         the ground that he was not in
                         employment on the succeeding day when
                         increment became payable. "



                   5.1.2 The retirement of the government servant
                   on the day prior to the increment becoming
                   payable is only fortuitous circumstance, it was
                   rightly expressed, (Para 24)

                         "In the case of a government servant
                         retiring on 30th of June the next day on

                         which increment falls due/becomes
                         payable looses significance and must
                         give way to the right of the government
                         servant to receive increment due to
                         satisfactory services of a year so that the
                         scheme is not construed in a manner that
                         if offends the spirit of reasonableness
                         enshrined in 
Article 14
 of the
                         Constitution of India. The scheme for
                         payment of increment would have to be
                         read as whole and one part of 
Article
                         151
 of CSR cannot be read in isolation
                         so as to frustrate the other part
                         particularly when the other part creates
                         right in the central government servant
                         to receive increment. This would ensure
                         that scheme of progressive appointment
                         remains intact and the rights earned by a
                         government servant remains protected
                         and are not denied due to a fortuitous
                         circumstance. "

5.4.1 In 
Laxmanbhai Chavda
 (supra), the
                   Division Bench of this court observed that
                   reading of Rule 10 of the Rules would make it
                   clear that the government servant is entitled to
                   the increment becoming payable on 1st July.
                   (Para 5)

                         "...Rule 10 of the Rules, which speaks of
                         uniform date of annual increment, which
                         is 1st July of every year. It says that the
                         employees completing six months and
                         above in the revised pay structure as on
                         1st July, will be eligible to be granted the
                         increment. The first increment, after
                         fixation of pay as per the said Rules is on
                         1.1.2006 in the revised pay structure
                         which shall need to be granted on
                         1.7.2006 for those employees for whom
                         the date of next increment was between
                         1.7.2006 to 1.1.2007."

                         held from the factual details that the
                         employee before it since had completed
                         one full year service as on 30.6.2013, i.e.
                         the date of which he was superannuated,
                         but the increment fell due on 1.7.2013,
                         on which date he was not in services and
                         therefore, it interpreted that he shall
                         have to be treated as having completed
                         one full year of service, though the date
                         of increment fell on the next day of his

                   Appeal stands meritless.

                   dismissed. Notice is discharged. Interim orders
                   stand vacated. The directions issued in

                   granted within six weeks from today and the
