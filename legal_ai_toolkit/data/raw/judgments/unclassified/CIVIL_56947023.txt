                             ORAL JUDGMENT


1.    Heard learned advocate Mr. S.P. Majmudar for the appellant -

plaintiff and learned senior advocate Mr. Mihir Thakore with learned

advocate Mr. P. J Kanabar for the respondents- defendants in Special

Civil Suit No. 36 of 1999.





2.     Feeling aggrieved by the order under Order VII Rule 11(a) and


(d) 
of the Code of Civil Procedure
,1908 (for short "the Code")

below application Exh. 205 and Order in application Exh. 243 under

Order 47 Rule 1 read with 
section 151
 as well as order below Exh 1

in Special Civil Suit No. 36 of 1999 rejecting the suit passed by the

Principal Senior Civil Judge, Amreli, the appellant-original plaintiff

has preferred this appeal.





3.    Brief facts of the case are that the appellant-plaintiff entered

into an agreement for sale on 06.09.1983 which was registered in

Book No.1 at Serial No. 1497 before the Sub-Registrar, Amreli. The

agreement to sale was made by one Babubhai Karshanbhai Senjaliya

in favour of the President Manohardas Karsandas Singada in respect

of the proposed Kalyannagar Co-operative Housing Society.

      C/FA/4234/2021                            JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

                                                                                  undefined




3.1 The appellant- Kalyannagar Cooperative Housing Society was

registered under 
section 9
 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies

Act,1961, by the Registration Officer, Amreli vide Registration No.

GJ-9234.





3.2      As per the terms recorded in the agreement for sale the

defendant-respondent herein agreed to sale the land admeasuring 9

Acres i.e. 36422 sq.mtrs of Survey No. 120/2 Paiki which is

estimated to 15 Vighas 06 vasa for consideration of Rs. 20,000/- per

vigha. Total consideration is noted as Rs. 3,06,000/- out of which,

Rs. 3,000/- was paid to the original owner as a part consideration

towards the agreement to sale and the remaining amount of

Rs. 3,03,000/- was paid afterwards.





3.3     The agreement for sale further records that the remaining

amount would be paid within three years as and when it is

convenient to the plaintiff financially and defendant would execute

sale deed as per the say of the plaintiff and possession would be

handed over at that time only.

      C/FA/4234/2021                              JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

                                                                                    undefined




3.4     It appears that as per the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff-

society was to make an application for obtaining permission under

section 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act,1943

as the plaintiff-society was not an agriculturist. Accordingly, the

application was made before the Deputy Collector who by order

dated 10.06.1984, granted permission to the plaintiff-society to

purchase the land and a permission was also granted to the original

owners to sell their land i.e. total area of 11 Acres 17 Gunthas

comprising of 9Acre of Revenue Survey No. 122/2 and 2 Acres 17

Gunthas of Survey No. 120/4 with certain terms and conditions.



3.5     Thereafter, it appears that the sale deed dated 16.07.1984 was

executed by Babubhai Karsanbhai Senjaliya in favour of

Manohardas Karsandas Singada, President of the plaintiff-society

with consideration of Rs. 1,31,000/- by registered sale deed for land

admeasuring 3 Acre and 33 Gunthas               of Survey No. 120/2 i.e.

6 vighas and 11 vasa, 15479 sq.mtrs situated on Varsada road of

Amreli and possession of the said land was handed over to the

President of the plaintiff-society.

                                                                                 undefined




3.6     It appears that thereafter, on 29.06.1984, the Special Land

Acquisition Officer, Amreli, wrote a letter to the Executive

Engineer, Gujarat Housing Board, intimating him to remain present

for acquisition of the land including the land of Survey Nos. 120/2

and 120/4 comprising land admeasuring 9 Acres was agreed to be

sold to plaintiff-society.





3.7     Revenue Entries No. 504 was mutated in village Form No. 6

with regard to registered sale deed executed on 16.07.1984 for land

admeasuring 3 Acres 33 Gunthas in favour of the plaintiff-society of

Survey No. 120/2.





3.8     It is pertinent to note that another suit being No. 37/1999 was

filed before the same Court for enforcement of Agreement of Sale

for 2 Acres and 17 Gunthas of Survey No. 120/4 which was running

in the name of son of the defendant-original owner by the plaintiff

society. The defendant preferred application under Order VII Rule

11 of the Code which was also rejected by the Court below against

which the appeal is pending before the District Court as the suit

value was less than the prescribed limit.

      C/FA/4234/2021                             JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

                                                                                   undefined




3.9     It appears that thereafter, the plaintiff as well as the defendant

challenged acquisition of the land including the land in question

before this Court wherein a compromise was arrived at between the

plaintiff and the original owner-defendant that the Gujarat Housing

Board and the plaintiff-society paid and deposited Rs. 67,000/-

towards establishment and miscellaneous expenses of Rs. 6,000/-

towards legal expenses in Current Account No. 3981 of Executive

Engineer of Gujarat Housing Board, Bhavnagar as a condition

precedent to withdraw the acquisition proceedings.



3.10 By letter dated 19.06.1996 written by the Housing

Commissioner, Gujarat Housing Board to Special Land Acquisition

Officer, it was informed that the Board in its meeting dated

11.10.1990 vide Resolution No. 2214 has resolved to exempt the

land of Survey No. 120 Paiki from the acquisition with any other

Government land available at Amreli.






3.11 The Land Acquisition Officer, by letter dated 30.06.1994

addressed to defendant informed that the land of Survey No. 120

    C/FA/4234/2021                             JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

                                                                                 undefined




Paiki is exempted from acquisition as per order dated 21.03.1994 of

the Revenue Department.





3.12 It appears that thereafter the Collector, Amreli, by order dated

10.10.1994 ordered to convert the land situated Survey Nos. 120/2

and 120/4 into non-agriculture land for residential purpose and

permission was granted to construct the residential house on the

application dated 24.11.1993 filed by the President of the plaintiff-

society for land admeasuring 5 Acres 4 Gunthas.



3.13 It appears that thereafter, the suit was filed in the year 1999 for

specific performance of the Agreement to Sale executed on

06.09.1983 along with the documents which are referred to here-in-

above by the plaintiff.





3.14 It also emerges from the record that the plaintiff thereafter

amended the plaint twice, once in the year 2000 and thereafter in the

year 2007 which was allowed by the Court below by passing a

reasoned order at the relevant time. The issues were framed by the

Court below on 15.01.2010.

     C/FA/4234/2021                          JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

3.15 It appears that application Exh 205 preferred by the

respondent-defendant under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) of the

Code was rejected by the Court below initially on the ground that

readable copy of the amended plaint was not provided by the

defendant. However, thereafter, an application was made under

Order 47 read with 
section 151
 of the Code being application Exh.

243 which was considered without disturbing the order passed below

Exh. 2057 and application Exhibits 205 and 243 were again heard

and disposed of by the impugned order by allowing the same by

rejecting the suit under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) of the Code.




4.    Learned advocate Mr. S.P.Majmudar appearing for the

appellant- original plaintiff submitted that the learned Judge has

committed a grave error in allowing the application Exhibits 205 and

243 together by depriving the appellant from challenging the order

of recall before the appropriate forum as originally the application

under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code was already dismissed by the

Court below and without recalling that order, the Court could not

have again passed the order allowing such applications nor a

                                                                                 NEUTRAL CITATION

common order could have been passed and therefore, the impugned

order suffers from vice of procedural lapses on the part of the Courts

below.





4.1 It was further submitted that even on merits of the case for

rejecting the suit, provisions of Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the

Code would not apply in the facts of the case as the suit cannot be

said to be barred by law more particularly, when on bare perusal of

the plaint as well as the documents in connection therewith raises a

mixed question of fact and law with regard to enforceability of the

Agreement for Sale which was alleged to have been executed by a

proposed society coupled with other documents produced on record

which ratified such agreement for sale by subsequent conduct of the

defendant permitting the appellant-society to make an application for

permission under 
section 63
 before the Deputy Collector for

conversion of the land into non-agriculture the land in question

which was already granted after arriving at compromise with the

Gujarat Housing Board to get the land exempted from the

acquisition etc.

4.2 It was therefore submitted that the Court below could not have

rejected the suit at threshold after more than 20 years by not giving

liberty to the plaintiff to lead the evidence to prove its case, more

particularly, when the issues are already framed by the Court.



4.3 It was also pointed out that the made by the Court below is

arbitrary and contrary to the documents produced on record by the

plaintiff in support of the averments made in the plaint. It was

submitted that even if the amendments made in the plaint are not

taken into consideration, the original plaint itself would be sufficient

as averments made in the original draft of the plaint along with the

documents produced therewith would go to show that the plaintiff

has a very good arguable case before the amendment also which can

be proved by leading oral and documentary evidence.



4.4 In support of his submissions he has relied upon the following

judgements:

5.       On the other hand, learned Senior Advocate Mr. Mihir Thakore

with the learned advocate Mr. Kanabar submitted that the

application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code can be preferred at

any stage of the trial and therefore the contention raised on behalf of

the appellant herein that it was filed after more than 20 years is of no

consequence. It was further submitted that the plaint is covered

under the provision of Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of the Code and

therefore, the same can be rejected by the Court at any stage.



5.1 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore invited attention of the

Court to the amendments made in the plaint in the year 2000 as well

as in year 2007 by the plaintiff to point out that the such

amendments were made so as to wriggle out of the settled legal

position that no agreement for sale could have been made by the

proposed society and such Agreement for Sale is void ab initio and

therefore, the same cannot be enforced by way of specific

performance. It was further submitted that amendments in paras 1A,

1B and 1C when read together, the stand taken by the plaintiff is

contradictory to each other. In para 1A it was averred that the

plaintiff relied upon the contract between the parties which was

carried out in the year 2000 and thereafter wisdom has prevailed

upon the plaintiff by further amendment of the plaint by inserting

para 1B which is again taking a stand that there was a deemed

registration of the society when the application for registration was

made by the society in the month of June 1983, prior to the date of

Agreement for Sale on 06.09.1983 whereas further contradictory

stand is taken in para 1C raising contention of oral agreement

between the parties. It was therefore submitted that the plaintiffs

have from time-to-time changed their standby amending the plaint

and therefore, the entire plaint is distorted and no decree of specific

performance can be passed on the basis of the bare perusal of the

averments made in the plaint.





5.2 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore also referred to

averments made in para 4 of the plaint to point out that vague

averments are made by the plaintiff with regard to refusal on part of

the defendants to execute the sale deed in the year 1999 so as to

overcome the question of limitation. It was submitted that it is

nothing but a piece of clever drafting by the plaintiff and as per the

settled legal position, the plaintiff cannot take advantage of such

clever drafting so as to avoid the action by the Court under Order

VII Rule 11 of the Code.

5.3 It was also submitted by learned advocate Mr. Thakore that the

documents produced along with plaint clearly shows that the

plaintiff has played a mischief with the Court by producing only

first page of the registered Sale Deed dated 16.07.2019 at Mark 4/5

whereas the entire sale deed was produced by the defendant later on

at Exh 22. It was submitted that as such sale deed produced by the

defendant cannot be looked by the Court for deciding the

application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code, the same is not

referred to however, suffice is to say that the plaintiff, for the

reasons best known to it, did not produce entire sale deed on record

as it may be possible that there was only sale of 03 Acres and 33

Gunthas      and not 9 Acres of Survey No. 120/2 for which the

registered Agreement to Sale was executed with the proposed

society which cannot be enforced as per the settled legal position.



5.4 It was further pointed out by learned Senior Advocate Mr.

Thakore that the Court below has therefore rightly came to the

conclusion that the suit is barred by law under Order VII Rule 11(d)

of the Code as no decree of specific performance can be granted in

favour of the proposed society by relying upon the various decisions

of this Court as well as the Hon'ble Supreme Court.



5.5 In support of his submissions, Senior Advocate Mr. Thakore

referred to and relied upon the following decisions:



 
 
Canara Bank vs. P. Selathal and ors
 reported in (2020) 13

     SCC 143:




          "8.       Therefore, the short question which is posed for
          consideration of this Court is, whether the suits filed by the
          plaintiffs were liable to be rejected in exercise of powers
          under Order 7 Rule 11(d) 
of the CPC
 or not?



          9. While considering the aforesaid issue/question, few
          decisions of this Court on exercise of powers under Order 7
          Rule 11(d) 
of the CPC
 are required to be referred to and
          considered.



          9.1     In the case of T. Arivandandam (supra), while
          considering the very same provision i.e. 
Order 7 Rule 11 of
          the CPC
 and the decree of the trial Court in considering
          such application, this Court in para 5 has observed and held
          as under:

            "5. We have not the slightest hesitation in condemning
            the petitioner for the gross abuse of the process of the
            court repeatedly and unrepentantly resorted to. From the
            statement of the facts found in the judgment of the High
            Court, it is perfectly plain that the suit now pending
            before the First Munsif's Court, Bangalore, is a flagrant
            misuse of the mercies of the law in receiving plaints.
            The learned Munsif must remember that if on a
            meaningful - not formal - reading of the plaint it is
            manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not
            disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his
            power under 
Order 7, Rule 11 CPC
 taking care to see
            that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if
            clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of
            action, nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining
            the party searchingly under 
Order 10, CPC
. An activist
            Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits...."



 
9.2 In the case of 
Church of Christ Charitable Trust and
       Educational Charitable Society v. Ponniamman
       Educational Trust
 (2012) 8 SCC 706, this Court in paras 13
       has observed and held as under:




           "13. While scrutinizing the plaint averments, it is the
           bounden duty of the trial Court to ascertain the materials
           for cause of action. The cause of action is a bundle of
           facts which taken with the law applicable to them gives
           the plaintiff the right to relief against the defendant.
           Every fact which is necessary for the plaintiff to prove to
           enable him to get a decree should be set out in clear
           terms. It is worthwhile to find out the meaning of the
           words "cause of action". A cause of action must include
           some act done by the Defendant since in the absence of
           such an act no cause of action can possible accrue."

       9.3 In 
A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies,
       Salem
 (supra), this Court explained the meaning of "cause
       of action" as follows:






            "12.A cause of action means every fact, which if
            traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove
            in order to support his right to a judgment of the court.
            In other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with
            the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to
            relief against the defendant. It must include some act
            done by the defendant since in the absence of such an
            act no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is not
            limited to the actual infringement of the right sued on
            but includes all the material facts on which it is founded.
            It does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such
            facts, but every fact necessary for the plaintiff to prove
            to enable him to obtain a decree. Everything which is
            not proved would give the defendant a right to
            immediate judgment must be part of the cause of action.
            But it has no relation whatever to the defence which
            may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon
            the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff."



       9.4 In the case of Sopan Sukhdeo Sable (supra) in paras 11
       and 12, this Court has observed as under:





           "11. 
In 
I.T.C. Ltd. v. Debts Recovery Appellate
           Tribunal
 [(1998) 2 SCC 70] it was held that the basic
           question to be decided while dealing with an application
           filed under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real
           cause of action has been set out in the plaint or
           something purely illusory has been stated with a view to
           get out of Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code.

           12. The trial Court must remember that if on a
           meaningful and not formal reading of the plaint it is
           manifestly vexatious and meritless in the sense of not
           disclosing a clear right to sue, it should exercise the
           power under Order 7 Rule 11 of the Code taking care to
           see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. If
           clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of

           by examining the party searchingly under Order 10 of

       9.5 In the case of Madanuri Sri Rama Chandra Murthy
       (supra), this Court has observed and held as under:




            "7. The plaint can be rejected under Order 7 Rule 11 if
            conditions enumerated in the said provision are fulfilled.
            It is needless to observe that the power under 
Order 7
            Rule 11 CPC
 can be exercised by the Court at any stage
            of the suit. The relevant facts which need to be looked
            into for deciding the application are the averments of the
            plaint only. If on an entire and meaningful reading of the
            plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious
            and meritless in the sense of not disclosing any right to
            sue, the court should exercise power under 
Order 7 Rule
            11 CPC
. Since the power conferred on the court to
            terminate civil action at the threshold is drastic, the
            conditions enumerated under 
Order 7 Rule 11 CPC
 to
            the exercise of power of rejection of plaint have to be
            strictly adhered to. The averments of the plaint have to
            be read as a whole to find out whether the suit is barred
            by any law. It is needless to observe that the question as
            to whether the suit is barred by any law, would always
            depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

            The averments in the written statement as well as the
            contentions of the defendant are wholly immaterial
            while considering the prayer of the defendant for
            rejection of the plaint. Even when the allegations made
            in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their
            face value, if they show that the suit is barred by any
            law, or do not disclose cause of action, the application
            for rejection of plaint can be entertained and the power
            under 
Order 7 Rule 11 CPC
 can be exercised. If clever
            drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause
            of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so
            that bogus litigation will end at the earlier stage."



 
9.6 In the case of 
Ram Singh v. Gram Panchayat Mehal
       Kalan
 (1986) 4 SCC 364, this Court has observed and held
       that when the suit is barred by any law, the plaintiff cannot
       be allowed to circumvent that provision by means of clever
       drafting so as to avoid mention of those circumstances, by
       which the suit is barred by law of limitation."

        23.3 The underlying object of Order VII Rule 11 (a) is
        that if in a suit, no cause of action is disclosed, or the suit

        not permit the plaintiff to unnecessarily protract the

        Manvendrasinhji Jadeja v. Rajmata Vijaykunverba w/o
        Late Maharaja Mahedrasinhji, (1998) 2 GLH 823
        permitted to waste judicial time of the court, in the
        following words :





           "12. ...The whole purpose of conferment of such power
           is to ensure that a litigation which is meaningless, and
           bound to prove abortive should not be permitted to
           occupy the time of the Court, and exercise the mind of
           the respondent. The sword of Damocles need not be kept
           hanging over his head unnecessarily without point or
           purpose. Even if an ordinary civil litigation, the Court
           readily exercises the power to reject a plaint, if it does
           not disclose any cause of action."



       23.5 The power conferred on the court to terminate a civil
       action is, however, a drastic one, and the conditions
       enumerated in Order VII Rule 11 are required to be strictly
       adhered to.



       23.6 Under Order VII Rule 11, a duty is cast on the Court
       to determine whether the plaint discloses a cause of action

       conjunction with the documents relied upon, or whether the
       suit is barred by any law.




       23.7 Order VII Rule 14(1) provides for production of
       documents, on which the plaintiff places reliance in his
       suit, which reads as under :





           " 14: Production of document on which plaintiff sues or
           relies.- (1)Where a plaintiff sues upon a document or
           relies upon document in his possession or power in
           support of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a
           list, and shall produce it in Court when the plaint is
           presented by him and shall, at the same time deliver the
           document and a copy thereof, to be filed with the plaint.



            (2)Where any such document is not in the possession or
            power of the plaintiff, he shall, wherever possible, state
            in whose possession or power it is.

           (3)A document which ought to be produced in Court by
           the plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be entered
           in the list to be added or annexed to the plaint but is not
           produced or entered accordingly, shall not, without the
           leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf
           at the hearing of the suit.

           (4)Nothing in this rule shall apply to document produced
           for the cross examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or,
           handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory."



       23.8     Having regard to 
Order VII Rule 14 CPC
, the
       documents filed alongwith the plaint, are required to be
       taken into consideration for deciding the application under
       Order VII Rule 11 (a). When a document referred to in the

       plaint, forms the basis of the plaint, it should be treated as a
       part of the plaint.




       23.9     In exercise of power under this provision, the
       Court would determine if the assertions made in the plaint
       are contrary to statutory law, or judicial dicta, for deciding
       whether a case for rejecting the plaint at the threshold is
       made out.

       23.10 At this stage, the pleas taken by the defendant in the
       written statement and application for rejection of the plaint
       on the merits, would be irrelevant, and cannot be adverted
       to, or taken into consideration.





23.11 The test for exercising the power under Order VII
       Rule 11 is that if the averments made in the plaint are taken
       in entirety, in conjunction with the documents relied upon,
       would the same result in a decree being passed. This test
       was laid down in 
Liverpool & London S.P. & I Assn. Ltd.
       v. M.V.Sea Success I & Anr.,4
 which reads as :


           "139. Whether a plaint discloses a cause of action or not
           is essentially a question of fact. But whether it does or
           does not must be found out from reading the plaint itself.
           For the said purpose, the averments made in the plaint in
           their entirety must be held to be correct. The test is as to
           whether if the averments made in the plaint are taken to
           be correct in their entirety, a decree would be passed."



 
23.12 In Hardesh Ores (P.) 
Ltd. v. Hede & Co.5
 the
       
Court further held
 that it is not permissible to cull out a
       sentence or a passage, and to read it in isolation. It is the
       substance, and not merely the form, which has to be looked

       into. The plaint has to be construed as it stands, without
       addition or subtraction of words. If the allegations in the
       plaint prima facie show a cause of action, the court cannot
       embark upon an enquiry whether the allegations are true in
       fact.





       23.13 If on a meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found
       that the suit is manifestly vexatious and without any merit,
       and does not disclose a right to sue, the court would be
       justified in exercising the power under 
Order VII Rule 11
       CPC
.





23.14 The power under 
Order VII Rule 11 CPC
 may be
       exercised by the Court at any stage of the suit, either before
       registering the plaint, or after issuing summons to the
       defendant, or before conclusion of the trial, as held by this
       Court in the judgment of 
Saleem Bhai v. State of
       Maharashtra
.
 
The plea that once issues are framed, the
       matter must necessarily go to trial was repelled by this
       Court in 
Azhar Hussain
 (supra).





       23.15 The provision of Order VII Rule 11 is mandatory in
       nature. It states that the plaint "shall" be rejected if any of
       the grounds specified in clause (a) to (e) are made out. If
       the Court finds that the plaint does not disclose a cause of
       action, or that the suit is barred by any law, the Court has
       no option, but to reject the plaint.

           "24. A cause of action, thus, means every fact, which if
           traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove
           an order to support his right to a judgment of the court.

           In other words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with
           the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a right to
           relief against the defendant. It must include some act
           done by the defendant since in the absence of such an
           act, no cause of action can possibly accrue. It is not
           limited to the actual infringement of the right sued on but
           includes all the material facts on which it is founded"




       24.2. 
In 
T. Arivandandam v. T.V. Satyapal & Anr.9
 this
       Court held that while considering an application under
       
Order VII Rule 11 CPC
 what is required to be decided is
       whether the plaint discloses a real cause of action, or
       something purely illusory, in the following words : -




 
"5. ...The learned Munsiff must remember that if on a
           meaningful - not formal - reading of the plaint it is
           manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not
           disclosing a clear right to sue, he should exercise his
           power under O. VII, R. 11, 
C.P.C
. taking care to see that
           the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if clever
           drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip
           it in the bud at the first hearing ..." (emphasis supplied)

       24.3     Subsequently, in 
I.T.C. Ltd. v. Debt Recovery
       Appellate Tribunal
, this Court held that law cannot permit
       clever drafting which creates illusions of a cause of action.
       What is required is that a clear right must be made out in
       the plaint.




 
29.16      
The present case
 is a classic case, where the
       plaintiffs by clever drafting of the plaint, attempted to
       make out an illusory cause of action, and bring the suit
       within the period of limitation.

                 someone purports to act is a nullity and gives rise to
                 no cause-of-action. In order to make good his
                 contention that such a contract is valid and
                 enforceable at law, Mr. Vyas has invited our
                 attention to some provisions of the 
Gujarat
                 Cooperative Societies Act, 1961
. 
S. 2(13)
 defines
                 "member" as a person joining in an application for
                 the registration of a co-operative society which is
                 subsequently registered, or a person duly admitted to
                 membership of a society after registration and
                 includes a nominal, associate or sympathiser
                 member. 
S. 2(19)
 defines "society" which means a
                 co-operative society registered or deemed to be
                 registered, under this Act. A reference to a society
                 "deemed to be registered " appears to be in the
                 context of sub-see. (2) of
 S. 169
. Sub-section (2) of
                 
S. 169
 provides as follows:-



                  "All societies registered or deemed to be registered
                  under the said Act the registration of which was in
                  force immediately before the commencement of
                  this Act, shall on such commencement be deemed
                  to be registered under this Act; and all proceedings

                 by such officer, authority or person in accordance
                 with the provisions of this Act."



            These three provisions to which Mr. Vyas has invited
            our attention do not warrant the conclusion that the
            society before it is registered and comes into existence
            can act through its promoter. 
Sec. 37
 throws light on
            this aspect. It reads as follows:-





                 "A society on its registration shall be a body
                 corporate by the name under which it is registered,

                 -w1th perpetual succession and a common seal, and
                 with power to acquire, hold and dispose of
                 property, to enter into contracts, to institute and
                 defend suits and other legal proceedings and to do
                 all such things as are necessary for the purpose for
                 which it is constituted."



            It is clear, therefore, that a co-operative society becomes
            a legal person after it is registered and it is after its
            registration that it acquires the capacity to enter into
            contracts. No provision in the Act has been pointed out
            to us under which the promoters of a society can act on
            behalf of the society before it has been registered and
            has come into existence.

                  Indravijaysinhji in favour of the petitioners who are
                  members of the proposed Vijay Co-operative Housing
                  Society is a nullity and creates no right in favour of the
                  petitioners. As the agreement to sell dated July 10,
                  1980 is nullity, it cannot be specifically enforced and,
                  therefore, even a suit for specific performance of the
                  said agreement cannot be brought by the petitioners in a
                  competent Court. In view of this legal position, it is
                  evident that it cannot be said that the petitioners are
                  adversely affected by consent decree dated November
                  18, 1993 passed in Regular Civil Suit No. 740 of 1986
                  so as to entitle them to get permission to file an appeal
                  against the said decree."



6.    Order VII Rule 11 of the Code provides for rejection of the

plaint and reads as under:



            "11. Rejection of plaint.



              The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases-



              (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action;



             (b) where the relief claimed is undervalued, and the
             plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the
             valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do
             so;



              (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the
              plaint is returned upon paper insufficiently stamped, and
              the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the
              requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the
              Court, fails to do so;

             (d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint
             to be barred by any law:





              Provided that the time fixed by the Court for the
              correction of the valuation or supplying of the requisite
              stamp-paper shall not be extended unless the Court, for
              reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff was
              prevented by any cause of an exceptional nature form
              correcting the valuation or supplying the requisite stamp-
              paper, as the case may be, within the time fixed by the
              Court and that refusal to extend such time would cause
              grave injustice to the plaintiff."



7.    Clause (a) of Rule 11 of Order VII of the Code provides that the

plaint shall be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action

and clause (d) provides that the plaint shall be rejected where the suit

appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.





8.    It is pertinent to note that the application under Exh 205 was

filed by the defendant-respondent on 12.08.2018 i.e. almost after 19

years from the date of filing of the suit. It is true that such

application can be filed at any stage of the trial but at the same time

conduct of the parties is also required to be considered. The issues

were already framed by the Court in the year 2010 and considering

the same also the application Exh 205 was filed after 8 years.




9.    The learned Judge after considering the documents produced

along with plaint while again disposing application Exh 205 along

with Exh 243 held that admittedly Agreement to Sale is of 1983 and

when it was executed the plaintiff-Co-operative Society was only

proposed society and was not registered under 
section 9
 of the

Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, at the same time it is observed

that thereafter the proceedings in respect of the land acquisition

procedure one of which lasted up to 1994 and thereafter the suit was

filed in 1999. However, the learned Judge has failed to consider the

fact that the documents produced along with the plaint together with

the averments made in the plaint prima facie shows that both the

parties in effect has proceeded with the terms of the Agreement for

Sale that is to say applying for permission before the Deputy

Collector to purchase the land and thereafter even NA permission

was granted on the application made by the plaintiff-society.

Therefore, as per the settled legal position as analyzed here-in-below

the question which arises for consideration is as to whether the suit

can be said to be barred by law as per clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order

VII of the Code would be a mixed question of fact or law or pure

question of law arising from the averments made in the plaint

together with the documents produced therewith.




10. The Trial Court has recorded the conclusion in paras 17 to 20 as

under:



          "17. Though, it is strongly argued by the Ld. Advocate of
          plaintiffs that issue of limitation is a mixed question of law
          & fact and it cannot be decided at this stage without
          recording the entire evidences, but this Court is firmly of
          the opinion that generally issue of 1\limitation is a mixed
          question of law and fact, but when facts and circumstances
          themselves clear, it is a pure question of law only, it
          deserves to be rejected. And facts and circumstances of
          present suit are such, which clear that issue of limitation is
          a pure question of law. When the suit and plaint itself
          clears that it is barred by the law and specifically the 
Law
          of Limitation and the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act,
          1961
, it cannot be allowed to remain the present suit for
          further years in the Court.



          18.      No new fact is brought on record by the present
          application. At the stage of deciding the application of 0.7
          R.11, Court has to see the plaint and documentary
          evidences produced along with it only. Plaint and the
          evidences produced by the plaintiff along with the plaint
          and afterwards, clear that present suit is barred by the
          provisions of Law of Limitation, the Gujarat Co- operative

Societies Act
.1961 and for the want of legal cause of
       action. Cause of action mentioned in the present suit is
       illusory, false, vexatious and artificial. Hence, present suit
       deserves to be rejected under 0.7 R.11 (a) and (d).



       19.      Arguments led by the Ld. Advocate of the
       defendant are tenable and arguments led the Ld. Advocate
       of plaintiff are not tenable for the above mentioned
       reasons. Though, this Court had dismissed the Exh.205
       earlier for want of legible copy of the plaint on record but
       if defendant was not producing that and failed to produce
       that before this Court then plaintiff could produce that but
       it was no followed so. Hence, it was not only the fault of
       defendant who move present applications but also fault on
       the part of the plaintiff. Because, Exh.205 was not decided
       on merits, then this Court finds no infirmity in allowing the
       application moved at Exh.243 under Order-47, Rule-1 r/w
       
Section 151
 of the Code. The scheme of the said provision
       does not violate in any manner, if the said application is
       allowed. And accordingly Exh.205 too, as discussed above.



       20.      In view of the above discussion, this Court is
       strongly of the opinion that present suit deserves to be
       rejected under the provisions of 0.7 R.11 (a) & (d) of the
       Code and hence, applications under Order 7, Rule 11(a) &

       (d) and under Order-47, Rule-1 r/w. 
Section 151
 of the
       Code deserves to be allowed. Hence, following order is
       passed under Exhs.205, 243 and Exh. 1:-



                           ::ORDER::

           allowed.



            (3) Present suit bearing Special Civil Suit No. 36/1999 is
            hereby rejected under Order 7. Rule 11 (a) & (d) of the
            Civil Procedure Code, 1908. (4) Copy of this order shall be
            kept along with the plaint of the suit."





11. On perusal of the above conclusion the only observation made

by the Trial Court is that when the suit and plaint itself declares that

it is barred by law and specifically by law of limitation and provision

of the 
Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act
, it cannot be allowed to

continue. However, while arriving at such conclusion the Trial Court

has failed to consider the facts emerging from the plaint and the

documents annexed therewith to the effect that             the subsequent

events from 1983 till the date of filing of the suit reflected from the

averments and documents annexed with the plaint clearly shows

that Agreement for Sale which is sought to be enforced under the

provisions of the 
Specific Relief Act
 and the issue as to whether the

suit is barred by limitation requires leading of evidence as it involves

the mixed question of facts as well as law inasmuch as merely on

bare perusal of the averments made in the plaint and the documents

that the suit is barred by law under Order VII Rule 11 (a) and (d) of

the Code.





12. Learned advocate for the appellant has relied upon the decision

of the Apex Court in case of 
Salim D. Agboatwala and ors vs.

Shamalji Oddhavji Thakkar
 reported in 2021 SCC online SC 735

wherein the Apex Court, after considering the provisions of 
sections

25
 and 
25A
 of the Maharashtra and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 as

well the question of limitation has held as under:


           "25. But the above contention of Shri Joshi overlooks an
           important facet of the case set up by the plaintiffs.
           According to the plaintiffs, the Estate was in the
           administration of the Court Receiver and that in collusion
           between the Court Receiver and the Revenue authorities,
           the sale as well as mutation took place without any notice
           to any of the interested parties. Collusion and fraud are the
           main planks on which the plaintiffs have built up their
           case. The question whether the order of the ALT and the
           sale certificate issued thereafter are the product of fraud
           and collusion, cannot be determined by the appellate or
           revisional authority under the Act. In any case it is
           contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that by
           virtue of 
Section 88B(1)(d)
 of the Act, none of the
           provisions of the Act, except a few, are applicable, "to
           lands taken under management temporarily by the Civil,

          receivers appointed by them, till the decision of the title of
          the rightful owners". The 7 AIR 1972 Bombay 122
          veracity of such argument has not been tested before the
          Trial Court or the High Court. We do not know whether the
          exemption under Section 88B was raised at all by the
          appellants/plaintiffs. But it is a legal issue which goes to
          the root of the matter. Therefore, the Civil Court's
          jurisdiction cannot be said to have been ousted completely.
          The Civil Court was obliged to see at least whether the
          appointment of a Receiver for the administration of the
          Estate of a deceased person would actually fall within the
          mandate of Clause(d) of Subsection(1) of Section 88B.



          26. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Trial
          Court as well as the High Court were clearly in error in
          rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11(d). Hence, the
          appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the Trial
          Court as well as the High Court are set aside and the suit is
          restored to file. There will be no order as to costs."

Pushpaben Yogendraprasad Mahant vs.

Ravirajsingh Kiritsingh Jhala
 decided on 19.07.2021 held as

under:




           "14.1 The Court has to read the entire plaint as a whole to
           find out whether it discloses a cause of action and if it
           does, then the plaint cannot be rejected by the Court
           exercising the powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the
           Code. Essentially, whether the plaint discloses a cause of
           action, is a question of fact which has to be gathered on the
           basis of the averments made in the plaint in its entirety
           taking those averments to be correct. A cause of action is a

        bundle of facts which are required to be proved for
        obtaining relief and for the said purpose, the material facts
        are required to be stated but not the evidence except in
        certain cases where the pleadings relied on are in regard to
        misrepresentation, fraud, wilful default, undue influence or
        of the same nature. So long as the plaint discloses some
        cause of action which requires determination by the court,
        mere fact that in the opinion of the Judge the plaintiff may
        not succeed cannot be a ground for rejection of the plaint.


        14.2 In the present case, the averments made in the plaint,
        as has been noticed by us, do disclose the cause of action
        and, therefore, the High Court has rightly said that the
        powers under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code cannot be
        exercised for rejection of the suit filed by the plaintiff-
        appellants.

Hardesh Ores (P) Ltd.,
        vs. Hade and Company
 (2007) 5 SCC 614 in Para 25
        observed as under:-






        "25. The language of 
Order VII Rule 11 CPC
 is quite clear
        and unambiguous. The plaint can be rejected on the ground
        of limitation only where the suit appears from the
        statement in the plaint to be barred by any law. Mr.
        Nariman did not dispute that "law" within the meaning of
        Clause (d) of Order VII Rule 11 must include the law of
        limitation as well. It is well settled that whether a plaint
        discloses a cause of action is essentially a question of fact,
        but whether it does or does not must be found out from
        reading the plaint itself. For the said purpose the averments
        made in the plaint in their entirety must be held to be
        correct. The test is whether the averments made in the
        plaint if taken to be correct in their entirety a decree would
        be passed. 
The averments made in the plaint as a whole

C/FA/4234/2021                                JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

                                                                                undefined




        of Order VII is applicable. It is not permissible to cull out
        a sentence or a passage and to read it out of the context in
        isolation. Although it is the substance and not merely the
        form that has to be looked into, the pleading has to be
        construed as it stands without addition or subtraction of
        words or change of its apparent grammatical sense. As
        observed earlier, the language of Clause (d) is quite clear
        but if any authority is required, one may usefully refer to
        the judgments of this Court in 
Liverpool and London S.P.

        14.4 It appears that the Court below has not been able to
        understand the fine distinction between the plea that there
        was no cause of action for the suit and the plea that the
        plaint does not disclose a cause of of action. In the case on
        hand, on a fair reading of the application Ex.18 filed by the
        defendants under Order VII Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure
        Code it is clear that the case of the defendants is that the
        plaintiffs have no cause of action to file the suit. It is not
        specifically pleaded by the defendants that the plaint does
        not disclose any cause of action. The trial Judge has also
        not recorded any specified finding to this effect. It could
        be said that while adjudicating the application for rejection
        of plaint the trial Judge has actually adjudicated the entire
        suit, in other words the right, title and interest of the
        plaintiffs in the suit property. It is very unfortunate to note
        that the trial Court proceeds on the footing that the
        plaintiffs have not been able to establish their right, title or
        interest in the suit properties on the basis of or on the
        strength of the revenue records i.e. the entries in the
        revenue records. The trial Judge seems to be oblivious of
        the fact that the entries in the revenue records even
        otherwise do not confer any right, title or interest. How
        does the trial Judge expect the plaintiff to make good his
        case or establish his title on the basis of the revenue

        records while deciding the application for rejection of the
        plaint at the instance of the defendants.




        14.5 From the averments made in the plaint, it is clear that
        the plaintiffs have pleaded a cause of action for filing the
        suit seeking the reliefs stated in it i.e. not to say that the
        plaintiffs have cause of action to file the suit for the reliefs
        sought, that question is to be determined on the basis of
        materials (other than the plaint) which may be produced by
        the parties at appropriate stage in the suit. For the limited
        purpose of determining the question whether the plaint is
        to be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 or not the
        averments in the plaint are only to be looked into.


        14.6 The Court below observed that in absence of further
        revenue record prima facie title to the property cannot be
        accepted to be established. According to the Court below,
        the plaint does not disclose that Mahant Narandas was
        ancestor of Yogendraprasadji and the sale deed cannot be
        challenged on the ground that plaintiffs were successors by
        inheritance to the property. It is important to note that the
        issue for adjudication of rights in connection to the said
        plaint will be with regards to the original transfer of rights
        by Yogendraprasadji, Ramdasguru Bhagwandas, Mahant
        Narandas to the plaintiffs. The said issue for adjudication
        of rights flowing from the Will dated 1937 cannot be shut
        merely on the ground that there are no further revenue
        records reflecting the rights of the plaintiffs.



        14.7 The suit is yet to go for trial and plaintiffs will have to
        prove by producing evidence to establish that they are
        successors of the subject property. The original entry no.
        253 will be relevant for the plaintiffs to establish their right
        to the property by succession. It is drastic to reject the suit

14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of 
Shaukathussain

Mohammad Patel vs. Khatunben Mohmmedbhai Polara
 reported

in (2019) 10 SCC 226 has held that the averment in the plaint have

to be taken into account in their entirety and considering such

evidence if the case is required to be considered on merits, rejection

of plaint is not justified as it is well settled that for the purposes of

the provision of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code, the entirety of the

averments in the plaint is to be taken into account and going by the

version of the appellant as detailed in the plaint, there was element

of deception and fraud which was practiced upon him as a result of

which the document concerned got entered into. In the facts of the

said case and considering such averments made in the plaint and the

fact that the plaintiff-appellant was always in possession of the

property in question the issue raised in the matter was required to be

considered on merits.

In case of 
Sejal Glass Ltd vs. Navilan Merchants Pvt. Ltd


reported in 2018 11 SCC 780 while examining the relative scope

and applicability of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code read with Order

VI Rule 16 of the Code it was held that if the condition mentioned in

Order VII Rule 11 of the Code are fulfilled entire plaint is to be

rejected. However, where it appears that plaint cannot be proceeded

with in some part but it can be proceeded in another part, Order VII

Rule 11 of the Code has no application and then suit as a whole must

proceed to trial.






               "20. 
In the case of 
Ahmed Hossein vs. Mt. Chembelli
               and others
 reported in AIR 1951 Cal 262, a decision
               relied upon by Mr. Thakore, the suit was on a
               dishonoured cheque. The plaint did not state that any
               notice of dishonour had been given or that any
               circumstances existed which rendered it unnecessary to
               give such notice. The plaintiff subsequently sought to
               introduce these statements in the plaint by an
               amendment. The application was opposed by the
               defendants on the ground that by reason of the absence
               of these allegations, the plaint as it stood then, disclosed
               no cause of action and hence it must be rejected under O.
               7, R. 11 (a) of the Code and the Court had no power to
               allow the amendment. The plaintiff's answer was two
               fold : First the plaint disclosed a cause of action in spite
               of the omission to state anything with regard to the
               notice of dishonour and secondly, that O. 7, R. 11, does
               not take away the Court's power to order amendment of

C/FA/4234/2021                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 07/07/2023

                                                                                  undefined




           the plaint. With regard to the first point, the plaintiff's
           contention was that the facts relating to the notice of
           dishonour were not part of the cause of action on a
           dishonoured cheque but were mere conditions precedent
           necessary for the case on the cheque, the performance or
           occurrence of which is to be implied in the plaint under
           O. 6, R. 6 of the Code. Sarkar J (as His Lordship then
           was) did not accept this contention. His Lordship made
           the following observations in this connection:




             "A cause of action is that bundle of facts which would,
            if left to itself, create in law a right or obligation, while a
            condition precedent is something which prevents the
            right or obligation which would have otherwise sprung
            out from those facts from springing out. A condition
            precedent has thus been described in the notes to O. 19,
            R. 14 in the White Book:



            "Cases constantly occur in which, although everything
            has happened which would at common law prima facie
            entitle a man to a certain sum of money, or vest in him a
            certain right of action there is yet something more which
            must be done or something more which must happen in
            the particular case before he is entitled to sue either by
            reason of the provisions of some statute, or because the
            parties have expressly so agreed; this something more is
            called a condition precedent. It is not of the essence of
            such a cause of action, but it has been made essential. It
            is an additional formality superimposed on the common
            law."



 
I would in the above quotation add to the words
            "common law" the words "or statute." Now the liability
            of the drawer of a cheque arises under
 S. 30
, Negotiable
            Instruments Act, and except as 
laid down in
 that section
            the drawer of a dishonoured cheque has no liability. This

            is because the whole law as to cheques is contained in
            that Act and the only section dealing with the liability of
            the drawer of a cheque is
 S. 30
. The section provides
            that the drawer of a cheque shall be liable to compensate
            the holder in case of dishonour "provided due notice of
            dishonour has been given to, or received by, the drawer
            as hereinafter provided." 
Sections 91
 to 
98
 of the Act lay
            down the provisions relating to the manner of the giving
            of the notice of dishonour and the cases where the
            giving of the notice is excused. The only way therefore
            in which liability on a cheque may arise is when (1) the
            cheque is dishonoured and (2) notice of such dishonour
            has been given or circumstances exist which render it
            unnecessary to give such notice. It is not a case where if
            no provisions as to notice of dishonour had been laid
            down, a right would have arisen in the holder on the
            dishonour of the cheque and where the only effect of
            those provisions is to prevent such right from springing
            up. The notice of dishonour as the law as to cheques
            stands is a part of the cause of action on a dishonoured
            cheque.
 In Fruhauf v. Grosvenor and Co., (1892) 67 I. T.
            350: (61 L. J. Q. B. 717), Lord Coleridge C. J.,
            expressed himself in these words:



            "The obligation upon the drawer of a cheque to pay does
            not arise until notice of dishonour thereof has been
            given to him, and therefore the statement of the case
            against the defendant here is not full and complete
            without either an allegation of notice of dishonour of the
            cheque having been given to the defendant the drawer of
            it, or of facts excusing the plaintiff from giving such
            notice."



            It was decided in this case that in the absence of the
            allegations as to the notice of dishonour, the plaint on a
            dishonoured cheque would not disclose a cause of
            action."

                21. We respectfully agree with the above view. In the
                case before us, if we apply the above principles, the
                permission of the Charity Commissioner is not of the
                essence of a cause of action, but it has been made
                essential. It is an additional formality superimposed
                which prevents the right or obligation which would have
                otherwise sprung out from those facts from springing
                out. Thus, by taking aid of the above decision it cannot
                be legitimately contended that grant of permission is the
                cause of action like dishonour of a cheque in an action
                for dishonour of cheque; on the other hand, it is a
                condition precedent for enforcement of the right which
                is the subject-matter of the suit and thus, Order 6 Rule 6
                clearly applies."



16. From the above conspectus of law, it emerges                    that while

considering the Order VII Rule 11 of the Code only the averment

made in the plaint is required to be considered along with the

documents produced with the plaint and it has to be borne out from

the facts of the case that the entire suit is barred by law including the

limitation and no cause of action could be disclosed from the

averments made in the plaint.





17. In the facts of the case however it is difficult to come to the

conclusion that there is no cause of action averred in the plaint, more

particularly, in view of the events which have taken place from 1983

till 1999 before filing the suit i.e. from the date of Agreement for

Sale till date of filing of the suit as it is reflected from the averments

as well as the documents annexed with the plaint which requires

scrutiny on merits after giving opportunity to the both the sides to

lead the evidence. 
In such circumstances, reliance placed by learned

In

Dahiben vs Arvindbhai Kalyanji Bhanusali

Court has held that it was a case of a classic clever drafting of the

plaint attempted to make out an illusionary cause of action and bring

the suit within the period of limitation whereas in the facts of the

case, even if the subsequent amendments are not taken into

consideration, it cannot be said that it is case of clever drafting

inasmuch as the averments made in the plaint requires to be

considered after providing an opportunity to both the sides to lead

the evidence.

                                                                                undefined

the plaint as the specific remedy was provided under the provisions

of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 and there was

inordinate delay of 15 years in challenging the action of the bank, in

such circumstances, it was held by the Apex Court that the suit was

barred by law under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Whereas in the

present case, merely because it is alleged by the defendant that the

suit is barred by law as the Agreement for Sale is prior to the date of

registration of the plaintiff-society, the suit could not have been

rejected as such contention is      required to be tested by leading

evidence.





18. In view of the foregoing reasons, the impugned order passed by

the Principal Senior Civil Judge, Amreli dated 05.08.2021 below

Exhibit 205 is hereby quashed and set aside without adjudicating as

application Exh 243 and dismissing the suit by allowing the

application Exh 205 which was already dismissed earlier. As the suit

is of the year 1999, the Trial Court is directed to decide the same as

expeditiously as possible preferably within 12 months from the date

of receipt of order after giving an opportunity of leading evidence to

both the sides without being influenced by any observation made in

the impugned order passed below Exh 205 as well as the order

passed by this Court. Appeal stands partly allowed accordingly in

terms of the aforesaid directions.





19. Registry to send back records and proceedings of the case to

the Trial Court forthwith.





20. In view of the disposal of the appeal, Civil Application would

not survive. The same is disposed of.
