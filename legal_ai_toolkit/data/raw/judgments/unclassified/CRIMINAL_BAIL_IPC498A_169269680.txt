                           Heard with the aid of case diary.

                           This is First application of the applicant Smt. Saroj Singh filed

                     Act.

                            As per prosecution case on 24.06.2019 deceased Nidhi Singh wife
                     of co-accused Uday Bhan Singh committed suicide by hanging herself. It
                     is alleged that applicant Smt. Saroj Singh, mother-in-law and co-accused
                     Uday Bhan Singh, husband of the deceased demanded one fridge and one
                     box and harass her and co-accused Uday Bhan Singh assaulted her due to
                     which she committed suicide.

                            Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant is innocent
                     and has falsely been implicated in the offence. The applicant is mother-
                     in-law of the deceased Nidhi Singh. The allegation regarding demand of
                     dowry are general in nature. Charge sheet has been filed. The applicant
                     is in custody since 08.07.2019 and the conclusion of trial is likely to take
                     long time, hence prayed for release of the applicant on bail.

                            Learned counsel for the State opposed the prayer and submitted
                     that applicant is mother-in-law of the deceased who harassed the
                     deceased Nidhi Singh, due to which, she committed suicide within six
                     months of her marriage. So, she should not be released on bail.

                            Looking to fact and circumstances of the case and the fact that the
                     applicant is mother-in-law of the deceased Nidhi Singh and the
                     allegation of demand of dowry are general in nature, charge sheet has
                     been filed, applicant is in custody since 08.07.2019 and conclusion of
                     trial will take time, without commenting on the merits of the case, the
                     application is allowed and it is directed that the applicant Smt. Saroj
                     Singh be released on bail upon her furnishing personal bond in the sum of
                     Rs.50,000/- (Rs. Fifty Thousand Only) with one surety in the like
                     amount to the satisfaction of the concerned C.J.M/trial Court for her
