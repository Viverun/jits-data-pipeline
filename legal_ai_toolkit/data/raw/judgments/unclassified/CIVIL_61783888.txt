                            4.    The plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010 are briefly as follows:-

                                                                                 A.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023

                            4.1. The suit properties are situated in Mulligrampattu village near

                  Nellikuppam in Cuddalore District. The Plaintiffs 1 to 6 and the Defendant-1

                  are the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa.                The suit properties were originally

                  purchased by K.M.Hanifa through a registered sale deed dated 07.04.1969 for

                  valuable consideration and he was in possession and enjoyment of the

                  properties till his death. The revenue records – patta, chitta and adangal are in

                  the name of K.M.Hanifa. K.M.Hanifa died intestate on 21.01.1997 leaving

                  behind him, his wife/first Plaintiff, the sons and daughters/Plaintiff 2 to 6 and

                  the first Defendant as legal heirs. While so, the Plaintiffs came to know that

                  the second Defendant had instituted a suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 against the

                  first Defendant as though the first Defendant had entered into a sale agreement

                  deed with the second Defendant to sell the suit properties to the second

                  Defendant. The suit in O.S.No. 34 of 2009 was alleged to have filed seeking

                  relief of specific performance of contract for sale against the first Defendant by

                  the second Defendant. The Plaintiffs 1 to 6 are not parties to the said sale

                  agreement deed. The alleged sale agreement deed will not bind the Plaintiffs 1

                  to 6. The second Defendant attempted to interfere with the possession of the

                  Plaintiffs. Therefore, the Plaintiffs were forced to file the suit in O.S.No. 252

                  of 2009 seeking declaration that the suit properties belong to the Plaintiffs and

                  the first Defendant and also the Plaintiffs had filed the suit in O.S.No.20 of

                  2010 seeking partition. The first Plaintiff/wife of K.M.Hanifa is entitled to 1/8

                  share, sons of K.M.Hanifa are entitled to 2/3rd shares and the daughters are

                  entitled to 1/3 share. Therefore, the Plaintiffs are collectively entitled to 58/72

                  shares. The first Defendant is entitled to 14/72 share. Therefore, the Plaintiffs

                  1 to 6 seeking preliminary decree for partition of their 58/72 shares. The first

                  Defendant remains ex parte in the suit.





                            5.    The brief averments in the written statement filed by the second

                  Defendant are as follows:



                            5.1. The suite preferred by the Plaintiffs is not maintainable and

                  therefore, the suit is to be dismissed. The second Defendant denied the claim

                  made by the Plaintiffs.       The second Defendant had instituted the suit in

                  O.S.No.34 of 2009 against the first Defendant seeking specific performance of

                  contract for sale of the property. On coming to know of the pendency of the

                  suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009, the Plaintiffs have filed the suit in O.S.No.20 of

                  2010 to create complications. The suit properties belong to K.M.Hanifa. After

                  the death of K.M.Hanifa, the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 and the first Defendant,who are

                  the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa, are entitled to share in the property.                           The

                  daughters of K.M.Hanifa were married off and they are living with their

                  husbands. The fourth Plaintiff, son of K.M.Hanifa, is living abroad. The first

                  Defendant is taking care of the properties on behalf of the family of the

                  deceased K.M.Hanifa. The first Defendant had executed a sale agreement deed


                  5/46

                                                                                     A.S.Nos.555 of 2022, 445 & 446 of 2023

                  dated 17.07.1997 with this second Defendant. The first Defendant also agreed

                  to execute the sale deed on return of his brother from abroad and also

                  undertake to execute the sale deed along with other legal heirs. Subsequently,

                  he had entered into sale agreement deed on 15.03.1999 agreeing to execute the

                  sale deed along with other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. The Defendant-1 did not

                  execute the sale deed as per his undertaking in the sale agreement deed dated

                  15.03.1999.           Therefore, he had executed a sale agreement deed dated

                  11.10.2004 and also a fresh sale agreement deed dated 06.12.2006. He had not

                  executed the sale deed as per his undertaking. Therefore, the second Defendant

                  had instituted the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 seeking specific performance of

                  contract for sale of the property. To create multiplicity of proceedings, the

                  Plaintiffs 1 to 6 had filed the suit in O.S.No.20 of 2010 seeking partition

                  without exhausting the remedy in the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 filed by the

                  second Defendant against the first Defendant. This Court cannot consider the

                  granting relief of partition to the Plaintiff. There is no cause of action for

                  instituting the suit. The suit is not maintainable and is to be dismissed.




                            6.    Based on the pleadings in the plaint and in the written statement,

                  the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, had framed

                  the following issues:



                                  (i)      Whether the suit properties are the joint family

                            properties of the Plaintiffs and the first Defendant?

                                  (ii) Whether the suit as framed is maintainable?

                                  (iii) Whether the Plaintiffs 1 to 6 are entitled to claim 58/72
                            share in the suit property?

                                  (iv)   Whether the Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief of
                            partition?

                                  (v) To what other reliefs the Plaintiffs are entitled to?




                            7.    Originally the suit was filed as O.S.No. 34 of 2009 by the second

                  Defendant in O.S.No.20 of 2010 against the first Defendant in O.S.No. 20 of

                  2010 on the file of the learned Sub Judge, Panruti which was re-numbered as

                  O.S.No.19 of 2015 on transfer to the learned I Additional District and Sessions

                  Judge, Cuddalore.





                            8.    The plaint averments in O.S.No.19 of 2015 are briefly as follows:


                            8.1. On 06.12.2006 the Plaintiff entered into sale agreement with the

                  Defendant for execution of the sale deed for the suit property agreeing to

                  execute the sale deed for Rs.2,50,000/-.                        On the date of agreement,

                  Rs.2,30,000/- was paid by the Plaintiff, for the balance of sale consideration of

                  Rs.20,000/-, the Defendant agreed to execute sale deed within the stipulated

                  time. Since the Plaintiff was ready and willing to perform his part of the

                  contract for payment of Rs.20,000/- and the Defendant did not come forward to

                  execute the sale deed within the stipulated period, the Plaintiff was forced to

                  file the suit for specific performance against the Defendant. If the Defendant

                  failed to execute the sale deed, the Court shall execute the sale in favour of the

                  Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had already paid Rs.2,30,000/- on the date of sale

                  agreement deed. The Defendant agreed to execute sale deed along with other

                  legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. As the Defendant did not come forward to execute

                  the sale deed, the Plaintiff had issued legal notice dated 25.06.2008 calling

                  upon the Defendant to execute the sale deed. On receipt of the said notice, the

                  Defendant had disputed the claim of the Plaintiff and sent reply with vexatious

                  contents. Therefore, the suit had been filed by the Plaintiff seeking the relief of

                  specific performance of contract for sale of the property. The suit is to be

                  decreed as prayed for.





                            9.    The contents of the written statement filed by the Defendant are

                  briefly as follows:



                            9.1. The suit as framed is not maintainable. The Defendant disputed

                  the claim of the Plaintiff. The Defendant has no intention to encumber the

                  properties. The sale agreement is a fraudulent deed. The Defendant had not

                  received any amount from the Plaintiff.                 The suit property was originally

                  belonged to the father of the Defendant K.M.Hanifa.                          He purchased the

                  property in the year 1997 and was in enjoyment of the same. After the death of

                  K.M.Hanifa, the suit properties were enjoyed by the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa.

                  The claim of the Plaintiff that the Defendant claiming to be the head of the

                  joint family is not true. In Mohammedan Law, there is no concept of joint

                  family.         Also the Plaintiff did not know the wherewithal to purchase the

                  property. The suit property is worth about Rs.25,00,000/- as on the date of

                  filling of the suit. The suit property is in enjoyment of the legal heirs of

                  K.M.Hanifa. The alleged sale agreement deed is a self-serving document

                  created by the Plaintiff.          The Plaintiff had obtained the signature of the

                  Defendant in a blank sheet of paper and had subsequently created alleged sale

                  agreement deed. The suit is filed with an evil intention to grab the property of

                  K.M.Hanifa. The Defendant has a share in the suit property along with the

                  Plaintiffs 1 to 6 in O.S.No.20 of 2010. The Plaintiff is aware of the same. Still

                  he had filed the suit seeking specific performance of contract for sale which is

                  not maintainable.





                            10.     Based on the pleadings in the plaint and the written statement of

                  the Defendant, the following issues were framed by the learned I Additional

                  District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore:-



                                    (i)    Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the relief of
                            specific performance of contract for sale?

                                    (ii)   To what relief the Plaintiff is entitled to?

                            11.   Since the properties in both the suits are one and the same, both

                  the suits were taken up for joint trial. The Defendants 1 and 2 in O.S.No.20 of

                            19.   Earlier, the Defendant-2 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 had filed suit in

                  the Plaintiff Ramu was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract.

                  of 2010 was denied by him. He had admitted that even during the lifetime of

                  K.M.Hanifa, the Plaintiff Ramu was cultivating the suit property as a tenant.

                  Even after the death of K.M.Hanifa, he was still cultivating the property.

                  Therefore, the finding of the trial Court is erroneous and the same is to be set

                  aside.





                            24.    In support of his submissions, the learned Counsel for the

                  Appellant Mr.R.Muralidharan relied on the following decisions:


 
(i) In 
2023-1-L.W. 777 [U.Venkatesan vs. Susila & Others

Section 12
 of Specific Relief Act enables the Court to grant
                            specific performance in respect of a part of contract in respect of
                            situations covered under sub-sections [2], [3] and [4]. In the present
                            case, the execution of Agreement by defendants 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 is not
                            in dispute. Therefore, the contract as such, is valid in respect of 8/9th
                            share which is enforceable against defendants 1 to 5 and 7 to 9. When
                            the contract is held to be valid and binding on defendants 1 to 5 and 7
                            to 9 except the 6th defendant who is entitled to only 1/9th share, there
                            is no impediment for the Court to grant specific performance, if the
                            plaintiff has otherwise proved his readiness and willingness and entitled
                            to a decree for specific performance in respect of the undivided share of
                            defendants 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 in respect of their 8/9th share. Hence,

                            “13. What remains to be considered is the other contention of the
                            learned Counsel for the appellants that the plaintiff herself has claimed
                            the alternative relief for refund of advance amount and damages and
                            hence the grant of decree of specific performance by the Trial Court is
                            unjust tothe first defendant. In this connection, reliance was placed on
                            the following decisions of the Supreme Court:

 
1. 
S. Rangaraju Naidu Vs. S. Thiruvarakkarasu
, and


 
2. 
Kanshi Ram Vs. Om Prakash Jawal and others
, .


 
In the first decision cited, since the borrower was not in a
                            position to pay the amount due on promissory note, he entered into an
                            agreement to sell his property and the agreement was sought for to be
                            enforced and in those circumstances, the Apex Court held that
                            predominant object would be for recovery of dues with interest and
                            hence the Court is not bound to grant specific performance and in that
                            view of the matter, granted the alternative relief. In the second decision
                            cited, the plaintiff had claimed specific performance and in the
                            alternative, a sum of Rs. 12,000/- as damages and the defendant offered
                            a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs as an alternative relief and in those
                            circumstances, the Apex Court held that the relief of specific
                            performance was inequitable and awarded the alternative relief. The
                            above decisions would not apply to the facts and circumstances of the
                            present case. As rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel for
                            the first defendant, the alternative plea of refund of advance amount
                            and damages cannot itself be a bar to claim a decree for specific
                            performance of the contract, as held by the Apex Court in the decision
                            in 
Motilal Jain v. Smt. Ramdasi Devi and Ors.
 (2000) 3 M.L.J. 202
                            (S.C.) and in the decision of the Supreme Court in P.C. Varghese,
                            referred above.”


                            25.    The learned Counsel for the Respondents 1 to 6 Mr. R. Rajavelan,

                  submitted his argument on behalf of the Respondents. The Appellant herein as

                  Plaintiff had filed the suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 before the learned Sub Judge,

                  Panruti against Nazeer Ahamed alone (Respondent in A.S.No.446 of 2023 and

                  Respondent 7 in A.S.No.445 of 2023 also in A.S.No.555 of 2022). The suit in

                  O.S. No. 34 of 2009 was filed by the Appellant herein as Plaintiff seeking

                  specific performance of contract based on an unregistered agreement for sale

                  Rs.2,50,000/-.   The Plaintiff had paid Rs.2,30,000/- as advance.                        Nazeer

                  Ahamed agreed to execute the sale deed after receipt of Rs.20,000/- within a

                  period of 2 years. Also he agreed that he being the elder son of K.M.Hanifa,

                  and on behalf of other family members, to execute the sale deed and major

                  portion of sale consideration having been accepted, possession of the property

                  was handed over to the Plaintiff. Nazeer Ahamed filed written statement

                  denying execution of agreement for sale but remained ex parte before the trial

                  Court. Having come to know about the same, the mother and siblings of

                  and 555 of 2022 had filed the suit in O.S. No.20 of 2010 before the learned

                  his favour by Ganapathi Pillai. K.M.Hanifa was in possession and enjoyment

                  of the said property till his death by effecting mutation of revenue records.

                  K.M.Hanifa died intestate on 21.09.1997 leaving behind him his widow, three

                  where he undertook to execute sale deed with all other co-sharers and it could

                  not be completed. Therefore, subsequent sale agreements were executed on

                  the suit for specific performance and the suit was filed by the mother and other

                  siblings of Nazeer Ahamed at the instigation of Nazeer Ahamed.




                            26.   The suit in O.S.No.34 of 2009 was withdrawn and transferred to

                  the file of the I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, to be tried

                  the claim of specific performance was refused by the learned Additional

                  District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore on the ground that the execution of

                  agreement for sale dated 06.12.2006 by Nazeer Ahamed alone is invalid since

                  the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 who are the other legal heirs of deceased

                  K.M.Hanifa have got shares over the suit property.                        However, refund of

                            29.   By observing above and relying upon Ex.A-1, the learned I

                  Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, had come to the conclusion

                  that the agreement for sale dated 06.12.2006 will not bind the other legal heirs

                  of K.M.Hanif, Respondents 1 to 6 thereby declined the main relief of specific

                  performance of contract for sale of the property but granted the alternate relief

                  of refund of advance amount of Rs.2,30,000/- with interest at the rate of 6%

                  per annum from the date of plaint till the date of recovery.




                            30.   Hence, the said unregistered agreement for sale is invalid,

                  unenforceable since Nazeer Ahamed, who had executed the agreement

                  regarding the entire property of 3 acres 44 cents did not have the absolute title

                  of the property. On perusal of the sale agreement, it reads as if he does not

                  have absolute right over the property and it reads as if he alone is the legal heir

                  of K.M.Hanifa. The Respondents 1 to 6, who are widow, 3 sons and 3

                  daughters were not referred in the sale agreement at all. The signature of the

                  Respondents were not obtained in the sale agreement deed. The agreement is

                  not executable as the same is barred by 
Section 17
 of Specific Relief Act. In

                  fact, it is fraudulent on the face of it.

In this nexus, the Respondents 1 to 6 (Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of

                          “33. .... It is an undisputed fact that the plaintiffs have not approached the
                          Trial Court with clean hands. It is evident from the pleadings of the

                          performance of Agreement of Sale as the plaintiffs did not obtain the

                  portion highlighted in yellow sketch in the plan to the extent of 0.63 cents was

                  allotted to Nazeer Ahamed. Under the said final decree, the Plaintiffs as

                  Petitioners in the final decree were permitted to draw water from the mortar

                  pump set for 5 days in the week and Nazeer Ahamed was given permission to

                  draw water for 2 days and 0.1½ cents have been earmarked for use as common

                  pathway for both parties. The claim of the Appellant Ramu that 14/72 share of

                  Nazeer Ahamed equivalent to 0.63 cents having been allotted in the final

                  decree can be allotted in his favour cannot be countenanced as the agreement

                  for sale under Ex.A-1 suffers from suppression of material facts of other legal

                  heirs of deceased K.M.Hanifa. There is no transfer of interest in immovable

                  property under Ex.A-1 agreement for sale and it does not by itself create any

                  interest or charge on such property according to 
Section 54
 of the Transfer of

                  Property Act, 1882.          For this proposition, the learned Counsel for the

                  Respondent rely on the reported decision in 2021 (1) MWN (Civil) 316 (SC)

                  [Venigalla Koteswaramma vs. Malampati Suryamba and others] wherein it is

                  held as under:



                          “39. Apart from the above, it is also fundamental, as per 
Section 54
 of the
                          Transfer of Property Act, 1882, that an agreement for sale of immoveable
                          property does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such
                          property vide Bank of India v. Abhay D. Narottam and others, 2005 (11)

Transfer of Property Act
 that reads as under: -

                          “54. “Sale” defined.- “Sale” is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a
                          price paid or promised or part-paid and part- promised.



                          Sale how made.- Such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable
                          property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of
                          a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered
                          instrument.



                          In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one
                          hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registered
                          instrument or by delivery of the property. Delivery of tangible
                          immoveable property takes place when the seller places the buyer, or such
                          person as he directs, in possession of the property.



                          Contract for sale.- A contract for the sale of immoveable property is a
                          contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled
                          between the parties.



                          It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property.”

                          39.1. It goes without saying that the alleged agreement for sale did not
                          invest the vendee with title to, or any interest in, the property in question;

                          and the alleged agreement for sale did not invest the vendee with any such
                          right that the plaintiff could not have maintained her claim for partition in
                          respect of the properties left by Annapurnamma without seeking
                          declaration against the agreement. Therefore, this plea about non-
                          maintainability of suit for want for relief of declaration against the said
                          agreement for sale remains totally baseless and could only be rejected.”


 
33.   Further, the learned Counsel for the Respondents 1 to 6 submitted

                  that such claim is not legally enforceable as the sale agreement dated

                  06.12.2006 under Ex.A-1 remains unregistered which is inadmissible for

                  seeking protection under 
Section 53 (A)
 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882

                  though it can be received in evidence. This is in view of 
Section 17
(1-
A) of

                  the Registration Act, 1908

                            of which relief of specific performance has been claimed, could be

                                   It is amply clear that the document containing contract to

                            consideration is required to be registered, if the party wants to rely on

                  mandatory for the Appellant to prove that possession is referred in agreement.

                  emption which is termed as right of Shuffa under the Mohammedan Law. The

                  object of the right of Shuffa is to avoid inconvenience arising from introduction

                  of stranger as co-owner. Under the Sunni Law a co-owner (Shafi-Sharik) can

                  Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore.





                            38.   On perusal of the common judgment dated 29.04.2017 passed in

                  O.S.No.20 of 2010 and O.S.No.19 of 2015, the order dated 28.04.2022 passed

                  in I.A.No.2 of 2018 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and from the cross examination of

                  D.W-1, the Plaintiff-6 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 as D.W-1 in O.S.No.19 of 2015,

                  Ramu was a tenant under K.M.Hanifa and continued to be tenant under the

                  legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. Therefore, he is aware of the details of the property

                  regarding ownership. He is aware that K.M.Hanifa died and his legal heirs are

                  the owners of the property. While so, the Plaintiff Ramu entering into sale

                  agreement with the elder son of K.M.Hanifa by name Nazeer Ahamed who is

                  the Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 (suit for partition) and the sole

                  Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015 seeking the relief of specific performance of

                  contract for sale of the property is found fraudulent. Also it is an unregistered

                  sale agreement deed. From the marking of documents, Ex.A-2 to Ex.A-7, it is

                  found that Ex.A-4 to Ex.A-6 are the earlier sale agreement deeds between

                  Nazeer Ahamed and the Plaintiff Ramu. What was the reason for getting fresh

                  sale agreement in Ex.A-4 on 17.07.1997. Again as per Ex.A-5, he had entered

                  into sale agreement deed dated 15.03.1999. Again he had entered another

                  agreement with Nazeer Ahamed as per Ex.A-6 dated 11.10.2004. So, there

                  were four (4) sale agreement deeds. Ex.A-1 is the sale agreement deed dated

                  06.12.2006, based on which the suit was filed. Since the Plaintiff had not

                  approached the Court with clean hands, the Civil Court had granted relief

                  based on principles of fairness, equity and good conscience. The Plaintiff

                  cannot be granted the relief of specific performance of contract. The suit

                  property is an extent of 3 acres and 44 cents for which the sale agreement was

                  obtained. From one of the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa leaving behind him, the

                  Plaintiffs and first Defendant in O.S.No.20 of 2010. Not only that,

                  Mohammedan Law does not have the principles of joint family which is

                  restricted only to Hindu Joint Family. Therefore, the claim in plaint in

                  O.S.No.19 of 2015 that there are no recitals that Nazeer Ahamed is entering

                  into sale agreement deed on behalf of all the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. Also

                  as rightly pointed out by the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,

                  the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015, Ramu had not obtained any authorisation

                  letter authorising Nazeer Ahamed to act on their behalf to enter into contract

                  regarding the property. While so, knowing fully well that K.M.Hanifa died, his

                  legal heirs have right over the property, the Plaintiff Ramu allegedly entering

                  into sale agreement deed dated 06.12.2006 with only one heir as per Ex.A-1 is

                  found unenforceable. After having paid Rs.2,30,000/- out of the total sale price

                  of Rs.2,50,000/-, for the balance consideration of Rs.20,000/-, time stipulated

                  for payment of the balance amount for a period of one year is found fraudulent.

                  The Plaintiff Ramu is not entitled even for refund of the advance amount paid,

                  Rs.2,30,000/-.     Still the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,

                  Cuddalore had granted alternate relief instead of dismissing the suit. Therefore,

                  the judgment of the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge decreeing

                  the suit for specific performance, at the same time, granting alternate relief of

                  refund of the advance amount is found just and proper. The grounds raised in

                  the grounds of Appeals that the judgment is not proper and is to be set aside is

                  found unacceptable. The grant of alternate relief in O.S.No.19 of 2015 is found

                  justified.





                            39.   The Plaintiff Ramu examined as P.W-1 and marked documents

                  under Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-7. The Plaintiff Ramu was cross examined. In the cross

                  examination, the Plaintiff Ramu admits that he was aware that K.M.Hanifa

                  died leaving behind him, his wife, three daughters and three sons as legal heirs.

                  He had admitted clearly that he had not sought specific performance against the

                  other legal heirs. He had also not attempted to interfere the contract of specific

                  performance based on the earlier agreements in 2004, 1999 and 1997. He had

                  admitted in all the earlier sale agreements that he had not obtained any

                  signature from the other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. He had stated that the one

                  year period for execution of the sale deed was agreed. Considering the fact that

                  the one of the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa was not in India, on his return, Nazeer

                  Ahamed claimed to execut the sale deed. Therefore one year period was

                  granted.





                            40.   The suggestion of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs in

                  O.S.No.20 of 2010 that the sale agreement deed is fraudulent deed as the

                  Plaintiff Ramu had not obtained any signature from other legal heirs of

                  K.M.Hanifa was denied by the Plaintiff. The learned Judge had considered

                  those facts while assessing the evidence of Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015

                  thereby refused to grant the relief of specific performance of contract for sale

                  of the property.





                            41.   On perusal of Ex.A-1 unregistered sale agreement deed dated

                  06.12.2006 marked in O.S.No.19 of 2015, only the name of Nazeer Ahamed is

                  found as one of the parties to sale agreement. As per the sale deed dated

                  07.04.1969, which is marked as Ex.B-1, K.M.Hanifa purchased the property.

                  As per Ex.B-2 the kist paid in the name of the K.M.Hanifa dated 07.01.2010.

                  Ex.B-3 is the legal heirship certificate issued to the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa

                  in the name of the Plaintiffs and Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 is found

                  true. Under those circumstances, the Court has to necessarily grant preliminary

                  decree for partition as per the plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010. The

                  claim of the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 is proved by the evidence of D.W-

                  1 in O.S.No.19 of 2015. Instead of Nazeer Ahamed, the sole Defendant in

                  O.S.No.19 of 2015 who remained ex parte, the same Defendant as the

                  Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010, he did not enter the witness box. Instead,

                  6th Plaintiff in O.S.No.20 of 2010 had examined himself as D.W-1 in

                  O.S.No.19 of 2015. The plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and the written

                  statement in O.S.No.19 of 2015 was stated in the affidavit filed as examination

                  in chief. The plaint averments in O.S.No.20 of 2010 was put as suggestion to

                  D.W-1.





                            42.   On perusal of the Ex.A-1, the sale agreement deed dated

                  06.12.2006 there is no mention of sole Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015. The

                  recitals under Ex.A-1 does not mention that Nazeer Ahamed has entered into

                  sale agreement on behalf of other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa. Also, the conduct

                  of the sole Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015, Nazeer Ahamed not entering

                  witness box and remained ex parte gives strong presumption against the

                  Defendants. For 3 acres and 34 cents, a meagre amount of Rs.2,50,000/- was

                  fixed. This is also a suspicious circumstance. Therefore, the learned I

                  Additional District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore, granted relief based on

                  fairness, equity and good conscience and not exercising the discretion in favour

                  of Plaintiff Ramu in O.S.No.19 of 2015. The discussion of evidence by the

                  learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge is well reasoned, since one of

                  the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa entered into sale agreement with Plaintiff Ramu

                  is found to be fraudulent deed. Still the learned I Additional District and

                  Sessions Judge had granted relief of refund of advance amount of Rs.2,30,000/-

                  against which the Plaintiff Ramu who had preferred Appeal in A.S.No.446 of

                  2023. When Plaintiff Ramu had not approached the Court with clean hands, the

                  Court need not grant any relief in favour of the Defendant-2 in O.S.No.20 of

                  2010.





                            43.   On analysing evidence, the learned trial Judge had arrived at a

                  conclusion that the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 are entitled to one share for

                  each of the daughters and two shares for the sons. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs

                  were granted 58/72 shares. Therefore, the shares entitled to Plaintiffs 1 to 6

                  was calculated as 58/72 shares.





                            44.   On proper appreciation of evidence and on perusal of documents

                  under Ex.A-1 to Ex.A-7 and Ex.B-1 to Ex.B-4, the learned Judge had granted

                  the preliminary decree to the Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010. The facts and

                  circumstances of the case as gathered from records, invoking the

                  Mohammedan Law and Mohammedan Law of Succession, the Plaintiff cannot

                  seek invocation of Hindu Law invoking the principles of joint family and on

                  basis of the joint family, the elder son of K.M.Hanifa/Defendant Nazeer

                  Ahamed entered into sale agreement with Plaintiff Ramu cannot be accepted.

                  Therefore, as rightly pointed out when the sale agreement entered into only

                  with Nazeer Ahamed, the elder son of K.M.Hanifa, by the Plaintiff is found not

                  fair. It was considered as fraudulent, then the Plaintiff is not entitled to any

                  relief under the 
Specific Relief Act
. The suit ought to have been dismissed.

                  Instead the learned Judge had granted relief of refund of advance amount in

                  O.S.No.19 of 2015 whereas the learned Judge had granted preliminary decree

                  for partition of the Plaintiffs share as 58/72.                The learned Judge granted

                  preliminary decree to the Plaintiffs as 58 / 72 is not found erroneous. It is a

                  well reasoned judgment that does not warrant any interference by this Court.





                            45.   In A.S.No.555 of 2022 also, the Appellant/Defendant-2 in

                  O.S.No. 20 of 2010 seeking to set aside the final decree date 28.04.2022 passed

                  District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore is found unacceptable as the learned

                  trial Judge had passed final decree in continuation of the preliminary decree.

                  The Advocate Commissioner was appointed and surveyed the property with the

                  in continuation of the preliminary decree for partition to the Plaintiffs.




                            46.   During argument, the learned Counsel for the Appellant in

                  A.S.No.555 of 2022 submitted that if the Court arrives at a conclusion that

                  Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 are entitled to 58 /72 shares, then this Court

                  exercising discretion shall pass judgment granting the relief of specific

                  performance for the share of the Defendant-1/Nazeer Ahamed in O.S.No.20 of

                  2010. This is also found unenforceable as the other legal heirs are not willing

                  to encumber the properties. The granting of the discretionary relief of specific

                  performance of sale of the property in O.S.No.19 of 2015 and restraining the

                  share of the Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010 cannot be granted, since the

                  other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa had objected to the sale agreement entered into

                  with the Defendant-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010.

                  examination of the 6th Plaintiff H.Sadiq Basha as D.W-1 in O.S.No.20 of 2010

                  that the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 Ramu was a tenant cultivating the lands

                  prior to the death of K.M.Hanifa and till the date of trial as a tenant. Therefore,

                  he has personal knowledge of the details of the family of K.M.Hanifa. While

                  so, if he has bona fide intention of purchasing the property, he ought to have

                  entered into agreement of sale with all the legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa, the

                  Plaintiffs in O.S.No. 20 of 2010. Earlier to that, he had obtained and ex parte

                  decree for specific performance of contract against the sole Defendant Nazeer

                  Ahamed, one of the legal heirs of the deceased K.M.Hanifa and the elder son

                  of K.M.Kanifa. As per the evidence, Ex.A-4 dated 17.07.1997 is the earliest

                  agreement entered into with Nazeer Ahamed. Ex.A-5 the same sale agreement

                  renewed on 15.03.1999. Ex.A-6 again the same sale agreement renewed as on

                  11.10.2004. Ex.A-7 is the suit filed by the Plaintiff in O.S.No.20 of 2010 for

                  injunction against the Plaintiff Ramu before the learned District Munsif in

                  O.S.No. 252 of 2009.        Therefore, Ex.A-4 to Ex.A-6 are the prior sale

                  agreement deeds entered into with the sole Defendant in O.S.No.19 of 2015 by

                  the Plaintiff Ramu who also happens to be the tenant of the of the family of the

                  deceased K.M.Hanifa. Ex.A-1 is the latest sale agreement date 06.12.2006

                  which is pressed into service in O.S.No.19 of 2015. When the Plaintiffs in

                  O.S.No.20 of 2010 came to know about the ex parte decree regarding specific

                  performance, they made enquiries and found out that the Plaintiff in O.S.No.

                  19 of 2015 had obtained ex parte decree in O.S.No.34 of 2009 before the

                  learned Sub Judge, Panruti. Therefore, the Plaintiffs in O.S.No. 20 of 2010

                  were forced to file the suit seeking partition against the elder son of

                  K.M.Hanifa, the first Defendant in O.S. No.20 of 2010. Only after filing the

                  suit, they had sought transfer of the suit in O.S. No.34 of 2009 for joint trial in

                  O.S.No. 20 of 2010 by filing transfer application before the learned Principal

                  District and Sessions Judge, Cuddalore. After setting aside the ex parte decree

                  in O.S.No. 34 of 2009 only the suit was ordered on transfer to the learned I

                  Additional District and Sessions Judge to be tried along with O.S.No. 20 of

                  2010. Meanwhile, before filing the suit for partition, the Plaintiff in O.S.No.

                  20 of 2010 had filed O.S.No. 252 of 2009 before the learned Principal District

                  Munsif, Panruti, seeking declaration that the suit schedule mentioned property

                  is the undivided property of Plaintiffs as well as the second Defendant in

                  O.S.No. 252 of 2009 and seeking permanent injunction restraining the first

                  Defendant Ramu from interfering with the peaceful possession and the

                  enjoyment of the suit property. Since suit in O.S.No.20 of 2010 and the suit in

                  O.
S. 19
 of 2015 (O.S.No.34 of 2009) were tried together, the suit in

                  O.S.No.252 of 2009 was not taken up along with this suit. From the evidence,

                  in the joint trial in O.S. No. 19 of 2015 and O.S.No.20 of 2010, it is found that

                  the Plaintiff Ramu in O.S.No. 19 of 2015 was a tenant under the Plaintiffs and

                  prior to them under K.M.Hanifa and he had entered into agreement of sale in

                  the year 1997 immediately after the death of K.M.Hanifa for sale of the

                  property. That shows that he was not fair. He had obtained sale agreement

                  with only one of parties and not from all the legal heirs. A Civil Court grants

                  relief under the 
Specific Relief Act
 only to those who approach the Court with

                  clean hands. Here, he had played fraud on the other legal heirs of K.M.Hanifa

                  by putting them in the dark.






                            48.   The Plaintiffs in O.S.No.20 of 2010 were surprised to know that

                  Nazeer Ahamed, the elder son of K.M.Hanifa, had entered into sale agreement,

                  with the Plaintiff Ramu, based on that, the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 had

                  obtained an ex parte decree which forced them to file the suit seeking

                  injunction against the Ramu before the learned Principal District Munsif under

                  Ex.A-7 (O.S.No.252 of 2009). Subsequently, they had filed a suit in O.S.No.

                  20 of 2010 seeking partition against Nazeer Ahamed, the elder son of

                  K.M.Hanifa. Also they had filed a petition to set aside the ex parte decree and

                  to implead themselves as Defendants in O.S.No. 19 of 2015 to set aside the ex

                  pare decree in O.S.No.34 of 2009 before the learned Sub Judge, Panruti and

                  also simultaneously filing the Transfer Original Petition seeking transfer

                  Judge wherein they had filed a suit for partition. Therefore, both the suits were

All the sale agreements are

                  refusing to grant the relief of specific performance of contract for sale in favour

                  of the Plaintiff in O.S.No.19 of 2015 and instead granting the alternate relief of

                  refund of advance amount is four proper. It is a well reasoned judgment which

                  does not warrant any interference by this Court exercising discretion under

                  Section 96 and 
Order XLI of C.P.C
.                           Accordingly, the point for

                  determination in A.S.No.446 of 2023 is answered in favour of the Plaintiffs

                  in O.S.No.20 of 2010/Respondents herein and against the Plaintiff in
