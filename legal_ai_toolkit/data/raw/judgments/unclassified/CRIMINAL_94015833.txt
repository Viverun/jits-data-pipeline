At the very outset, the learned counsel for applicant contends that co-accused Kajol @ Komal and Dashrath Singh have already been granted bail by this Court vide order dated 02.12.2023 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.43850 of 2023 (Kajol @ Komal Vs. State of U.P.) decided along with connected Criminal Misc.

"Heard Mr. Jagmohan Singh, the learned counsel for applicants, the learned A.G.A. for State and Mr. Sanjay Kumar Nigam, the learned counsel representing first informant. 



These applications for bail have been filed by applicant Kajol @ Komal and Dashrath Singh seeking their enlargement on bail in Case Crime No. 152 of 2023, under 
Sections 498A
/

 IPC and 
Sections 3

 Dowry Prohibition Act, P.S. Sachedi, District Kanpur Nagar, during the pendency of trial. 



Perused the record. 



Record shows that marriage of Laxmi Devi was solemnized with Santosh Kumar, yougner brother of applicant Dashrath Singh on 18.4.2022. However, just after expiry of a period of 1 year and 12 days from the date of marriage of the younger brother of applicant Dashrath Singh, an unfortunate incident occurred on 29/30.4.2023 in which Laxmi Devi, the wife of younger brother of Dashrath Singh died. It is the case of applicant that information regarding aforesaid suicidal death of deceased was given by the uncle of applicant to the father of the deceased. However, no information as required under Section 174 Cr. P. C. was given at the concerned police station by the applicant or by any of his family members. 



Subsequently, Lala, the father of the deceased lodged an F.I.R. dated 30.4.2023, which was registered as Case Crime No. 152 of 2023, under 
Sections 498A
/
304B
 IPC and 
Sections 3
/
4
 Dowry Prohibition Act, P.S. Sachedi, District Kanpur Nagar.. In the aforesaid F.I.R., eight persons namely Santosh Singh (husband), Champa Devi (mother-in-law), Dashrath Singh (Jeth), Jethani, Lal Singh (cousin father-in-law) (chachiya sasur), Rachana Devi (Nand), Sri Kishan (Nandoi) and Pappu (maternal father-in-law) (mamiya sasur) of the deceased have been nominated as named accused. 



The gravamen of the allegations made in the F.I.R. is to the effect that at the time of marriage sufficient amount of goods and jewellery was given. However, in-laws of the daughter of the first informant were dissatisfied with the same. Subsequently, an additional demand of car was made by the in-laws of the daughter of first informant. As additional demand of dowry was not fulfilled, cruelty was committed to bring additional demand of dowry from her home. However, the F.I.R. specifies that the cruelty was committed upon the daughter of first informant only by the husband of the deceased. Ultimately, the named accused caused the death of the deceased i.e. daughter of first informant and hanged her body from a tree. 



After above mentioned F.I.R. was lodged, Investigating Officer proceeded with statutory investigation of concerned case crime number in terms of Chapter XII Cr. P. C. Thereafter, inquest (Panchayatnama) of the body of the deceased was conducted on 30.4.2023. In the opinion of witnesses of inquest (Panch witnesses), the nature of death of deceased was categorized as suicidal and the cause of death of accused was specified as hanging. Thereafter, the post mortem of the body of deceased was conducted. In the opinion of Autopsy Surgeon, who conducted autopsy of the body of deceased, cause of the death was opined as asphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging. The Autopsy Surgeon found following ante mortem injuries on the body of deceased:- 



Ligature mark around neck 33 cm x 2 cm gap if around 6 cm R side back of neck. 



During course of investigation, Investigating Officer recorded the statements of first informant and other witnesses under Section 161 Cr. P. C.Witnesses so examined have substantially supported the F.I.R. On the basis of above and other material collected by the Investigating Officer, he came to the conclusion that complicity of four of the named accused namely Santosh Singh (husband), Champa Devi (mother-in-law), Dashrath Singh (jeth) and Smt. Kajal @ Komal (jethani) of the deceased is established in the commission of crime in question. He, accordingly, submitted the charge sheet dated 19.7.2022, whereby aforementioned named accused have been charge sheeted under Sections 498A, 304B and 
Sections 3
/
4
 D.P. Act, whereas investigation against other named accused is said to be pending. 



Learned counsel for applicants contends that applicants are innocent. Applicants are the jeth and jethani of the deceased. Irrespective of the fact that applicants are charge sheeted accused, yet they are liable to be enlarged on bail. 



According to the learned counsel for applicants, the deceased was a short tempered lady and she has taken the extreme step of committing suicide by hanging herself. The bona fide of the applicants is explicit from the fact that no other external ante mortem injury was found on the body of deceased except the ligature mark. Prima facie, the death of deceased is a suicidal death. As per the document occurring at page 48 of the paper book, it is established that applicants were living separately from the family of deceased. Moreover, applicants cannot be said to be beneficiary of the alleged demand of additional dowry. The husband of the deceased i.e. brother of the applicant Dashrath Singh is already in jail. Moreover, the applicant Kajol @ Komal is a lady and therefore, entitled to the benefit of the provisions contained in proviso to Section 437 Cr. P. C. 
 
Attention of the Court was then invited to the F.I.R., and on basis thereof, he submits that allegation regarding commission of cruelty upon deceased on account of non fulfillment of additional demand of dowry has been specifically made against the husband of the deceased and not other named accused. As such, it is admitted case of the prosecution that though demand of dowry was made by all the named accused, but cruelty was committed upon deceased by her husband alone. 



Even otherwise, applicants are of clean antecedents having no criminal history to their credit except the present one. Applicants are in jail since 05.06.2023. As such, they have undergone more than 5 and a half months of incarceration. The police report in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr. P. C. has already been submitted. As such, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against the applicants stands crystallized. However, upto this stage, no such circumstance has emerged on record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicants during the pendency of trial. It is thus urged that applicants are liable to be enlarged on bail. In case, the applicants are enlarged on bail, they shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the trial. 



Per contra, the learned A.G.A. and the learned counsel representing first informant have opposed the prayer for bail. They submit that since applicants are the jeth and jethani of the deceased named and charge sheeted accused, therefore, they do not deserve any indulgence by this Court. The death of the deceased has occurred within seven years of her marriage and at her marital home. As such, the death of the deceased is a dowry death. Applicants are Jeth and Jethani of the deceased. Therefore, burden is upon the applicant to not only explain the manner of occurrence but also his innocence in terms of 
Sections 106
 and 
113
 of the Evidence Act. However, applicants have failed to discharge the said burden. Upon this stage simply on the basis of the certification issued by the Gram Pradhan which is not a private document, it cannot be said that applicants are living separately. The deceased was a young lady aged about 21 years, who has died in unnatural circumstance. As such, no sympathy be shown by this Court in favour of applicants, However, they could not dislodge the factual/legal submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicants with reference to the record at this stage. 



Having heard the learned counsel for applicants, the learned A.G.A. for state, the learned counsel representing first informant upon perusal of material brought on record, nature and gravity of offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, accusation made and coupled with the fact that prima facie the death of the deceased a suicidal death, the bona fide of the applicant is explicit from the fact that no external or internal ante mortem injury was found on the body of deceased except the ligature mark, in view of above, the applicants are not liable to be awarded the maximum sentence for the offence under 
Section 304 B 
IPC, if convicted, it is the admitted case of the prosecutrix as per the prosecution story unfolded in the F.I.R. that though demand of additional dowry (car) was made by all the accused, but on account of non fulfillment of of the said demand of dowry cruelty was committed upon deceased only by her husband, applicants cannot be said to be beneficiary of the alleged demand of dowry, the police report in terms of Section 173 (2) Cr. P. C. has already been submitted, as such, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against the applicants stands crystallized, however, upto this stage, no such circumstance has emerged necessitating the custodial arrest of applicants during the pendency of trial, the judgement of the Supreme Court in 
Sumit Subhashchandra Gangwal Vs. State of Maharashtra
, 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 373 (para5) the clean antecedents of applicants, the period of incarceration undergone by applicants, therefore, irrespective of the objections raised by the learned A.G.A. and the learned counsel for first informant in opposition to this application for bail, but without making any comments on the merits of the case, the applicants have made out a case for bail.




Accordingly, bail applications are allowed.

10. The bail application is allowed." 



According to the learned counsel for applicant though applicant is husband of the deceased, a named and charge-sheeted accused yet he is liable to be enlarged on bail. The death of the deceased is a suicidal death. The bona fide of the applicant is further explicit from the fact that no external ante-mortem injury was found on the body of deceased. The deceased was a short tampered lady and she has taken the extreme step to commit suicide by hanging herself. On the above premise, he, therefore, contends that even in the case of conviction, applicant is not liable to be awarded the maximum sentence under 
Section 304-B
 IPC i.e. life imprisonment. As such, the applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail 
 
Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents having no criminal history to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in custody since 01.05.2023. As such, he has undergone more than one year of incarceration. The police report under 
Section 173 (2)
 CrPC has already been submitted. As such, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against the applicant stands crystalized. However, up to this stage, no such circumstance has emerged necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant. He, therefore, contends that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case the applicant is enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the trial. 



Per contra, the learned A.G.A. and the learned counsel representing first informant have opposed the prayer for bail. Learned A.G.A. submits that though no external ante-mortem injury was found on the body of deceased but the dead body of deceased was recovered far away from the marital home of deceased, which was found to be hanging on a mango tree. It is an adverse circumstance, which emerged against applicant, but has remained unexplained up to this stage. Admittedly, applicant is husband of the deceased and the occurrence has occurred while the deceased was residing at her marital home therefore, by reason of above the burden is upon the applicant not only to explain the manner of occurrence but also his innocence in terms of 
Sections 106
 and 
113-B
 of the Evidence Act. Upto this stage, there is nothing on record to show the bona fide of applicant regarding the fact as to when the deceased went missing from the house of applicant. The deceased was a young lady, who has died just after expiry of one year and twelve days from the date of her marriage. On the above conspectus, the learned A.G.A. contends that irrespective of the submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant no good ground for release of applicant is made out. As such, the present application for bail is liable to be rejected by this Court. 



When confronted with above, the learned counsel for applicant could not overcome the same. 



Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, the learned counsel representing first informant and upon perusal of record, evidence, complicity of the accused, accusation made, nature and gravity of offence and coupled with the fact that the objections raised by the learned A.G.A. in opposition to the present application for bail but without making any comments on the merits of the case, this Court does not find any good ground to enlarge the applicant on bail. 



As a result, the application for bail is liable to be rejected. 



It is accordingly rejected. 



Order Date :- 7.5.2024. " 



5. Learned counsel for applicant contends that subsequent to the above order dated 07.05.2024, the trial of applicant commenced before court below. The first informant i.e. father of deceased namely Lala @ Ganesh Singh has deposed before court below as P.W.-1. His deposition as recorded before court below has been brought on record as Annexure-6 to the affidavit filed in support of this repeat application for bail. Referring to the examination-in-chief of the aforesaid witness, the learned counsel for applicant submits that aforementioned witness in his examination-in-chief has not fully supported the F.I.R. He therefore contends that once the first informant has himself has not supported the F.I.R. in his examination-in-chief then no justifiable ground exists to prolong the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial. As such, applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail.



6. Even otherwise applicant is a man of clean antecedents inasmuch he has no criminal history to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in custody since 01.05.2023. As such, he has under-gone more than one year and six months of incarceration. The police report (charge-sheet) in terms of 
Section 173 (2)
 Cr.P.C. has already been submitted, therefore, the entire evidence sought to relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands crystallised. Upto this stage, no such incriminating circumstance has emerged on record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial. He therefore submits that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case the applicant is enlarged on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the trial. 



7. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 and Agni Pal Singh, the learned counsel representing first informant have vehemently opposed the prayer for bail. Learned A.G.A. contends that even though, this court is a superior court, dictates of prudence require that no such exercise of evaluating the evidence which has emerged during the pendency of trial be undertaken by this Court as any such exercise undertaken by this Court will amount to per-empting the trial and may prejudice the prosecution or the defence. Furthermore, P.W.-1 has not been declared hostile. Upto this stage, no adverse inference can be drawn against P.W.-1. On the above conspectus, the learned A.G.A. submits that no new, good or sufficient ground has emerged so as to enlarge the applicant on bail. 



8. When confronted with above, the learned counsel for applicant could not overcome the same. 



9. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon consideration of material on record, evidence, gravity and nature of offence, accusations made as well as complicity of applicant, coupled with the fact that objections raised by the learned A.G.A. in opposition of this repeat application for bail could not be dislodged by the learned counsel for applicant, therefore irrespective of the varied submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant in support of present repeat application for bail but without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, this court does not find any new, good or sufficient ground so as to enlarge the applicant on bail.



10. As a result, present repeat application for bail fails and is liable to be rejected. 



11. It is accordingly rejected.
