                                    that she has five children (3 daughters and 2 sons). Her daughter Pallavi was
                                    married to Anshul and in the marriage, complainant and her family had
                                    spent according to their capacity and had given all household goods and
                                    jewellery but Pallavi's husband and in-laws were not satisfied and tortured
                                    and harassed her for bringing less dowry and kept demanding more and
                                    more, especially a car, on the ground that Anshul was the only son of his
                                    parents and held the status of a Government servant. Pallavi also complained
                                    that Anshul would come home drunk and physically beat her. She also
                                    narrated that on 29.04.2024 her husband had spoken to Pallavi's father-in-
                                    law requesting him to send her to the parental house as her mother was ill.

                                    despite her mother being ill and forced by the in-laws, Pallavi went back on

                                     07.05.2024. Complainant stated that on 08.05.2024 Pallavi telephoned her
                                    and informed that her husband and in-laws were harassing her badly.
                                    Complainant and her husband decided to visit her matrimonial home on
                                    10.05.2024 to resolve the issues but before that on 09.05.2024 they received
                                    a phone call from Pallavi's father-in-law that she had committed suicide by
                                    hanging. Complainant categorically stated that Pallavi's husband and in-
                                    laws had a role to play in her alleged suicide as they had been regularly
                                    harassing and torturing her for dowry.

                                    5.          It is stated that thereafter, present FIR was registered and
                                    investigation was initiated, wherein statements of witnesses were recorded
                                    and evidences collected. On 11.05.2024, co-accused Anshul and his father
                                    Karm Singh were arrested and are in Judicial Custody. Investigation has
                                    brought forth sufficient incriminating material against the applicant, who is
                                    the Nanad of the deceased and was residing in the same house. Post-mortem
                                    report of deceased Pallavi has been received which reflects presence of a
                                    brownish coloured dark abraded hard Panchmentised incomplete ligature
                                    mark around the neck of length 30 cm and width varying 1 cm-3 cm, 7.5 cm
                                    from chin and 6 cm at sterna notch. The distance of the mark from the right
                                    and left angle of mandible is 2 cm-2.5 cm respectively. Two crecentric
                                    abrasions were found, one over the lower lip. Session Court has dismissed
                                    the bail application of the applicant looking at the seriousness of the
                                    allegations and the role attributed to the applicant.

                                    6.          Counsel for the applicant states that the applicant is innocent and has
                                    no role to play in the alleged suicide of the deceased Pallavi. It is stated that
                                    the applicant is a young girl, aged 27 years and is unmarried and her
                                    incarceration will ruin her entire life. There are no allegations of dowry

                                     against the applicant which is evident from a bare reading of the FIR. It is
                                    urged that applicant has never made any attempt to evade the process of law
                                    and it is a natural reaction to shift out of the known place of residence, if an
                                    FIR is registered. Applicant is willing to join investigation and cooperate
                                    therein. Reliance is placed on the judgments of Co-ordinate Benches of this
                                    Court in Smt. Vinni v. The State, Bail Appln. 
208/2022, decided on
                                    08.03.2022; and 
Shiksha @ Shashi Kiran v. State of NCT of Delhi, Bail
                                    Appln
. 1029/2023, decided on 28.07.2023.


                                    7.          On the other hand, Ms. Shubhi Gupta, learned APP submits that the
                                    allegations against the applicant are grave and serious. Marriage between
                                    Anshul and deceased was solemnised on 16.02.2023 and the deceased
                                    committed suicide on 09.05.2024, i.e. within 14 months from the date of
                                    marriage. It will be incorrect for the applicant to argue that there are no
                                    allegations against the applicant. Statement of the complainant is replete
                                    with instances where she stated that the deceased had confided in her that
                                    her in-laws including the applicant were torturing and harassing her for less
                                    dowry and repeatedly demanding more dowry, especially a car as per their
                                    status as Anshul was the only son and had a Government job. It is urged that
                                    applicant is not joining investigation and is evading the process of law.
                                    Learned APP is emphatic that there are specific and serious allegations
                                    against the applicant that she pressed the neck of the deceased and this could
                                    only be with a motive to kill the deceased. Investigating Officer has made
                                    several efforts to contact the applicant to join investigation but as per the
                                    statements of the neighbours, applicant and her mother both have not been
                                    seen since the registration of the FIR. Judgments relied upon by learned
                                    counsel for the applicant are distinguished on facts arguing that there can be

                                     no precedent in bail matters as each case has to be decided on its own facts,
                                    circumstances, seriousness of allegations, role ascribed to the accused etc.

                                    8.          I have heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned APP for the
                                    State and examined their rival submissions.

 
9.          Before proceeding to deal with the present case, it would be useful to
                                    refer to an order in the case of 
Lavesh v. State NCT of Delhi, Bail Appln
.
                                    No.1602/2011, decided on 05.12.2011, where the FIR was registered under
                                    
Section 498A
/
304B
 IPC and Petitioners were real sister and brother of the
                                    husband of the deceased, respectively.
 
Application for grant of pre-arrest
                                    bail was dismissed by the Court relying on the judgement of the Supreme
                                    Court in 
Samunder Singh v. State of Rajasthan and Others
, (1987) 1 SCC


                                    466. Challenge to the order declining bail was unsuccessful in the Supreme
                                    Court looking at the nature and gravity of the accusations, possibility of the
                                    applicant fleeing from justice, etc. 
In 
Samunder Singh
 (supra), the Supreme
                                    Court made a very significant observation that dowry deaths are even now
                                    treated with some casualness and that High Court should not have exercised
                                    the discretion to grant anticipatory bail, disregarding the magnitude and
                                    seriousness of the matter. The matter regarding the unnatural death of the
                                    daughter-in-law at the house of her in-laws was still under investigation.
                                    Relevant paragraph of the judgement is as under:-


                                                "The widespread belief that dowry deaths are even now treated with some
                                                casualness at all levels seems to be well grounded. The High Court has
                                                granted anticipatory bail in such a matter. We are of the opinion that the
                                                High Court should not have exercised its jurisdiction to release the
                                                accused on anticipatory bail in disregard of the magnitude and
                                                seriousness of the matter. The matter regarding the unnatural death of the
                                                daughter-in-law at the house of her father-in-law was still under
                                                investigation and the appropriate course to adopt was to allow the
                                                concerned magistrate to deal with the same on the basis of the material

                                                 arrested. It was neither prudent nor proper for the High Court to have
                                                granted anticipatory bail which order was very likely to occasion
                                                prejudice by its very nature and timing. We therefore consider it essential
                                                to sound a serious note of caution for future. The High Court is under no
                                                compulsion to exercise its jurisdiction to grant anticipatory bail in a
                                                matter of this nature. So far as the present matter is concerned, since it has
                                                become infructuous, we do not propose to pass any order. Subject to these
                                                observations, the appeal is dismissed."



                                    10.         
In the case of 
Ms. Preeti v. The State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi
), 2016
                                    SCC OnLine Del 2325, this Court declined to grant Anticipatory Bail to the
                                    mother-in-law and sister-in-law of the deceased who died an unnatural death
                                    and FIR was registered under 
Sections 498A
/
304B
/
34
 IPC. Court observed
                                    that the deceased had committed suicide within four and a half years from
                                    the date of marriage. Petitioners were not co-operating with the investigation
                                    and the case was still at the initial stages.


                                    11.         In the present case, marriage between deceased Pallavi and Anshul
                                    was solemnized on 16.02.2023 and the unnatural death has taken place in
                                    less than 14 months from the date of marriage, which raises a statutory
                                    presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and
                                    
Section 304-B
 IPC, as rightly contended by the learned APP. Mother of the
                                    deceased has made serious and pointed allegations against the Applicant
                                    also, who is the sister-in-law of the deceased and lived in the same house.
                                    Allegations of dowry demand, harassment, mental and physical torture have
                                    been clearly levelled including a repeated demand for a car. Significantly,
                                    there is a serious allegation against the applicant that she pressed the neck of
                                    deceased on an earlier occasion. Post-mortem report indicates that there are
                                    two crecentric abrasions, one present over lower lip, which may be pointers
                                    to some physical assault prior to the alleged hanging by the fan. I find prima
                                    facie merit in the submission of learned APP that there is sufficient

                                     incriminating evidence against the applicant, who was residing in the same
                                    house as the deceased. Status Report reveals that despite efforts by the
                                    Police, applicant has successfully evaded arrest till date and has not joined
                                    investigation. The seriousness of the allegations; role ascribed to the
                                    applicant; factum of death of the deceased in about 14 months of marriage;
                                    statements of the mother of the deceased regarding repeated demands of
                                    dowry and torture of the deceased; and the matter being at a nascent stage
                                    are some of the factors which dissuade this Court to exercise discretion in
                                    favour of the applicant and grant pre-arrest bail.

                                    12.         Insofar as the judgments relied upon by counsel for the applicant are
                                    concerned, none of them are even close to the facts of the present case.
                                    Moreover, each bail application has to be decided on the given facts and
                                    circumstances and as mentioned above, facts of this case do not aid the
                                    applicant.

                                    13.         Bail Application is, accordingly, dismissed.

                                    14.         Needless to state no observation in this order will be construed as an
                                    expression on the merits of the case.



                                                                                                                           JYOTI SINGH, J
