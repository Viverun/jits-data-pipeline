Section 151
 of CPC, 1908)

                          1.     This is a case where the dream of the Decree Holder to own a home
                          became a reality when the Suit for Specific Performance of an Agreement
                          to Sell was decreed with alacrity in less than two months. However, it
                          turned into a mirage as she embarked on a long and arduous journey on
                          the path of execution since 1988, which continues even after 38 years.
                          The adage by an unknown Writer "The Hurrier I Go, The Behinder I Get"
                          aptly explains the dilemma of Decree Holder. The journey to realize the

                          fruits of the Decree may still not end with the determination of these
                          Objections.
                          2.     This case reflects the archetype challenges of an adversarial
                          litigation system and urgently requires the attention of all the stakeholders
                          to assume responsibility to work out a mechanism to ensure that the
                          person with a Decree is not left only with papers which do not materialize
                          into fruition.
                          3.     The Objections under 
Section 47
 read with 
Section 151
 of the Code

                          8.     While the Execution was pending, Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and Mr.

                          party or any other person claiming through or under them. In addition to
                          this, the Agreement to Sell also contained a clause that the plot in question
                          was absolutely free from any kind of encumbrances.
                          9.     An Agreement for Building Construction dated 11 th September,
                          1990 was also executed by the JD acting through Attorney Ganga Parshad
                          Gupta in favour of Mr. Binod Kumar Gupta, husband of Ms. Meena Rani
                          Gupta, applicant No. 1 and Mr. Anant Kumar Gupta, husband of Ms.

                          10.    The JD challenged the Judgement and Decree by filing the
                          RFA (OS) 86/1998. The Objectors came to know for the first time on
                          07th December, 1998, about the pendency of the present Suit. They moved

                          party in the said appeal but the application for impleadment was dismissed
                          by observing that the Objectors were strangers to the suit. The application
                          was also dismissed by the Division Bench by its Judgement dated
                          18th January, 2012.

                          11.    This led the Objectors to file an independent Appeal vide RFA (OS)
                          125/1998 against the Judgement dated 18th January, 2012, but it met the
                          same fate of dismissal. However, while dismissing the Appeal, the
                          Division Bench observed that whatever defences are available to the
                          appellants to seek possession of the suit property, may be raised at the
                          time of execution of the Decree.

                          12.    The Objectors, thereafter, filed a petition under 
Article 136
 of the
                          Constitution of India seeking leave of the Hon'ble Apex Court, but the
                          petition was dismissed vide Order dated 04th July, 2012.
                          13.    The Objectors have then filed a Suit bearing No. CS (OS) 779/2001
                          for Specific Performance and in the alternative for Damages which is
                          pending disposal.
                          14.    The DH filed the present Execution petition for execution of the
                          Judgement and Decree dated 29thApril, 1998. The Objectors have filed
                          against the Objections under 
Section 47
 of CPC, 1908 for protection of
                          their possession as they are in physical possession of the suit property by
                          way of part performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 26th November,
                          1990 under 
Section 53A
 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter
                          referred to as "TPA, 1882"). The Objectors have asserted that while
                          entering into the transaction on 26th November, 1990, neither were they

                          aware that the JD had already entered into an Agreement to Sell with DH
                          nor was the pendency of suit in their knowledge.
                          15.    It is further asserted that a fraud has been committed on the Court
                          on account of collusion between DH and JD. Despite the JD's admissions
                          in the cross-examination as DW-1 during the trial that he had entered into
                          an Agreement to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta, no steps were taken either
                          by JD or DH to implead Ms. Kamlesh Gupta as a party to the Suit.
                          16.    The JD was not in physical possession of the suit property at the
                          time of institution of the suit. The Agreement to Sell was executed by JD
                          in favour of Ms. Kamlesh Gupta prior to filing of the suit and the doctrine
                          of lis pendens enshrined under

                          applicable. The Objectors have asserted that they have independent rights
                          and are entitled to protection of their possession by virtue of 
Section 53A

                          of TPA, 1882.
                          17.    The Objectors have stated that the question of law that has arisen is
                          whether the person having an Agreement to Sell, who may not be affected
                          by 
Section 52
 of TPA, 1882, would have the protection of 
Section 53A
 of
                          the TPA, 1882 and if so, whether such person is bound by a Decree made
                          in respect of the immovable property to which they were not made a party.
                          18.    It is submitted that this Court under 
Order I Rule 10 of CPC
, 1908
                          may add the Objectors as a party to the present proceedings as has been
                          held in Baster Transport and Trading Co. & Anr. vs. Court of Wards
                          Baster and Anr AIR 1955 Nagpur 78. The Objectors have a locus standi
                          to file the objections for which reliance is placed on Kancherla
                          Lakshminarayana vs. Mattararthi Syamala and Ors. 2008 (14) 258. A

                          prayer has, therefore, been made that the objections may be allowed, and
                          the execution proceedings be dismissed.
                          19.    The DH, VeenaMahajan in her Reply to the objections has taken
                          a preliminary objection that the Objectors have already availed all the
                          remedies and all their applications and appeals have been dismissed. The
                          present Objections are frivolous and have been filed only with the
                          dishonest intention to delay the proceedings.
                          20.    In response to the contention of part performance, it is asserted that
                          the Objectors cannot avail any protection under 
Section 53A
 of
                          TPA, 1882 as the same is available only against the transferor and not a
                          third party for which reliance has been placed on Rambhau Namdeo Gajre
                          vs. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra (2004) 8 SCC 614. The protection of part
                          performance could have been availed by the objectors from the alleged
                          Transferor i.e., Ms Kamlesh Gupta who was not a party to the main suit.
                          21.    On merits, all the averments made in the application are denied by
                          the DH.
                          22.   Submissions heard.
                          23.    Admittedly, the JD who was the owner of the suit property, entered
                          into an Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986 with the DH, but
                          failed to execute the Sale Deed. The DH filed a Suit for Specific
                          Performance in 1988 which was decreed vide Judgement/Decree dated
                          29th April, 1988, the execution of which has been sought by way of
                          present Execution Petition.
                          24.    The Apex Court in Sanjeev Lal and Others vs. Commissioner of
                          Income Tax, Chandigarh and Another, (2015) 5 SCC 775 observed that
                          when a right is created in favour of the Vendee, the Vendor is restrained

                          from selling the said property to someone else because the vendee, in
                          whose favour a right in personam is created, has a legitimate right to
                          enforce specific performance of the Agreement, if the Vendor for some
                          reason is not executing the sale deed. It can thus be extrapolated that the
                          consequence of execution of the Agreement to Sell is that the owner
                          cannot sell the property to someone else and the Vendor's right to further
                          sell the property stands extinguished.
                          25.    Undeterred and in defiance of the legal embargo as explained in
                          Sanjeev Lal (supra), the JD went ahead and executed the Agreement to
                          Sell, registered Will, registered General /Special Power of Attorney, all
                          dated 21st January, 1988 in favour of Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and her
                          husband, Gagan Parshad. Thereafter, the present suit was filed in March,
                          1988 by the DH and Injunction order was granted on 14th March, 1988
                          which is subsequent to the delivery of possession of the suit property by
                          the JD to Ms. Kamlesh Gupta.Ms. Kamlesh Gupta in turn executed the
                          Agreement to Sell dated 26th November, 1990 in favour of the Objectors,
                          who were then put in possession of the suit property.

                          Doctrine of Lis Pendis under 
Section 52
 of the Transfer of Property
                          Act, 1882:

                          26.    The Objectors have claimed that the doctrine of lis pendis is not
                          applicable to them since they derive their title, not from the JD, but from
                          Ms.Kamlesh Gupta, who was not a party to the suit.
                          27.    Significantly, the Objectors' claim to title is based on the
                          transaction entered into during the pendency of the Execution of the



                          EX.P. 282/2012                                                 Page 8 of 28

                          reads as under: -
                                 "
Section 52
 -Transfer of property pending suit relating
                                 thereto.--
                                 During the pendency in any Court having authority within the
                                 limits of India excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir or
                                 established beyond such limits by the Central Government of

                                 right to immoveable property is directly and specifically in
                                 question, the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt
                                 with by any party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the
                                 rights of any other party thereto under any decree or order
                                 which may be made therein, except under the authority of the
                                 Court and on such terms as it may impose.
                                 Explanation.--For the purposes of this section, the pendency of
                                 a suit or proceeding shall be deemed to commence from the
                                 date of the presentation of the plaint or the institution of the
                                 proceeding in a Court of competent jurisdiction, and to
                                 continue until the suit or proceeding has been disposed of by a
                                 final decree or order and complete satisfaction or discharge of
                                 such decree or order has been obtained, or has become
                                 unobtainable by reason of the expiration of any period of
                                 limitation prescribed for the execution thereof by any law for
                                 the time being in force."

                          29.    In Ballamy vs. Sabine,(1857) 1 DeG&J 566, Lord Cranworth, L.C.
                          about one and a half centuries back, explained that this doctrine is based
                          on the necessity of putting an end to litigation which otherwise would
                          continue ad infinitum. The relevant paragraph reads thus:

                                   "...where a litigation is pending between a plaintiff and a
                                   defendant as to the right to a particular estate, the necessities of
                                   mankind require that the decision of the Court in the suit shall
                                   be binding not only on the litigating parties, but also on those
                                   who derive title under them by way of alienations made during
                                   the pendency of the suit, whether such alienees had or had not
                                   notice of the pending proceedings. If this is not so, there could
                                   be no certainty that the litigation would ever come to an end."

                          30.      In Amit Kumar Shaw vs. Farida Khatoon (2005) 11 SCC 403, the
                          Hon'ble Apex Court observed that the doctrine of lis pendens, therefore,
                          applies only when the lis is pending before a Court. It enumerated the
                          following elements that should be present in order to constitute lis
                          pendens:
                                "1. There must be a suit or proceeding pending in a court of competent
                                jurisdiction.
                                2. The suit or proceeding must not be collusive.
                                3. The litigation must be one in which the right to immovable property
                                is directly and specifically in question.
                                4. There must be a transfer of or otherwise a dealing with the property
                                in dispute by any party to the litigation.
                                5. Such transfer must affect the rights of the other party that may
                                ultimately accrue under the terms of the decree or order."

                          31.      In Smt. Ram Peary vs. Gauri and Ors., AIR 1978 All 318, the Full
                          Bench of Allahabad High Court explained that this rule is based on the
                          principles of public policy wherein a purchaser who purchases during the
                          pendency of a suit need not be impleaded as a party and shall have
                          subservient rights in comparison to the litigating parties. It expounded the
                          doctrine of lis pendens as follows:


                          EX.P. 282/2012                                                      Page 10 of 28

                                "...Ordinarily, it is true that the judgment of a court binds only the
                                parties and their privies in representations or estate. But he who
                                purchases during the pendency of an action, is held bound by the
                                judgement that may be against the person from whom he derives
                                title. The litigating parties are exempted from taking any notice of
                                the title so acquired; and such purchaser need not be made a party
                                to the action. Where there is a real and fair purchase without any
                                notice, the rule may operate very hardly. But it is a rule founded
                                upon a great public policy; for otherwise, alienations made during
                                an action might defeat its whole purpose, and there would be no
                                end to litigation. And hence arises the maxim pendente lite, nihil
                                innovetur; the effect of which is not to annul the conveyance, but
                                only to render it subservient to the rights of the parties in the
                                litigation. As to the rights of these parties, the conveyance is
                                treated as if it never had any existence; and it does not vary them."

                          32.      The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Usha Sinha vs Dina Ram
                          (2008) SCC 144 explained the rights of the transferee pendent lite by
                          observing that a transferee from a Judgment Debtor is presumed to be
                          aware of the proceedings before the Court of Law. Thus, he should be
                          careful before he purchases the property which is the subject matter of
                          litigation. Rule 102 of 
Order XXI of CPC
, 1908 thus takes into account
                          the ground reality and refuses to extend a helping hand to purchasers of a
                          property in respect of which the litigation is pending. It recognizes the
                          doctrine lis pendens contained in 
Section 52
 of the TPA, 1882. Similar
                          observations were made by the Apex Court in Sarvinder Singh vs. Dalip
                          Singh (1996) 5 SCC 539.
                          33.      In Sanjay Verma vs. Manik Roy and Ors. (2006) 13 SCC 608, in
                          accordance with equity, good conscience and justice, applying the

                          question of good faith or bona fide arises. A Transferee pendente lite is
                          bound by the decree just as if he was a party to the Suit. The mere
                          pendency of a suit does not prevent one of the parties from dealing with
                          the property constituting the subject matter of the suit. The section only
                          postulates a condition that the alienation will in no manner affect the
                          rights of the other party under any decree which may be passed in a Suit,
                          unless the property was alienated with the permission of the court. The
                          view expressed in Ballamy (supra) were thus endorsed.
                          34.    Similarly, in M.S. Mansoor Deen and Ors. vs. Fathimuthu Bevy
                          &Ors. (2009) 4 CTC 489, the Madras High Court observed that the
                          transferees pendente lite from the JD having no independent right in the
                          teeth of 
Section 52
 of the TPA, 1882, cannot resist the execution since
                          under the doctrine of lis pendens a Decree passed in a suit during the
                          pendency of which a transfer is effected, makes the decree binding on the
                          transferee.
                          35.    In Silverline Forum Private Limited vs. Rajiv Trust (1998) 3 SCC
                          723, while considering the resistance caused by the transferee pendente
                          lite, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the scope of the adjudication is
                          confined to the question of whether he was a transferee during the
                          pendency of the suit in which the decree was passed. If such finding is in
                          affirmative, the executing court must hold that he has no right to resist or
                          obstruct the proceedings and such person cannot seek protection from the
                          executing Court. The exclusion of such a third party Transferee from
                          raising further contentions is based on the salutary principle adumbrated

                          in 
Section 52
 of TPA, 1882. For example, if the obstructer admits that he
                          is the Transferee pendente lite, it is not necessary to determine a question
                          raised by him that he was unaware of the litigation when he purchased the
                          property. Similarly, a third-party who questions the validity of a transfer
                          made by a DH to an assignee, cannot claim that the question regarding its
                          validity should be decided during the executing proceedings.
                          36.     Hence, the question for determination is whether the title of the
                          Objectors is superior to that of the Decree Holder and whether they are
                          entitled to remain in possession on the strength of the Agreement to Sell
                          dated 26th November, 1990 executed in their favour by Ms. Kamlesh
                          Gupta.
                          37.     The Agreement to Sell was executed by the JD in favour of the DH
                          on 14th February, 1986. Subsequently, he entered into another Agreement
                          to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta on 21.01.1988, which is prior to the
                          institution of this Suit. Once the Agreement to Sell had already been
                          executed in favour of the DH on 14th February, 1986, any subsequent
                          Agreement to Sell would obviously be subject to the earlier interest
                          already created by way of the Agreement to Sell dated 14th February,
                          1986.
                          38.     Ms. Kamlesh Gupta could have sought execution of Agreement to
                          Sell only if she could establish that her title was superior to that of the
                          DH. But in the absence of any Sale Deed in her favour, she could not have
                          asserted any ownership rights. Thus, merely on the basis of an Agreement
                          to Sell, she could not have transferred the ownership rights which she
                          herself did not possess.

                          39.    The sole claim of the Objectors' rests on the Agreement to Sell
                          dated 26th November, 1990 executed by Ms. Kamlesh Gupta during the
                          pendency of the present Suit. From the admitted facts, it is evident that
                          Ms. Kamlesh Gupta merely had an Agreement to Sell and other
                          documents in her favour, but the big question is whether the mere
                          execution of an Agreement to Sell amounted to sale of the suit property as
                          defined under 
Section 54
 of TPA, 1882 or whether it was merely an
                          Agreement subject to the rights of the owner i.e., the JD.
                          40.    Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and her husband Gagan Parshad are the
                          predecessor-in-interest through whom the Objectors are claiming a right
                          and title which cannot be better than that of the predecessor-in-interest
                          i.e., Ms. Kamlesh Gupta. Rather, the rights of Ms. Kamlesh are
                          subservient to those of DH as held in the case of Ram Peary (supra). In
                          addition to this, the JD, having entered into Agreement to Sell dated 14th
                          February, 1986 with the DH, was enjoined by law from entering into any
                          further sale transaction with third party. The facts in hand get squarely
                          answered by the decision of the Apex Court in Sanjeev Lal (supra).
                          41.    The DH has already got a Decree dated 29th April, 1988 in her
                          favour and has been held to be entitled to specific performance on the
                          basis of Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986 which is prior to the
                          documents dated 21st January, 1988 executed in favour of Kamlesh
                          through whom the Objectors are claiming a title.
                          42.    Though the Agreement to Sell between the JD and Kamlesh Gupta
                          was executed on 21st January, 1988 i.e., prior to the institution of the Suit
                          by the DH, the Agreement to Sell dated 26th November, 1990 between
                          Kamlesh Gupta and the Objectors was executed subsequent to the Decree

                          for Specific Performance dated 29th April, 1988 in favour of DH. Thus,
                          Kamlesh Gupta and Ganga Prasad Gupta, though not a party to the Suit,
                          were made party to the Execution Petition No 282/2012 for the execution
                          of the Decree in CS (OS) 553/1988.
                          43.    The explanation to 
Section 52
 of TPA, 1882 provides that lis
                          pendens subsists until the decree is discharged. With the execution of the
                          decree yet to be effected, Suit No 553/1998 is still lis pendence for the
                          purposes for 
section 52
 of the TPA, 1882 making the transaction between
                          Kamlesh Gupta and the Objectors fall under the scope of 
Section 52
 of
                          TPA, 1882. As observed in Sanjay Verma (supra), a Transferee pendente
                          lite is bound by the decree, thus making the appellants, who were
                          transferees from Kamlesh Gupta, bound by the Decree.
                          44.    In Surjit Singh vs. Harbans Singh (1995) 6 SCC 50, the Hon'ble
                          Apex Court answered the question of whether a person to whom the suit
                          property is alienated after passing of the preliminary decree by the trial
                          court which had restrained the parties from alienating or otherwise
                          transferring the suit property, has the right to be impleaded as party, in the
                          negative. While rejecting the impleadment of the assignees, the Hon'ble
                          Apex Court had also observed that if alienation/assignment is allowed in
                          defiance of the restraint order, it would defeat the ends of justice and the
                          prevalent public policy. When the Court intends a particular state of
                          affairs to exist while it is in seisin of a lis, that state of affairs is not only
                          required to be maintained but is presumed to exist till the Court orders
                          otherwise. The court in these circumstances has the duty, as also the right,
                          to treat the alienation/assignment as having not taken place at all for its
                          purposes.

                          45.    In Vidur Impex and Traders Private Limited vs. Tosh Apartments
                          Private Limited and Others (2012) 8 SCC 384, while making a reference
                          to Surjit Singh (supra), it was held that where an Agreement to Sell was
                          made and even the Sale Deed pursuant thereto was executed by
                          respondent No. 2 in favour of the appellants in a clandestine manner and


                          in violation of the injunction granted by the High Court, it cannot be said
                          that any valid title or interest has been acquired by the appellants in the
                          suit property by virtue of such a Sale Deed.

                          46.    Thus, the transaction inter se between Ms. Kamlesh Gupta and the
                          applicant dated 26.11.1990 is covered by doctrine of lis pendens as
                          provided in 
Section 52
 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and the
                          rights acquired, if any, by the applicant was subject to the outcome of the
                          pending suit. This suit has been decreed in favour of the DH, Veena
                          Mahajan and her rights have crystallized into a superior title and Ms.
                          Kamlesh Gupta cannot claim any right title merely on the basis of an
                          Agreement to Sell. Ms. Kamlesh Gupta could not have transferred any
                          title better than what she had in favour of the Objectors. Thus, even if she
                          executed an Agreement to Sell, Will, Special Power of Attorney, General
                          Power of Attorney and Receipt all dated 26th November, 1990 in favour of
                          the Objectors, their rights were not only hit by the doctrine of lis pendens,
                          but also were subject to the decree which has been given in favour of the
                          DH Veena Mahajan.

                          47.    The Objectors do not have any valid independent right title in the
                          property and thus, their objections are without merit and have no right to
                          seek protection of their possession.

                          Protection of possession under 
Section 53A
 of the Transfer of
                          Property Act, 1882:



                          48.      The Objectors may have been put in possession pursuant to the
                          Agreement to Sell dated 26.11.1990 by Ms. Kamlesh Gupta, but the other
                          aspect is whether they can seek any protection under 
Section 53A
 of
                          TPA, 1882.

 
49.      The essential conditions which are required to be fulfilled if a
                          transferee wants to defend or protect his possession under 
Section 53A
 of
                          the TPA, 1882 have been explained by the Apex Court in 
Shrimant
                          Shamrao Suryavanshi vs. Pralhad Bhairoba Suryavanshi
 (2002) 3 SCC
                          676 which are:


                                "1. There must be a contract to transfer for consideration of any
                                immovable property;

                                2. The contract must be in writing, signed by the transferor, or by
                                someone on his behalf;

                                3. The writing must be in such words from which the terms
                                necessary to construe the transfer can be ascertained;

                                4. The transferee must in part-performance of the contract take
                                possession of the property, or of any part thereof;

                                5. The transferee must have done some act in furtherance of the
                                contract;

                                6. The transferee must have performed or be willing to perform his
                                part of the contract."



                          50.      If these conditions are fulfilled, then the equitable doctrine of
                          part-performance provided under 
Section 53A
 of TPA, 1882 comes into
                          play in favour of the proposed Transferee who can protect his possession
                          against the proposed transferor, even though the Registered Deed
                          conveying the title is not executed by the proposed Transferor. The
                          protection provided under 
Section 53A
 of TPA, 1882 is only against the

                          Transferor. It disentitles the transferor from disturbing the possession of
                          the proposed Transferee who is put in possession in pursuance of such an
                          Agreement to Sell.

                          51.      
In 
State of U.P. vs. District Judge & Ors.
 1997 (1) SCC 496, it was
                          observed that the protection is available under the TPA, 1882 as a shield
                          only against the transferor and the proposed vendor who is disentitled
                          from disturbing the possession of the proposed Transferees who are put in
                          possession pursuant to such Agreement. But this has nothing to do with
                          the ownership of the proposed Transferor who remains the full owner of
                          the said land till it is legally conveyed by Sale Deed to the proposed
                          Transferees. It was further observed that 
Section 53A
 of TPA, 1882 is
                          merely to protect the possession of the proposed vendee and may entitle
                          him to protection of the possession which they have acquired pursuant to
                          an Agreement to Sell but such a right cannot be pressed against a third
                          party.


                          52.      The pertinent question which arises in the facts of this case is
                          whether the doctrine of part-performance can be availed by the Objectors
                          with whom the judgement debtor has never entered into an Agreement of
                          Sale. 
In 
Rambhau Namdeo Gajre vs. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra
 (2004)8
                          SCC 614, similar facts as in hand came up for consideration. The owner
                          executed an Agreement to Sell with one Pishorrilal who also took
                          possession in part-performance thereof. Sale deed had never been
                          executed. Within a period of two and a half months, the Pishorilal
                          executed a similar agreement of sale in favour of the appellant and put
                          them in possession of the suit land. Pishorrilal who merely had an

                          Agreement to Sell in his favour, had no ownership right and thus was held
                          to have no right to enter into an Agreement to Sell with the appellants.


                          53.    In the present facts as well the owner had executed an Agreement to
                          Sell in favour of one Ms. Kamlesh Gupta who in turn executed another
                          Agreement to Sell in favour of the present Objectors vide Agreement to
                          Sell dated 26th November, 1990, and also put them in possession. Ms.
                          Kamlesh Gupta being merely having an Agreement to Sell was not the
                          owner and could not have possibly entered into the Agreement to Sell in
                          respect of the suit property with the present Objectors.

                          54.    
In 
Rambhau Namdeo Gajre
 (supra), it was observed that an
                          Agreement to Sell does not create any interest of the proposed vendee in
                          the suit property. As per 
Section 54
 of TPA, 1882 the title in immovable
                          property valued at more than Rs. 100 can be conveyed only by executing a
                          registered sale deed. This Section specifically provides that a contract for
                          sale of immovable property is a contract evidencing the fact that the sale
                          of such property shall take place on the terms settled between the parties
                          but does not by itself create any interest in or charge on such property.
                          Unless a registered document of sale is executed pursuant to the
                          Agreement to Sell in favour of the proposed transferee, the title of the suit
                          land continues to vest in the original owner and the property remains in
                          his ownership. The doctrine of part performance can be availed by the
                          proposed transferee against the Transferor or any person claiming under
                          him and not against the third party with whom he does not have any
                          privity of contract.


                          55.    The Scope of Agreement to Sell and the right, title and interest
                          which are created under an Agreement to Sell was explained by the Apex


                          EX.P. 282/2012                                                  Page 19 of 28

                          Court in Suraj lamp and Industries private limited vs. State of Haryana
                          (2012) 1 SCC 656. It was held that the Agreement to Sell coupled with
                          other documents namely Special Power of Attorney, General Power of
                          Attorney are not transactions of transfer or sale and cannot be treated as a
                          complete sale or conveyance. They may continue to be treated as existing
                          Agreement to Sell and nothing prevents the affected parties from getting
                          registered deeds of conveyance to complete their title. These documents
                          may even be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession
                          under 
Section 53A
 of the TPA, 1882 or may also be used to apply for
                          regularization of allotments/leases by development authorities. However,
                          the Agreement to Sell independently continues to be only an agreement
                          and does not create any valid transfer of ownership in the suit property.

                          56.    
In 
Rekha Nankani vs. Kulwant Singh Sachdeva and Ors.
 (2009) 107
                          DRJ 282, this Court observed that if a property was bound by the
                          Agreement of the owner/vendor, then merely because the vendor had
                          transferred the property, the transferee shall not acquire rights better than
                          that of the vendor and shall be subject to the liability of the vendor.

                          Similar observations were made by the High Court of Allahabad in Smt.
                          Ram Peary (supra).

                          57.    Therefore, in view of the law as laid down in the afore-discussed
                          case law, it may be concluded that the Objectors are not entitled to any
                          protection of their possession under 
Section 53-A
 of TPA, 1882.
                          Alleged Fraud and Collusion between the Decree Holder and the
                          Judgement Debtor:



                          58.    A plea has been set up by the Objectors that the Judgement and
                          Decree dated 29th April, 1988 is not executable as it has been obtained by


                          EX.P. 282/2012                                                  Page 20 of 28

                          fraud and collusion between the decree holder and the judgement debtor
                          with the view to cause prejudice to the interest of Kamlesh Gupta in the
                          property in question, who was having enforceable rights against the
                          property in view of the Agreement to Sell dated 21st January, 1988 having
                          been executed in her favour and she being put in physical possession of
                          the property in question.

                          59.    Though a plea of fraud has been taken on behalf of the applicant,
                          but aside from claiming a fraud and collusion between the decree holder
                          and the judgement debtor, no further facts have been disclosed from
                          where any inference of there being fraud and collusion can be inferred. In
                          fact, the Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986 executed in favour
                          of the DH, Ms. Veena Mahajan was prior to the Agreement to Sell dated
                          21st January, 1988 executed in favour of Ms. Kamlesh Gupta. No fraud or
                          collusion has been even prima facie disclosed by the applicant in its
                          objections.

                          60.    Moreover, the JD had filed an appeal by way of RFA (OS) 86/1998
                          challenging the Decree in favour of the DH which was dismissed on
                          merits on18th January, 2012.The conduct of the JD also does not reflect
                          any collusion with the DH.



                          Cancellation of earlier Agreement to Sell dated 14th February, 1986:



                          61.    The Objectors have further asserted their right over the suit
                          property by claiming that there is no finding in the judgement that the JD
                          had entered into an Agreement to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta only after
                          cancellation of the Agreement with the DH in respect of the suit premises.

                          Agreement to Sell in favour of DH having been cancelled by the JD
                          before entering into Agreement to Sell with Ms. Kamlesh Gupta, the
                          Decree of Specific Performance could not have been passed against the
                          JD.

                          62.     This argument is completely fallacious because all the aspects
                          surrounding the Agreement to Sell had been specifically considered while
                          allowing the decree of specific performance in favour of the DH. The
                          aspect of cancellation of the Agreement to Sell in favour of the DH was
                          specifically considered in the judgement dated 29th April, 1998. This
                          aspect of cancellation of the Agreement to Sell in favour of decree holder
                          was also specifically considered in RFA (OS) 86/1998 and the same was
                          negated. Moreover, it is not within the scope of the Objectors to challenge
                          the Decree dated 29th April, 1988 itself, which has already attained
                          finality.

                          Bona fide Purchase: Not Aware of the previous Agreement to Sell in
                          favour of DH:



                          63.     The Objectors have set up a defence that they were not aware of the
                          Sale Agreement between the DH and the JD. 
Section 19
 of the Specific
                          Relief Act, 1963 provides for the relief to the parties claiming under them
                          by subsequent title. It reads as under:

64.      Lord Buckmaster speaking for a five judge bench in 
Mt. Fatima
                          Bibi vs. Saadat Ali
, AIR (1930) Privy Council while interpreting a
                          parimateria provision of 
Section 27 (b)
 of the old 
Specific Relief Act
 held
                          that even though the title may be subsequent to the Agreement to Sell of
                          which specific performance is claimed, but if that title was in pursuance to
                          an Agreement of a date earlier to the date of the Agreement of which
                          specific performance was claimed, then the plaintiff is not entitled to the
                          relief of specific performance.

                          making purchase of the property was in actual possession of such
                          property. Considering the effect of

                          pendency of a suit for specific performance, the owner sold the property
                          to another person and the contention of bonafide purchaser was examined.
                          It was held that the defence of bonafide purchase is not applicable during
                          lis pendens.


                          67.    This plea of being unaware of the prior Agreement to Sell or of
                          bona fide purchase does not come to the rescue of the Objectors.
                          No Relief of possession is claimed:



                          68.    The Objectors have taken the ground that the decree in the present
                          suit was for the Specific Performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 14th
                          February, 1986 in respect of the suit property in favour of the DH. The
                          fundamental question which has arisen is whether the DH can claim
                          possession when the JD himself was not in physical possession thereof. In
                          addition to this, no relief with respect to delivery of possession was
                          granted even though it was one of the reliefs sought in the Suit. The DH
                          is, therefore, not entitled to seek possession.

                          69.    There has been a divergence of opinion in various judgements as to
                          whether the possession can be delivered while executing a Decree for
                          Specific Performance, when no relief of possession is sought. To obviate
                          the confusion, the Law Commission in its 9 th Report submitted on 19th
                          July, 1958 recommended introduction of 
Section 22
 of the Specific Relief
                          Act, 1963 which provided that no relief in a Suit for Specific Performance

                          may be granted unless it is specifically claimed.          
Section 22
 of the
                          Specific Relief Act, 1963 was thus introduced which reads as under:

                                ―
Section 22
. Power to grant relief for possession, partition,
                                refund of earnest money, etc.--(1) Notwithstanding anything to
                                the contrary contained in 
the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908 (5 of
                                1908), any person suing for the specific performance of a contract
                                for the transfer of immovable property may, in an appropriate
                                case, ask for--

                                (a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the
                                property, in addition to such performance; or

                                (b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the
                                refund of any earnest money or deposit paid or made by him, in
                                case his claim for specific performance is refused.
                                (2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall
                                be granted by the court unless it has been specifically claimed:

                                Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in
                                the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow
                                him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including
                                a claim for such relief.

                                (3) The power of the court to grant relief under clause (b) of
                                subsection (1) shall be without prejudice to its powers to award
                                compensation under 
Section 21
."



 
70.      There is no doubt that no specific relief of possession has been
                          granted despite a prayer being made for the same. This aspect was
                          considered by the Madras High Court in 
S.S Rajabather vs. N.A. Sayeed

                          AIR 1974 Mad 289, held that if the relief of Specific Performance of a
                          Contract for Sale was granted by a Decree, everything which was
                          necessary for the contract to be specifically performed, can be ordered and
                          informed in the execution.




                          EX.P. 282/2012                                                    Page 25 of 28

                          71.      
In 
Gyasa vs. Smt. Risalo
 AIR 1977 Allahabad 156, Allahabad High
                          court held that it was not always incumbent on the plaintiff to claim
                          possession of partition or separate possession in a suit for specific
                          performance of the contract for the transfer of immovable property. This
                          is to be done where the circumstances so demand. The relief of specific
                          performance of the contract of sale embraces within its ambit not only
                          execution of sale deed but also possession of the property which is the
                          subject matter of the sale deed.
 
Similar observations were made in
                          
Narayana Pillai Krishna Pillai vs. Ponnuswami ChettiarSubbalekshmi
                          Ammal
 AIR 1978 Kerala 236; by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High
                          Court in 
Debabrata Tarafder vs. Biraj Mohan Bardhan
 AIR 1983
                          Calcutta 51, Sm. Dhiraj BalaKaria Vs. Jethia Estate Pvt. Ltd 1982 SCC
                          OnLine Cal 152.


 
72.      A similar situation, as in hand, was discussed by the Hon'ble Apex
                          Court in 
Babu Lal vs. Hazari Lal Kishori Lal & Ors.
 (1982) 1 SCC 525,
                          wherein it was observed that the expression "in an appropriate case"


                          appearing in Sub-Section (1) of 
Section 22
 of the Act implies that a relief
                          of possession has to be sought against the third person as he is not bound
                          by the Contract to be enforced. The Hon'ble Apex Court further observed
                          that the relief of possession can be granted to the Decree Holder where the
                          property is agreed to be conveyed by virtue of an Agreement to Sell. The
                          argument that the plaintiff must claim possession in a Suit for Specific
                          Performance of a Contract in all cases was also negated as 
Section 22
 of
                          the Specific Relief Act, 1963 talks of relief of possession in appropriate
                          cases.

73.    Supreme Court in 
S. Sampoornam Vs. P.V. Kuppuswamy
 2007 SCC
                          OnLine Mad 365 reiterated the same principle and held that even in the
                          absence of prayer for possession, once the suit for specific performance is
                          decreed, the court has got every power to order delivery of possession as
                          per the proviso to 
Section 22 (2)
 of the specific Relief Act.


 
74.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Manickam Thandapani & Anr. vs.
                          Vasantha
 2022 Live Law (SC) 395 referred to the aforementioned
                          judgements and emphasized that the phrase "in an appropriate case"


                          stated in Sub-
Section 1
 of 
Section 22
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 does
                          not mandatorily require that possession has to be claimed and granted in
                          every Suit for Specific Performance of Agreement to Sell. It is only
                          where the plaintiff/third party acquires the title to the property alone in the
                          Suit for Specific Performance and his claim for possession/partition is
                          based on independent rights, then in such case, the delivery of possession
                          cannot be granted to the Decree Holder merely on execution of Sale Deed
                          which is in consonance with 
Section 55(1)
 of Transfer of Property Act,
                          1882. However, in cases where the Agreement to Sell itself envisages the
                          handing over of the possession to the Decree Holder, then it may not be
                          necessary for the Decree Holder to have specifically claimed possession
                          over the property as provided in 
Section 22 (1)
 of the Specific Relief Act,
                          1963. It was thus concluded that though 
Section 22 (2)
 of the Act, which
                          is in negative language, states that "no relief under clause (a) or clause

                          (b) of Sub-Section (1) shall be granted by the court unless it has been
                          specifically claimed", but the proviso thereto takes out the mandatory
                          nature from the substantive provision and allows the plaintiff to amend the
                          plaint "at any stage of the proceeding". The Hon'ble Apex Court


                          EX.P. 282/2012                                                    Page 27 of 28

                          explained that any "stage of proceeding" would include the proceedings
                          in Suit, in appeal and also in execution. The proviso to 
Section 22(2)

                          makes the provision directory with no penal consequences. 
Section 22(2)

                          of the Act only contains the rule of prudence to ask for possession "in an
                          appropriate case". It cannot be said that it is a mandatory provision or
                          that the relief of possession cannot be granted in a Decree for Specific
                          Performance in the absence of there being a specific relief so granted.

                          75.    It may be thus concluded that even though the relief for possession
                          had not been granted in the Decree, but it is inherent in the Decree for
                          Specific Performance of the Agreement to Sell. The decree holder is,
                          therefore, entitled to the relief of possession.

                          76.    It is thus concluded that there is no merit in the present application
                          under 
Section 47
 of CPC, 1908 filed by the applicants, Ms. Meera Rani
                          Gupta and Ms. Nalini Gupta and the same is accordingly dismissed.
