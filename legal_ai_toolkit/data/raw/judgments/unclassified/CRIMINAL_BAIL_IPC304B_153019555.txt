                           2.1       On 29th November 2023, an intimation was received at P.S. Krishna
                          Nagar from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital,4 Delhi, reporting that Smt.
                          Gurpreet Kaur, wife of Shri Karanjeet Singh, aged 24 years, had been
                          brought to the hospital by her husband (the Applicant) following an incident
                          of alleged hanging that occurred at House No. 17/12, 2nd Floor, Krishna
                          Nagar, Delhi. The attending medical officer at GTB Hospital declared her
                          "brought dead" as per MLC No. 462/11/23. The said DD Entry was
                          assigned to SI Naresh Kumar for necessary action.

                          2.2       SI Naresh Kumar, accompanied by HC Sunil and the Applicant,
                          reached the location where the incident occurred. Smt. Prableen Kaur,
                          (sister-in law of the Applicant) was also present. The Crime team inspected
                          the scene of crime and took photographs. Broken bathroom tiles were
                          seized.

                          2.3       Co-accused Prableen Kaur, produced a multicoloured chunni, stating
                          it had been used by the deceased to hang herself from a ceiling fan in the
                          bathroom. She disclosed that she broken open the bathroom door; untied the
                          chunni from around the neck of the deceased and ceiling fan; and placed it
                          inside a cupboard in the room. The chunni was seized by SI Naresh Kumar.
                          2.4       Since the death of the deceased had occurred within 7 years of
                          marriage, in compliance with 
Section 176
 Cr.P.C., an intimation was sent to
                          the SDM, Vivek Vihar to hold inquest. Statements of the parents of the
                          deceased were recorded by the Executive Magistrate. They alleged that the
                          deceased had married the Applicant on 12th December, 2022, and had since
                          been subjected to physical and mental abuse by the Applicant and his
                          family. Specific allegations included dowry demands, including a car, and
                          claims that the marriage had not been consummated. The deceased was

                           allegedly made to live in a bedroom without a door. An illicit relationship
                          was also alleged between the Applicant and co-accused Prableen Kaur.
                          2.5      The impugned FIR was lodged pursuant to these allegations. The
                          Applicant was arrested on 1st December 2023, along with co-accused
                          Prabhjeet Singh (brother-in-law of the deceased) and Jitender Singh (father-
                          in-law of the deceased). Co-accused Prableen Kaur was arrested on 2nd
                          December 2023.

                          2.6      A post-mortem examination of the deceased was conducted on 30th
                          November, 2023. The autopsy surgeon opined, "the cause of death is
                          asphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging and viscera of disease has been
                          preserved for investigation". Viscera was preserved and sent to CFSL
                          Hyderabad for chemical examination, which later reported no detection of
                          common poisons, pesticides, alkaloids, or drugs.
                          2.7      The mobile phones of the Applicant and co-accused Prableen Kaur
                          were seized. The WhatsApp chats revealed that the Applicant used abusive
                          and vulgar language regarding the deceased in his conversations with co-
                          accused Prableen Kaur. Both the phones were submitted to FSL, Rohini,
                          Delhi, for the retrieval of deleted data, the results of which are awaited.
                          2.8      The chargesheet was filed on 24th February, 2024 before the Trial
                          Court, and charges were framed against the Applicant and Prableen Kaur
                          under 
Sections 498A

                          Applicant's Case

                          3.       The Counsel for the Applicant seeks grant of bail on the following
                          grounds:

                          3.1      The Applicant is innocent, and has been falsely implicated at the
                          behest of the mother of the deceased with ulterior motives.

                           have been framed. The Applicant has already undergone over a year of
                          incarceration as an undertrial, and the trial is likely to take considerable
                          time. Continued detention at this stage infringes the Applicant's right to a
                          speedy trial under 
Article 21
 of the Constitution of India.
                          3.3   The charges framed against the Applicant are identical to those faced
                          by co-accused Prabhleen Kaur, who was granted bail in December 2023.
                          Bail is thus sought on the principle of parity.

                          3.4   The Applicant requires surgical intervention, which can only be
                          administered at a medical facility outside jail. Prior to his arrest, the
                          Applicant had been suffering from kidney stones, causing abdominal pain.
                          An Ultrasound of the abdomen conducted on 16 th August 2023 revealed the
                          presence of a 4 mm concretion in his right kidney, accompanied by left-
                          sided hydroureteronephrosis with a dilated upper ureter. His condition has
                          since deteriorated, with the stone enlarging to 17 mm.
                          3.5   The post-mortem report does not mention any anti-mortem injuries.
                          3.6   Neither the Applicant, nor his parents or any of his relatives ever
                          made any demand for dowry, either before or during marriage. In such
                          circumstances, it is wholly unreasonable to presume that any such demand
                          would have arisen subsequently, particularly after the parties had spent a
                          substantial period together post-marriage. Significantly, no complaint was
                          ever lodged by the deceased, her parents, or any other family member
                          against the Applicant or his relatives regarding any dowry demand during
                          her lifetime. The allegations in the FIR have been made only after the death
                          of the deceased, seemingly under external influence, with ulterior motives.
                          3.7   Pertinently, during the hearing of the bail application of co-accused
                          Prableen Kaur before the ASJ, the deceased's mother categorically admitted
                          that no dowry was given at the time of marriage. The said fact was duly

                           recorded in the order dated 22nd December 2023, wherein it was observed:

                                   "On being enquired by the Court, the mother of the deceased/ complainant
                                   stated that during the marriage no dowry was given."



                          3.8      The Applicant was not present at the scene of the incident when the
                          deceased committed suicide. He was at work and called the deceased around
                          lunchtime. On learning of the incident, he rushed home, took her to the
                          hospital, and informed her father. He remained fully cooperative.
                          3.9      Statements of the deceased's parents under 
Section 161
 Cr.P.C. differ
                          materially from their testimonies in court, which reflect an improved
                          version. The original statements lacked key allegations subsequently
                          introduced in the testimonies.

                          3.10 The allegation of dowry demand is vague and unsubstantiated, and
                          lacks any specific timeframe. Allegations of demand made "subsequent to
                          marriage" do not meet the legal threshold of "soon before death".
                          Respondents' Case

                          4.       On the other hand, Mr. Amit Ahlawat, APP for the State, and Mr.
                          Aman Akhtar, Counsel for the Complainant, strongly oppose the request.
                          Mr. Ahlawat contends that the allegations levelled against the Applicant
                          involve the serious offence of dowry death under 
Section 304B
 IPC, a
                          charge that carries a presumption of culpability against the husband and his
                          relatives where the death of a woman occurs within seven years of marriage
                          under suspicious circumstances. It is submitted that the material on record,
                          including the testimonies of the deceased's parents, indicate that the
                          deceased was subjected to sustained harassment, both physical and
                          emotional, by the Applicant and co-accused, Prableen Kaur. The nature of
                          abuse was not limited to dowry demands, but extended to personal
                          humiliation and denial of marital rights, as alleged in the statements

                           recorded before the Executive Magistrate and in Court. Further, Mr.
                          Ahlawat highlights the content of WhatsApp chats retrieved from the
                          Applicant's mobile phone, which contains vulgar and derogatory remarks
                          made against the deceased. These communications lend prima facie support
                          to the Prosecution's contention of persistent cruelty.

                          5.         Mr. Aman Akhtar, counsel for the Complainant, adds that the parents
                          of the deceased have consistently reiterated the allegation of unlawful
                          demands made soon before the death of the deceased. He argues that the
                          Applicant's conduct points not only to domestic cruelty, but also to a
                          potential motive tied to his extra-marital involvement. He asserts that
                          granting bail at this stage would not only undermine the gravity of the
                          charge, but may also embolden the Applicant to influence or intimidate key
                          Prosecution witnesses. Both counsel stress that the seriousness of the
                          offence, the nature of evidence available, and the possibility of interference
                          with the trial process strongly weigh against the grant of bail. They urge the
                          Court to consider the statutory presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the
                          Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which squarely applies in this case, and to deny
                          the Applicant the relief sought.

                                     and they are said to be:

                                    (a) death of a woman must have been caused by any burns or bodily
                                    injury or her death must have occurred otherwise than under normal
                                    circumstances;

                                    (b) such death must have occurred within seven years of her marriage;

                                    (c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected to cruelty or
                                    harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and

                                    (d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with the demand
                                    for dowry."



                          7.       These four conditions form the statutory foundation for invoking the
                          presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Indian Evidence Act, which shifts
                          the burden onto the accused to rebut the same. However, this presumption is
                          not absolute, and must be preceded by the establishment of foundational
                          facts as required under 
Section 304B
 IPC, including the specific allegation
                          of dowry-related harassment occurring "soon before death".

                          8.       The death of a young woman within a year of marriage, under
                          unnatural circumstances, inevitably invites serious legal scrutiny. Yet, even
                          in such tragic cases, the Court must assess whether the evidentiary
                          foundation laid by the prosecution aligns with the statutory requirements. On
                          closer examination, prima facie the material on record in this case reveals
                          significant ambiguities and lacks the specificity that 
Section 304B
 IPC
                          demands. The allegation of dowry demand, primarily the alleged demand for
                          a car, finds mention only in the post-incident statements made by the family
                          of the deceased. Pertinently, there is no contemporaneous complaint by the
                          deceased, her parents, or any other relative during her lifetime alleging
                          harassment or demand for dowry.

                          9.       Furthermore, the statements of the deceased's family members are
                          devoid of specific details, particularly with respect to the date, time, or
                          frequency of the alleged demands. 
In this regard, it is crucial to refer to the

16. The aforesaid position was emphasized by this Court, in the case of
                                      
Kans Raj v. State of Punjab
, (2000) 5 SCC 207, wherein the three-Judge
                                      Bench held that:


 
"15. ... "Soon before" is a relative term which is required to be
                                      considered under specific circumstances of each case and no straitjacket
                                      formula can be 
laid down by
 fixing any time­limit. ... In relation to dowry
                                      deaths, the circumstances showing the existence of cruelty or harassment
                                      to the deceased are not restricted to a particular instance but normally
                                      refer to a course of conduct. Such conduct may be spread over a period
                                      of time. .... Proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on
                                      dowry demand and the consequential death is required to be proved by
                                      the prosecution. The demand of dowry, cruelty or harassment based upon
                                      such demand and the date of death should not be too remote in time
                                      which, under the circumstances, be treated as having become stale
                                      enough."


                                                                                           (emphasis supplied).

 
A similar view was taken by this Court in 
Rajinder Singh v. State of
                                      Punjab
, (2015) 6 SCC 477.


                                      17. Therefore, Courts should use their discretion to determine if the
                                      period between the cruelty or harassment and the death of the victim
                                      would come within the term "soon before". What is pivotal to the above
                                      determination, is the establishment of a "proximate and live link"

                                      between the cruelty and the consequential death of the victim."

                                                                                           [Emphasis Supplied]


                          10.        Therefore, it is a well-settled principle of law that, for the invocation
                          of 
Section 304B
 IPC, it is mandatory to establish that the cruelty or
                          harassment inflicted upon the deceased occurred "soon before her death",
                          demonstrating a proximate and live link between such cruelty and the
                          consequential demise of the victim. In the present case, the absence of any
                          proximate allegation of dowry-related harassment close in time to the death
                          in the present case, creates a doubt in the case of the Prosecution.

 
11.        At this stage, the Court is not to conduct a mini-trial, nor would it be
                          appropriate to render findings that might prejudice either side. However, for
                          the limited purpose of assessing whether the statutory presumption under

Section 304B
 IPC stands attracted, a prima facie examination of the record
                          is warranted. In her testimony, the mother of the deceased stated that she,
                          along with other family members, frequently visited the deceased's
                          matrimonial home, and celebrated occasions such as Lohri, Makar
                          Sankranti, and Diwali, together with the Applicant's family. She further
                          acknowledged having attended the birthday celebration of co-accused
                          Prableen Kaur on 27th November 2023 at her daughter's matrimonial home,
                          just two days prior to the unfortunate incident. This conduct, viewed in
                          context, suggests that the deceased and her family remained on civil, if not
                          cordial, terms with the Applicant's family until very shortly before her
                          death. Prima facie, the record does not disclose any immediate or proximate
                          instance of dowry-related cruelty or harassment that could satisfy the
                          threshold of "soon before her death", thereby creating further doubt in the
                          Prosecution's version.

 
12.   It has further been alleged that the Applicant was involved in an illicit
                          relationship with co-accused Prableen Kaur, and that the deceased
                          purportedly discovered them in a compromising position on two occasions
                          in August 2023. While such allegations may carry emotional and moral
                          weight, their veracity and relevance are matters that will be determined at
                          trial. However, even assuming arguendo that such a relationship existed, or
                          that vulgar or demeaning language was exchanged via WhatsApp between
                          the Applicant and his co-accused in reference to the deceased, these facts,
                          stand alone, do not, prima facie, at this stage, disclose the specific
                          ingredients of cruelty or harassment in connection with a dowry demand.

                           be a ground to implicate the accused under 
Section 304B
 IPC. Such
                          allegations, as noted above, must be accompanied by conduct (i) linked to a
                          dowry demand, and (ii) shown to have occurred soon before the death of the
                          woman, in order to attract the offence under 
Section 304B
 IPC.


                          13.       This Court remains fully conscious of the societal gravity and
                          enduring prevalence of dowry deaths. Such offences strike at the
                          foundations of dignity, equality, and justice in domestic life. 
In 
Shabeen
                          Ahmad v. State of U.P.,9
 the Supreme Court cautioned that the grant of bail
                          in such cases must not be mechanical or perfunctory, and that courts are
                          required to exercise measured and informed judicial discretion, having
                          regard not only to the seriousness of the charge, but also to the broader
                          implications of such offences on social conscience. However, the
                          observations in Shabeen Ahmad cannot be read as laying down a blanket
                          prohibition against the grant of bail in every case under 
Section 304B
 IPC.
                          Rather, the Court reaffirmed that bail decisions must rest on the individual
                          facts and circumstances of each case, the nature and weight of the evidence,
                          and the overall context in which the allegations are situated.


                          14.       In view of the above discussion, and upon a prima facie assessment of
                          the material on record, this Court is of the considered opinion that the
                          Applicant has made out a case for grant of bail, particularly with respect to
                          the allegations under 
Section 304B
 IPC.

                          15.       As for the alternative offence under 
Section 306
 IPC, law demands a
                          threshold that is both high and precise. The Supreme Court has consistently
                          emphasized that, for a charge under 
Section 306
 IPC to be sustained, the
                          accused must have instigated, provoked, or engaged in facilitating or

encouraging the commission of suicide. The Prosecution, in such cases,
                          must be in a position to furnish evidence to establish beyond reasonable
                          doubt that any act or omission of the accused instigated the deceased to
                          commit suicide.10 In this context, the Supreme Court, in 
Ramesh Kumar v.
                          State of Chhattisgarh,11
 observed as follows:


                                      "20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to
                                      do "an act". To satisfy the requirement of instigation though it is not
                                      necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what
                                      constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of
                                      the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence
                                      must be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not a case where
                                      the accused had by his acts or omission or by a continued course of
                                      conduct created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no
                                      other option except to commit suicide in which case an instigation may
                                      have been inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without
                                      intending the consequences to actually follow cannot be said to be
                                      instigation."



                          16.        In the present case, prima facie, neither the Complainant nor the
                          Prosecution has alleged that the Applicant engaged in behaviour amounting
                          to instigation, threat, or sustained cruelty of such a nature as to trigger the
                          deceased's suicide. There is no indication of affirmative acts, whether by
                          commission or omission, that drove the deceased to a state of desperation
                          immediately preceding her death. Consequently, the statutory threshold for
                          invoking 
Section 306
 IPC prima facie remains unsatisfied. The only
                          allegations raised pertain to an alleged demand for a car as dowry, and an
                          alleged extra-marital relationship between the Applicant and his sister-in-
                          law. However, Courts have consistently held that mere suspicion of an extra-
                          marital affair, however morally reprehensible it may seem, does not per se
                          amount to abetment of suicide. The Supreme Court, in K.V. Prakash Babu

                                       individualistic perception regard being had to one's endurance and
                                       sensitivity. It is difficult to generalize but certainly it can be appreciated
                                       in a set of established facts. Extra-marital relationship, per se, or as such
                                       would not come within the ambit of 
Section 498-A
 IPC. It would be an
                                       illegal or immoral act, but other ingredients are to be brought home so
                                       that it would constitute a criminal offence. There is no denial of the fact
                                       that the cruelty need not be physical but a mental torture or abnormal
                                       behaviour that amounts to cruelty or harassment in a given case. It will
                                       depend upon the facts of the said case. To explicate, solely because the
                                       husband is involved in an extra-marital relationship and there is some
                                       suspicion in the mind of wife, that cannot be regarded as mental
                                       cruelty which would attract mental cruelty for satisfying the ingredients
                                       of 
Section 306
 IPC."



                          17.        The Supreme Court clarified that, an extra-marital relationship per se
                          may not come within the ambit of 
Section 498-A
 IPC. In order to determine
                          as to whether such a relationship amounts to cruelty to attract the offence
                          under 
Section 306
 IPC, the other essential ingredients of the said offence
                          will also need to be satisfied, which will depend upon the specific facts and
                          circumstances of each individual case. In the present case, the existence and
                          fulfilment of such ingredients are issues to be adjudicated after conclusion of
                          the trial. Nonetheless, at this preliminary stage, the Court is of the prima
                          facie opinion that the invocation of 
Section 306
 IPC does not warrant the
                          denial of the relief of bail to the Applicant.

 
18.        It is also pertinent to note that the father-in-law and brother-in-law of
                          the deceased have already been discharged, and the sister-in-law, who faces
                          identical charges as the Applicant, has been granted bail. The Applicant was
                          arrested on 1st December, 2023 and has remained in judicial custody for over
                          one year. During this period, the Applicant was granted interim bail, and

                           there is nothing on record to suggest that he misused the liberty extended to
                          him. The investigation stands concluded, and the charge sheet has already
                          been filed. The case is presently at the stage of prosecution evidence, and
                          given the nature of allegations and the number of witnesses cited, the trial is
                          unlikely to conclude in the near future. In these circumstances, continued
                          incarceration of the Applicant would serve no fruitful purpose.

                          19.      It is well-established that the object of granting bail is neither punitive
                          nor preventative. The primary aim sought to be achieved by bail is to secure
                          the attendance of the accused person at the trial.13 Accordingly, in light of
                          the foregoing facts and circumstances, the Applicant is directed to be
                          released on bail on furnishing a personal bond for a sum of INR 50,000/-
                          with two sureties of the like amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial
                          Court/Duty MM, on the following conditions:

                          a.       The Applicant will not leave the country without prior permission of
                          the Court.

                          b.       The Applicant shall provide permanent address to the Trial Court. The
                          Applicant shall intimate the Court by way of an affidavit and to the IO
                          regarding any change in his residential address.
                          c.       The Applicant shall appear before the Court as and when the matter is
                          taken up for hearing.

 
d.       The Applicant shall provide all mobile numbers to the concerned IO,
                          which shall be kept in working condition at all times.
                          e.       The Applicant shall not switch off his phone or change his mobile
                          number without prior intimation to the concerned IO.
                          f.       The Applicant will report to the concerned IO on the second and

                          more than an hour.

                          g.       The Applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity and shall not
                          communicate with or come in contact with any of the prosecution witnesses,
                          or tamper with the evidence of the case.

                          20.      In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry / complaint lodged
                          against the Applicant, it would be open to the State to seek redressal by
                          filing an application seeking cancellation of bail.

                          21.      Needless to state, any observations made in the present order are for
                          the purpose of deciding the present bail application and should not influence
                          the outcome of the trial and also not be taken as an expression of opinion on
                          the merits of the case.

                          22.      A copy of the order be sent to the Jail Superintendent for information
                          and necessary compliance.

                          23.      The bail application is allowed in the afore-mentioned terms.
