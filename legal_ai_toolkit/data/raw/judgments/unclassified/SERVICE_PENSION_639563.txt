JUDGMENT:


      SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI, J.



 
Leave  is	 granted.  This appeal, an off-shoot of	 the
judgment  of this Court in 
Common Cause vs.  Union of  India

[1987  (1) SCC 142], arises from the judgment and order of a
Division  Bench	 of the Madras High Court in  Writ  Petition
No.12381 of 1996 dated January 22, 1998.  The appellant, who
is  a Senior Advocate and a member of the Madras High  Court
Bar, filed writ petition No.12381 of 1996, a public interest
litigation,   in  the  High   Court  of	 Madras	 challenging
Memorandum  No.34/2/86-P&PW(G) dated August 22, 1990  issued
by  Department	of Pension and Pensioner's Welfare and	also
the letter dated September 26, 1990, applying the above said
Memorandum  to	the  Department	 of  Justice,  and   seeking
declaration that it does not apply to the Judges of the High
Courts and the Supreme Court of India.	The substance of the
appellant's  case before the High Court was that the Supreme
Court  had issued direction that payment of reduced  pension
on  account  of	 commutation of a part of the pension  of  a
Government  employee should be only for a period of 15 years
"from the date of retirement", but the Union of India issued
impugned  Memorandum  changing	it  to	"from  the  date  of
commutation  of	 pension".
 
The  Union	 of  India,  in	 its
counter-affidavit,  stated that the Supreme Court  clarified
the  direction	given  in  
Common   Cause
  (supra)  in	 its
subsequent  judgment that the period of 15 years be reckoned
from  the  date	 of  commutation and not from  the  date  of
retirement.   Pursuant	to the subsequent judgment  of	this
Court,	Government  of India revised its earlier  Memorandum
No.34/2/86-P&PW	 dated March 5, 1987 and brought into  force
the  impugned  Memorandum.  A Division Bench of	 the  Madras
High  Court,  taking note of the various judgments  of	this
Court,	dismissed  the writ petition by order dated  January
22,  1998.   It	 is against that judgment,  this  appeal  is
preferred.   Mr.R.  Venkataraman, learned senior counsel for
the   appellant,  strenuously  contended   that	  once	 the
Government  of India accepted in principle that the commuted
pension would be recovered for a period of 15 years from the
date  of  retirement  and  the same had	 culminated  into  a
direction  of  this Court, they could not have	unilaterally
changed	 the same to reckon the period of 15 years from	 the
date  of  commutation of pension.  The learned	counsel	 has
submitted  that	 under	the Pension Rules, a  pensioner	 can
commute	 a  part of his pension only within one year of	 the
date  of retirement, therefore, the stand of the  Government
that  those  who applied for and got their pension  commuted
just  on  the verge of the completion of 15 years  would  be
able  to  claim	 their full pension after a  few  months  of
deduction  was	without	 any  basis.   Mr.   A.S.   Nambiar,
learned	 senior	 counsel appearing for the respondents,	 has
argued	that  the period of 15 years is fixed on  the  basis
that the commuted pension would normally be recovered within
the  said  period;  when the commutation of pension and	 the
date  of  retirement synchronize, no difficulty would  arise
but  if	 the  pension  is commuted long after  the  date  of
retirement,  the  period of 15 years will be cut short	when
counted	 from  the date of retirement and in the result	 the
pensioners  will get an undue and unintended benefit of	 the
order  of  the Supreme Court.
 
In the case of  
Common  Cause

(supra),  it  was  represented before this Court in  a	Writ
Petition  under	 
Article  32
  of the  Constitution  that  on
commutation  of pension the amount paid to the pensioner  in
lump  sum  by  the Government would be	recovered  from	 his
pension	 within a period of 12 years, there was,  therefore,
no  justification for the Government to pay reduced  pension
for  the  rest	of the life of the  pensioner.	 This  Court
desired	 that  the Government might give a new look  to	 the
application  of	 Central  Civil	  Service  (Commutation	  of
Pension)  Rules, 1981.	The Government took decision in	 the
matter	and  communicated  the	 same  through	the  learned
Attorney General, which is in the following terms :




      "(i) Recovery from pension payable every month towards
commuted  value of pension will stop on the completion of 15
years  from  the date of retirement on superannuation or  on
the  pensioner completing the age of 70 years, whichever  is
later.



      (ii)  The	 formulation  will  apply  to  all  civilian
pensioners   in	 whose	case  the   age	 of  retirement	  on
superannuation is 58 years and the personnel of Armed Forces
in  whose case the retirement age varies in accordance	with
the  colour  service prescribed for the rank (attaining	 the
age of 37/38 years or more).



      (iii) Government have taken this decision as an act of
goodwill to pensioners and to extend to them some measure of
relief	in  the	 evening of their lives.   It  is  sincerely
believed  that there will be no further demand on this issue
and  that  the	pensioners will accept the decision  of	 the
Government without dissent or reservation.



      (iv) The decision will take effect prospectively (from
April 1, 1986)."



      In  hoc  the  first point, this  Court  considered  it
unnecessary  to refer to the age of commuting pensioner	 for
restoration of full pension to him but on taking note of the
facts  that  the  lump sum amount would fetch  benefit	like
interest  and  there  is  also an element  of  risk  factor,
directed by its judgment dated December 9, 1986 that "on the
expiry	of  15	years from the period  of  retirement"	full
pension	 should be restored.  
In terms of 
the said judgment
,
the  Government	 issued Memorandum dated March 5, 1987.
 
In
Welfare Association of Absorbed Central Government Employees
in  Public Enterprises vs.  Union of India & Ors.  [1991 (2)
SCC  265],  the	 question canvassed before  this  Court	 was
whether	 Central Government employees, who had taken benefit
of the judgment in 
Common Cause
 (supra) and subsequently got
absorbed in Public Enterprises, were entitled to the benefit
of   that   judgment  again  on	  retirement   from   public
enterprises.  While negativing their claim, it was observed,
"this  court for the reasons indicated in the judgment	came
to  hold  that	on  expiry  of 15 years	 from  the  date  of
commutation   the  entire  pension   revived."
 
From	this
observation  it	 can be noticed that the judgment in  
Common
Cause
  (supra) was neither modified nor clarified.
 
What all
can  be inferred is that this Court in Welfare Association's
case (supra) understood the words "on the expiry of 15 years
from  the  period of retirement" in 
Common Cause
 (supra)  as
"15  years from the date of commutation....".
  The  judgment
in  Welfare  Association case (supra) was rendered on  April
12, 1990.  It is only pursuant to that judgment, the counter
affidavit recites, the Government revised its earlier Office
Memorandum  dated  March 5, 1987 and brought into force	 the
impugned Office Memorandum dated August 22, 1990.  
In 
Bharat
Petroleum  Corporation Ltd.  Ex-Employees Association & Ors.
vs Chairman & Managing Director Bharat Petroleum Corporation
Ltd.,  Bombay  &  Ors.
	 [1993 (3) Scale  424],	 this  Court
extended the benefit of the judgment in 
Common Cause
 (supra)
to  the clerical employees of Bharat Petroleum.	 There	also
the words "period of 15 years from the period of retirement"


were  understood as "15 years from the date of commutation".

In  Welfare  Association  of   Absorbed	 Central  Government
Employees  in 
Public Enterprises & Ors.	 vs.  Union of India
&  Anr.
	  [AIR	1996  SC 1201], the  relief  sought  by	 the
pensioners  in	their  petition	 under	
Article	 32
  of	 the
Constitution  was  :   restoration of 1/3rd portion  of	 the
fully  commuted pension as per the decision of this Court in

Common	Cause
 (supra).	A three-Judge Bench, of which one of
us (Venkataswami,J.) was a member, reiterated the principles
applied	 in the aforementioned cases.  Indeed, the date from
which  15 years pension was to be reckoned was not in  issue
there.
 
This Court strikes at arbitrary action of the State
and  accordingly  it  did  in	
Common	Cause
  (supra),	  by
interdicting  the  arbitrary  action of	 the  Government  in
paying	the  reduced pension as a result of  commutation  of
1/3rd pension for the rest of the life of the pensioners and
issued	an  equitable direction to restore the full  pension
after  15  years "from the period of the retirement" to	 the
pensioners  who	 had  commuted 1/3rd of	 the  pension.	 The
period	of  15 years has been arrived at after	taking	into
consideration  various	factors	 mentioned   above.   It  is
well-settled principle that the words in the judgment of the
Court  cannot be interpreted as the words in a statute.	  By
the  said direction this Court never intended to confer	 any
unfair	or  undue  advantage  on the  pensioners.   It	only
ensured fairness in the treatment of pensioners at the hands
of  the	 Government  in	 respect  of  deduction	 of  pension
consequent  upon  the  commutation  of the  portion  of	 the
pension.
 
The	decision  in 
Common Cause
 (supra)  has	been
understood  in all subsequent judgments of this Court as  15
years  from the date of commutation and we are in respectful
agreement with the same.  This neither prejudices the rights
of  any	 of  the  parties nor confers any  undue  or  unfair
advantage  upon	 any party.
 
From the above  discussion,  it
follows	 that  the impugned Memorandum does not	 incorporate
any  condition	contrary  to the judgment of this  Court  in

Common	Cause
 (supra).	The High Court was, therefore, right
in  dismissing the writ petition.  We find no illegality  in
the  order  of the High Court.	The appeal fails and  it  is
accordingly dismissed.	No costs.
