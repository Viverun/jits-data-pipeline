                                                        ORDER



                                This revision raises an interesting question as to the Court fee

                      payable in an appeal against an order determining the share of the income

                      from the properties to be divided between the parties in a suit for partition.




                                2. The suit in O.S.No.493 of 1993 was filed by one Palaniandi and

                      the respondents 1 and 2 herein. Since Palaniandi died after the suit, his

                      legal representatives were brought on record and arrayed as respondents 3 to

                      6 herein. A preliminary decree came to be passed by the Trial Court on

                      26.10.1998. An appeal was taken there from to this Court in A.S.No.861 of

                      1998, which came to be disposed of on 22.09.2008.                Thereafter, the

                      plaintiffs in the suit filed an application in I.A.No.172 of 2010 seeking

                      determination of the income from the suit properties. The application came

                      to be filed under Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C.





                                3. The learned Principal Sub-Ordinate Judge, Cuddalore by an

                      order dated 12.01.2016 fixed the income from the suit properties, which

                      resulted in a direction to the petitioner herein to pay a sum of

                                                                           C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      Rs.1,00,19,890/- with subsequent interest at 6% per annum from the date of

                      the suit till date of realization. Aggrieved by this fixation, the petitioner,

                      who is the sole defendant in the suit preferred an appeal in A.S.No.30 of

                      2016 on the file of the Principal District Judge, Cuddalore. The appeal was

                      valued under Section 37(2) of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation

                      Act and a fixed court fee of Rs.750/- was paid. The respondents herein filed

                      I.A.No.260 of 2016 under Section 44 r/w 52 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees

                      and Suits Valuation Act, directing the appellant to pay ad valorem court fee

                      at the rate of 7.5% contending that an appeal against an order determining

                      mesne profits ought to be valued under Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court

                      Fees and Suits Valuation Act and the Court fee payable is on the income

                      ascertained by the Court. They would also rely upon the direction made in

                      the order of the Trial Court requiring them to pay Court fee at 7.5% per

                      annum.





                                4. This application was opposed by the petitioner herein

                      contending that the order passed by the Trial court though on an application

                      under 
Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C
, is not an order ascertaining mesne profits.

                                                                              C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      It is actually an order passed under 
Order 20 Rule 18 of C.P.C
., where the

                      court is empowered to determine the share of the income of the parties as

                      per the preliminary decree. Therefore, according to the petitioner herein,

                      the appeal is not against an order passed under 
Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C
 as

                      Order 20 Rule 12 could be invoked only in cases where there is a decree for

                      possession against a person, who is found to be in illegal occupation of the

                      property.





                                  5. It is the further contention of the petitioner herein that Section

                      44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suit Valuation Act will apply only in

                      cases where a decree for mesne profits granted by the Court as against

                      person who is in illegal possession and not against the sharer in suit for

                      partition. On the above contentions, the petitioner herein claim that the

                      court fee that has been paid is just and proper. The learned Principal

                      District Judge, who heard the application concluded that since the appeal is

                      against an order determining mesne profits under Order 20 Rule 12, it is

                      
Section 44
 of the Court fee Act that would apply and therefore, the appellant

                      ought to have valued the appeal and paid ad valorem court fee at 7.5% of

                                                                               C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      the share of the income that was determined by the Trial Court. It is the

                      correctness of this order, which is questioned in this revision.




                                  6.   I have heard Mr.V.Raghavachari, learned counsel for the

                      petitioner, Mr.N.Suresh, learned counsel for the contesting respondents.

                      Since the matter involved in payment of Court fee, I had directed issuance

                      of notice to the Additional Government Pleader (CS) and I have heard

                      Mr.Y.T.Aravind Gosh, learned Additional Government Pleader (CS) also.




                                  7. The application before the Trial Court namely, the application

                      in I.A.No.172 of 2010 was filed under 
Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C
. 
Order 20

                      Rule 12 of C.P.C
 reads as follows:-



                             “12. Decree for possession and mesne profits.- (1) Where a suit
                             is for the recovery of possession of immovable property and for
                             rent or mesne profits, the court may pass a decree—


                             (a) for the possession of the property;



                             (b) for the rents which have accrued on the property during the
                             period prior to the institution of the suit or direction an inquiry as
                             to such rent;

                                                                              C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                             profits;



                             (c) directing an inquiry as to rent or mesne profits from the
                             institution of the suit until—


                             (i) the delivery of possession to the decree holder,


                             (ii) the relinquishment of possession by the judgment debtor with
                             notice to the decree holder through the court, or


                             (iii) the expiration of three years from the date of the decree,
                             whichever event first occurs.



                                        (2) Where an inquiry is directed under clause (b) or

                             clause (c), a final decree in respect of the rent or mesne profits

                             shall be passed in accordance with the result of such inquiry.



                                        (3) Where an Appellate Court directs such an inquiry, it
                             may direct the Court of first instance to make the inquiry, and in
                             every case the Court of first instance may of its own accord, and
                             shall whenever moved to do so by the decree holder inquire and
                             pass the final decree.”

                                  A very reading of the above provision would show that it will not

                      apply to a suit for partition.



                                  7. Subsection 12 of 
Section 2
 of C.P.C defines the term mesne

                                                                           C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      profits and it reads as follows:-



                                      “(12)"Mesne profits” of property means those profits
                             which the person in wrongful possession of such property actually
                             received or might with ordinary diligence have received
                             therefrom, together with interest on such profits, but shall not
                             include profits due to improvements made by the person in
                             wrongful possession.”




                                 8. From the definition, it could be gathered that mesne profits is

                      referable to those profits, which a person in “wrongful possession”

                      received. As regards the partition action is concerned, the sharers are

                      deemed to be in joint possession and possession of one of the sharers is on

                      behalf of the others also. Therefore, it cannot be said that a sharer in

                      possession of a joint property is in wrongful possession of the property.

                      Therefore, a determination of the share of the income from the properties

                      subject matter of a partition suit cannot be termed as determining mesne

                      profits within the meaning of 
Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C
. The nature of

                      such determination is no longer res-integra. The nature and character of the

                      proceeds from the estate subject matter of a suit for partition was subject

                      matter of a several decisions of this Court as well as the other High Courts.




                                  9. 
In 
Ramaswami Iyer Vs. Subramania Iyer
 reported in AIR

                      1923 Mad 147, a Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court had an occasion to

                      consider the nature of the liability of a manager to account for profits

                      subsequent to the suit.
 After referring to the judgment of the Privy council

                      in Prithi Pal Vs. Jowahir singh reported in ILR 14 Cal 493, this Court had

                      observed as follows:-



                                       "8. As pointed out by their Lordships a member of a
                             Hindu family suing for partition and for the profits on his share is
                             really suing for an account of the profits received by the manager
                             or the persons in possession so that the proceeds so received by
                             the latter which are also divisible property, may be divided and
                             his share therein also given to him. As stated by their Lordships at
                             page 512, a sharer has a "clear right" to an account of the
                             profits received by the person in possession of the whole, and to
                             be awarded his share thereof, not as mesne profits received by a
                             person in wrongful possession but as appurtenant to the
                             plaintiff's right in his share of the lands.” (Emphasis Supplied)

                              which ultimately might fall to his share under the decree, (2) That

                                                                                 C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                                         (1) The court fee payable for a relief of partition in a
                              suit as well as In the appeal is only the fixed court fee payable
                              under Article 17-
B of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act
.

                                         (2) If the relief of accounting or any other relief is an
                              inherent part of the main relief of partition and implied therein, it
                              is not necessary to value that relief separately. The court fee paid
                              on the relief for partition would cover the other relief also. In
                              such a case if the relief claimed in an appeal is only that implied
                              in the main relief for partition, the fixed court fee under Article
                              17-B of Schedule II will suffice.

                                         (3) But if the relief for rendition of accounts relates to a
                              different subject matter such as a relief for accounting against a
                              manager of a Joint Hindu family on the ground of fraud or
                              improper conduct, a separate court fee has to be paid both in the
                              suit as well as in the appeal. In such cases the principle of the
                              Full Bench decision in -- 'AIR 1938 Mad 435 (E)', will apply and
                              'ad valorem' court fee is payable in appeal on the amount
                              decreed.

                                         7. In the instant case, the appeals relate only to the sum
                              of Rs. 21600 representing the share of the other members in the
                              sale proceeds of the clay realised by the appellants. That amount,
                              therefore, only represents the value of the respondents' share in
                              one of the assets of the family. Looking into the accounts by the

                              therefore hold that the appellants have correctly valued their
                              relief in the appeals by paying the fixed fee of Rs. 100 under

                                   11. A similar question as to the nature of the claim for accounting

                      in the suit for partition was considered by a Hon'ble Full Bench of this

                      Court in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya reported in 1951 (2) MLJ 176. The

                      essential question that was raised was as to whether the Court directed any

                      enquiry into future profits in a partition suit where, the preliminary decree is

                      silent. The main objection that was raised before the Hon'ble Full Bench

                      was that since the preliminary decree passed in the suit did not direct an

                      enquiry into the accounts and recovery of profits, the Court cannot direct

                      enquiry and pass a final decree for such income. The correctness of the

                      judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in Ghulusam Bibi Vs. Ahamadsa

                      Rowther was considered by the Hon'ble full bench. While considering the

                      question, the Hon'ble full bench had observed as follows:-

                                                                               C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                              three different types of cases in which a question of profits or
                              mesne profits might arise : (1) Suits for ejectment or recovery of
                              possession of immoveable property from a person in possession
                              without title, together with a claim for past or past & future
                              mesne profits. (2) Suits for partition by one or more tenants-in-
                              common against others with a claim for account of past or past &
                              future profits. (3) Suits for partition by a member of a joint Hindu
                              family with a claim for an account from the manager. In the first
                              case, the possession of the defts. not being lawful, the plff. is
                              entitled to recover "mesne profits" as defined in 
Section 2
, Clause
                              (12), Civ. P. C., such profits being really in the nature of damages.

                              In the second case, the possession & receipt of profits by the deft,
                              not being wrongful the plff's. remedy is to have an account of
                              such profits making all just allowances in favour of the collecting
                              tenant in common. In the third case, the plff. must take the joint
                              family property as it exists at the date of the demand for partition
                              and is not entitled to open up past accounts or claim relief on the
                              ground of past inequality of enjoyment of the profit, except where
                              the manager has been guilty of fraudulent conduct or
                              misappropriation. The plff. would, however, be in the position of a
                              tenant-in-common from the date of severance in status & his
                              rights would have to be worked out on that basis.”

                                   12. The Hon'ble full bench also considered the scope of Order 20

                      Rule 12 and Order 20 Rule 18. It was observed that while Order 20 Rule 12

                      would apply to the first category of suits mentioned above, Order 20 Rule

                      18 would apply to the second and third categories of the suits. The Hon'ble

                      full bench concluded that since the profits arising from the estate forming

                      part of a partition suit, also form part of such estate are liable to be

                      partitioned under the final decree. Even without a specific prayer in the

                      plaint for an account of such profits and division there of the court can

                      determine such profits and direct the sharer in possession to pay such share

                      to the suing sharer, the Hon'ble Full Bench summarised its conclusion as

                      follows:-

                              still a pending suit & the rights of the parties have to be adjusted
                              as on the date of the final decree: Jadunath v. Parameswar, I.L.R.
                              (1940) 1 Cal. 255. In such a suit the Court has not only to divide
                              the common properties but has also to adjust the equities arising
                              between the parties oat of their relation to the common property

                      he then was in 
D.Nataraja Achari Vs. Balambal Ammal
 reported in 1979

                      (2) MLJ 234 considered the difference between the determination under

                      Order20 Rule 12 and 
Order 20 Rule 18 C.P.C
. After referring to the

                      judgment of the full bench in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya, it was held that the

                      determination of profits in a partition suit would fall under 
Order 20 Rule

                      18 of C.P.C
 and not under 
Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C
. Having held so, the

                      claim of the appellants that the Court cannot grant mesne profits beyond a

                      period of three years from the date of the decree was rejected. While doing

                      so, this Court observed as follows:-




                                        6. The Full Bench also held that Order 20, Rule 12,
                              Civil Procedure Code, deals with the first class of suits above
                              referred, while Order 20, Rule 18 would take in suits in the
                              second and third categories. It was also further held that Order

                              20, Rule 12 relates to "mesne profits" in the sense in which that
                              expression is defined in 
Section 2(12)
 of the Civil Procedure Code
                              and that the claim of the plaintiff suing for partition and his share
                              of profits accruing from the lands pending the suit is not, properly
                              speaking, a claim for mesne profits and Order 20, Rule 12 Civil
                              Procedure Code, has no application to such a case. The learned
                              Counsel for the appellant, however, would strongly rely upon a
                              decision of the Supreme Court in Chittoori Subbamma v.

 
Kadappa Subbanna and Ors. and urge that the first respondent
                              cannot be granted a decree in respect of mesne profits in excess
                              of three years from the date of the decree. The question, therefore,
                              is whether the first respondent decree-holder could be denied her
                              share of the income for a period in excess of three years. The
                              scope and applicability of the judgment of the Supreme Court
                              relied upon by the learned Counsel for the appellant was the
                              subject-matter of the judgment of a Division Bench reported in
                              
Subba Reddiar v Hara Bibi
.
 In that case also, the same objection
                              that is being raised in the present second appeal by the learned
                              Counsel for the appellant was raised, relying upon the aforesaid
                              judgment of the Supreme Court reported in Subbamma's case.
                              The Division Bench examined the provisions of Order 20, Rule 12
                              and Order 20, Rule 18. Civil Procedure Code, and followed the
                              ratio of the Full Bench of this Court reported in Basavayya v.

Order 20, Rule 12 of the
                              Code of Civil Procedure
 will not be applicable to a case like the
                              present case, because when an account of the income from the
                              property pertaining to the share of the plaintiff is ordered up to
                              the date of the final decree what actually happens is the division
                              of an integral portion of the hotch pot comprising of not only
                              the property but also the income and accretions thereto up to
                              the date of the final decree and to such a case, Order 20, Rule
                              12 will be inapplicable. In addition, the Division Bench also
                              examined in detail the judgment of the Supreme Court and held
                              that a careful perusal of the minority and the majority views
                              shows that the entire discussion related only to the scope of Order
                              20, Rule 12, Civil Procedure Code, and in particular whether the
                              preliminary decree would be binding upon the defendant at the
                              stage of the final decree proceedings and whether the objection
                              that the period for the award of mesne profits should not exceed
                              three years could be allowed to be raised for the first time before
                              the High Court. It was also pointed out by the Division Bench
                              that in the judgment of the Supreme Court there is no reference
                              whatever to Order 20, Rule 18, Civil Procedure Code, which
                              deals with a case of suit for partition and mesne profits. It was
                              also further pointed out that the Full Bench decision of this Court
                              reported in Basavayya's case was not even referred to and,

                              therefore, it is rather difficult to countenance an argument that
                              the Supreme Court by implication intended to over-rule the view
                              taken by the Full Bench which has been followed in all other
                              decisions of other High Courts. That being the position, the
                              question of the applicability of the provisions of Order 20, Rule
                              12 to the instant case does not arise because in this case, though
                              the application purports to be one under Order 20, Rule 12, Civil
                              Procedure Code, it would fall within the second and third
                              categories enumerated by the Full Bench and to which the
                              provisions of Order 20, Rule 12, will not be applicable Order 20,
                              Rule 18, Civil Procedure Code, would govern the present case
                              and. therefore, the objection of the learned Counsel for the
                              appellant that the mesne profits cannot be given for more than
                              three years from the date of the decree does not hold good.

                                        “8. There is no substance in the contention of learned
                              Counsel for the appellants that the application for the
                              ascertainment of mesne profits is barred by limitation, or that it is
                              not maintainable as there is no provision therefor in the
                              preliminary decree. It is merely a misnomer to call it mesne
                              profits. The decree holders seek to have an account of the income
                              from the property under Order 20, Rule 18, 
C.P.C
., and it is not
                              an application under Order 20, Rule 12, 
C.P.C
. The law is well
                              settled that is too late in the day to question the right of a co-
                              sharer in a partition suit to apply for ascertainment of the income
                              pertaining to his share after the passing of a preliminary decree
                              for partition. It is not necessary to refer to any authority other

                                                                                C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      AIR 1923 Mad 147 to conclude as follows:




                                        “18. The concept of 'mesne profits' is applicable to

                              cases of wrongful possession and not partition. The right of a
                              tenant-in-common or a co-owner to a share in the profits from a
                              property in the enjoyment of another tenant-in-common, is not a
                              right to mesne profits for wrongful possession, but a right
                              appurtenant in his right to a share in the property. A suit for
                              partition and accounts is governed by 
Order 20 Rule 18 CPC
.
                              Neither Section 42 (relating to suits for mesne profits) nor Order
                              20 Rule 12 (relating to suits for possession and mesne profits)
                              relied on by the first respondent, is relevant to a suit for partition
                              and accounts and share in profits. 
Section 35
 of the Act governs
                              suits for partition with or without the ancillary relief of accounts.

                              In a final decree for partition, what is determined is the share of
                              the plaintiff in the profits from the property as a result of
                              rendering of account by the tenant-in-common in physical
                              possession or management, and not mesne profits.

                                        19. The learned Counsel for first respondent lastly
                              contended that if there is a complete ouster of the plaintiff from
                              possession and enjoyment, then it is possible to claim mesne
                              profits. This contention is academic and need not retain us long.
                              If really there was such ouster, then the main suit for partition
                              will itself fall under 
Section 35(1)
 in which event the Court Fee

                                                                                C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                              had to be computed on the market value of plaintiff's share. But
                              where the suit is valued under 
Section 35(2)
 as in this case, by
                              contending that the plaintiff is in joint possession, there is no
                              question of ouster and consequently no question of mesne profits.

                                        20. Therefore, we hold that 
Section 42
 of the Act is not
                              applicable. We further hold that the relief relating to rendering
                              account and payment of plaintiff's share in profits, is an ancillary
                              relief for which no Separate Court Fee is payable. The Court fee
                              payable under Section 49, on an appeal against a final decree
                              determining profits from the date of suit till the date of delivery of
                              possession, would be the same as the Court fee that was paid in
                              the Court of first instance and it is not necessary to pay ad
                              valorem Court fee on the amount determined as profits. In this
                              case, the Court fee payable and paid in the Court of first instance
                              was Rs. 200/-. Therefore, Court fee payable on the appeal will be
                              Rs. 200.00.”




                                   16. The Kerela High Court has considered the similar question in

                      Mariyumma Vs. Kunhambu Nair reported in 1967 KLT 1017 and Abu

                      and Others Vs. Thithikutty Umma and others reported in 1968 KLJ 549.

                      The Division Bench in Mariyumma Vs. Kunhambu Nair had after referring

                      to the judgment of the full bench of this Court held as follows:-

                                        “7. We are in respectful agreement with the dictum
                              laid down by the Full Bench in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya (AIR
                              1951 Mad. 938 FB) and also the aforesaid decisions of the
                              Andhra Pradesh High Court. In a suit for partition, the court
                              has not only to divide the common properties but also to adjust
                              equities arising between the parties out of their relation to the
                              common property sought to be divided. A sharer claiming
                              partition has a clear right to an account of the profits received
                              by the person in possession of the common property and to be
                              awarded his share thereof not as mesne profits but as
                              appurtenant to his right in his share of the lands. The profits
                              accruing from the common properties forming the subject
                              matter of the division during the pendency of the suit form part
                              and parcel of the corpus itself and are as much in the hotchpot
                              as the lands themselves. It is not correct to regard the claim
                              for profits put forward in a suit for partition by a sharer of
                              joint family property or of co-ownership property as a claim
                              for mesne profits falling under 
Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C
. In
                              our view, it is part of the legitimate function of a court passing
                              a final decree in a suit for partition and effectuating a division
                              of properties pursuant to a preliminary decree to make a
                              division of the profits that have accrued from such properties
                              pending the suit as such profits really form part of the corpus

                                 17. In Abu and Others Vs. Thithikutty Umma and Others, a Single

                      Judge of the Kerala High Court has reiterated the position that

                      determination of shares in a suit for partition will not fall under Order 20

                      Rule 12 and therefore, separate Court fee need not be paid under 
Section 37


                      of the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 ( Act of 1960, Kerala).

                      Making a distinction between decree for profits in a suit for partition as

                      determined under Order 20 Rule 18 and determination of mesne profits

                      under Order 20 Rule 12, the learned Judge held that the profits ascertained

                      under Order 20 Rule 18 being one of the incidents of the suit for partition, it

                      becomes a component part of the decree and therefore, separate Court fee

                      need not be paid while a challenge is made to such determination. This

                      reasoning is essentially based on the law laid down by the full bench of this

                      Court in Basavayya's case to the effect in a partition action, the profits

                      determining under Order 20 Rule 18 also forms part of the shares and it

                      cannot be called as mesne profits stricto sensu. Recently, in Dr.Rachel

                      Court reiterated the very same position of law after referring to the above

                      two decisions of the Kerela High Court.



                                 18. Mr.N.Suresh, learned counsel for the respondents would

                      vehemently contend that de-hors the law laid down by the full bench when

                      there is a determination of profits at the particular amount and the defendant

                      seeks to avoid liability of that particular amount, he has to pay ad valorem

                      court fee under Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation

                      Act. Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act reads

                      as follows:-



                                        “44. Suits for mesne profits. - (1) In a suit for mesne
                              profits or for immovable property and mesne profits, fee shall
                              in respect of mesne profits be computed, where the amount is
                              stated approximately and sued for, on such amount. If the
                              profits ascertained to be due to the plaintiff are in excess of the
                              profits as approximately estimated and sued for, no decree
                              shall be passed until the difference between the fee actually
                              paid and the fee that would have been payable had the suit
                              comprised the whole of the profits so ascertained is paid.

                                        (2) Where a decree directs an enquiry as to the
                              mesne profits which have accrued on the property, whether

                                                                              C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                              prior or subsequent to the institution of the suit, no final decree
                              shall be passed till the difference between the fee actually paid
                              and the fee which would have been payable had the suit
                              comprised the whole of the profits accrued due till the date of
                              such decree is paid.

                                        (3) Where, for a period subsequent to the date of the
                              decree or final decree, such decree or final decree directs
                              payment of mesne profits at a specified rate, such decree or
                              final decree shall not be executed until the fee computed on the
                              amount claimed in execution has been paid.”

                                 Section 44 provides for payment of Court fee in a suit for

                      possession and mesne profits. The definition of the term 'mesne profits' as

                      found in 
the C.P.C
., has been extracted above.           It is referable only to

                      wrongful possession. The Full bench of this Court in Basavayya's case

                      clearly laid down that Order 20 Rule 12 will not apply to a partition suit and

                      the determination of profits if any made in a partition suit is essentially

                      under Order 20 Rule 18 and not Order 20 Rule 12.



                                 19. Mr.N.Suresh would however draw my attention to the

                      judgment of the five bench of this Court in Inre Dhanukodi Nayakkar and

                      others reported in AIR 1938 Mad 435 wherein, the Hon'ble full bench

                      considered the court fee payable in a suit for accounts falling under 
Section

                      7(iv)(f)
 of the Court Fees Act, 1870. The Hon'ble Full Bench held as

                      follows:--



                                         “The section gives great freedom to plaintiff-
                              appellants, but we do not consider that it gives the same
                              freedom to defendant-appellants. When a defendant-appellant
                              appeals against a final decree he knows exactly the value of his
                              relief.   It follows that we consider that 56 Mad 705 was
                              wrongly decided and therefore should not be followed.”




                                   20. I am afraid that the said decision may not be helpful in

                      considering the question that crops up in this revision in as much as the full

                      bench was concerned with a suit for accounts filed under 
Section 7(iv)(f)
 of

                      the Court fees Act, 1817, which is equivalent to 
Section 35
 of the present

                      Act. 
Section 35
 essentially deals with suits for accounts. The determination

                      of profits in a partition suit has been held to be incidental to the relief of

                      partition. Therefore, the said judgment cannot be taken as a precedent to

                      determine the question arising in this revision.

                                21. Mr.N.Suresh would also rely upon the judgment of the

                      Hon'ble Justice. V. Ratnam as he then was in Thulasibai Ammal -Vs-Kanna

                      Pandithar reported in 1981(2) MLJ 250, wherein, a challenge was made to

                      direction to the petitioner to pay owelty in a suit for partition in order to

                      equalize deficit in the value of the share allotted to the respondent. When

                      the said direction was challenged by way of an appeal, it was held that since

                      the petitioner is seeking to avoid his liability to pay owelty, ad valorem

                      Court fee will have to be paid and the petitioner cannot take advantage of

                      
Article 17(b)
 to justify payment of fixed fee on the basis of the valuation in

                      the plaint. In doing so, the judgment in Inre Dhanukodi Nayakkar referred

                      to above was relied upon. I do not think, the said judgment can also be

                      taken as a precedent in deciding the question of Court fee payable in a suit

                      for partition where, the challenge is to the determination of profits. 
The

                      very same learned Judge has in 
Nataraja Achari Vs. Balambal Ammal


                      reported in 1979 2 MLJ 234 referred to Supra had noted the distinction

                      between Order 20 Rule 12 and Order 20 Rule 18.






 
22. My attention is also drawn to the judgment of the Hon'ble

                                                                             C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      Justice Ramprasad Rao as he then was in 
Karuppanna Gounder Vs.

                      Sennimalai Gounder
 reported in 1977 1 MLJ 491. That was also a case

                      where a decree for possession and mesne profits was challenged. Therefore,

                      the learned judge concluded that the Court fee should be payable on the

                      difference in mesne profits. That was a case to which Section 44 would

                      automatically apply. From the above discussion, the following principles

                      emerge:-




                                 1) A suit for partition takes in itself a prayer for determination of

                      the share of the income of the plaintiff in the properties and there need not

                      be a separate prayer.



                                 2) The income determined in a suit for partition forms part of the

                      estate in which the plaintiff would be entitled to his or her share even in

                      cases where the preliminary decree does not grant such share and directs

                      determination of such income.



                                 3) The determination of income in a suit for partition cannot be

                      called as determination of mesne profits in the strict sense of the term as

                      mesne profits contemplates wrongful possession.



                                 4) Once it is held that the determination of income is not mesne

                                                                             C.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018

                      profits Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act will

                      not apply.



                                   5) Once it is held that the income determined forms part of the

                      estate while challenging the quantum, the appellant need not value it

                      separately and pay Court fee on such valuation, since he is not seeking to

                      avoid the liability but he is only questioning the quantum of liability.



                                   23. I therefore, find that the learned Principal District Judge was

                      not right in concluding that the court fee should be paid under Section 44 of

                      the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act. This civil revision

                      petition is allowed, the order of the learned District Judge is set aside and

                      I.A.No.260 of 2016 will stand dismissed.             Consequently, connected

                      miscellaneous petitions are closed. No costs.
