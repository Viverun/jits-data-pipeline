           application filed by the petitioner have been dismissed. A further

           prayer has been made by the petitioner for quashing the orders

           dated 30.04.1996 (Annexure P-4) and dated 12.04.1998 (sic.

           23.03.1989) (Annexure P-2) whereby the discharge of the petitioner

           petitioner with effect from 23.03.1989, that is, from the date of his

           discharge.



                               In terms of the reply filed by the respondents, the

           question of maintainability of the writ petition has also been raised.


 
Insofar as the question regarding the jurisdiction of this

           Court is concerned, it may at the outset be noticed that a Division

           Bench of this Court in the case 15165 
Flight Lieutenant Onkar

                               26.4.2011, following the aforesaid judgments in the

                               context of this very Act, we are deciding this petition on

                               merits.




                                     Accordingly, we have heard learned counsel for the

                               parties on merits of the writ petition."



                               In L. Chandra Kumar etc. v. The Union of India and

           others, AIR 1997 SC 1125 it was held that power of judicial review is

           a basic and essential feature of the Constitution. Broadly speaking, it

           was held that judicial review in India comprises of three aspects; (i)

           judicial review of legislative action, (ii) judicial review of judicial

           decision and (iii) judicial review of administrative action. The Judges

           of the Superior Courts have been entrusted with the task of

           upholding the Constitution and to this end have been conferred the

           power to interpret it. It is they who have to ensure the balance of

           power envisaged by the Constitution is maintained and that the

           legislature and the executive do not, in the discharge of their

           functions, transgress constitutional limitations. Therefore, this Court

           going by the decision in L. Chandra Kumar's case (Supra) has power

           of judicial review in respect of the judicial decisions of the Tribunal in

           terms of 
Article 226
 of the Constitution.



                               In view of the above, the writ petition is held to be

           maintainable.



                               The petitioner initially rendered Army service of 8 years

           and 332 days. Thereafter, he was enrolled in the Defence Security

           Corps ('DSC' - for short) on 09.03.1983. The petitioner was served

           with a charge sheet (Annexure P-1) on account of an act prejudicial

           to good order and military discipline. It was alleged that at Ambala

           Cantt. between 22.00 hours and 22.30 hours on 02.03.1987 while at

           post No.2, he improperly and without authority fired one round in the

           air from his 7.62 mm bolt action rifle. In the order of the Tribunal, it is

           recorded that the petitioner while on duty was forced to fire one

           round in the air to save himself from the aggressor, who was another

           sepoy of the platoon and was armed with a rifle. The petitioner was

           tried by a Summary Court Martial and in terms of order passed on

           12.04.1988, he was found guilty and dismissed from service. The

           petitioner filed a writ petition (CWP No.5988 of 1989) in this Court for

           supplying him proceedings of the Court Martial. The said writ petition

           was allowed by this Court. The petitioner in the meantime filed a

           petition under 
Section 164 (2)
 of the Army Act, 1950. The General

           Officer Commanding in Chief vide order dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure

           P-2) on the post confirmation petition dated 25.07.1988 submitted by

           the petitioner against the award of the Summary Court Martial

           partially agreed with the recommendations of the General Officer,

           Commanding PH and HP Area. The sentence of dismissal awarded

           to the petitioner was commuted to discharge; besides, it was directed

           that the petitioner shall be deemed to have been discharged with

           effect from the date of original sentence of dismissal became

           operative.



                               The petitioner then filed a writ petition (CWP No.17050 of

           1989) in this Court which was taken up for hearing on 11.01.1995.

           By this time, the petitioner was due for retirement on superannuation

           from service.        The writ petition was disposed of vide order dated

           11.01.1995 (Annexure P-3). It was observed by the learned Single

           Judge of this Court that even though the petitioner had raised several

           grounds to challenge the impugned action of his discharge, his

           learned counsel stated that he had remained unemployed since 1989

           from the date of his discharge and was in a bad shape and he would

           be satisfied if the authorities reconsider his claim for grant of pension

           sympathetically. It was pointed out that the petitioner had rendered

           more than 15 years of service by 23.03.1989 i.e. the date of his

           discharge from service vide order Annexure P-2.              It was also

           submitted that the factors which weighed with the authorities while

           commuting the punishment from dismissal to discharge were that the

           petitioner would be able to earn his pension.         The learned Senior

           Standing counsel for the Union of India submitted that if the petitioner

           makes a representation to the competent authority within one month

           from          11.01.1995,   it   would   be   considered   and    decided

           sympathetically.        In view of the above, it seemed fair to this Court

           that the petitioner should be allowed to make a representation to the

           respondents for grant of pension. In case such a representation was

           made within one month from 11.01.1995, the competent authority it

           was directed shall consider it sympathetically and decide it as

           expeditiously as possible. It was further observed that keeping in

           view the fact that the petitioner had completed more than 14 years of

           service as on the date of his dismissal from service and more than 15

           years on 23.03.1989, when he was ordered to be discharged from

           service, it would be fair and proper if his claim was considered

           sympathetically. In fact insofar as the petitioner was concerned, it

           was observed that there would be no difference to him between

           dismissal or discharge from service unless his claim was considered

           for the grant of pension. In view of the totality of the circumstances,

           the writ petition was disposed of with the direction that the petitioner

           shall make a representation within one month from 11.01.1995 which

           the respondents were to consider and decide. It was clarified that in

           case the respondents consider his claim for grant of pension, he

           shall not be entitled to claim any arrears of pension etc.

                               In consequence of the order dated 11.01.1995 (Annexure

           P-3) passed by this Court, the petitioner submitted a representation

           dated 10.02.1995. According to the petitioner his main submission

           was that the order of his discharge from service was not liable to be

           made with retrospective effect and it is to be prospective. The order

           dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) commuting the sentence of

           dismissal to discharge, it was submitted was made in a manner that it

           brought in operation the discharge of the petitioner from service with

           the retrospective date. It was also submitted by the petitioner that he

           had rendered 5 years,           1 month and 3 days service in the DSC and

           he had a continuous service of 9 years in the Army which was

           required to be added to the present service for the purpose of

           pension. He in fact had 14 years and 1 month of service to his credit.

           Service of five months more would have been required so as to

           entitle the petitioner to earn his pension on commutation of his

           sentence of dismissal to discharge.           However, the petitioner had

           more than 15 years of service to his credit on the date when his

           sentence of dismissal was commuted to discharge i.e. On

           23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2).



                               The representation of the petitioner was considered by

           the Government of India, Ministry of Defence vide impugned order

           dated 30.04.1996 (Annexure P-4). It was inter alia mentioned that

           the representation of the petitioner dated 10.02.1995 had been

           considered de novo in the Ministry of Defence in consultation with the

           Army Headquarters.             It was found that the petitioner had been

           charged under 
Section 63
 of the Army Act, 1950 which relates to

           violation of good order and discipline. He was tried by the Special

           Court Martial on 12.04.1988 and he was awarded punishment of

           'dismissal from service'. Accordingly, he was dismissed from service

           with effect from 12.04.1988. Subsequently in pursuance of the post

           confirmation petition dated 25.07.1988 submitted by the petitioner,

           the General Officer Commanding in Chief, Western Command

           commuted the sentence of 'dismissal' to 'discharge'.          It was also

           directed that the date of discharge of the petitioner from service

           would be effective from the same date from which the original

           sentence of dismissal became operative i.e. with effect from

           12.04.1988. It was further observed that in view of the foregoing, it

           was clear that there was no dispute regarding the date of discharge

           of the petitioner from service, which was 12.04.1988. It was also

           observed that no retirement benefits as otherwise due on 12.04.1988

           would have been admissible to the petitioner had he been dismissed

           from service, however, the retriment benefits as per admissibility

           were payable to him under the Army Pension Regulations. Thus by

           commuting his sentence from 'dismissal' to 'discharge', he was held

           entitled to receive retirement benefits as dismissal under Rules

           depending on the length of service rendered by him upto 12.04.1988.

           As per service record of the petitioner, the total qualifying service on

           the day of his discharge from service i.e. on 12.04.1988 worked out

           to 14 years and 1 day only, which included his earlier service of 8

           years and 330 days. In this manner, there was a short fall of 11

           months of service required for 15 years service for grant of pension.

           Service pension was, therefore, not admissible to him in terms of

           
Regulation 132
 of the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 (Part

           I). Further, condonation of deficiency in service only upto 6 months

           was permissible under the Pension Regulations.         In case of the

           petitioner, the deficiency in service was more than six months and

           the same, it was observed, could not be condoned. The petitioner

           was, however, held entitled to grant of Service Gratuity, Death cum

           Retirement Gratuity amounting to Rs.22,325/- for 14 years of service

           which had already been paid to him. The service gratuity otherwise

           would not have been admissible to him had his punishment not been

           commuted from 'dismissal' to 'discharge'.     In view of the foregoing

           position, it was held that no pension was payable to him under the

           Rules. The petitioner now claims for the grant of pension.

                               Notice of motion was issued to the respondents.



                               Reply has been filed on behalf of the respondents. It has

           inter alia been submitted that the petitioner initially served with the

           Sikh LI for the period from 23.07.1973 to 29.09.1982. He served with

           the Sikh LI for more than 9 years. Thereafter he was enrolled in the

           DSC on 09.03.1983.               His qualifying service countable towards

           pension/gratuity in DSC was only 8 years and 332 days after

           deducting 102 days being non-qualifying service due to absence from

           service of the petitioner for the periods from 13.08.1973 to

           05.09.1973; 20.08.1977 to 17.09.1977 and from 02.08.1981 to

           20.09.1981. Accordingly his formal service of 8 years and 332 days

           was counted towards pension/gratuity in DSC by the PAO (OR) DSC.

           The petitioner was posted in RR to 140 B DSC Platoon attached to

           HQ 448 Coy ASE (Pet) Ambala Cantt. on 25.12.1986 and not during

           1983 as mentioned in the writ petition.                He was involved in

           disciplinary proceedings while serving with 140 B DSC Platoon

           attached with Head Quarters 448 Coy ASC (Pet) Ambala Cantt.


                               Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the

           petitioner is entitled for the benefit of pension as he has rendered 15

           years of service till the date of his discharge from service on

           02.03.1989. In any case, it is submitted that even if it is taken that

           the petitioner has rendered 14 years and 1 month of service, the

           period of short fall of 11 months for qualifying service for grant of

           pension is liable to be condoned in terms of Government of India

           order dated 14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) and Government of India

           order dated 21.07.2001 that have been filed.                  Therefore, the

           petitioner is liable to be given the benefit of pension.


                               In response, learned counsel for the respondents has

           placed strong reliance on Note 5 (a) of 
Section 179
 of the Army Act,

           1950 which is placed on record as Annexure R-1. The same

           envisages that a sentence of dismissal might be remitted on the

           condition that the person sentenced shall not receive pay in respect

           of or count service for any purpose during the period spent under

           dismissal; besides, the conditions, if any must be clearly stated that

           the written acceptance of the person obtained and that the mitigation

           or commutation cannot be made conditional. Therefore, it is

           submitted that the petitioner is not entitled for any benefit of pension.


                               We have given our thoughtful consideration to the matter.

           The factual aspects are not much in dispute.              The petitioner has

           rendered initial service with the Sikh LI for the period from

           23.07.1973 to 29.09.1982. The said service according to the Army

           records works out to about 8 years and 332 days. Thereafter, the

           petitioner was enrolled in the DSC on 09.03.1983 in which he

           continued till the date of his dismissal from service on 12.04.1988.

           This was subsequently vide order dated 23.03.1989 commuted to

           discharge. It was directed that the petitioner shall be deemed to have

           been discharged with effect from the date the original sentence of

           dismissal became operative, that is, from 12.04.1988. In this manner

           the petitioner had 14 years and 1 month of service. The qualifying

           service for grant of pension is undisputedly 15 years.             There is,

           therefore, a short fall of 11 months of service for entitlement for

           pension. However, in case the service of the petitioner is to be taken

           to have been dispensed with from 23.03.1989 when his sentence of

           dismissal           was commuted to that of discharge, he completes 15

           years of service.



                               Two fold questions, therefore, would require consideration

           as to whether the short fall of 11 months of service so as to have the

           necessary qualifying service for entitlement for pension can be

           condoned; and whether the order of commutation of dismissal from

           service to that of discharge in respect of the petitioner becomes

           effective from the date of the order of discharge, that is, from

           23.03.1989.



                               The learned Armed Forces Tribunal in its impugned order

           dated 03.11.2011 inter alia observed that a look at the order dated

           30.04.1996 (Annexure P-4) by which the representation of the

           petitioner was declined showed that it proceeded on the basis of the

           provisions of 
Regulation 132
 of the Pension Regulations and the

           reason given was that condonation in deficiency of service only up to

           6 months was permissible, while in the case of the petitioner, it was

           more than 6 months. Therefore, he was not held entitled to service

           pension, besides, service gratuity had already been paid to him.

           
Regulation 132
 of the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 Part I

           relates to minimum qualifying service of pension, which reads as

           under:-

                               132. The minimum period of qualifying service (without

                               weightage) actually rendered and required for earning

                               pension shall be 15 years"



                               The learned Tribunal, therefore, relying on the said

           provision and the instructions applicable held that for condonation of

           deficiency of service that was permissible was only up to six months

           while in the case of the petitioner it was more than six months. As

           such, he was not held entitled to service pension. The petitioner has,

           however, placed on record Government of India order dated

           14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) according to which the shortfall in

           qualifying service for grant of pension in respect of PBOR (personnel

           below officers rank) can be beyond six months and upto 12 months.

           The relevant extract of the said Government of India order dated

           14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) reads as under:-

           powers delegated to them vide order dated 14.08.2001 (Annexure

           A-1) even to the cases which were pending with prior to issue of the

           orders. However, they were required to exercise the power in the

           interest of justice, equity and fair play. Therefore, even in respect of

           pending cases the power can be exercised for condoning the short

           fall or deficiency in qualifying service from six months to twelve

           months.             The said orders dated 14.08.2001 (Annexure A-1) and

           Tribunal. The learned Tribunal in its impugned order inter alia

           observed that a period of short fall of six months only could be

           condoned and not eleven months. The same, would not be

           sustainable and in fact a period of up to twelve months can be

           condoned. The petitioner has a short fall of eleven months which can

           be condoned and this in fact is the tenor, intent and spirit of the order

           dated 11.01.1995 (Annexure P-3) passed by this Court in the writ

           petition filed by the petitioner whereby he restricted his claim for the

           grant of pension only which was to be considered sympathetically by

           the Union of India in accordance with the stand taken on its behalf by

           the learned Senior standing counsel appearing for it. Therefore, the

           period of elven months was liable to be condoned.



                               As regards the other condition with regard to the effective

           dates for discharge, the learned counsel for the respondents has

           placed strong reliance on Note 5 (a) of 
Section 179
 of the Army Act,

           1950. The said Note 5 (a) of 
Section 179
 of the Army Act, 1950

           reads as under:-



                                    "A sentence of dismissal might be remitted on the

                               conditions that the person sentenced shall not receive

                               pay in respect of or count service for any purpose during

                               the period spent under dismissal. The conditions, if any

                               must be clearly stated that the written acceptance of the

                               person obtained.     Mitigation or commutation cannot be

                               made conditional."



                               In terms of the above note, sentence of dismissal might

           be remitted on the condition that the person sentenced shall not

           receive pay in respect of or count service for any purpose during the

           period spent under dismissal and the conditions, if any, must be

           clearly stated and that the written acceptance of the person obtained.

           However, the above is only a note under 
Section 179
 of the Army

           Act, 1950 which relates to pardon and remission. The said note, even

           otherwise relates to the period spent under dismissal. The same in

           any case would not over ride the provisions of the 
Army Act
 1950,

           the Army Rules 1954 or the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961.

           The claim of the petitioner if permissible under the relevant statutory

           rules and regulations cannot be defeated by reference to a note. The

           question, in fact that requires to be considered for the grant of

           pensionary benefits is the date from which the order of discharge

           becomes effective. 
Section 22
 of the Army Act, 1950 and Rule 18 of

           commuted the dismissal to discharge. It was, however, directed that

           the petitioner shall be deemed to have been discharged with effect

           from the date of original sentence of dismissal became operative.

           However, the effective date of dismissal or discharge is to be

           determined in accordance with the Rule 18 of the Army Rules, 1954.

           It is well-known that if a procedure is prescribed by the Rules, then

           that procedure alone is to be followed and all other procedures are

           forbidden. Therefore, there being a provision in terms of Rule 18 of

           the Army Rules, the effective date for determining the dismissal or

           discharge, as the case may be, is Rule 18 of the Army Rules. Sub

           Rule (1) of Rule 18 envisages the dismissal of an officer under

           
Section 19
 (which provides that subject to the provision of the 
Army

           Act
 and the rules and regulations made thereunder, the Central

           Government may dismiss, or remove from the service any person

           subject to the 
Army Act
) or the retirement, resignation, release or

           removal of such officer shall take effect from the date specified in

           that behalf in the notification of such dismissal, retirement or removal

           in the Official Gazette. There is no official gazette notification placed

           on the record from which the petitioner can be said to have been

           released and neither is the petitioner an officer. He in fact is a

           personnel below officer rank (PBOR). Therefore, Sub Rule (1) of

           Rule 18 is inapplicable. Sub Rule (2) of Rule 18 relates to dismissal

           of a person subject to the 
Army Act
, other than an officer whose

           dismissal otherwise than by sentence of court martial is duly

           authorized or the discharge of a person so subject whose discharge,

           if duly authorized, is to be carried out by the Commanding Officer of

           such person with all convenient speed. It is further provided that the

           authority competent to authorize such dismissal or discharge may,

           when authorizing the dismissal or discharge, specify any future date

           from which it shall take effect. In terms of the proviso, if no such date

           is specified, the dismissal or discharge is to take effect from the date

           on which it was duly authorized or from the date on which the person

           dismissed or discharged ceased to perform military duty whichever is

           the later date. In terms of Sub Rule (3) of Rule 18, the retirement,

           removal, resignation, release, discharge or dismissal of a person

           subject to the Act shall not be retrospective. In the present case the

           initial dismissal by way of Court Martial was later on commuted to

           discharge. The object of discharge was primarily to grant pensionary

           and retiral benefits to the petitioner which he otherwise would not

           have been entitled to in the case of dismissal; besides, Sub Rule (2)

           provides for dismissal or discharge from a future date from which it

           shall take effect and Sub Rule (3) provides that it shall not be

           retrospective. 
In 
Inder Pal Singh v. Union of India and others

           case of a Sepoy who injured another Sepoy negligently and was tried

           by a Court Martial and dismissed from service. It was held that the

           competent authority had the jurisdiction to modify the order of

           dismissal to one of discharge; besides, after referring to Rule 18 of

            CWP No.10610 of 2012 (O & M)                                        -20-



           the Army Rules and particularly Sub Rule (3) held that the said Sub

           Rule imposes a restriction that in no case the discharge could be

           made with retrospective effect. It was further observed that a bare

           reading of the entire Rule 18 makes it clear that the competent

           authority may order the dismissal or discharge from a future date. In

           no circumstances such order could be made from a retrospective

           date.         This Court in the said case was also of the opinion that

           whether the discharge was made in the ordinary course or had been

           made as a matter of punishment, in no case, the same could be

           made with retrospective effect. It was also held that there was no

           force in the contention of the respondents that the provisions of Rule

           13 or 18 were not applicable in the case of the petitioner because he

           had been punished for dismissal from service by the Summary Court

           Martial and thereafter he ceased to be a member of the service and

           the Army Rules were only applicable to the persons who were still in

           service and subject to the 
Army Act
. It was held that merely because

           the petitioner was punished by the Court Martial, it could not be said

           that the aforesaid rules were not applicable on him and the

           punishment of discharge could be given to him with retrospective

           effect. Consequently, the impugned order in the said case to the

           extent vide which the petitioner was ordered to have been discharged

           from service from the date his dismissal order became effective, was

           set aside and the order of discharge of the petitioner, it was held,

           would be effective from the date it was passed by the Vice Chief of

           Army Staff.         Applying the ratio of said judgment in the present case

           the discharge of the petitioner would be effective from the date it was

           passed i.e. in terms of order dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2).


 
The learned Tribunal   referred to 
the said judgment
 in

           
Inder Pal Singh v. Union of India
 (supra) and it was held that the

           earlier petition (i.e. CWP No.17050 of 1989) was filed after the order

           dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) was passed regarding discharge

           being effective from the date of original sentence of dismissal

           became operative and the said writ petition was to challenge the

           entire action of dismissal or discharge taken against the petitioner. It

           was found that from the order dated 11.01.1995 (Annexure P-3), the

           order dated 23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) had been taken into account

           in that order. Obviously, therefore, the litigation, it was observed, had

           already culminated in the order dated 11.01.1995, wherein the

           contention regarding the impermissibility of discharge being effective

           from the date, the original punishment order was operative was not

           pressed into service. As such it could not be allowed to be raised.

           Therefore, the learned Tribunal was of the view that since the

           contention regarding the effective date of discharge was not pressed

           while disposing of the writ petition (CWP No.17050 of 1989) vide

           order dated 11.01.1995, the original punishment was operative and it

           could not be allowed to be raised now. However, we are of the view

           that since the claim of the petitioner is for grant of pension and the

           question whether he has the requisite entitlement of service for grant

           of pension is germane to the matter in issue, it can well be raised and

           taken into account so as to consider his case for the requisite service

           rendered for the benefit of pension. In fact for the grant of pension

           the rules can be read down so as to grant the same.
 
Therefore,

           keeping in view the ratio of judgment in 
Inder Pal Singh
's case

           (supra), we are of the view that the order of discharge from service

           became effective from the date of passing the order, that is, from

           23.03.1989 (Annexure P-2) whereby the dismissal from service of the

           petitioner was commuted to discharge.              By the said date, that is

           23.03.1989, the petitioner had the requisite 15 years of service. As

           such, on both or any of the account, that were formulated, the

           petitioner would be entitled to pension.




                               Consequently, the writ petition is liable to be allowed.

           However, in the order dated 11.01.1995 passed in CWP No.17050 of

           1989 it was clarified by this Court that in case the respondents

           consider the case of the petitioner for the grant of pension, he would

           not be entitled to claim any arrears of pension etc. The said

           restriction was for the respondents. However, keeping in view the

           spirit of the said order the arrears are liable to be restricted to a

           period of three years earlier to the filing of CWP No.9915 of 1996 in

           this Court, that is, from 08.07.1996.



                               Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed, the petitioner

           would be entitled to pension for the service rendered by him for a

           period of 15 years. However, the arrears shall be restricted to three

           years earlier to the filing of CWP No.9915 of 1996 in this Court, that

           is, from 08.07.1996 for which the pension be calculated and paid to

           the petitioner. For the period the matter remained pending in this

           Court and in the Tribunal, the petitioner cannot be said to be at any

           fault and he would be entitled to pension for the said period as well.

           There shall, however, be no costs.
