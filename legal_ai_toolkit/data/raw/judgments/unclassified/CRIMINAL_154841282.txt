                              In the matter of : Partha Saha

                              Mr. Fazlur Rahman,
                              Mr. Md. Babul Hossain
                                                            ... For the Petitioner.

                              Mr. Saryati Dutta,

                                                            ... For the State.


                                                  Dictated by Arijit Banerjee, J.



                              1.        The petitioner renews his prayer for bail which was
                              last rejected on August 30, 2024.       The last rejection was
                              primarily on the basis of an order dated March 30, 2023
                              passed on a bail application of a co-accused person being
                              CRM (NDPS) 594 of 2023, whereby two years' time was
                              granted for conclusion of the trial.    That time period is to
                              expire on May 17, 2025.         On instruction, learned State
                              counsel tells us that the trial will definitely be concluded by
                              that date.



                              2.           The petitioner renews his prayer saying that after
                              August 30, 2024, only two witnesses have been examined.
                              There are 25 charge sheet named witnesses. Therefore, early

                    conclusion of the trial or conclusion within May 17, 2025, is
                    impossible.



                    3.       Opposing the prayer for bail, learned State advocate
                    tells us that the prosecution has examined four witnesses till
                    date. It proposes to examine eight more witnesses. The trial
                    would definitely conclude within May 17, 2025.



                    4.       We have considered the rival contentions of the
                    parties. The petitioner is in custody for more than four years.
                    Given the pace at which the trial has been proceeding, it is
                    highly improbable that the trial would conclude by May 17,
                    2025. The petitioner is in custody for over four years.



                    5.        Therefore, without touching the merits of the case
                    and solely on the touchstone of 
Article 21
 of the Constitution
                    of India, we feel constrained to enlarge the petitioner on bail.



                    6.         Accordingly, we direct that the petitioner, namely,
                    Partha Saha, shall be released on bail upon furnishing a
                    bond of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand), with
                    two sureties of Rs.12,500/- each, one of whom must be local,
                    to the satisfaction of learned Additional Sessions Judge, 6th
                    Court, Barasat, Special Court under 
NDPS Act
.                         The
                    petitioner shall appear before the learned trial Court on every
                    date of hearing and shall not intimidate the witnesses and/or
                    tamper with evidence in any manner whatsoever and/or
                    commit any cognizable offence in any manner whatsoever.
                    The   petitioner   shall       remain   within   the   jurisdiction    of
                    Nabadweep Police Station except for the purpose of attending
                    the court proceedings and shall report to the Officer-in-
                    Charge/Inspector-in-Charge of Nabadweep Police Station
                    once in a fortnight, until further orders.



                    7.         In the event the petitioner fails to comply with any
                    of the conditions stipulated above, the trial Court shall be at

                    liberty to cancel the bail in accordance with law without
                    further reference to this Court.



                    8.         The application for bail is, thus, allowed.



                    9.         All parties shall act on the server copies of this
                    order duly downloaded from the official website of this Court.



                    10.      Criminal Section is directed to supply certified copies
                    of this order to the parties, if applied for, upon compliance of
                    all necessary formalities.
