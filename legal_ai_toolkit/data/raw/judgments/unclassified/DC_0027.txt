         otherwise of the compromise, the undersigned has recorded the
         statement of respondent Yogesh Kumar son of Rakesh Kumr
         son of Somnath resident of Pakki Gali, Sherpur and Shella
         Devi wife of Somnath who are the complainants in the
         present FIR No.34 dated 30.04.2021 under 
Section 379-B

         IPC, PS Sherpur.



                       In their statements, they had stated that on their
         initiation, FIR No.34 dated 30.04.2021 under 
Section 379-B

         IPC, was registered at Police Station Sherpur, District Sangrur
         originally against accused Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of
         Paramjit Singh. Later during police investigation police has
         nominated Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep Singh as accused
         in the present FIR.



                       It was further submitted by them that now with the
         intervention of respectable and relatives persons, they had
         voluntarily    compromised         the   matter     with   accused
         persons/petitioners Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep Singh and
         Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of Paramjit Singh, without there
         being any pressure or coercion any misrepresentation or undue
         influence and without any greed. They further stated that they

         is produced in the court i.e. Ex.CX and identified their
         signatures over the same. They further stated that the

         coercion or any undue influence and the same is valid. They
         further stated that they do not want to pursue with the present

         of Hardeep Singh and Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of Paramjit

                      In their statements, the petitioners/accused
         namely Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep Singh resident of
         village Sandhour, Tehsil Malerkotla and accused Pardeep
         Singh Dhaliwal son of Paramjit Singh resident of village

         Police Station Sherpur, District Sangrur against them by

         Shella Devi wife of Somnath.



                            Now with the intervention of respectable and
               relatives, they have effected a compromise with the
               complainants without any pressure or coercion any
               misrepresentation or undue influence and without any
               greed. They further stated that they have seen the original

               signatures over the same which is Ex.CX. They further

               and without any coercion or any undue influence and the
               same is valid. They further stated that they have a

                 son of Hardeep Singh resident of village Sandhour, Tehsil
                 Malerkotla is involved in one more case bearing FIR
                 No.38 of 2019 under 
Section 304
, 
341
 IPC PS Thulliwal,
                 District Barnala. Accused Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of
                 Paramjit Singh is not involved in any other case.



                         From the statements of the parties as well as
                 their oral examination, undersigned is of the opinion
                 that matter has been amicably settled between
                 accused/petitioners Gurdarshan Singh son of Hardeep
                 Singh and accused Pardeep Singh Dhaliwal son of
                 Paramjit Singh and complainants/respondents Yogesh
                 Kumar and Shella Devi.



                 The said compromise is genuine, voluntarily and is
                 without any coercion or undue influence.



5.         The full Bench of this Court in the matter of "
Kulwinder Singh

and others versus State of Punjab and another
" reported as (Punjab and

Haryana High Court) : 2007 (3) RCR (Criminal) 1052 has been observed as

under:




           " (28) To conclude, it can safely be said that there can never be
           any hard and fast category which can be prescribed to enable the
           Court to exercise its power under 
Section 482
 of the Cr.P.C. The
           only principle that can be laid down is the one which has been
           incorporated in the Section itself, i.e., "to prevent abuse of the
           process of any Court" or "to secure the ends of justice".



 
(29) In 
Mrs. Shakuntala Sawhney v. Mrs. Kaushalya Sawhney
           and Ors.
, Hon'ble Krishna Iyer, J. aptly summoned up the essence
           of compromise in the following words:

         "The finest hour of justice arrives propitiously when parties,
         despite falling apart, bury the hatchet and weave a sense of
         fellowship of reunion."

         (30) The power to do complete justice is the very essence of every
         judicial justice dispensation system. It cannot be diluted by
         distorted perceptions and is not a slave to anything, except to the
         caution and circumspection, the standards of which the Court sets
         before it, in exercise of such plenary and unfettered power
         inherently vested in it while donning the cloak of compassion to
         achieve the ends of justice.



         (31) No embargo, be in the shape of Section 320(9) of the
         Cr.P.C., or any other such curtailment, can whittle down the
         power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.



         (32) The compromise, in a modern society, is the sine qua non of
         harmony and orderly behaviour. It is the soul of justice and if the
         power under 
Section 482
 of the Cr.P.C. is used to enhance such a
         compromise which, in turn, enhances the social amity and
         reduces friction, then it truly is "finest hour of justice". Disputes
         which have their genesis in a matrimonial discord, landlord-
         tenant matters, commercial transactions and other such matters
         can safely be dealt with by the Court by exercising its powers
         under 
Section 482
 of the Cr.P.C. in the event of a compromise,
         but this is not to say that the power is limited to such cases. There
         can never be any such rigid rule to prescribe the exercise of such
         power, especially in the absence of any premonitions to forecast
         and predict eventualities which the cause of justice may throw up
         during the course of a litigation.



         (33) The only inevitable conclusion from the above discussion is
         that there is no statutory bar under the 
Cr.P.C
. which can affect
         the inherent power of this Court under 
Section 482
. Further, the
         same cannot be limited to matrimonial cases alone and the Court
         has the wide power to quash the proceedings even in non-
         compoundable offences notwithstanding the bar under 
Section
         320
 of the Cr.P.C., in order to prevent the abuse of law and to
         secure the ends of justice.

            (34) The power under 
Section 482
 of the Cr.P.C. is to be
            exercised Ex-Debitia Justitia to prevent an abuse of process of
            Court. There can neither be an exhaustive list nor the defined
            para-meters to enable a High Court to invoke or exercise its
            inherent powers. It will always depend upon the facts and
            circumstances of each case. The power under 
Section 482
 of the
            Cr.P.C. has no limits. However, the High Court will exercise it
            sparingly and with utmost care and caution. The exercise of
            power has to be with circumspection and restraint. The Court is a
            vital and an extra-ordinary effective instrument to maintain and
            control social order. The Courts play role of paramount
            importance in achieving peace, harmony and ever-lasting
            congeniality in society. Resolution of a dispute by way of a
            compromise between two warring groups, therefore, should
            attract the immediate and prompt attention of a Court which
            should endeavour to give full effect to the same unless such
            compromise is abhorrent to lawful composition of the society or
            would promote savagery.



6.          The legal principles as laid down for quashing of the judgment

were also approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Gian Singh

Versus State of Punjab and another, (2012) 10 SCC 303. Still further, the

broad principles for exercising the powers under 
Section 482
 were summarized

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of "Parbatbhai Aahir @

Parbatbhai Bhimsinhbhai Karmur and others verus State of Gujarat and

another" (2017) 9 SCC 641, the same are extracted as under:



            16. The broad principles which emerge from the precedents on the
            subject, may be summarised in the following propositions :



            16.1 
Section 482
 preserves the inherent powers of the High Court
            to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the
            ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only
            recognises and preserves powers which inhere in the High Court;



            16.2 The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash
            a First Information Report or a criminal proceeding on the



                                     7 of 12

         ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender
         and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for
         the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an
         offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of
         
Section 320
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power
         to quash under 
Section 482
 is attracted even if the offence is non-
         compoundable.



         16.3 In forming an opinion whether a criminal proceeding or
         complaint should be quashed in exercise of its jurisdiction under
         
Section 482
, the High Court must evaluate whether the ends of
         justice would justify the exercise of the inherent power;



         16.4 While the inherent power of the High Court has a wide ambit
         and plenitude it has to be exercised; (i) to secure the ends of
         justice or (ii) to prevent an abuse of the process of any court;



         16.5 The decision as to whether a complaint or First Information
         Report should be quashed on the ground that the offender and
         victim have settled the dispute, revolves ultimately on the facts
         and circumstances of each case and no exhaustive elaboration of
         principles can be formulated;



         16.6 In the exercise of the power under 
Section 482
 and while
         dealing with a plea that the dispute has been settled, the High
         Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
         offence. Heinous and serious offences involving mental depravity
         or offences such as murder, rape and dacoity cannot
         appropriately be quashed though the victim or the family of the
         victim have settled the dispute. Such offences are, truly speaking,
         not private in nature but have a serious impact upon society. The
         decision to continue with the trial in such cases is founded on the
         overriding element of public interest in punishing persons for
         serious offences;



         16.7 As distinguished from serious offences, there may be
         criminal cases which have an overwhelming or predominant
         element of a civil dispute. They stand on a distinct footing in so
         far as the exercise of the inherent power to quash is concerned;



         16.8 Criminal cases involving offences which arise from

                                  8 of 12

             commercial, financial, mercantile, partnership or similar
             transactions with an essentially civil flavour may in appropriate
             situations fall for quashing where parties have settled the dispute;



             16.9 In such a case, the High Court may quash the criminal
             proceeding if in view of the compromise between the disputants,
             the possibility of a conviction is remote and the continuation of a
             criminal proceeding would cause oppression and prejudice; and

             16.10 There is yet an exception to the principle set out in
             propositions 16.8 and 16.9 above. Economic offences involving
             the financial and economic well-being of the state have
             implications which lie beyond the domain of a mere dispute
             between private disputants. The High Court would be justified in
             declining to quash where the offender is involved in an activity
             akin to a financial or economic fraud or mis-demeanour. The
             consequences of the act complained of upon the financial or
             economic system will weigh in the balance.



7.           It is evident that in view of the amicable resolution of the issues

amongst the parties, no useful purpose would be served by continuation of the

proceedings. The furtherance of the proceedings is likely to be a waste of

judicial time and there appears to be no chances of conviction.



8.           The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of "
Ramgopal and

another versus State of Madhya Pradesh
" reported as 2021 SCC online SC

83, that the matters which can be categorized as personal in nature or in the

matters in which the nature of injuries do not exhibit mental depravity or

commission of an offence of such a serious nature that quashing of which

would override public interest, the Court can quash the FIR in view of the

settlement arrived at amongst the parties. The observation of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court is extracted as under:




                   "19. We thus sum up and hold that as opposed to

             320

         'compoundable' within the statutory framework, the extra-
         ordinary power enjoined upon a High Court under 
Section
         482
 Cr.P.C. or vested in this Court under 
Article 142
 of the
         Constitution, can be invoked beyond the metes and bounds
         of 
Section 320
 Cr.P.C. Nonetheless, we reiterate that such
         powers of wide amplitude ought to be exercised carefully in the
         context of quashing criminal proceedings, bearing in mind: (i)
         Nature and effect of the offence on the conscious of the society;

         (ii) Seriousness of the injury, if any; (iii) Voluntary nature of
         compromise between the accused and the victim; & (iv)
         Conduct of the accused persons, prior to and after the
         occurrence of the purported offence and/or other relevant
         considerations.



               20. Having appraised the afore-stated parameters and
         weighing upon the peculiar facts and circumstances of the two
         appeals before us, we are inclined to invoke powers
         under 
Article 142
 and quash the criminal proceedings and
         consequently set aside the conviction in both the appeals. We
         say so for the reasons that:



         Firstly, the occurrence(s) involved in these appeals can be
         categorized as purely personal or having overtones of criminal
         proceedings of private nature;



         Secondly, the nature of injuries incurred, for which the
         Appellants have been convicted, do not appear to exhibit their
         mental depravity or commission of an offence of such a serious
         nature that quashing of which would override public interest;



         Thirdly, given the nature of the offence and injuries, it is
         immaterial that the trial against the Appellants had been
         concluded or their appeal(s) against conviction stand
         dismissed;



         Fourthly, the parties on their own volition, without any
         coercion or compulsion, willingly and voluntarily have buried

            their differences and wish to accord a quietus to their
            dispute(s);



             Fifthly, the occurrence(s) in both the cases took place way
            back in the years 2000 and 1995, respectively. There is nothing
            on record to evince that either before or after the purported
            compromise, any untoward incident transpired between the
            parties;



            Sixthly, since the Appellants and the complainant(s) are
            residents of the same village(s) and/or work in close vicinity,
            the quashing of criminal proceedings will advance peace,
            harmony, and fellowship amongst the parties who have decided
            to forget and forgive any ill-will and have no vengeance against
            each other; and

            Seventhly, the cause of administration of criminal justice
            system would remain un-effected on acceptance of the amicable
            settlement between the parties and/or resultant acquittal of the
            Appellants; more so looking at their present age.



9.          A perusal of the FIR shows that the dispute pertains to the

alleged snatching of gold ear rings of the complainant. The accused persons

are alleged to have attacked the grand-mother of the complainant and of

having eloped after the same. The petitioners have realized their mistake and

thereupon have entered into a settlement with the complainant. No dispute

survives between the parties. Even though, one another FIR No.38 of 2019

has been registered against the petitioners for offence under 
Sections 304


and 
311
 IPC at Police Station Thulliwal, District Barnala, however, the same

should not restrain the parties from entering into a settlement of a dispute

that is in relation to an offence which is neither heinous nor causes mental

depravity to the complainant as well as the victim. The case is at the initial

stages and the parties can be saved of agony of having to face protracted

laid down by
 the Apex Court in "Gian Singh Versus State of

the Full Bench of this Court in "

involved in the instant case pertains to offence under 
Section 379-B
 IPC

which cannot be perceived as falling within the prohibited category or as an

offence that is heinous and grossly shocking to the conscience of the Court

subsequent proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed, in light of the
