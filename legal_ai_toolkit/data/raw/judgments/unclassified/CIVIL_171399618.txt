3.      Brief facts of the present case are as under:-



3.1     That the original plaintiff - Khushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel

filed Special Civil Suit No.536 of 1982 seeking division and/or

partition of ancestral property and to handover the legal

possession of the suit property. The plaintiff, defendant no.1 and

deceased Umedbhai Chhotabhai Patel are the real brothers.



Chhotabhai Amdubhai Patel was holding various agricultural

lands and property in Village: Bhayali. That after the death of

Chhotabhai, one Lambha Lekh (family settlement) dated

27.03.1950 was executed between the mother - Jivaben and

three brothers and the property was divided as per the Lambha

Lekh. The deceased Umedbhai had executed a registered sale

deed on 10.05.1961 and accordingly he became the owner and

came into possession of the share, which belonged to deceased

Umedbhai. In the said Lambha Lekh, the brothers and mother -



Jivaben had made arrangement for maintenance of the mother

and after the death of Jivaben, the share of the mother was

divided between all the brothers. The defendant no.1 filed a

       C/SA/365/2019                                     JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




revenue case before the Revenue Authority claiming to be the

tenant of the suit property, which had come into the share of the

plaintiff and deceased Umedbhai. The claim of the defendant

was rejected and revenue proceedings culminated in favour of

the plaintiff. The division of the agricultural property had not

taken place and defendant no.1 used to raise dispute including

criminal case and restrained the plaintiff in cultivating the land

which had come into his share and this had caused to file the

suit. The original plaintiff filed Special Civil Suit No.536 of 1982

for division / partition of the ancestral property and for

permanent injunction before the Civil Court, Senior Division,

Vadodara (hereinafter be referred to as the "Trial Court").



3.2     The Trial Court having regard to the pleadings of the

parties framed the following issues vide Exhibit 161.



          (1)   Whether the plaintiff proves that after the death of
                Chhotabhai, the property of the Chhotabhai was
                divided between Jivaben, Umedbhai, plaintiff and
                defendant   No.1    as    per       Lambha   Lekh     dated
                27.03.1950 as alleged?

          (2)   Whether the plaintiff proves that he has got 2/3 share
                in the H.U.F. property as alleged?

          (3)   Whether the plaintiff proves that the suit is barred
                under law of limitation?

          (4)   Whether the defendants prove that they have
                become the owners by adverse possession?

          (5)   Whether the suit is bad for misjoinder of the parties?
          (6)   Whether the plaintiff is entitled for getting the
                possession of the suit property as described in plaint
                at para 11(1)?

          (7)   Whether the plaintiff is entitled to claim relief as
                prayed?

          (8)   What order and decree?



3.3     The issues framed by the Trial Court referred to above

came to be answered as under:-



          (1)   In the negative;

          (2)   In the affirmative:

          (3)   In the negative;

          (7)   In the affirmative;

          (8)   As per final order;



3.4     The Trial Court, on appreciation of the oral as well as

documentary evidence on record, decreed the suit with cost and

the defendants were ordered to handover the suit property as

prayed in para-11 of the plaint within six months and if the

defendants fail to comply with an order they will be at liberty to

ask for the further relief for the appointment of the Court

Commissioner regarding the compliance after the completion of

six months. Further, regarding relief of mense profit, the Trial

Court dismissed the same.



3.5     The Trial Court, while deciding the suit, has observed in

paragraphs no.6, 7 and 8 as under:-



          "6.    As far as the issue no.1 is concerned, the burden of
          proof lies on the plaintiff to prove it that HUF property is
          belonging to Chhotabhai Amthabhai divided between the
          brothers as per Lambha Lekh dated 27.03.1950. As per the
          say of the plaintiff, his father was expired before long time
          and widow of deceased Chhotabhai Amthabhai is Jiviben
          who is known as Jibaben and he has divided the suit
          property as per Lambha Lekh dated 27.03.1950. The
          Lambha Lekh is produced and proved at Exh.31 and
          looking to the Lambha Lekh, it appears that the property is
          divided but the said Lambha Lekh is not registered and
          looking to the Lambha Lekh, it appears that the property is
          an agricultural land and it belongs to S.No.648, 168 and
          171/1 and other are fragment land and the provisions of
          the Fragmentation law is applicable as agricultural land is

 C/SA/365/2019                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    divided into various parts and the parts have gone to three
    brothers. Looking to the entire record of this matter, it
    appears to me that no doubt, the Lambha Lekh is executed
    but no action has taken place pertaining to the division of
    the property as per Lambha Lekh and has not been divided
    as Lambha Lekh hence issue no.1 in negative.



    7.     As far as issue no.2 is concerned, there is no dispute
    between the parties that the plaintiff and deceased
    Bhikhabhai was real brothers and defendant nos.2 to 5 are
    legal heirs of deceased Bhikhabhai and they have got the
    interest in the property of their father. As the plaintiff has
    purchased the property from Umedbhai it was purchased
    by the plaintiff which can be seen at Exh.84. Hence, the
    plaintiff has become the owner of 2/3 share of the property
    and his mother was expired hence by Hindu Succession
    right, the plaintiff is getting 1/2 share of the property of
    the deceased mother Jiviben. Moreover, defendant no.1
    had raised some dispute pertaining to the said property
    which was dismissed by the Revenue Officer, regarding the
    contention as to a tenant. The deposition of the defendant
    in revenue proceedings is produced at Exh.90 wherein the
    defendant has admitted that the plaintiff has got 2/3 right
    in the suit property hence reply of issue no.2 comes in
    affirmative. Moreover, the suit property is belonging to the
    ancestral one and there is no dispute between the parties.
    Moreover, in the written statement also, the defendant
    never contended that the suit property is not an ancestral
    one. The defendant is examined at Exh.122 wherein the
    defendant has agreed that property No.171/1, 1156,
    1628/2 and 1686 are belonging to Chhotabhai Amthabhai.

 C/SA/365/2019                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    Moreover,    it is admitted that the house No.550 was
    purchased by Chhotabhai Amthabhai hence one thing is
    crystal clear that the entire suit property was belonging to
    ancestral one hence I have no hesitation in quote here that
    the suit property is belonging to the Hindu Undivided
    Property and as per the division made in the Lambha Lekh
    dated 27.03.1950 some property had gone in the part of
    the plaintiff, defendant and deceased Umedbhai and as per
    the sale deed as proved by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has
    purchased the property which has gone to Umedbhai and
    more particularly after the death of mother Jiba 1/2
    property have gone in the favour of the plaintiff hence the
    plaintiff has got 2/3 part of the share of the entire suit
    property as described in the Lambha Lekh hence reply of
    issue no.2 comes in affirmative.



    As far as issue no.3 is concerned, the defendant has raised
    a contention regarding the provision of the 
Limitation Act
,
    as suit is barred under law of limitation. For that purpose
    one thing can be seen that no doubt, that the Lambha Lekh
    is not registered but as per the execution of the Lambha
    Lekh, all the parties were having the possession of the
    properties regarding the averments made in the Lambha
    Lekh and whatever, the property had gone in favour of all
    brothers and mother they were enjoying the property but
    the dispute had raised in the year 1982. The defendant
    no.1 quarreled with the plaintiff and fractured was also
    made to the plaintiff and defendant no.1 was convicted by
    the Court of law and it can be seen that in the year 1982,
    the defendant no.1 has taken the possession of the
    property hence one thing is crystal clear to note that on

 C/SA/365/2019                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    13.06.1982, the defendant no.1 had taken the possession.
    One another thing can be noted from Exh.37 to 42 utara
    which can be seen that property had gone in favour of the
    plaintiff and a possession has been cited separately and
    agricultural right is also cited in 7/12 utara. In the year
    1982 the plaintiff was having the possession of the two
    lands in supporting their contentions they had proved and
    produced a revenue receipt at mark 61 to 82 which are
    belonging for the year 1982-83 which can be presumed
    that the plaintiff was cultivating the suit land. Moreover,
    the plaintiff was pleased to sell the cotton to the Varnama
    Group Society which is in the year 1982 hence one thing is
    crystal clear to note that the plaintiff was having the
    possession of the suit property till 1982. Moreover, the
    plaintiff has produced a tax assessment, copy of it
    produced at Exh.96 which year of 1981-82 the property
    was running in the name of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has
    paid which can be seen by receipt at Exh.62 & 63 hence
    there is no hesitation to hold that the plaintiff was having
    the possession of the suit property right from Lambha Lekh
    to 1982. While in the written statement, the defendant has
    raised the contention that the plaintiff has got monetary
    right but nothing has been proved in deposition and by the
    documentary     evidence.      Moreover,   no   documentary
    evidence is proved by the plaintiff that he has right over
    the suit property from 1950 hence the provision of the law
    of limitation proved in this case hence the suit was filed in
    the year 1982, in the year 1982 the plaintiff dispossessed
    by the defendant. Hence this issue is not proved by the
    defendant. Hence, issue nos.3 & 4 come in negative.

    8.     As far as issue no.5 is concerned, the defendant no.2
    to 5 have been joined as a defendant they are the legal
    heirs of defendant no.1. To avoid the technicalities and at
    the time of handing over the possession of legal heirs may
    put some hurdles hence the plaintiff was pleased to join
    them as defendant hence the present suit is not bad for
    misjoinder of the parties. One thing is crystal clear that as
    far as the suit property is concerned, the present suit is not
    barred by law of limitation as well as adverse possession.
    Moreover, the provision of the Fragmentation Act is not
    applicable in this matter. Moreover, it is proved that the
    present plaintiff was having the possession over the suit
    property right from 1952 to 1982 hence the plaintiff is
    entitled to claim the relief as prayed. The plaintiff's L.A.
    Mr.Y. M. Pandya produced the case of Girijanandini Devi
    Vs. Bijendra Narain Choudhary, AIR 1967 SC 1124 wherein
    the provision of the Hindu law is provided that it is held
    that the rights of the coparceners are defined when there
    is partition. Partition consists in defining the share of the
    coparceners in the joint property actual division of the
    property by metes and bounds is not necessary to
    constitute partition. Once the shares are defined, whether
    by agreement between the parties or otherwise, partition
    is complete. Mr. Pandya argued before me that Lambha
    Lekh is proved it is not necessary that as per the Lambha
    Lekh the possession was handed over. But one thing is
    crystal clear to note that the partition of the suit property
    has really taken place. As far as relief prayed at para 7, 8
    are concerned, it is held that the plaintiff is entitled to get
    the relief."

3.6     Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned

judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court, the original

defendants preferred Regular Civil Appeal No.43 of 2008 before

the District Court, Vadodara [hereinafter referred to as the "first

Appellate Court"] wherein the First Appellate Court framed the

following issues at Exhibit 161.



          (1)    Whether      the   Trial   Court      committed    error      in
                concluding that the plaintiff / opponent has 2/3rd
                share in the H.U.F. property as alleged?



          (2)   Whether the the Trial court committed error in
                rejecting the plea of adverse possession raised by the
                appellant / defendant?



          (3)   Whether the Trial Court committed any error in
                concluding that the suit is within the period of
                limitation?



          (4)   Whether the Trial Court committed any error in
                passing order to the effect that the plaintiff shall be at
                liberty to ask for appointment of Court commissioner
                regarding the compliance, though Sec.54 of the Civil
                Procedure Code provides partition of estate or
                separate of share on the basis of decree shall be
                made by Collector or any Subordinate Officer of the
                Collector?

          (5)   Whether the judgment and decree passed by the Trial
                Court is erroneous, illegal and without appreciation of
                evidence are required any interference?



3.7     The points determined by the first Appellate Court referred

to above came to be answered as under:-



          (1)    In negative;
          (2)   In negative;
          (3)   In negative;
          (4)   Partly in affirmative;
          (5)   In negative;



3.8     The first Appellate Court, while deciding the appeal, has


observed in paragraphs no.14.1, 14.2, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24,

25, 26, 27 and 28 as under:-



          "14.1 The trial Court has recorded in the impugned
          judgment that, there is no dispute between the parties
          pertaining to Lambha Lekh in the year 1950. The Lambha
          Lekh is produced and proved vide Ex.31. The Trial Court
          answered issue No.1 with regard to division of suit property
          on the basis of Lambha Lekh dated 27.3.1950, in Negative.
          However the Trial Court has recorded that, the Lambha
          Lekh is produced and proved at Ex.31 and looking to the
          Lambha Lekh it appears that, the property is divided but

    and answers issue No.1 in negative but further records
    that, the Lambha Lekh is executed but no action pertaining
    to division of property as per Lambha Lekh has taken
    place.



    14.2 Under these circumstances, this Court is required to
    consider as to whether there was execution of Lambha
    Lekh and whether the parties had decided to divide the
    share as per Lambha Lekh or not ? As per Lambha Lekh
    (Ex.31), all the three sons of Chhotabhai Patel i.e.
    Umedbhai Patel, Bhikhabhai Patel and Khushalbhai Patel
    decided to distribute suit property which is recorded in
    Lambha Lekh. It is stated that, Umedbhai will get the
    property as per condition No.1, Bhikhabhai will get
    property as per condition No.2 and Khushalbhai will get
    property as per condition No.3 and it is also recorded that,
    rest of the property remains undistributed and is kept for
    the maintenance of their mother and after the death of
    their mother, the property would be divided equally
    amongst the three brothers. The Lambha Lekh is signed by
    Umedbhai Patel, Bhikhabhai Patel and Khushalbhai Patel.
    The Ld. Trial Court has specifically recorded that the
    Lambha Lekh is proved. This Court records its concurrence
    with the findings of the Trial Court. The fact with regard to
    the execution of Lambha Lekh, each brother agreed 1/3rd
    share in suit property, is not only proved as recorded
    herein above, but also considering the subsequent
    proceedings which were initiated between the brothers,
    more particularly by defendant Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai
    Patel.

    15. Ex.84 is the copy of registered sale deed executed by
    Umedbhai Chhotabhai Patel in favour of Khushalbhai
    Chhotabhai Patel (Plaintiff). Description of the property in
    the above registered sale deed describes the property as
    agricultural land bearing Survey No.172 and named
    "Dibatiyu", ad-measuring 5.5 Vigha, agricultural land
    bearing     Survey   No.648       and       named      "Ankoliyu",
    admeasuring 5.5 Vigha and one house in village Bhaiyali. It
    also appears from this sale deed that, Umedbhai had 1/3rd
    share as similarly recorded in Lambha Lekh dated
    27.03.1950 in condition No.1 of the said Lambha Lekh. By
    the said registered sale deed the fact with regard to
    division of share i.e. 1/3rd share of each brother stands
    concluded from the Lambha Lekh as well as from the
    registered sale deed executed by Umedbhai Patel. This fact
    is further fortified considering the judgment and decree
    recorded below RCS No.67/1963, which was filed by
    deceased - Umedbhai Chhotabhai Patel against plaintiff -
    Khushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel. The suit was filed by
    Umedbhai      Chhotabhai      Patel        against    Khushalbhai
    Chhotabhai Patel seeking cancellation of sale deed dated
    10.5.1961 and the said suit was dismissed. Against this
    Judgment and Decree, deceased - Umedbhai Chhotabhai
    Patel had preferred Civil Appeal No.112/1966 and the said
    appeal was dismissed with cost vide order dated 8.8.1967
    by the 2nd Extra Assistant Judge, Baroda. The copy of
    Judgment and order dated 8.8.1967 recorded below Civil
    Appeal No.112/66 is produced vide Ex.87. Nothing is
    brought on record as to whether there were further
    challenge to the order passed in above referred appeal and
    the said decision has attained finality, meaning thereby to

    believe     that,   the   plaintiff Khushal   Chhotabhai      had
    purchased share of Umedbhai by way of registered sale
    deed as established from the above referred two decisions
    of the Civil Court as well as Appellate Court which were
    preferred by Deceased Umedhai Chhotabhai Patel.



    15.1 The fact with regard to each brother had 1/3rd suit
    property is not only proved from above referred discussion,
    but is further emerging from the very proceedings initiated
    by Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai Patel (Appellant/ Defendant).
    Ex.89 is a copy of order dated 8.10.1976 passed by the
    Mamlatdar and ALT, Vadodara, in Case No.1781/1975
    wherein Bhikhabhai had claimed that he holds possession
    of his 1/3rd share and the opponent Khushal and Umedbhai
    holds 2/3rd Share and Bhikhabhai had claimed relief to
    declare him as tenant of the 2/3rd share which belonged to
    Khushalbhai and Umedbhai. The claim of Bhikhabhai with
    regard to tenancy is rejected by the Mamlatdar's Order
    dated 8.10.1976 (Ex.89).



    16. Ex.90 is the copy of deposition of Bhikhabhai
    Chhotabhai Patel recorded in proceedings U/s.70B of the
    Tenancy Act. On reading deposition of the Bhikhabhai
    Chhotabhai Patel, he has stated that, opponents are his
    real brothers and he is cultivating 2/3rd share which
    belongs to his two brothers. Thus admission on the part of
    Bhikhabhai makes it clear and prove that, there were three
    brothers having equal share i.e. 1/3rd share in the said
    property. He has also stated that, the property is divided
    and shares are divided separately amongst three brothers.
    He has admitted that, the names of his brothers are

    recorded in the Revenue Records. He has also admitted
    that, 1/3rd share is recorded in his name and 2/3rd share is
    recorded in the name of opponent No.1 i.e. in the name of
    plaintiff Khushalbhai. This deposition is recorded on
    3.2.1976 in proceedings before the additional Mamlatdar
    under the 
Tenancy Act
.



    17. Ex.91 is the copy of RCS No.1780/1981, which was
    preferred by Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai Patel (Appellant /
    Defendant)      against   Khushalbhai       C.      Patel    (Plaintiff/
    Opponent), wherein the Additional Mamlatdar has recorded
    that, the opponent i.e. Khushalbhai is cultivating the land
    in   question    and   rejected   the      claim     of     Bhikhabhai
    Chhotabhai Patel and further ordered to record the name
    in Revenue Records in Survey No.7/1B, 168, 171/1,
    648,1156/2, 1628/2 and 1686. The above order was also
    challenged by appellant/ defendant Bhikhabhai Chhotabhai
    Patel by way of RTS Appeal No.34/1981, which was also
    rejected and order passed by the Mamlatdar was
    confirmed by Dy. Collector vide order dated 25.11.1983.
    The documentary evidence produced in the nature of tax
    assessment, Revenue Records makes it clear that, the
    property was in the possession and was recorded in the
    name of the Plaintiff - Khushalbhai Chhotabhai Patel.



    20. One of the contention raised by the appellant is to the
    effect that, the Trial Court did not consider that, the
    appellant/ defendant had become owner of the suit
    property by adverse possession. To deal with the above
    contention with regard to adverse possession, it would be
    relevant to note that, the appellant/ defendant is claiming

 C/SA/365/2019                                      JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    adverse possession with the co-owners who are real
    brothers. It is settled position of law that, there could be no
    adverse possession between coowners, unless there has
    been a denial of title and an ouster to the knowledge of the
    other.



    21. In the present case as recorded herein above, on one
    hand it is admitted by the appellant/ defendant before the
    Revenue Authorities that all the brothers were having
    equal shares and even it was his specific contention before
    the Revenue Authority under the tenancy proceedings
    that, he is holding his 1/3rd share and is in possession of
    2/3rd share of his two brothers i.e. 1/3rd share of
    Khushalbhai and 1/3rd share of deceased Umedbhai. The
    appellant / original defendant Bhikhabhai claimed adverse
    possession of 2/3rd share, however, there 18 Regular Civil
    Appeal No.43/2008 is no evidence to prove the plea of
    adverse possession. To deal with the contention of adverse
    possession, it would be relevant to refer case law on this
    issue.



    21.1 The Hon'ble Apex Court in recent decision in case of
    Nanjegowda     @    Gowda    (dead)       by   legal     heirs     Vs.
    Ramegowda, 2018(1), SCC 574, in the said case the suit
    was for declaration of title over part of family property.
    Defendant admitting oral partition in the family and its
    implementation. The defendant failed to independently
    establish his case by leading cogent evidence and decree
    was passed in the favour of plaintiff and the said decree
    was upheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court. In the said case,
    claim of adverse possession was also raised and the

 C/SA/365/2019                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    Hon'ble Apex Court has held that, there cannot be adverse
    possession amongst members of one family for want of
    animus among them for land belonging to their family."



 
21.2 The three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
    case of 
P. Lakshmi Reddy Vs. R. Lakshmi Reddy
, while
    examining the necessary conditions for applicability of
    doctrine of ouster to the share of co-owners held that,


    "The ordinary classical requirement of adverse possession
    is that, it should be nec vi nec clam nec precario.
 
[See
    Secretary of State for 
India Vs. Debendra Lal Khan
, AIR
    1934, SC 23), 82]."




    The possession required must be adequate, in continuity,
    in publicity and in extent to show that, it is possession
    adverse to the competitor. But it is well settled that, in
    order to establish adverse possession of one co-heir
    against another it is not enough to show that, one out of
    them is in sole possession and enjoyment of the profits of
    the properties. Ouster of that non-possession co-heir by
    the co-heir in possession who claims his possession to be
    adverse, should be made out. The possession of one heir is
    considered, in law, as possession of all the co-heirs. When
    one co-heir is found to be in possession of the properties, it
    is presumed to be on the basis of joint title. The co-heir in
    possession cannot render his possession adverse to the
    other co-heir not in possession merely by any secret,
    hostile, animus on his own part in derogation of other co-
    heirs title. It is settled rule of law that as between co-heirs
    there must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title,

    coupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one
    of them to the knowledge of the other, so as to constitute
    ouster. The above referred observation are made and
    referred by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Nagabhusha
    Nammal (D) by legal heirs Vs. C. Chandikeswara Lingam,
    AIR 2016 SC 1134. In view of the above principle with
    regard to adverse possession,there being no evidence to
    support the contention, this Court do not finds any merits
    in the contentions raised by the appellant/ defendant and
    accordingly point No.2 is answered in negative.



    23. The plaintiff in his plaint has stated that, the cause to
    file the suit aroused when the Mamlatdar did not accept
    the division of suit property as per Lambha Lekh. The
    cause aroused on 23.8.1982 as the Mamlatdar did not
    accept division and there were continuous disputes
    between the brothers and therefore he filed suit in the year
    1982. The defendant / appellant has raised the issue of
    limitation in his written statement by stating that, the suit
    is filed beyond period of limitation of period of 12 years. On
    going through the evidence which is produced by the
    respective parties, it appears that, each brother was
    holding 1/3rd share in the said property and all the
    brothers were enjoying the 20 Regular Civil Appeal
    No.43/2008 property and were in the possession of the suit
    property as per their share. The dispute is said to have
    arise in the year 1982 and this gave the cause of filing the
    suit. The Revenue Records also discloses that, the plaintiff
    was in possession of his share as well as share of deceased

    - Umedbhai which plaintiff had purchased by way of
    registered sale deed and defendant was in possession of

    his 1/3rd share. The appellant / defendant - Bikhabhai
    Chhotahai Patel had initiated various proceedings before
    the Revenue authority, Mamlatdar claiming 2/3rd share as
    tenant which belong to plaintiff - Khushalbhai and
    Umedbhai     which     is   not    tilted   in   favour     of     the
    appellant/defendant.



    24. Ex.27 to Ex.42 are the extracts of Revenue records
    which establish that, the property had come in favour of
    the plaintiff and even possession is recorded separately in
    7/12 extract. It also appears from the revenue receipt
    produced under Mark-61 to Mark-82 that, plaintiff was in
    possession of the two lands. The other documentary
    evidence in the form of Tax Assessment copy (Ex.96),
    Receipt (Ex.62 and 63) discloses that, the plaintiff/
    opponent - Khushalbhai was in possession of the suit
    property upto year 1982. The defendant on the other hand
    except raising contentions that, suit is barred by limitation
    has not been able to prove that, how suit is barred by
    limitation. In view of the above, discussion this Court, do
    not find any error or illegality in the findings of the Trial
    Court that, the suit is not barred by limitation.



    25. The appellant/defendant has raised issue in this appeal
    that to the Trial Court while passing impugned judgment
    has ignored provisions of Sec.54 and Order-20 Rule-18(2)
    and though the competent authority would be the Collector
    or any Gazetted Officer or Subordinate of Collector, who
    will partition or separate the share in case of decree of
    partition of undivided estate. It is stated that, the trial
    Court committed error in ordering to comply with the order

    passed in the judgment and it would be open for the
    plaintiff to seek further relief for appointment of Court
    Commissioner regarding the compliance after completion
    of six months.



    26. 
Sec.54
 of CPC deals with the partition of estate or
    separation of share. It provides that, where ever the
    decree is for partition of undivided estate, access to
    payment or separation of share the same shall be made by
    the Collector or any Gazetted Officer Subordinate Officer to
    the Collector.



    27. Order-20, Rule-18 deals with the procedure in case of
    decree in suit for partition of property or separate
    possession of a share. Rule-18 also provides separation or
    partition to be made by the Collector or Gazetted Officer
    Subordinate of the Collector deputed by him in his behalf
    in consonance with the provisions of Sec.54. To this extent
    this Court finds that, the Trial Court could not have granted
    liberty to apply for Court Commissioner, when Sec.54 and
    Order-20 Rule-18 provides specific provisions in connection
    with partition. Even Learned Advocate Mr. Pandya for the
    Opponent has stated that, he have no objection if the
    decree of the trial court is effected as per the provision of
    Section 54 and Order-20 Rule-18 
of the CPC
. To this extent
    the operative order which grants liberty to apply for Court
    Commissioner requires to be interfered considering the
    provisions of Sec.54 and Order-20 Rule-18 and it is
    modified to the extent that, the decree shall be effected as
    per the provisions of Sec.54 and Order-20 Rule-18 of Civil
    Procedure Code.

    evidence recorded before the Trial Court, this Court do not

    concurrence with the findings and Judgment of the Trial

committed error in interpreting the documentary evidence as

house no.815 (new no.990) city survey no.113, 815/1 - Vada

Land having panchayat no.991 (new number) city survey

no.1102 was purchased by Umedbhai Patel. He submitted that in

view of the above facts, the appeal deserves allowed.



6.1. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants

submitted that Special Civil Suit No.536 of 1982 came to be filed

by     Khushalbhai   Chhotabhai       Patel,    against         Bhikhabhai

Chhotabhai, Vinodbhai Bhikhabhai Patel, Thakorbhai Bhikhabhai

Patel and Bharatbhai Bhikhabhai Patel. He submitted that the

original    plaintiff,   original     defendant     no.1     and       Umedbhai

Chhotabhai Patel were the real brothers and after the death of

Chhotabhai Amthabhai Patel i.e. father of original plaintiff -



Khushalbhai, a Lambha Lekh dated 27.03.1950 came to be

executed and the plaintiff had preferred the suit on the basis of

the Lambha Lekh which came to be executed for arrangement of

various properties amongst the legal heirs and representatives of

deceased Chhotabhai. He submitted that the plaintiff filed the

suit on the basis of the fact that if Lambha Lekh was not being

considered or accepted or believed by the Court, then the

properties mentioned in the plaint as well as Lambha Lekh be

partitioned amongst the plaintiff and defendants. While referring

to the paper-book, he submitted that the suit was filed seeking

partition of the properties and the cause of action arisen for

seeking partition by metes and bounds through the revenue

department, as at the relevant point of time, on passing of the

preliminary decrees, on declaration of the respective shares of

the concerned plaintiff - defendant, the actual physical

possession and actual demarcation of respective portion of

shares was to be done through the revenue department. He also

referred to para-11, 11(2), 11(3) and 11(6) of the prayers clause

and submitted that the said prayers are in respect of seeking

partition of the properties as mentioned in the suit. It is

submitted that even the Lambha Lekh at Exhibit 31 is an

unregistered document. He further submitted that original

defendants have filed written statement to the plaint and

counter affidavit to the interim injunction application denying all

the averments and contentions and contended that no partition

had ever taken place.      He submitted that the judgment and

decree passed by the Trial Court provided that division of

ancestral properties and/or partition of the said properties and

permanent injunction and thus, the nature of the suit itself was

considered as a suit for division of ancestral properties and

partition of the properties.



6.2     It is submitted that the Trial Court has observed in para-6

of the judgment and decree that no doubt, the Lambha Lekh was

executed but no action has taken place pertaining to the division

of the properties as per the Lambha Lekh and has not been

divided as per the Lambha Lekh. He submitted that the findings

of the Trial Court have become final and after giving the

reasoning, the suit came to be decreed and possession is

ordered to be handed over to the concerned plaintiffs and, thus,

the reasons assigned by the Trial Court are contradictory to law.



He submitted that the defendants stated that no Lambha Lekh

was executed and no partition had taken place on the basis of

the said document and the same is not a document which

provides for division of properties amongst the coparcener of the

Hindu Undivided Family. He submitted that the deposition of the

plaintiff at Exhibit 30 is required to be considered and the

deposition of the defendant in respect of 
Section 70(b)
 of the

Tenancy Act is very much relevant. It is submitted that in view of

the statutory provisions of 
Section 17
 of the Indian Registration

Act, the Lambha Lekh could not be considered as a document,

which declares the division of the respective shares in their

respective          properties   amongst      the   coparcener        of     Hindu

Undivided Family. He submitted that neither there is any

challenge made to the findings of the Trial Court nor any cross-



objections have been filed by the original plaintiff as it ought to

have been done under Order XXXIX Rule 22 of the Civil

Procedure Code. He submitted that in view of the findings on

issue No.1 and issue no.2, the decree could not have been

passed and the suit could not have been allowed and, therefore,

the judgment and decree of the Trial Court which came to be

confirmed by the first Appellate Court deserves to be quashed

and set aside. He submitted that the plaintiff failed to make out

any averments in the plaint and to lead oral as well as

documentary evidence as to what had happened to the

properties which had gone into the share of Jibaben @ Jiviben. He

submitted that as per the settled proposition of law, in a suit for

decree of partition, the Trial Court ought to have passed the

preliminary decree by which the respective shares in the

properties ought to have been declared and, thereafter, the

further orders ought to have been passed for actual physical

division of the share of the concerned coparcener and,

thereafter, the final decree for physical division be metes and

bounds was required to be passed. He also submitted that the

preliminary         decree   and   final     decree    have       been       passed

simultaneously which is serious error cropped-up by both the

Courts below. While referring to the deposition of the defendants

at page no.105 and page-93, he submitted that it is clearly

established that the defendant stated that the defendants are in

possession of the entire lands since 1951-1952 and no partition

could be said to have effected, however, the said aspects have

not been considered by both the Courts below. He has submitted

that various civil proceedings had taken place between the two

other brothers, however, the defendants were not parties to the

suit and sale transaction which had taken place was without the

consent of the defendants and, therefore, the sale transactions

was null and void and, therefore, the judgment and decree

passed in earlier suit would not be binding to the present

appellants - original defendants. He further submitted that the

plaintiff approached before the revenue authority on 02.09.1976

and considering the averments made in para-7, para-14 and

Lambha Lekh, it appears that the suit was barred by law of

limitation as the limitation was started from 27.03.1950 and the

same had continued to remain in force and the suit was filed on

30.12.1982, which came to be barred by law of limitation. He has

submitted that considering 
Article 113
 of the 
Limitation Act
, the

       C/SA/365/2019                            JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




suit for partition ought to have been filed within a period of three

years and the suit for possession ought to have been filed within

the period of three years from the date of the so-called Lambha

Lekh. He has submitted that survey no.171/1 was never sold by

one of the brother - Umedbhai to the plaintiff, however, the

decree provides the same and, therefore, there is serious error

cropped-up while passing the decree. He has submitted that the

provisions of Section 103 of the Civil Procedure Code, this Court

can interfere with the findings of facts in a given case if finding

of question of law is erroneous and if Trial Court's decree is

perverse or without considering the pleadings and relevant

evidence or on erroneous approaches or requires constructions

of documents. He lastly submitted that in view of the facts and

circumstances of the case, the appeal deserves to be allowed.

counsel appearing for the respondent - original plaintiff. He

submitted that Trial Courts below have not committed any error

while     passing    the   impugned     orders.    He     submitted           that

Chhotabhai Amthabhai Patel died in the year 1950, Jibaben Wd/o.



Chhotabhai Patel died in the year 1961 and their legal heirs are

Khushalbhai - original plaintiff and Bhikhabhai - original

defendant. He submitted that the present appeal is against the

concurrent findings recorded by both the Courts and when the

Courts below have, after appreciating the oral as well as

documentary evidence and after considering the arguments

advanced by all the parties passed the orders and, therefore, this

Court cannot go into the question of facts arising in the matter

and interference with such findings of facts is impermissible or

re-appreciation of the evidence and the present appeal is not

required to be entertained and called for any interference. He

     C/SA/365/2019                            JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




submitted that Lambha Lekh is not a document effecting

partition, but is a document merely recording the oral partition

which had taken place between the parties; the law in this issue

is well settled only a document effecting partition is mandatorily

registerable under 
Section 17
 of the Registration Act 1908 and

since    Lambha Lekh is not mandatorily registerable, the bar

under 
Section 49
 of the Registration Act, 1908 would not come

into play. Learned senior counsel pointed out that on existence

and execution of Lambha Lekh of 1950 affected in the year 1982

and even the defendant also contended before the concerned

Trial Court that when considering the adverse possession, he

became the owner of the parcel of land by virtue of the adverse

possession as he is cultivating the land since 1950-1952. He

submitted that the defendants have not challenged the same

before any of the authority and it is hit the provisions of the

limitation and barred by law of limitation. He submitted that the

contention with regard to the suit was barred by law of limitation,

the Trial Court has rightly dealt with the said contention in issue

no.3 and issue no.4. He submitted that the family settlement

arrived at in 1950 and it put into force in 1982 and since the

defendants have forcefully dispossessed the plaintiff from the

parcel of land, he filed the suit in the year 1982 and prayed for

the partition taken place in the year 1950 and the Trial Court has

rightly appreciated and dealt with in issue no.3 and issue no.4.



He also submitted that the first Appellate Court has, while

recording the concurrent findings in with the judgment and

decree of the Trial Court, rightly dealt with the evidence in its

true and proper spirit as observed in paragraph no.28 of the

judgment and order and, therefore, no interference is called for.

9.     
In the case of 
Ramabhai Shamalbhai Patel
 (supra), this

Court (Coram: Hon'ble Mr.Justice N. V. Anjaria) has observed in

paragraphs no.2 and 7.3 as under:-




         "2.    At the time of admission of this Appeal, the following
         substantial questions of law were formulated.



         (i) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the
         case, 
Section 8
 of the Limitation Act would override the
         provisions of 
Sections 6
 and 
7
 thereof?



         (ii) Whether the limitation for the plaintiff's Suit would be
         governed by 
Article 110
 of the 
Limitation Act
?



         (iii) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case,
         even if the Suit is otherwise time barred the reliefs sought
         by the plaintiff in respect of his share in the property of
         Ravjibhai-defendant No.1, who died pending the Appeal,
         would not be time barred?



         7.3    The contention that there is no limitation for partition
         suit thus rests here being without any substance. In this
         case as the cause of action accrued in the year 1968, the
         plaintiffs' partition suit was subjected to three years period

          of     limitation   under 
Article         113
 of       the 
Limitation
          Act
 and 
Section 6
 read with 
Section 8
 of the Limitation Act
          would apply."



10.     
In the case of 
Krishna Pillai Rajasekharam Nair
 (supra),

the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed in paragraph no.22 as

under:-




          "22. In our opinion, the suit filed in the present case being
          a suit for partition primarily and predominantly and the
          relief of redemption having been sought for only pursuant
          to the direction made by the High Court in its order of
          remand, the limitation for the suit would be governed
          by 
Article 120
 of Limitation Act, 1908. For a suit for
          partition the starting point of limitation is - when the right
          to sue accrues, that is, when the plaintiff has notice of his
          entitlement to partition being denied. In such a suit, the
          right of the redeeming co- mortgagor would be to resist the
          claim of non-redeeming co- mortgagor by pleading his right
          of contribution and not to part with the property unless the
          non-redeeming co-mortgagor had discharged his duty to
          make contribution. This equitable defence taken by the
          redeeming co-mortgagor in the written statement would
          not convert the suit into a suit for contribution filed by the
          non-redeeming co- mortgagor."

has observed in paragraph no.9 as under:-




       "9.    We are unable to accept the decision of the High
       Court as correct. The High Court overlooked the fact that
       so far as the G. P. Notes were concerned the decree upon
       the award only declared the rights of the parties. Under the
       decree Raghunath Das was entitled to have G. P. Notes of
       the value of Rs. 13,200 endorsed in the names of himself
       and Mst. Daropadi out of the G. P. Notes of the value of Rs.
       26,500. The award or the decree thereon did not actually
       divide the G. P. Notes by specifying which particular G. P.
       Notes were to be endorsed in the names of Gokul Chand
       and Mst. Daropadi or which of them were to be endorsed in
       the names of Raghunath Das and his mother. Until the G.
       P. Notes were actually divided, either by consent of parties
       or by the decree of the court, neither of the brothers could
       claim any particular piece of G. P. Notes as his separate
       property or ask for delivery of any particular C. P. Notes in
       specie. Gokul Chand not being agreeable to come to an
       amicable division of the G. P. Notes, Raghunath Das had
       perforce to seek the assistance of the court and pray that
       the entire lot of C. P. Notes of the value of Rs. 26,500 be
       divided by or under the directions of the court into two lots
       and one lot making up the value of Rs. 13,200 be endorsed
       in favour of him (Raghunath Das) and his mother by or on
       behalf of Gokul Chand and then delivered to him, the
       plaintiff. He could not in his plaint claim that particular
       pieces of G. P. Notes making up the value of Rs. 13,200 be
       delivered to him in specie. This being the true position, as
       we conceive it, Raghunath Das's suit cannot possibly be

    regarded as a suit for a " specific moveable property ".

 
That expression is apt only to cover a suit wherein the
    plaintiff can allege that he is entitled to certain specific
    moveable property and/or of which he is presently entitled
    to possession in specie and which the defendant has
    wrongfully taken from him and/or is illegally withholding
    from him. That is not the position here. It should be
    remembered that the two brothers were entitled to the G.
    P. Notes of the value of Rs. 26,500 originally as joint
    coparceners and thereafter, when the decree upon the
    award had been passed, as tenants- in-common. Until
    actual partition by consent of the parties or by court Gokul
    Chand, who held the custody of the G. P. Notes, could not
    be said to have taken them wrongfully from Raghunath
    Das and his possession of them could not be said to be or
    to have become unlawful. These considerations clearly
    distinguish this case from the case of 
Gopal Chandra Bose
    v. Surendra Nath Dutt
 on which the High Court relied
    because 
in that case
 the defendant had no right to or
    interest in the G. P. Notes in question and had no right to
    retain possession thereof. Therefore, to the present
    situation the terminus a quo specified in the third column
    of 
Art. 49
 can have no application. It is now well
    established that a suit by an heir against other heirs to
    recover his share of the moveable estate of a deceased
    person is not one for (1) (1908) XII C. W. N. 1010 specific
    moveable    property    wrongfully       taken   such     as     is
    contemplated by Art 49, but is governed by 
Art. 120.
 See
    Mohomed Riasat Ali v. Mussumat Hasin Banu (1). The only
    difference between the facts of that case and those of the
    present case is that here the rights of the parties had been

          declared by the decree upon the award but that
          circumstance does not appear to us to make any material
          difference in the application of the principle laid down by
          the Judicial Committee. The substance of the plaintiff's
          claims in both cases is for separating his share out of the
          estate and for allotment and delivery to him of his share so
          separated. In short such a suit is nothing but a suit for
          partition or division of the moveable properties held jointly
          or as tenants-in-common by the parties and there being no
          specific Article applicable to such a suit it must be
          governed by 
Art. 120.




12.     
In the case of 
Saraswatiben Kantilal Patel
 (supra), this

Court (Coram: Hon'ble Ms.Justice Harsha Devani) has observed in

paragraphs no.23 and 26 as under:-




 
"23. Thus, the Limitation Act does not prescribe any period
          of limitation for a suit for partition. The Supreme Court in
          the case of 
Krishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair v. Padmanabha
          Pillai
 (supra) was of the opinion that the suit filed in the
          said case being a suit for partition, the limitation for the
          suit would be governed by 
Article 120
 of the Limitation Act,
          1908. For a suit for partition, the starting point of limitation
          is - when the right to sue accrues, that is, when the
          plaintiff has notice of his entitlement to partition being
          denied. Therefore, 
Article 110
 of the 
Schedule to the
          Limitation Act, 1963
 which prescribes the period of
          limitation in case of a suit by a person excluded from a
          joint family property to enforce a right to share therein

 C/SA/365/2019                                    JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    would not be applicable to a suit for partition. In the light of
    
the above decision
 of the Supreme Court, the applicable
    provision would be 
Article 113
 of the 
Schedule to the
    Limitation Act, 1963
 which corresponds to 
Article 120
 of
    the Limitation Act, 1908 and provides for a limitation of
    three years from the date when the right to sue accrues.
    Accordingly, in the case at hand, the limitation would start
    running from the date of the plaintiffs' knowledge of denial
    of entitlement to partition.




 
26.    26. As discussed hereinabove, the limitation in the
    present case for instituting a suit for partition would be
    three years from the date of knowledge of the plaintiffs of
    denial of their entitlement to partition, which may be taken
    to be the date of filing of the present suit. As noticed
    earlier, the suit was instituted in the year 2008 whereas
    the application under rule 17 of Order VI of the Code was
    filed on or about 28th July, 2014, that is, after a period of
    more than five years. Testing the facts of the present case
    in the light of the law 
laid down by
 the Supreme Court in
    
Krishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair v. Padmanabha Pillai

    (supra), the amendment application which has been filed
    after a period of more than five years from the date of the
    plaintiffs' knowledge of the denial of their entitlement to
    partition, is clearly barred by limitation.
 
In 
Revejeetu
    Builders & Developers v. Narayanaswamy & Sons
, (2009)
    10 SCC 84, the Supreme Court has inter alia held that as a
    general rule, the court should decline amendments if a
    fresh suit on the amended claims would be barred by the
    limitation on the date of application."

13.     
In the case of 
Illoth Valappil Ambunhi
 (supra), the Apex

Court has observed in paragraphs no.14, 21 to 27 as under:-




          "14. It is now well settled that perversity in arriving at a
          factual finding gives rise to a substantial question of law,
          attracting intervention of the High Court under 
Section 100

          CPC.



 
"21. The High 
Court further held
: (Chuzhali raman
          
Karnavan v. Illoth Valappil Ambunhi
, 2009 SCC Online Ker
          6802 para 8)


          8.     In the decisions relied on by the learned counsel for
          the respondent it has been held that there cannot be a
          presumption regarding acceptance of the gift, be it not
          onerous and that there must be some evidence to show
          that the gift was accepted during the life time of the donor
          but, what is stated in those decision is concerning the
          presumption as to the acceptance of the gift. But when the
          document itself recited that the possession of the property
          was given to the donee, then, a presumption of acceptance
          of gift would arise in favour of the donee.



          22.    The proposition of law that when the document of
          transfer    by   gift   records   delivery   of   possession,       a
          presumption of acceptance would arise, in the absence of
          overt repudiation of the gift, by and/or on behalf of the
          donee, is unexceptionable. As held by the High Court,
          when the deed itself said that the possession of the
          property was given to the donee, the burden of proving,




                                      Page 41 of 85

 C/SA/365/2019                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    that the said recital was not correct, lay on the party who
    asserted so. In our view, the law has correctly been
    appreciated and enunciated by the High Court.



    23.    The High Court took note of the recital to the effect
    that Karnavan (Malingan Chuzhali Ashari) acting on behalf
    of the Bhandaram was to enjoy the property from the date
    of the gift, which was strong evidence of transfer of
    possession.



    24.    The High Court rightly found that there was no
    direction in the gift deed which made the gift onerous as
    understood in 
Section 127
 of the Transfer of Property Act.
    In all fairness to the appellants, this has not even been
    argued before the High court. The gift not being onerous,
    there was no reason why Malingan Chuzhali Ashari should
    not have accepted the gift on behalf of the Bhandaram.



 
25.    The High Court held: (Chuzhali raman 
Karnavan v.
    Illoth Valappil Ambunhi
, 2009 SCC Online Ker 6802 para 6)


    6.......It is indisputable that an idol is to be treated as a
    minor for all legal purposes. Hence, the acceptance of the
    gift as per Ext. A1 could be by any person on behalf of the
    donee. It is not disputed that Malingan Chuzhali Ashari was
    the Karnavan of the Tharawad during the time of Ext.A1
    and that along with Malingan Chuzhali Ashari, the donor
    (Raman Aithan Ashari) was also a trustee of the
    Bhandaram.



    26.    As noted by the High Court, there is no dispute that

          Malingan Chuzhali Ashari and the donor Raman were
          trustees of the Bhandaram (donee) at the time of
          execution of deed of gift. The fact that nothing was done
          by Raman or any other trustee of the Bhandaram to
          repudiate the gift in itself shows that the deed of gift was
          duly accepted by the Bhandaran.



          27.    The High Court rightly held that the Courts below had
          proceeded on the wrong assumption that even in spite of
          the recitals in Exh. A1, being the deed of gift and the
          admitted facts of the case, the burden of proof was on the
          respondents to show that the gift had been accepted. The
          findings of the Trial Courts and the First Appellate Court
          were based on a wrong assumption of law regarding the
          possession of an idol in the eye of law and the relevant
          recitals in Exh. A1 (deed of gift)."



14.     
In the case of 
Uma Pandey
 (supra), the Apex Court has

observed in paragraph no.12 to 18 as under:-




          "12. In our considered opinion, the High Court erred in
          dismissing the second appeal in limine on the ground that
          it did not involve any substantial question(s) of law.



          13.    In our view, the appeal did involve substantial
          question(s) of law within the meaning of 
Section 100
 of the
          Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as
          'the Code') and, therefore, it should have been admitted
          for final hearing on the substantial question(s) of law
          arising in the case.

 C/SA/365/2019                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022





    14.    It is not in dispute that the defendants (respondents)
    filed one document(EX-A)-(Annexure-P-1 of SLP). This
    document was relied on and appreciated by the two Courts
    below for deciding the rights of the parties. The Trial Court
    decreed the suit and the First Appellate Court reversed it
    on appreciating the evidence including EX-A.



    15.    It is a settled principle of law that interpretation of
    any document including its contents or its admissibility in
    evidence or its effect on the rights of the parties to the Lis
    constitutes a substantial question(s) of law within the
    meaning of Section 100 of the Code.



    16.    Whenever such question arises in the second appeal
    at the instance of the appellant, it deserves admission on
    framing     appropriate   substantial question(s)     on      such
    questions to enable the High Court to decide the appeal on
    merits bi-party.



    17.    In this case, it was all the more reason for the High
    Court to have admitted the appellants' second appeal
    because the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court had
    taken into consideration the document - Ex-A for deciding
    the Lis involved in the case.



    18.    In the light of the foregoing discussion, we cannot
    concur with the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by
    the High Court as, in our view, it wrongly dismissed
    appellants' second appeal in limine."

15.     
In the case of 
Abdul Raheem
 (supra), the Apex Court has

observed in paragraphs no.10 to 12 as under:-




          "10. A substantial question of law ordinarily would not
          arise from the finding of facts arrived at by the trial court
          and the first appellate court. The High Court's jurisdiction
          in terms of Section 100 of the Code is undoubtedly limited.



          11.    The question as to whether the plaintiff was ready
          and willing to perform its part of contract by itself may not
          give rise to a substantial question of law. Substantial
          question of law should admittedly be formulated relying on
          or on the basis of findings of fact arrived at by the trial
          court and the first appellate court.



          12.    However, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that
          consideration of irrelevant fact and non-consideration of
          relevant fact would give rise to a substantial question of
          law. Reversal of a finding of fact arrived at by the first
          appellate court ignoring vital documents may also lead to a
          substantial question of law. In vidhyadhar v. Manikrao,
          (1999) 3 SCC 573 this court held: 9SCC p.586, para 23)


          "23. The findings of fact concurrently recorded by the trial
          court as also by the lower appellate court could not have
          been legally upset by the High court in a second appeal
          under 
Section 100
 CPC unless it was shown that the
          findings were perverse being based on no evidence or that
          on the evidence on record, no reasonable person could

16.     
In the case of 
Patel Ramanbhai Mathurbhai
 (supra), the

Apex Court has observed in paragraphs no.27 to 37 as under:-




          "27. 
Section 100
 CPC provides for a second appeal only on
          the substantial question of law. Generally, a Second Appeal
          does not lie on question of facts or of law.

In 
State Bank of India & Ors. v. S. N. Goyal
, 2008 Air
          (SC) 2594, the Supreme Court explained the terms
          "substantial question of law" and observed as under:




          "The word 'substantial' prefixed to 'question of law' does
          not refer to the stakes involved in the case, nor intended to
          refer only to questions of law of general importance, but
          refers to impact or effect of the question of law on the
          decision in the lis between the parties. 'Substantial
          questions of law' means not only substantial questions of
          law of general importance, but also substantial question of
          law arising in a case as between the parties. ....... any
          question of law which affects the final decision in a case is
          a substantial question of law as between the parties. A
          question of law which arises incidentally or collaterally,
          having no bearing on the final outcome, will not be a
          substantial question of law. There cannot, therefore, be a
          straitjacket definition as to when a substantial question of
          law arises in a case"

 C/SA/365/2019                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    this Court for the purpose of determining the issue held:




    "The proper test for determining whether a question of law
    raises in the case is substantial, would, in our opinion, be
    whether it is of general public importance or whether it
    directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties.."



    29.    
In 
Vijay Kumar Talwar v. Commissioner of Income
    Tax, New Delhi
, 2011 1 SCC 673, this Court held that, a
    point of law which admits of no two opinions may be a
    proposition of law but cannot be a substantial question of
    law. To be 'substantial' a question of law must be
    debatable, not previously settled by law of the land or a
    binding precedent, and must have a material on the
    decision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as the
    rights of the parties before it are concerned. To be a
    question of law 'involving in the case' there must be first a
    foundation for it laid in the pleadings and the question
    should emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived
    at by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that
    question of law for a just and proper decision of the case. It
    will, therefore, depend on the facts and circumstances of
    each case, whether a question of law is a substantial one
    or not; the paramount overall consideration being the need
    for striking a judicious balance between the indispensable
    obligation to do justice at all state and impelling necessity
    of avoiding prolongation in the life of any lis." (See also:


 
Rajeshwari v. Puran Indoria
, 2005 7 SCC 60).




    30.    The Court, for the reasons to be recorded, may also
    entertain a second appeal even on any other substantial

    question of law, not formulated by it, if the Court is
    satisfied that the case involves such a question. Therefore,
    the existence of a substantial question of law is a sine qua
    non for the exercise of jurisdiction under the provisions of
    
Section 100
 CPC. The second appeal does not lie on the
    ground      of   erroneous    findings       of   facts    based       on
    appreciation of the relevant evidence.



    There may be a question, which may be a "question of
    fact", "question of law", "mixed question of fact and law".
    Question means anything inquired; an issue to be decided.
    The "question of fact" is whether a particular factual
    situation exists or not. A question of fact, in the Realm of
    Jurisprudence, has been explained as under:"



 
"A question of fact is one capable of being answered by
    way of demonstration. A question of opinion is one that
    cannot be so answered. As answer to it is a matter of
    speculation which cannot be proved by any available
    evidence to be right or wrong." (Vide: Salmond, on

In 
Smt. Bibhabati Devi v. Ramendra Narayan Roy &
    Ors.
 [AIR 1947 PC 19], the Privy Council has provided the
    guidelines as in what cases the second appeal can be
    entertained, explaining the provisions existing prior to the
    amendment of 1976, observing as under:




    ".....that miscarriage of justice means such a departure

    from the rules which permeate all judicial procedure as to
    make that which happen not in the proper sense of the
    word 'judicial procedure' at all. That the violation of some
    principles of law or procedure must be such erroneous
    proposition of law that if that proposition to be corrected,
    the finding cannot stand, or it may be the neglect of some
    principle of law or procedure, whose application will have
    the same effect. The question whether there is evidence
    on which the Courts could arrive at their finding, is such a
    question of law.



    'That the question of admissibility of evidence is a
    proposition of law but it must be such as to affect
    materially the finding. The question of the value of
    evidence is not sufficient reason for departure from the
    practice......"



    32.    
In 
Suwalal Chhogalal v. Commissioner of Income Tax

    [(1949) 17 ITR 269], the Supreme Court held as under:




    " A fact is a fact irrespective of evidence, by which it is
    proved. The only time a question of law can arise in such a
    case is when it is alleged that there is no material on which
    the conclusion can be based or no sufficient evidence."



    33.    
In 
Oriental Investment Company Ltd. v. Commissioner
    of Income Tax, Bombay
 [AIR 1957 SC 852], the Supreme
    Court considered a large number of its earlier judgments,
    including    
Sree   Meenakshi      Mills   Ltd.,   Madurai       v.
    Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras
 [AIR 1957 SC 49],
    and held that where the question of decision is whether

    certain profit is made and shown in the name of certain
    intermediaries, were, in fact, profit actually earned by the
    assessee or the intermediaries, is a mixed question of fact
    and law. The 
Court further held
 that inference from facts
    would be a question of fact or of law according as the point
    for determination is one of pure fact or a "mixed question
    of law and fact" and that a finding of fact without evidence
    to support it or if based on relevant or irrelevant matters,
    is not unassailable.




 
34.    There is no prohibition to entertain a second appeal
    even on question of fact provided the Court is satisfied that
    the findings of the courts below were vitiated by non-
    consideration    of    relevant   evidence   or   by    showing
    erroneous approach to the matter and findings recorded in
    the court below are perverse. (Vide: Jagdish Singh v. Nathu

In 
Jai Singh v. Shakuntala
 [AIR 2002 SC 1428], the
    Supreme Court held that it is permissible to interfere even
    on question of fact but it may be only in "very exceptional
    cases and on extreme perversity that the authority to
    examine the same in extenso stands permissible it is a
    rarity rather than a regularity and thus in fine it can thus

    be safely concluded that while there is no prohibition as
    such, but the power to scrutiny can only be had in very
    exceptional      circumstances        and    upon        proper
    circumspection."
 
Similar view has been taken in the case
    of 
Kashmir Singh v. Harnam Singh & Anr.
, AIR 2008 SC
    1749.




 
36.    Declaration of relief is always discretionary. If the
    discretion is not exercised by the lower court "in the spirit
    of the statute or fairly or honestly or according to the rules
    of reason and justice", the order passed by the lower court
    can be reversed by the superior court. (See: 
Mysore State
    Road Transport Corporation v. Mirja Khasim Ali Beg & Anr.
,
    AIR 1977 SC 747).




    37.    There may be exceptional circumstances where the
    High Court is compelled to interfere, notwithstanding the
    limitation imposed by the wording of 
Section 100
 CPC. It
    may be necessary to do so for the reason that after all the
    purpose of the establishment of courts of justice is to
    render justice between the parties, though the High Court
    is bound to act with circumspection while exercising such
    jurisdiction. In second appeal the court frames the
    substantial question of law at the time of admission of the
    appeal and the Court is required to answer all the said
    questions unless the appeal is finally decided on one or
    two of those questions or the court comes to the
    conclusion that the question(s) framed could not be the
    substantial question(s) of law. There is no prohibition in law
    to frame the additional substantial question of law if the
    need so arises at the time of the final hearing of the

          appeal.



17.     
In the case of 
Gurnam Singh
 (supra), the Apex Court has

observed in paragraphs no.14 an 15 as under:-




          "14. When a substantial question of law can be said to
          have arisen, has been dealt with and considered by this
          Court in the case of Ishwar Dass Jain (Supra). In the
          aforesaid decision, this Court has specifically observed and
          held :



          Under 
Section 100
 CPC, after the 1976 amendment,
          it is essential for the High Court to formulate a substantial
          question of law and it is not permissible to reverse the
          judgment of the first appellate court without doing so.
          There are two situations in which interference with findings
          of fact is permissible. The first one is when material or
          relevant evidence is not considered which, if considered,
          would have led to an opposite conclusion. The second
          situation in which interference with findings of fact is
          permissible is where a finding has been arrived at by the
          appellate court by placing reliance on inadmissible
          evidence which if it was omitted, an opposite conclusion
          was possible. In either of the above situations, a
          substantial question of law can arise.



          15.    Applying the law laid down by this Court in the
          aforesaid decisions to the facts of the case on hand, we are
          of the opinion that the High Court has erred in re
          appreciating the evidence on record in the second appeal

          under 
Section 100
 of the CPC. The High Court has
          materially erred in interfering with the findings recorded by
          the First Appellate Court, which were on re-appreciation of
          evidence, which was permissible by the First Appellate
          Court in exercise of powers under 
Section 96
 of the CPC.

          Cogent reasons, on appreciation of the evidence, were
          given by the First Appellate Court. First Appellate Court
          dealt with, in detail, the so called suspicious circumstance
          which weighed with the learned Trial Court and thereafter
          it came to the conclusion that the Will, which as such was a
          registered Will, was genuine and do not suffer from any
          suspicious circumstances. The findings recorded by the
          First   Appellate   Court    are     reproduced   hereinabove.
          Therefore, while passing the impugned judgment and
          order, the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction while
          deciding the second appeal under 
Section 100
 CPC."



18.     
In the case of 
Syeda Rahimunnisa
 (supra), the Apex

Court has observed in paragraphs no.25 to 28 as under:-




 
"25. A three-judge Bench of this Court in the case of
          
Santosh Hazari v. Purushottam Tiwari
 speaking through
          R.C. Lahoti, J. (as his Lordship then was) examined the

          involved in the appeal and if it does so it acts illegally and

    in abnegation or abdication of the duty cast on Court. The
    existence of substantial question of law is the sine qua non
    for the exercise of the jurisdiction under the amended
    Section 100 of the Code. (See Kshitish Chandra Purkait v.

 
Santosh Kumar Purkait (1997) 5 SCC 438, Panchugopal
    Barua v. Umesh Chandra Goswami
 (
1997) 4 SCC 413
    and Kondiba    Dagadu      Kadam          v.   Savitribai    Sopan
    Gujar
 (1999) 3 SCC 722)


    10. At the very outset we may point out that the memo of
    second appeal filed by the plaintiff-appellant before the
    High Court suffered from a serious infirmity. Section 100 of
    the Code, as amended in 1976, restricts the jurisdiction of
    the High Court to hear a second appeal only on
    "substantial question of law involved in the case". An
    obligation is cast on the appellant to precisely state in the
    memorandum of appeal the substantial question of law
    involved in the appeal and which the appellant proposes to
    urge before the High Court. The High Court must be
    satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in
    the case and such question has then to be formulated by
    the High Court. Such questions or question may be the one
    proposed by the appellant or may be any other question
    which though not proposed by the appellant yet in the
    opinion of the High Court arises as involved in the case and
    is substantial in nature. At the hearing of the appeal, the
    scope of hearing is circumscribed by the question so
    formulated by the High Court. The respondent is at liberty
    to show that the question formulated by the High Court
    was not involved in the case In spite of a substantial
    question of law determining the scope of hearing of second

    appeal having been formulated by the High Court, its
    power to hear the appeal on any other substantial question
    of law, not earlier formulated by it, is not taken away
    subject to the twin conditions being satisfied: (i) the High
    Court feels satisfied that the case involves such question,
    and (ii) the High Court records reasons for its such
    satisfaction.



    12. The phrase "substantial question of law", as occurring
    in the amended Section 100 is not defined in the Code. The
    word substantial, as qualifying "question of law", means --
    of having substance, essential, real, of sound worth,
    important or considerable. It is to be understood as
    something in contradistinction with -- technical, of no
    substance or consequence, or academic merely. However,
    it is clear that the legislature has chosen not to qualify the
    scope of "substantial question of law" by suffixing the
    words "of general importance" as has been done in many
    other provisions such as Section 109 of the Code or 
Article
    133(1)(a)
 of the Constitution. The substantial question of
    law on which a second appeal shall be heard need not
    necessarily be a substantial question of law of general
    importance. In Guran Ditta v. T. Ram Ditta (AIR 1928 PC

    172), the phrase "substantial question of law" as it was
    employed in the last clause of the then existing 
Section
    110
 CPC (since omitted by the 
Amendment Act, 1973
)
    came up for consideration and their Lordships held that it
    did not mean a substantial question of general importance
    but a substantial question of law which was involved in the
    case as between the parties. 
In Sir Chunilal V. Mehta &
    Sons Ltd. v. Century Spg. and Mfg. Co. Ltd.(AIR 1962 SC

    1314) the Constitution Bench expressed agreement with
    the following view taken by a Full Bench of the Madras
    High        Court   in 
Rimmalapudi     Subba   Rao    v.    Noony
    Veeraju
 (AIR 1951 Mad 969): (
Chunilal V. Mehta
 case, AIR
    p. 1318 para 5)


    5....when a question of law is fairly arguable, where there
    is room for difference of opinion on it or where the Court
    thought it necessary to deal with that question at some
    length and discuss alternative views, then the question
    would be a substantial question of law. On the other hand
    if the question was practically covered by the decision of
    the highest court or if the general principles to be applied
    in determining the question are well settled and the only
    question was of applying those principles to the particular
    facts of the case it would not be a substantial question of
    law."



    And laid down the following test as proper test, for
    determining whether a question of law raised in the case is
    substantial: (AIR p. 1318, para 6)



    6....The proper test for determining whether a question of
    law raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion,
    be whether it is of general public importance or whether it
    directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties
    and if so whether it is either an open question in the sense
    that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy
    Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty
    or calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is
    settled by the highest court or the general principles to be

    applied in determining the question are well settled and
    there is a mere question of applying those principles or
    that the plea raised is palpably absurd the question would
    not be a substantial question of law."



    14. A point of law which admits of no two opinions may be
    a proposition of law but cannot be a substantial question of
    law. To be "substantial" a question of law must be
    debatable, not previously settled by law of the land or a
    binding precedent, and must have a material bearing on
    the decision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as
    the rights of the parties before it are concerned. To be a
    question of law "involving in the case" there must be first a
    foundation for it laid in the pleadings and the question
    should emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived
    at by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that
    question of law for a just and proper decision of the case.
    An entirely new point raised for the first time before the
    High Court is not a question involved in the case unless it
    goes to the root of the matter. It will, therefore, depend on
    the facts and circumstance of each case whether a
    question of law is a substantial one and involved in the
    case, or not; the paramount overall consideration being the
    need for striking a judicious balance between the
    indispensable obligation to do justice at all stages and
    impelling necessity of avoiding prolongation in the life of
    any lis".

    24, 25 and 26 observed as under:




    "17. Sub-section (5) of 
Section 100
 CPC says that the
    appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and
    the respondent shall at the hearing of the appeal be
    allowed to argue that the case does not involve such a
    question. The proviso states that nothing in this sub-
    section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power
    of the Court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the appeal
    on any other substantial question of law not formulated by
    it if it is satisfied that the case involves such question. In
    the instant case, the High Court at the time of final hearing
    formulated five more questions of law as extracted above
    after hearing the counsel for both sides having miserably
    failed to record the reasons for formulating the other
    substantial questions of law.



    24. In our opinion, the High Court has erred in holding that
    the appellants have failed to establish their title to the suit
    property evidently without appreciating the evidence on
    record in its proper perspective by making only reference
    to   portions   of   evidence    having   once    decided      to
    reappreciate the evidence. The High Court, in our opinion,
    ought to have examined the entire evidence both oral and
    documentary instead of only a portion thereof especially
    while deciding to look into and reappreciate the evidence
    despite the limited scope under 
Section 100
 CPC. In our
    view, the learned Single Judge of the High Court has
    exceeded his jurisdiction in reassessing, reappreciating
    and making a roving enquiry by entering into the factual
    arena of the case which is not the one contemplated under




                              Page 58 of 85

    the limited scope of jurisdiction of a second appeal under
    
Section 100
 CPC.



    25. In the present case, the lower appellate court fairly
    appreciated the evidence and arrived at a conclusion that
    the appellants' suit was to be decreed and that the
    appellants are entitled to the relief as prayed for. Even
    assuming that another view is possible on a reappreciation
    of the same evidence, that should not have been done by
    the High Court as it cannot be said that the view taken by
    the first appellate court was based on no material.



    26. To say the least the approach of the High Court was
    not proper. It is the obligation of the courts of law to
    further the clear intendment of the legislature and not
    frustrate it by excluding the same. This Court in a catena of
    decisions held that where findings of fact by the lower
    appellate court are based on evidence, the High Court in
    second appeal cannot substitute its own findings on
    reappreciation of evidence merely on the ground that
    another view was possible".               (emphasis in original)



    27.    Reverting to the facts of the case at hand and
    keeping in view the aforesaid principles of law in mind, we
    find that the High Court while admitting the second appeal
    had formulated the following questions:



    1.     Whether the finding of the Court below, that the suit

    evidence, which establish that there was a sub-division of
    S.No.35/5, the suit site is S.No.35/5, CI Ex.A.I being a

    presumption under 
Section 90
 of Evidence Act applies,
    both with regard to execution and attestation, and as such
    the opinion of the trial Court that it is suspicious document,
    is untenable and unsustainable in law?



    3.     Whether the lower appellate Court erred in law in not
    framing proper points for consideration, on the validity of
    Ex.A.2 gift deed and the sub- division of suit property
    S.No.35/5 C1A1, as required under Order 41 Rule 31 C.P.C.

    and as such the Judgment of the lower appellate Court as a
    final Court of fact is vitiated by errors of law?



    4.     Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in law,
    in holding that Ex.A2 gift deed is invalid, because the
    property gifted is poramboke, when the Government itself
    (second defendant) has not disputed either the long
    possession or possessory title of the plaintiff of the suit
    property?



    5.     Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in law

    based on mere guess work ignoring the relevant and
    clinching documentary evidence?



    6.     Whether the finding of the lower appellate Court that
    P.W.6 (plaintiff's son) did not vacate the site even after the
    lease period of the site S.No.35/5 C1A19 of D.I is not based
    on any evidence except the word of D.W.2 (no witnesses
    wee examined) and the conclusion reached by it that the
    suit site in O.S.No.53/93 and the leased site are the same,
    is contrary to the evidence on record?



    7.     Whether the lower appellate Court has erred in law in
    its failure to consider the admission of D.W.2 himself that
    his father encroached into the plaintiff's site and was
    issued B-Memos and paid the penalty, which conclusively
    establishes that the two sites are different and not one and
    the same?



 
8.     Whether the very approach of the lower appellate
    Court is essentially erroneous and its findings are liable to
    be set aside (
Jagdish Singh v. Natthu Singh

    28.    In our considered     opinion, the aforementioned
    questions cannot be regarded as satisfying the test of
    being a "substantial questions of law" within the meaning
    of 
Section 100
 of CPC. These questions, in our view, are
    essentially questions of fact. In any event, the second
    appeal did not involve any substantial questions of law as
    contemplated under 
Section 100
 of CPC and lastly no case
    was made out by the respondents before the High Court

          for remanding of the case to the trial court for de novo trial
          in all the civil suits. This we say for following reasons.



19.     
In the case of 
Panchugopal Barua
 (supra), the Apex

Court has observed in paragraphs no.7 and 8 as under:-




          "7.    A    bare   look   at      Section      100. 
Code    of    Civil
          Procedure
 shows that the jurisdiction of the High Court to
          entertain a second appeal after the 1976 amendment is
          confined only to such appeals as involve a substantial
          question of law, specifically set out in the memorandum of
          appeal and formulated by the High Court. Of course, the
          proviso to the Section shows that nothing shall be deemed
          to take away or abridge the power of the Court to hear, for
          reasons to be recorded, the appeal on any other
          substantial question of law, not formulated by it, if the
          Court is satisfied that the case involves such a question.
          The proviso presupposes that the Court shall indicate in its
          order the substantial question of law which it proposes to
          decide even if such substantial question of law was not
          earlier formulated by it. The existence of a "substantial
          question of law" is thus, the sine qua non for the exercise
          of the jurisdiction under the amended provisions of Section
          100, C. P. C.



          8.     Generally speaking, an appellant is not to be allowed
          to set up a new case in second appeal or raise a new issue
          (otherwise than a jurisdictional one ), not supported by the
          pleadings or evidence on the record and unless the appeal




                                         Page 62 of 85


                                                                  Downloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022

 C/SA/365/2019                                    JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    inovles a substantial question of law, a second appeal shall
    not lie to the High Court under the amended provisions. In
    the present case, no such question of law was formulated
    in the memorandum of appeal in the High Court and
    grounds (6) and (7) in the memorandum of the second
    appeal on which reliance is placed did not formulate any
    substantial question of law. The learned single Judge of the
    High Court also, as it transpires from a perusal of the
    Judgement under appeal, did not formulate any substantial
    question of law in the appeal and dealt with the second
    appeal, not on any substantial question of law, but treating
    it as if it was a first appeal, as of right, against the
    Judgement and decree of the subordinate Court. The
    intendment    of the   legislature       in amending      
Section
    100
, Code of Civil Procedure was, thus, respected in its
    breach. Both the trial Court and the lower Appellate Court
    had decided the case only on questions of fact, on the
    basis of the pleadings and the evidence led by the parties
    before the trial Court. No pure question of law nor even a
    mixed question of law and fact was urged before the trial
    Court or the First Appellate Court by the respondent. The
    High Court was, therefore, not justified in entertaining the
    second appeal on an altogether new point, neither pleaded
    nor canvassed in the subordinate Courts and that too by
    overlooking   the   changes   brought       about   in    
Section
    100
, Code of Civil Procedure by the Amendment Act of
    1976 without even indicating that a substantial question of
    law was required to be resolved in the second appeal. To
    say the least, the approach of the High Court was not
    proper. It is the obligation of the Courts of law to further
    the clear intendment of the legislature and not to frustrate

          it by ignoring the same.



20.     
In the case of 
Kondiba Dagadu Kadam
 (supra), the Apex

Court has observed in paragraphs no.3 to 7 as under:-




          "3.    After the amendment a second appeal can be filed
          only if a substantial question of law is involved in the case.
          The memorandum of appeal must precisely state the
          substantial question of law involved and the High Court is
          obliged to satisfy itself regarding the existence of such
          question. If satisfied, the High Court has to formulate the
          substantial question of law involved in the case. The
          appeal is required to be heard on the question so
          formulated. However, the respondent at the time of the
          hearing of the appeal has a right to argue that the case in
          the court did not involve any substantial question of law.
          The proviso to the Section acknowledges the powers of the
          High Court to hear the appeal on a substantial point of law,
          though not formulated by it with the object of ensuring
          that no injustice is done to the litigant where such question
          was not formulated at the time of admission either by
          mistake or by inadvertence.



          4.     It has been noticed time and again that without
          insisting for the statement of such substantial question of
          law in the memorandum of appeal and formulating the
          same at the time of admission, the High Courts have been
          issuing notices and generally deciding the second appeals
          without adhering to the procedure prescribed
 u/s. 100
,
          Code of Civil Procedure. It has further been found in a

    number of cases that no efforts are made to distinguish
    between a question of law and a substantial question of
    law. In exercise of the powers under this Section the
    findings of fact of the 1st appellate Court are found to have
    been disturbed. It has to be kept in mind that the right of
    appeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right attached
    to the litigation. Being a substantive statutory right, it has
    to be regulated in accordance with law in force at the
    relevant time. The conditions mentioned in the Section
    must be strictly fulfilled before a second appeal can be
    maintained and no court has the power to add to or
    enlarge those grounds. The second appeal cannot be
    decided on merely equitable grounds. The concurrent
    findings of facts howsoever erroneous cannot be disturbed
    by the High Court in exercise of the powers under this
    Section. The substantial question of law has to be
    distinguished from a substantial question of fact. This
    Court in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd. V/s. Century
    Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1314
    held that :-



    "The proper test for determining whether a question of law
    raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion, be
    whether it is of general public importance or whether it
    directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties
    and if so whether it is either an open question in the sense
    that it is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy
    Council or by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty
    or calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is
    settled by the highest Court or the general principles to be
    applied in determining the question are well settled and

    there is a mere question of applying those principles or
    that the plea raised is palpably absurd the question would
    not be a substantial question of law."



    5.     It is not within the domain of the High Court to
    investigate the grounds on which the findings were arrived
    at, by the last court of fact, being the first appellate Court.
    It is true that the lower appellate Court should not
    ordinarily reject witnesses accepted by the trial Court in
    respect of credibility but even where it has rejected the
    witnesses accepted by the trial court, the same is no
    ground for interference in second appeal when it is found
    that the appellate Court has given satisfactory reasons for
    doing so. In a case where from a given set of
    circumstances two inferences are possible, one drawn by
    the lower appellate Court is binding on the High Court in
    second appeal. Adopting any other approach is not
    permissible. The High Court cannot substitute its opinion
    for the opinion of the first appellate Court unless it is found
    that the conclusions drawn by the lower appellate Court
    were        erroneous   being      contrary     to    the    mandatory
    provisions of law applicable or its settled position on the
    basis of pronouncements made by the apex Court, or was
    based upon inadmissible evidence or arrived at without
    evidence.



    6.     If the question of law termed as substantial question
    stands already decided by a larger bench of the High Court
    concerned or by the Privy Council or by the Federal Court
    or by the Supreme Court, its merely wrong application on
    facts of the case would not be termed to be a substantial

          question of law. Where a point of law has not been pleaded
          or is found to be arising between the parties in the
          absence of any factual format, a litigant should not be
          allowed to raise that question as substantial question of
          law in second appeal. The mere appreciation of the facts,
          the documentary evidence or the meaning of entries and
          the contents of the document cannot be held to be raising
          a substantial question of law. But where it is found that the
          first appellate Court has assumed jurisdiction which did not
          vest in it, the same can be adjudicated in the second
          appeal, treating it as substantial question of law. Where
          the first appellate Court is shown to have exercised its
          discretion in a judicial manner, it cannot be termed to be
          an error either of law or of procedure requiring interference
          in second appeal. This Court in Reserve Bank of
          India V/s. Ramakrishna Govind Morey, AIR 1976 SC 830 :

          (1976 Lab IC 575) held that whether trial Court should not
          have exercised its jurisdiction differently is not a question
          of law justifying interference."



21.     
In the case of 
Roshan Singh
 (supra), the Apex Court has

observed in paragraph no.12 as under:-




          "12. Partition, unlike the sale or transfer which consists in
          its essence of a single act, is a continuing state of facts. It
          does not require any formality and therefore if parties
          actually divide their estate and agree to hold in severally,
          there is an end of the matter."

23.     I have considered the submissions canvassed by the

learned counsel appearing for the respective parties and after

thoughtful consideration, first of all, the present second appeal is

filed under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code. The

requirement of Section 100 is that the memorandum of appeal

shall precisely state the substantial question or questions of law

involved in the appeal as required under sub-section (3) of

Section 100. Where the High Court is satisfied that in any case

any substantial question of law is involved it shall formulate that

question under sub-section (4) and the second appeal has to be

heard on the question so formulated as stated in sub-section (5)

of Section 100. Meaning thereby unless there is substantial

question involved in the present appeal or it is framed by the

Court, the appeal cannot be entertained or heard by the High

Court.



24.     Considering the proviso of Section 100 is to the effect that

nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or

abridge the power of the Court to hear, for reasons to be

recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of law,

not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such

question. It is abundantly clear that when a question of law is

fairly arguable, where there is room for difference of opinion on it

or where the Court thought it necessary to deal with that

question at some length and discuss alternative views, then the

question would be a substantial question of law. On the other

hand if the question was practically covered by the decision of

the highest court or if the general principles to be applied in

determining the question are well settled and the only question

was of applying those principles to the particular facts of the

case it would not be a substantial question of law. In the present

appeal, learned counsel has suggested the following questions of

law:

          1.    Whether the Lambha Khat in question is admissible in
                evidence without the same being registered as
                required under law?

          2.    Whether the Courts below have materially erred in
                construing    the   documents         on     record,      more
                particularly the Lambha Khat in question?

          3.    Whether the reliefs as granted by the Courts below
                could have been granted in view of the frame of the
                suit and the documents on record?

          4.    Whether the decree as passed by the Courts below
                without firstly adjudicating the exact shares of parties
                and exactly demarcating the properties in question, is
                in violation of the provisions of law?

          5.    Whether the alleged sale deed, Exh.84 is valid under
                law and binding to the Appellants?

          6.    Whether the suit of the Plaintiff is barred by law of
                limitation?

          7.    Whether the Courts below have materially erred in
                recording various findings on the basis of the
                proceedings before the Revenue authorities, without
                independently appreciating the evidences tendered
                on record?

          8.    Whether the Appellant can be considered to have
                perfected their title by adverse possession against
                the Respondents?

Court, while referring to its earlier decision in the case of 
Kale

Vs. Director of Consolidation
 reported in (1976) 3 SCC 119,

has observed in paragraphs no.33, 34, 35, 36, 44, 46 and 48 as

under:-




 
"33. 
Kale and Ors. v. Deputy Director of Consolidation
, is
        a case which had a checkered history in which a discussion
        on the effect and value of family arrangements entered
        into between the parties with a view to resolve disputes
        once and for all, came up for consideration. It was
        observed that in the case of a family settlement, usually
        there would be an agreement which is implied from a long
        course of dealing, but such an agreement would be
        embodied or effectuated in a deed to which the
        term family arrangement      is applied. Such      a family
        arrangement is not applicable to dealings between
        strangers but is in the context of maintaining the interest
        and peace of the members of the family.




        34.    
In paragraph 10 of 
the said judgment
, this Court has
        adumbrated on the essentials of a family settlement which
        could be usefully extracted as under: (
Kale
 case, SCC pp.
        126-27)


        "10. In other words to put the binding effect and the
        essentials of a family settlement in a concretized form, the
        matter may be reduced into the form of the following
        propositions:


        (1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to

 C/SA/365/2019                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    resolve family disputes and rival claims by a fair and
    equitable division or allotment of properties between the
    various members of the family;

    (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should
    not be induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence;
    (3) The family arrangements may be even oral in which
    case no registration is necessary;

    (4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary
    only if the terms of the family arrangement are reduced
    into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made
    between a document containing the terms and recitals of a
    family arrangement made under the document and a mere
    memorandum prepared after the family arrangement had
    already been made either for the purpose of the record or
    for information of the Court for making necessary
    mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not
    create or extinguish any rights in immoveable properties
    and therefore does not fall within the mischief of 
Section
    17(2)
 [sic (
Section 17(1)(b)
?] of the 
Registration Act
 and is,
    therefore, not compulsorily registrable;
    (5) The members who may be parties to the family
    arrangement must have some antecedent title, claim or
    interest even a possible claim in the property which is
    acknowledged      by     the     parties   to the settlement.

    Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but
    under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its
    claims or titles in favour of such a person and
    acknowledges him to be the sole owner, then the
    antecedent title must be assumed and the family
    arrangement will be upheld, and the Courts will find no
    difficulty in giving assent to the same;

 C/SA/365/2019                                     JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    (6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which
    may not involve legal claims are settled by a bona fide
    family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family
    arrangement is final and binding on the parties to the
    settlement.                               (emphasis in original)



 
35.    After reviewing several judgments of this Court, the
    Privy Council and other High Courts, this Court in
    paragraph 20 indicated the following propositions: (
Kale

    case, SCC p. 130)


    "20....We would, therefore return the reference with a
    statement of the following general propositions:




    (1)    A family arrangement can be made orally.



    (2)    If made orally, there being no document, no question
    of registration arises.



    (3)    If though it could have been made orally, it was in
    fact reduced to the form of a "document" registration
    (when the value is Rs. 100 and upwards) is necessary.



    (4)    Whether the terms have been "reduced to the form of
    a document" is a question of fact in each case to be
    determined upon a consideration of the nature and
    phraseology of the writing and the circumstances in which
    and the purpose with which it was written.



    (5)    If the terms were not "reduced to the form of a
    document", registration was not necessary (even though




                              Page 73 of 85


                                                        Downloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022

 C/SA/365/2019                                     JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




    the value is Rs. 100 or upwards); and, while the writing
    cannot be used as a piece of evidence for what it may be
    worth, e.g. as corroborative of other evidence or as an
    admission of the transaction or as showing or explaining
    conduct.



    (6)    If the terms were "reduced to the form of a
    document" and, though the value was Rs. 100 or upwards,
    it was not registered, the absence of registration makes
    the document inadmissible in evidence and is fatal to proof
    of the arrangement embodied in the document.



 
36.    Ultimately,   this   Court     held   that   the     family
    arrangement in the nature of a compromise which was
    considered 
in that case
 did not require registration. It was
    further held that since the existence of the family
    arrangement was admitted 
in that case
, the same was
    binding on the principle of estoppel. Also, even if the family
    arrangement could not be registered it could be used for
    collateral purpose, i.e. to show the nature and character of
    possession of the parties in pursuance of the family
    settlement and also for the purpose of applying the rule of
    estoppel which flowed from the conduct of the parties,
    who, having taken benefit under the settlement for seven
    years, later tried to resile from the settlement.




    44.    For a better understanding of the same it would be
    useful to refer to 
section 17 (1) (e)
 and 
17 (2) (v)
 as under:



    17. Documents of which registration is compulsory. (l) The
    following documents shall be registered, if the property to

    they have been executed on or after the date on which,

    (2)    Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (l)
    applies to:


    (v)    any document other than the documents specified in

    such right, title or interest."

          nature of a memorandum of understanding, a mere
          agreement of the steps to be taken in future for the
          division of the properties. Hence, the said document did
          not require registration under 
Section 17 (1) (b)
 of the Act
          as under the said document no creation of rights in any
          specific joint family property was effected. Hence the
          second limb of the contention of the appellant is
          accordingly answered.



          48.    In our view, Ext. B-13 did not require registration.



26.     It is profitable to referred to the decision of the Apex Court

in the case 
Kashmir Singh Vs. Harnam Singh
 reported in

(2008) 12 SCC 786 wherein the Apex Court has observed in

paragraphs no.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 as under:-




          "9.    It has been noted time and again that without insisting for
          the statement of such a substantial question of law in the
          memorandum of appeal and formulating the same at the time of
          admission, the High Courts have been issuing notices and generally
          deciding the second appeals without adhering to the procedure
          prescribed u/s. 100 of the Code. It has further been found in a
          number of cases that no efforts are made to distinguish between a
          question of law and a substantial question of law. In exercise of the
          powers under this section in several cases, the findings of fact of
          the first appellate court are found to have been disturbed. It has to
          be kept in mind that the right of appeal is neither a natural nor an
          inherent right attached to the litigation. Being a substantive
          statutory right, it has to be regulated in accordance with law in
          force at the relevant time. The conditions mentioned in the section





                                       Page 76 of 85


                                                                 Downloaded on : Fri Sep 30 20:01:03 IST 2022

    must be strictly fulfilled before a second appeal can be maintained
    and no court has the power to add or to enlarge those grounds. The
    second appeal cannot be decided on merely equitable grounds. The
    concurrent findings of facts will not be disturbed by the High Court
    in exercise of the powers under this section. Further, a substantial
    question of law has to be distinguished from a substantial question
    of fact. This Court in Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd. V/s.
    Century Spg. & Mfg. Co. Ltd., AIR 1962 SC 1314 held that :



    "The proper test for determining whether a question of law
    raised in the case is substantial would, in our opinion, be
    whether it is of general public importance or whether it
    directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and
    if so whether it is either an open question in the sense that it
    is not finally settled by this Court or by the Privy Council or
    by the Federal Court or is not free from difficulty or calls for
    discussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by
    the highest court or the general principles to be applied in
    determining the question are well settled and there is a
    mere question of applying those principles or that the plea
    raised is palpably absurd the question would not be a
    substantial question of law."



    10.    It is not within the domain of the High Court to
    investigate the grounds on which the findings were arrived
    at, by the last court of fact, being the first appellate court. It
    is true that the lower appellate court should not ordinarily
    reject witnesses accepted by the trial court in respect of
    credibility but even where it has rejected the witnesses
    accepted by the trial court, the same is no ground for
    interference in second appeal when it is found that the
    appellate court has given satisfactory reasons for doing
    so. In a case where from a given set of circumstances two
    inferences of fact are possible, one drawn by the lower
    appellate court will not be interfered by the High Court in
    second      appeal. Adopting    any    other   approach      is   not

    permissible. The High Court will, however, interfere where it
    is found that the conclusions drawn by the lower appellate
    court were erroneous being contrary to the mandatory
    provisions of law applicable or its settled position on the
    basis of pronouncements made by the Apex Court, or was
    based upon inadmissible evidence or arrived at by ignoring
    material evidence.



    11.     The question of law raised will not be considered as a
    substantial question of law, if it stands already decided by a
    larger Bench of the High Court concerned or by the Privy
    Council or by the Federal Court or by the Supreme Court.
    Where the facts required for a point of law have not been
    pleaded, a litigant should not be allowed to raise that
    question as a substantial question of law in second
    appeal. Mere     appreciation   of   facts,   the   documentary
    evidence or the meaning of entries and the contents of the
    documents cannot be held to be raising a substantial
    question of law. But where it is found that the first appellate
    court has assumed jurisdiction which did not vest in it, the
    same can be adjudicated in the second appeal, treating it as
    a substantial question of law. Where the first appellate court
    is shown to have exercised its discretion in a judicial
    manner, it cannot be termed to be an error either of law or
    of procedure requiring interference in second appeal. This
    Court in Reserve Bank of India V/s. Ramkrishna Govind
    Morey, 1976 1 SCC 803 held that whether the trial court
    should not have exercised its jurisdiction differently is not a
    question of law justifying interference.(See: Kondiba Dogadu
    Kadam V/s. Savitribai Sopan Gujar and Others, 1999 3 SCC

    722).



    12.     The phrase "substantial question of law", as occurring
    in the amended Sec. 100 is not defined in the Code. The
    word substantial, as qualifying "question of law", means of
    having substance, essential, real, of sound worth, important

    or considerable. It is to be understood as something in
    contradistinction    with technical,        of   no   substance       or
    consequence, or academic merely. However, it is clear that
    the legislature has chosen not to qualify the scope of
    "substantial question of law" by suffixing the words "of
    general importance" as has been done in many other
    provisions such as 
Art. 133(1)(a)
 of the Constitution. The
    substantial question of law on which a second appeal shall
    be heard need not necessarily be a substantial question of
    law of general importance. In Guran Ditta V/s. T. Ram Ditta,
    AIR 1928 PC 172, the phrase 'substantial question of law' as
    it was employed in the last clause of the then existing Sec.
    100 (since omitted by the 
Amendment Act, 1973
) came up
    for consideration and their Lordships held that it did not
    mean a substantial question of general importance but a
    substantial question of law which was involved in the case.
    
In 
Sri Chunilal
's case (supra), the Constitution Bench
    expressed agreement with the following view taken by a full
    Bench of the Madras High Court in Rimmalapudi Subba Rao
    V/s. Noony Veeraju, AIR 1951 Mad 969:




    "When a question of law is fairly arguable, where there is
    room for difference of opinion on it or where the Court
    thought it necessary to deal with that question at some
    length and discuss alternative views, then the question
    would be a substantial question of law. On the other hand if
    the question was practically covered by the decision of the
    highest court or if the general principles to be applied in
    determining the question are well settled and the only
    question was of applying those principles to the particular
    facts of the case it would not be a substantial question of
    law."



 
13.     This Court laid down the following test as proper test,
    for determining whether a question of law raised in the case
    is substantial as quoted in 
Sir Chunilal
's case (supra).

          15.    To be "substantial" a question of law must be
          debatable, not previously settled by law of the land or a
          binding precedent, and must have a material bearing on the
          decision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as the
          rights of the parties before it are concerned. To be a
          question of law "involving in the case" there must be first a
          foundation for it laid in the pleadings and the question
          should emerge from the sustainable findings of fact arrived
          at by court of facts and it must be necessary to decide that
          question of law for a just and proper decision of the case. An
          entirely new point raised for the first time before the High
          Court is not a question involved in the case unless it goes to
          the root of the matter. It will, therefore, depend on the facts
          and circumstance of each case whether a question of law is
          a substantial one and involved in the case, or not; the
          paramount overall consideration being the need for striking
          a judicious balance between the indispensable obligation to
          do justice at all stages and impelling necessity of avoiding
          prolongation in the life of any lis. (See :Santosh Hazari V/s.
          Purushottam Tiwari (deceased) by Lrs., 2001 3 SCC 179).



27.     Considering the questions suggested by the learned

counsel appearing for the appellants, it does not require any

further hearing or re-determination. The question is practically

covered by the decision of the highest court and/or there is no

further determination of any of the questions suggested by the

learned counsel is required. Considering the test which is

enumerated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in

(supra) for determining whether a question of law raised in a

given case is substantial question. The substantial question of

law must be debatable, not previously settled by law of the land

or a binding precedent, and must have a material bearing on the

decision of the case, if answered either way, insofar as the rights

of the parties before it are concerned. To be a question of law

"involving in the case" there must be first a foundation for it laid

       C/SA/365/2019                                      JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022





28.     The principles relating to Section 100 relevant for this case

may be summarized thus:-



          (i)    An inference of fact from the recitals or contents of a
                 document is a question of fact. But the legal effect of
                 the terms of a document is a question of law.

                 Construction of a document involving the application
                 of any principle of law, is also a question of law.
                 Therefore,   when    there     is misconstruction      of a
                 document or wrong application of a principle of law in
                 construing a document, it gives rise to a question of
                 law.



          (ii)   The High Court should be satisfied that the case
                 involves a substantial question of law, and not a mere
                 question of law. A question of law having a material
                 bearing on the decision of the case (that is, a
                 question, answer to which affects the rights of parties
                 to the suit) will be a substantial question of law, if it is
                 not covered by any specific provisions of law or
                 settled   legal   principle     emerging   from     binding
                 precedents, and, involves a debatable legal issue. A
                 substantial question of law will also arise in a contrary
                 situation, where the legal position is clear, either on
                 account of express provisions of law or binding
                 precedents, but the court below has decided the
                 matter, either ignoring or acting contrary to such legal
                 principle. In the second type of cases, the substantial
                 question of law arises not because the law is still
                 debatable, but because the decision rendered on a

       C/SA/365/2019                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 23/09/2022




                material question, violates the settled position of law.



29.     Therefore, in the general rule, High Court will not interfere

with concurrent findings of the Courts below. But it is not an

absolute rule. Some of the well recognized exceptions are where


(i) the courts below have ignored material evidence or acted on

no evidence; (ii) the courts have drawn wrong inferences from

proved facts by applying the law erroneously; or (iii) the courts

have wrongly cast the burden of proof. When we refer to

'decision based on no evidence', it not only refers to cases where

there is a total dearth of evidence, but also refers to any case,

where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable

of supporting the finding.



30.     In view of the aforesaid settled principles, it appears that

the both the Courts below have not committed any error either

on facts or on law. As per the decision of the Apex Court in the

case of 
Gurnam Singh
 (supra), framing of substantial question

of law is a sine qua non for the exercise of the jurisdiction under

Section 100 of the Code. Considering the issue involved in the

present appeal and the contentions raised on the basis of the

factual aspects of the matter, this Court not thought it fit to enter

into the factual aspects which does not involved any substantial

question of law.
 It is also relevant to note here that the re-



appreciation of the evidence is impermissible by this court while

exercising the jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code.



31.     Considering all the contentions raised in the appeal, this

Court has no hesitation to show that in the present appeal no

substantial question is involved as the question suggested by the

appellants with regard to more or less re-appreciation of the

evidence recorded by the Trial Court which is permissible under

the jurisdiction of Section 100 of the Code.



32.     Considering the facts and circumstances of the case,

submissions canvassed by the learned counsel for the respective

parties and the decisions cited at the Bar, I find no reason to

entertain the present appeal.



33.     For the foregoing reasons, the appeal fails and it is

accordingly dismissed. The Trial Court shall direct to implement

the impugned judgment and decree in its true spirit and hand

over the possession to the original plaintiffs within three months

from the date of receipt of the copy of the order, if it is not

handed over by the defendants by metes and bounds.



34.     In view of the disposal of the main appeal, connected civil

applications shall stand disposed of. Interim relief, if any, granted

earlier shall stand vacated forthwith.

                         FURTHER ORDER


        After pronouncement of the judgment, the learned counsel

appearing for the appellants has requested to stay the

implementation and operation of the judgment. However, it

seems that the stay is operating since 1982 and they are fighting

for the cause and, therefore, the request made by learned

counsel appearing for the appellants is not just and proper.



Hence, the request is not accepted.
