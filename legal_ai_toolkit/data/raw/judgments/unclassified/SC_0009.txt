                                                           ORDER



                A.The Petition:



                          This Criminal Original Petition is filed to quash the final report in

                C.C.No.2671 of 2022 on the file of the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,

                Coimbatore.



                B.Brief Facts:



                          2. The brief facts leading to the filing of this petition are that M/s

                Canara Bank lodged an information in writing before the first respondent,

                based         on   which   a   First     Information           Report    was   registered      in

                RC0322021A0009 dated 17.05.2021, for the alleged offences under Section

                120B read with 420 
IPC
 and 
section 13 (2)
 read with 13 (1) (d) of the

                
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
.





                          2.1. The gist of the information is that M/s Air Carnival Private Limited,

                represented by its Directors S. Irud a y a n a t h a n (A1), the petitioner herein, and

                his wife, Mrs. Lima Rose (A2), applied for a loan by offering to create an

                equitable mortgage of its immovable property measuring 3.75 acres along with

                a building on S.F.Nos. 298/1 and 298/3 in Myleripalayam Village,

                Madukkarai Taluk, Coimbatore District. The Directors also acted as personal

                guarantors. Based on the application dated 04.06.2016, a term loan of Rs. 4.90

                Crores was granted along with a bank guarantee, a sum of Rs. 3.05 Crores on

                01.06.2016; an overdraft facility of Rs. 4.70 Crores on 27.10.2016; and a

                temporary overdraft of Rs. 1.00 Crore on 31.03.2017, totaling Rs. 13.65

                Crores. The loan account was classified as 'Non-Performing Asset' (NPA) on

                29.06.2017 and was reported as a fraudulent account on 27.11.2019. The

                company and its Directors wilfully and dishonestly defrauded the Bank by

                conspiring to divert and siphon the loan amount, causing wrongful loss of Rs.



                13.65 Crores to the Bank and wrongful gain to themselves.



                          2.2. After an investigation, the final report was submitted. The report

                states that the 2 Director, M r s . Li m a Ros e, had no criminal intent or
                                     nd




                knowledge regarding the mentioned transaction, and therefore her name is

                omitted. It also states that there was no criminal intent or knowledge on the

                part of the public servants/bank officials concerning the transactions, and the

                provisions of the offences under the 
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
, were

                dropped. Furthermore, it explains that initially, while the petitioner,

                Irud a y a n a t h a n , operated his business as a proprietorship, he showed higher

                contributions when he transitioned to a partnership, whereas the contributions

                of the other partners were minimal. Later, when the partnership was converted

                into a company registered under the 
Companies Act, 2013
, the property

                offered as security remained in his personal name and was not transferred to

                the company's name.



                          2.3. Further, by availing the loans on the specified dates, the company

                did not adhere to its original plan, and the primary sureties in the form of

                goods that should have been created were not created. On the other hand, the

                loan proceeds were siphoned off to other accounts to create four Fixed

                Deposits, which were subsequently used as margin money for bank

                guarantees. Subsequently, several bank guarantees were obtained in favor of

                M/s Anjali Hotels Private Limited, M/s Airports Authority of India,

                Coimbatore, Air India Air Transport Services Limited, New Delhi, ATR

                Eastern Support Private Limited, Singapore. Additionally, the loan amount

                was diverted to other institutions such as M/s Coimbatore Marine College,

                Mangalore Marine College, and Technology. However, the accused failed to

                repay the principal and interest, leading to the accounts being classified as

                NPA. In the meantime, the company went into liquidation and is now

                represented by the Official Liquidator. The matter is currently pending before

                the National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai. Therefore, finding that the

                offence under 
Section 420
 of IPC is made out, the final report has been filed.



                          2.4. It is stated that, in the meantime, by a communication dated

                12.01.2022, Canara Bank offered to accept a sum of Rupees 12 Crores as full

                and final settlement, on the condition that the amount be paid in installments

                within the specified timeline, with the final installment of Rupees 3 Crores to

                be paid on or before 31.03.2022. In addition, the legal expenses and

                CIRP/liquidation expenses were also to be paid. It is explicitly mentioned in

                the offer that the account will be considered closed only after all direct and

                indirect liabilities in the name of the firm/borrower/guarantors are settled. It is

                further stated that the One Time Settlement will not affect ongoing criminal

                proceedings initiated by the CBI/Police authorities. The One-Time Settlement

                (OTS) will be without prejudice to the rights of the CBI/Police to investigate

                or prosecute and shall not hinder the continuation or resolution of any pending

                criminal proceedings, if any.



                          2.5. The petitioner is said to have completely paid the loan amount of

                Rs.12 Crores on 02.03.2022, and there are no dues whatsoever to the Bank,

                with the civil liability amicably settled. However, due to the clause originally

                                                                                          Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024


                contained in the memorandum of understanding, the Bank is not coming

                forward to join in the filing of application for compounding under 
Section 320


                of Cr.P.C. Therefore, contending that the entire action does not constitute any

                criminal offence and that the settlement of dues amicably should be

                considered, and the proceedings be quashed.



                C.Submissions of the learned counsel:



 
3. Heard, M s . K a d a m b r i Sure s h , the learned counsel appearing on behalf

                of the petitioner. Firstly she would submit that the amount was borrowed after

                furnishing due security. There was never an intention to cheat the bank. It was

                a failed venture and thus the account slipped into NPA. The petitioner had

                made all earnest efforts and has settled the loan amount. Except for the brief

                period of default, there was no dishonest intention for the petitioner. The

                learned counsel would rely upon various Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme

                Court of India, more specifically 
K.Bharthi Devi V. State of Telangana1
 and

                
N.S.Gnaneshwaran Vs. Inspector of Police & Anr.2
 and would submit that

                the proceedings are liable to be quashed.

                          3.1. Per      contr a,   Mr.     K. Sriniv a s a n ,      the learned Special Public

                Prosecutor, would submit that the legal position in this regard has not been

                altered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, and he would rely upon a set of

                judgments to argue that, in cases involving bank fraud, the Court should not

                invoke jurisdiction under 
Section 482
 of Cr.P.C. based on a subsequent

                settlement. In fact, when the money originally borrowed is sanctioned for

                specific purposes such as purchasing tools, kits, and equipment, which serve

                as primary security for the loan, diverting funds for a different purpose and

                then defaulting completes the offence of cheating.



                          3.2.    The     learned        counsel      appearing          on   behalf   of    the    2   nd




                respondent/Canara Bank submitted that the entire dues of the Bank have been

                settled, and the Bank has no serious objections in considering the petition for

                quashing. However, in view of the clause in the memorandum of One Time

                Settlement, there was no mandate for the Bank to file a compounding

                application before the Trial Court.



                D.Consideration and Findings:



                          4. This case was heard along with the connected Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and

                30939 of 2024 whereby, this Court considered the arguments made by the

                                  it does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal
                                  proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice
                                  in the case demands that the dispute between the
                                  parties is put to an end and peace is restored;

                                  securing the ends of justice being the ultimate
                                  guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have
                                  harmful effect on the public and consist in
                                  wrongdoing that seriously endangers and threatens
                                  the well-being of the society and it is not safe to
                                  leave the crime-doer only because he and the victim
                                  have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim
                                  has been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have
                                  been made compoundable in law, with or without the
                                  permission of the court. In respect of serious offences
                                  like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or other offences of
                                  mental depravity under 
IPC
 or offences of moral
                                  turpitude under special statutes, like the 
Prevention
                                  of Corruption Act
 or the offences committed by
                                  public servants while working in that capacity, the
                                  settlement between the offender and the victim can
                                  have no legal sanction at all. However, certain
                                  offences which overwhelmingly and predominantly
                                  bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,
                                  mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or
                                  such like transactions or the offences arising out of
                                  matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or the
                                  family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the
                                  victim and the offender and the victim have settled
                                  all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of
                                  the fact that such offences have not been made
                                  compoundable, the High Court may within the
                                  framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal
                                  proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is
                                  satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is
                                  hardly any likelihood of the offender being convicted
                                  and by not quashing the criminal proceedings, justice
                                  shall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated.
                                  The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each
                                  case will depend on its own facts and no hard-and-

                                  High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR
                                  or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is
                                  distinct and different from the power given to a
                                  criminal court for compounding the offences under
                                  Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide
                                  plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
                                  exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in
                                  such power viz. : (i) to secure the ends of justice, or

                                  (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In
                                  what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
                                  complaint or FIR may be exercised where the
                                  offender and the victim have settled their dispute
                                  would depend on the facts and circumstances of each
                                  case and no category can be prescribed. However,
                                  before exercise of such power, the High Court must
                                  have due regard to the nature and gravity of the
                                  crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental
                                  depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.
                                  cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or
                                  victim's family and the offender have settled the
                                  dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and
                                  have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any
                                  compromise between the victim and the offender in
                                  relation to the offences under special statutes like the
                                  
Prevention of Corruption Act
 or the offences
                                  committed by public servants while working in that
                                  capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for
                                  quashing criminal proceedings involving such
                                  offences. But the criminal cases having
                                  overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour
                                  stand on a different footing for the purposes of
                                  quashing, particularly the offences arising from
                                  commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership
                                  or such like transactions or the offences arising out of
                                  matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family
                                  disputes where the wrong is basically private or
                                  personal in nature and the parties have resolved their
                                  entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High
                                  Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its
                                  view, because of the compromise between the
                                  offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction
                                  is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal
                                  case would put the accused to great oppression and
                                  prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to

                                      and complete settlement and compromise with the
                                      victim. In other words, the High Court must consider
                                      whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest
                                      of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or
                                      continuation of the criminal proceeding would
                                      tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
                                      settlement and compromise between the victim and
                                      the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of
                                      justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put
                                      to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is
                                      in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well
                                      within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal
                                      proceeding.”


                                          31. There is no quarrel over the proposition that the
                                  High Court will be well within its jurisdiction to quash the
                                  proceedings on compromise, if the offence is predominantly
                                  civil in nature, private in nature, completely settled between
                                  the parties with no claim subsisting and the continuance of the
                                  proceedings is a bleak prospect for the prosecution and would
                                  be oppressive on the accused to be continued, even after
                                  settlement. The power is to be exercised with a great amount
                                  of prudence and responsibility, to secure the ends of justice.



                                          32. However, the question regarding the instances of
                                  various frauds committed by parties concerning banking
                                  transactions, obtaining loans, and defaulting on and
                                  subsequently settling them through methods like OTS, with
                                  the bank, has been addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
                                  India in the cases mentioned above. In some cases, cases were
                                  quashed, while in others, they were not. But a proper and
                                  combined reading of all the judgments cited above related to
                                  this subject shows that the common thread for the conclusion
                                  reached. It is not the classification or categorisation of the
                                  particular offence, such as 468, 471 of 
IPC
, or offences under
                                  Section 120 B read with 420 of 
IPC
 which is paramount.
                                  Instead, it is the nature of the allegations that the Court must
                                  examine. By considering the facts and circumstances of each
                                  case, one has to determine whether the case involves a purely
                                  commercial or private transaction between the bank and the
                                  borrower, or if it has broader implications affecting society or
                                  the financial system as a whole.



                                         33. In these cases, the nature of facts and circumstances

                                  must be examined. First, the Court must be satisfied that the
                                  case is primarily commercial or civil in nature and that the
                                  criminal aspects are not of utmost depravity and seriousness,
                                  which could have a likely impact on society as a whole or the
                                  country's financial system. The second step involves assessing
                                  whether the case has been fully settled and whether the Bank
                                  has any remaining claims. If the case has reached a complete
                                  and final settlement and the bank has no pending claims, then
                                  the Court moves to the third step to evaluate whether
                                  continuing the prosecution is prudent and likely to succeed in
                                  prosecuting the accused. Additionally, the Court must consider
                                  whether continuing the proceedings would be unfair,
                                  oppressive, or constitute an abuse of the legal process,
                                  considering the nature of the settlement or compromise, the
                                  circumstances of the alleged default, efforts made by the
                                  accused, the time elapsed, and the stage at which quashing is
                                  requested. In the interest of justice, the Court may, in fit cases,
                                  decide to quash the proceedings. In appropriate cases, costs
                                  can also be imposed.”



                          4.1. Based on the above, examining the facts of the present case, it is

                clear that the only offense alleged is under 
Section 420
 of the Indian Penal

                Code. Although the Bank has no serious objection, it has not explicitly agreed

                to join the petitioner in filing an application for compounding before the

                appropriate forum.



                          4.2. The main allegation against the petitioner is that, immediately after

                receiving the loan, the funds were diverted from the original purposes stated in

                the loan application, such as purchasing tools and equipment. The entire loan

                for other purposes, including providing margin money for bank guarantees and

                transferring funds to other institutions related to the petitioner, including those

                associated with the marine college business. Therefore, the core allegation is

                that the petitioner acted dishonestly by misrepresenting the purpose for which

                the loan was obtained. Although the funds were meant for his other business

                ventures, a different purpose was declared in the loan application.



                          4.3. When the loan amount was disbursed in April 2016, July 2016,

                October 2016, and the final transfer of Rs. 1 Crore was sanctioned in March

                2017, it is evident that in the very next quarter, on 29.06.2017, the account

                was classified as NPA. The original loan was obtained from the erstwhile

                Syndicate Bank, which later merged with Canara Bank. The statement of

                L.W.7 – Shri Ar u n Ras a p p a n , regarding the pending disbursement and

                utilization of the bank accounts, reads as follows:-

                                  that the said TOD of Rs 1.00 crores also slipped to NPA along
                                  with other Credit facilities.

                                  On being asked how the Term Loan of Rs 4.90 crores was
                                  disbursed to M/s Air Carnival Private Limited, I state that Shri
                                  S. Irudayanathan CMD of M/s Air Carnival Private limited
                                  requested to release the loan amount. I state that our Ganapathy

                                  account of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited. I state that Shri S.

                                  the company. I further state that Shri S.Irudayanthan requested
                                  in the said letter that he had already made payments to various
                                  vendors of Rs 6.80 crores including margin money of the

                          4.4. One Par i p o o r a n a m , Senior Manager, who in his statement as

                L.W.15 states as follows with reference to obtaining of lease of Aircrafts:



                                  “On being asked how many Air Crafts were taken on lease by
                                  M/s Air Carnival Private Limited during sanction of credit
                                  facilities, I state that these credit facilities were sanctioned for
                                  one Air Craft only, however, the company promised to take
                                  another Air Craft on lease basis by end of December 2016,
                                  however, it did not happen, the reason of the same was not
                                  known to me. On being asked I state that during sanction of

                                                                                            Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024


                                  discussed in the committee of RLCAC-I that the project is
                                  viable only if two Air Crafts would be taken on lease and
                                  commercial operations should b done with two Air Crafts.”



                          4.5. There is also an additional allegation that when the balance sheet of

                the original concern, viz., M/s Jet Carnival, showed a net worth of Rs.5.37

                Crores, there was a sudden increase of Rs.11.85 Crores in just one month and

                seven days, to reflect a higher valuation of Rs.11.85 Crores for the purpose of

                portraying increased capital as if infused by the firm. A further reading of the

                FIR shows that the company attempted to artificially boost its net worth to

                become eligible for a larger loan amount, and later failed to follow the original

                business plan by using the loan proceeds for purposes other than those

                specified. However, from the testimonies of the various listed witnesses, it

                appears that these actions were not done without the knowledge of the relevant

                officials. One of the witnesses, viz., Anb u m a n i , was even penalized with a

                minor penalty of a one-stage reduction in the pay scale for six months, without

                cumulative effect, which did not adversely affect his pension.



                          4.6. A review of the loan sanction letters shows that the first sanction

                letter, issued for a term loan of Rs.4.7 Crores, states the purpose is to cover

                working capital needs. The second sanction letter, dated 04.06.2016, mentions



                27/33



https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                   ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )

                                                                                        Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024


                that the loan was approved for purchasing tools and equipment, setting up a

                corporate office, acquiring computers, printers, furniture, and carrying out

                interior work on leased premises. Furthermore, 30% of the approved amount

                had to be deposited as margin money.



                          4.7. Firstly, it can be seen that the allegation is the diversion of funds

                for a different purpose, which would be a fraud within the meaning of the

                circular of the Reserve Bank of India. However, per se, it would not amount to

                an offence under 
Section 420
 of IPC. The transactions become an offence

                once there is a default. Therefore, only if the petitioner does not pay the

                amount due with respect to the specific installments, can it be said that the

                ingredients of the offence under 
Section 420
 of IPC, i.e., causing loss to the

                bank, are established.



                          4.8. Although the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

                entire loan amount was secured, once the purpose of the loan is dishonestly

                misrepresented and the amount remains unpaid on the stipulated dates, a prima

                facie offence under 
Section 420
 of the IPC is established. Furthermore, the

                factors pleaded by the petitioner would need consideration if a determination

                is to be made regarding the absence of any intent to cheat the bank. Therefore,

                at this stage, it cannot be said that no offence under 
Section 420
 of the IPC is

                made out.



                          4.9. On the other hand, as late as March 2017, the last transaction of

                Rs.1 Crore of overdraft facility was sanctioned, and immediately thereafter, in

                June 2017, the account was classified as NPA and taken into account.



                Although the OTS proposal by the bank states that the settlement is not for the

                ongoing criminal case, it is important to note that the standard clause is

                included in all cases, as the bank cannot withdraw or compound because non-



                compoundable offences are typically involved. Even in this case, offences

                under Section 120(B) and also the offence under 
Section 13(2)
 read with

                13(1)(d) were initially alleged against the bank officials, but these charges

                were later dropped, leaving only the offence under 
Section 420
 IPC against the

                petitioner.



                          4.10. Therefore, after careful consideration and review of the facts, the

                position tilts in favor of the petitioner, indicating that the entire episode is

                primarily commercial or civil in nature and does not impact society at large.



                The civil dispute between the petitioner and the Bank has been amicably

                resolved, with the bank explicitly stating that no amount is due. Based on the

                final report and collected materials, although there is evidence of siphoning

                funds, the question of whether the intent to cheat the bank was present from

                the outset would be difficult for the prosecution to prove to secure a

                conviction, especially if proper security was provided. More importantly, the

                diversion of funds initially was not to any external element but to the fixed

                deposit accounts with the bank itself. The period during which the loan was

                sanctioned, the fact that the petitioner’s venture quickly failed resulting in the

                entire loan being classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), and the

                settlement reached on 02.03.2022 all suggest there was no deliberate delay or

                mala fide intent by the petitioner to prolong the matter. Rather, the petitioner

                sincerely attempted to settle the dispute amicably and swiftly with the bank.



                Therefore, considering the full efforts toward settlement and compromise,

                continuing the prosecution may be deemed oppressive and unjust to the

                petitioner. Moreover, as per the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,

                the entire basis of the complaint leading to the prosecution is solely due to the

                petitioner’s default in amounts and causing the account to become an NPA.



 
Thus, the costs for prosecution and court fees should be imposed as per the

                ruling in 
Kothari Polymers Limited and Others Vs. CBI3
.
