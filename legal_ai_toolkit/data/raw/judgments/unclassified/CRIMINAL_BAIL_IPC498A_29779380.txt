    THESE PETITIONS, COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
ORDER WAS MADE THEREIN AS UNDER:

CORAM:     HON'BLE MR JUSTICE S VISHWAJITH SHETTY

                         ORAL ORDER


1.   Accused nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.40/2024 registered by

Nagara Police Station, Shivamogga, for the offences punishable

under 
Sections 323
, 
498A
, 
149
 IPC and 
Sections 3
 & 
4
 of the

Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, are before this Court under


Section 438
 of Cr.PC seeking anticipatory bail.



2.   Heard the learned Counsel for the parties.



3.   FIR in Crime No.40/2024 was registered by Nagara Police

Station,   Shivamogga,   against     the   petitioners   herein   and

another for the aforesaid offences on the basis of the first

information dated 26.07.2024 received from Akshata Kalahal

who is the wife of accused no.1. Apprehending arrest in the

                                    -5-

                                                 NC: 2024:KHC:37494

                                              CRL.P No. 9189/2024

                                         C/W CRL.P.Nos.9225/2024,

                                                        9231/2024




said   case,   petitioners   had    filed   applications   before   the

jurisdictional Sessions Court seeking anticipatory bail. The said

applications   were   rejected     by    the   Sessions    Court,   and

therefore, the petitioners are before this Court.



4.     Learned Counsel for the petitioners having reiterated the

grounds urged in the petition, submits that the relationship

between accused no.1 and his wife is strained. The alleged

offences are triable by the Court of Magistrate and the

maximum punishment for the same is imprisonment for a

period of three years. Petitioner are ready and willing to

cooperate with the police for the purpose of investigation.

Accordingly, he prays to allow the petitions.



5.     Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the petitions.



6.     Perusal of the material available on record would go to

show that the marriage of accused no.1 and the first informant

was solemnized on 27.01.2022. It is appears that subsequently

their relationship got strained and the first informant was

suspecting that accused no.1 had illicit relationship with

accused no.4. The first information is now filed alleging that

                                -6-

                                             NC: 2024:KHC:37494

                                          CRL.P No. 9189/2024

                                     C/W CRL.P.Nos.9225/2024,

                                                    9231/2024




accused persons were ill-treating and torturing the first

informant in her matrimonial house and were also demanding

additional dowry from her. It is also alleged that accused no.1

has illicit relationship with accused no.4. Petitioners do not

have criminal antecedents. The alleged offences are triable by

the Court of Magistrate and the maximum punishment for the

said offences is imprisonment for a period of three years.

Petitioners have undertaken to cooperate with the police for the

purpose of investigation. Under the circumstances, I am of the

opinion that the petitioners prayer for grant of anticipatory bail

is required to be answered affirmatively. Accordingly, the

following order:





7.    The petitions are allowed. The respondent - Police or any

other police in the State of Karnataka are directed to release

the petitioners in the event of their arrest in Crime No.40/2024

registered by Nagara Police Station, Shivamogga, for the

offences punishable under 
Sections 323
, 
498A
, 
149
 IPC and


Sections 3
 & 
4
 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, subject to

the following conditions:

                                -7-

                                      C/W CRL.P.Nos.9225/2024,

                                                     9231/2024


           1. The Petitioners shall appear before the
     Investigating Officer within 15 days from the date
     of receipt of the copy of this order and shall
     execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-
