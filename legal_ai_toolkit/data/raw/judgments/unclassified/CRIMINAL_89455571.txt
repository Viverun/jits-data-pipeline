 Order No.


01.      1.         It submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
         inadvertently the details of the case at hand has been wrongly stated
         in paragraph-7 of the bail application. He is permitted to correct the
         same in Court.

         2.         Heard learned counsel for the Petitioner and learned
         counsel for the State.

         3.         The Petitioner is an accused in connection with Spl.
         (NDPS) case No.107 of 2023, pending before the Court of learned
         Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Boudh arising out of Boudh
         P.S. Case No. 208 of 2023, for alleged commission of offences
         under 
Sections 20(b)(ii)(C)
/
29
 of NDPS Act.

         4.         Being aggrieved by the rejection of his application for bail
         U/s. 439 
Cr.P.C
. by the learned Special Judge, Boudh by order
         dated 26.05.2023 in the aforementioned case, the present BLAPL
         has been filed.

         5.         It is stated that the petitioner is the first offender and is in
         custody since 21.05.2023, on the accusation of possessing the
         contraband (ganja) to the tune of 22 kgs along with two co-accused.

                                                                               Page 1 of 2


                                 6.       Learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the order dated
                                22.06.2023 in respect of the co-accused passed by this Court in
                                BLAPL No.6484 of 2023 and seeks release inter alia on the ground
                                of parity.

                                7.       It is further submitted that in the case at hand the wrong
                                weighment cannot be ruled out so as to bring it within the rigors of
                                
Section 37
 of the NDPS Act. Hence, further continuance of the
                                petitioner in custody is not warranted.

                                8.       Learned counsel for the State opposes the prayer for bail
                                relying on the bar contained in 
Section 37
 of the NDPS Act and
                                submits that defence plea as advanced cannot be taken into account
                                at this stage.

                                9.       Considering the nature of allegations, role ascribed to the
                                petitioner and the petitioner being the first offender, this Court
                                directs the petitioner to be released on bail on such terms to be fixed
                                by the learned Court in seisin subject to verification of criminal
                                antecedent of the petitioner.

                                10.      If it comes to the fore that the petitioner has any criminal
                                antecedent, this order shall stand recalled.

                                11.      Additionally it is directed that, the petitioner shall appear
                                before the jurisdictional police station once a week on such date and
                                time to be fixed by the learned Court in seisin till submission of the
                                final form. Certification of such appearance shall be submitted to
                                the Court in seisin.

                                12.      The BLAPL thus stands disposed of.
