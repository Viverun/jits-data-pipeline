(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of
Yashwant Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in
(1996) 7 SCC 113, dealing with question for determination "whether
appellant is entitled to any pensionary benefits since total service of
more than eighteen years was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:-

                               held:

     "3.. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing
     for the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when
     the appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½
     years of quasi-permanent
                       permanent service. According to him to earn
     pension it was necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of
     permanent service.

          It is contended that since the total service of the appellant
     was in quasi-permanent
                     permanent capacity he wasw not enlisted to the
     pensionary benefits.

          There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant
     was not made permanent even when he had served the
     Government for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the
     appellant is denied the pensionary benefits simply on the
     ground that he was not a permanent employee of the
     government. The appellant having served the government for
     almost-two
              two decades it would be unfair to treat him as
     temporary/quasi-permanent.

                        permanent.

          Keeping in view the facts and circumstances
                                         circumstanc of this case we
     hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become
     permanent after he served the Government for such a long
     period. The services of the appellant shall be treated to be in
     permanent capacity and he shall be entitled to the pensionary
     benefits. We allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
     Tribunal and direct the respondents to treat the appellant as
     having been retired from service on 7.3.1980 after serving the
     Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of permanent
     service) and d as such his case for grant of pension be finalized
     within six months from the receipt of this order. The appellant
     shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date of
     retirement.

(iii)    The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical
facts and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain
Singh, CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017. Their
Lordships was seisin with similar issue as decided by Central

Communication, Department of Posts taken plea as before Tribunal
that services of private respondents Temporary Status Casual
Labour, was never regularized nor worked on a regular group 'D'
post till his retirement. Therefore he is not entitled to pensioner
benefits. Their Lordships in case of 
Kritnarain Singh
 (supra)
affirmed view taken by this Tribunal in OA No. 900/2012 based on
Hon'ble High Court Patna judgement dated 15.12.2015 in CWJC
No. 17204/2015. So also their Lordships observed that Tribunal has
taken correct view because in similar and identical circumstances the
High Court held in favour of an employee and that judgment stands
and holds the field and writ application dismissed.

case in facts and legal issue in case of 
Union of India versus Smt

                          // 12 //                                    OA/050/00396/2019




Ram Kali Devi, DWJC No. 11435 of 2017 decided on 11.9.2017.11.9.2017
Their Lordships were seisin with similar issue as involved in the
present case. The Union of India, Department of Posts had
challenged order dated 22.3.2017 passed in O.A. No. 664/2015
(Patna) by this Tribunal to pay family pension, retiral dues to widow
of deceased employee.




         Their Lordships observed that
                                  tha husband of petitioner granted
temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992
and he died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more
than 25 years of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in
temporary status begets the benefits of pension. Failure on part of
postal department not to regularize services of husband of private
respondents cannot be appreciated. Their Lordships decided in
favour of temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'
employee and upheld order dated 22.3.2017 in similar OA No.
664/2015 (Patna). So also observed that in similar and identical cases
adjudicated in favour of employees in OA No. 113/2006 decided on
21.9.2006, affirmed by Patna High Court vide order dated 7.11.2007
in CWJC No. 4475/2007007 and order of the High Court Patna has been
affirmed by Hon'ble Apex Court on 4.12.2009. So also similar cases
travelled from O.A. No. 900/2012 (CAT Patna) in CWJC No. 10978
of 2017 and Division Bench vide order dated 4.9.2017 had upheld
directions by this
                 his Tribunal extending benefits of pension as
employee was granted temporary status at par with Group 'D'
employee.

(v)      The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with similar legal
core issue as involved in the present case interpreted rules
applicable in the present OA in hand. 
In the case of 
Union of
India and others versus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar, CWJC

O.A 164/2008

          2008 (Patna). The Tribunal has granted family pension and
other pensionary benefits to widow of deceased employee died as
temporary employee without being regularized.
Their Lordships dealing with the identical issue "whether deceased
employee who was appointed
                        pointed as a casual labourer and thereafter
stepped into the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 23.10.1992 and
died in harness on 15.11.2007 and his legal heirs is entitled to
benefit of pension/family pension or not ?"




So also held that sub-clause
                        clause (3) of
                                    o clause (2) of Para 5 of Casual

is crystal clear that temporary employees is entitled to pension and
retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of service in the
temporary status followed
                     lowed by regularization. Their Lordships further
observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs

Service Rules i.e Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules
1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 1972 and temporary rules is a

The writ petition was directed against order dated 31.1.2014
            passed by learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh
            Bench, in OA No. 426/HP/2013 Painu Ram Vs Union of India &

(vii) Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at
            Chandigarh in case of 
Mrs. Alka Sharma versus Union of India
,

            and family pension under Railway Services (Pension) Rules as for no
            fault of deceased employee on lapses on railways could not be
            considered for regularization". The Hon'ble High Court considered
            the fact that employee himselfself was not at fault for such lack of
            regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The Hon'ble
            High Court considered relevant Rules 75,75 governing Family Pension
            Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased
            employee was otherwisee not regularized inspite of 14 years in
            temporary capacity and at time of the death was still working as
            temporary employee.

            family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee
            by notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension
            only for a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.


12.         In the other similar and identical situation, The Central
Administrative Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of
original applicants on similar facts and legal issue as involved in the
present OA in hand and some of them are cited as under:

                                                 under:-

 
(a)   The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018
            
Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors

            decided on 28.10.2021. The said O.A. was filed by Night Guard
            working in Department of Posts seeking pension and other
            pensionary benefits in terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read
            with GID (3) below Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
 
The
                      ribunal observed that as per judgement by The Hon'ble
            learned Tribunal
            Supreme Court in 
Uma Devi
's case, Department of Posts has
            circulated policy in June/July 2014 for regularization of casual
            labours having worked for ten years or more and vide judgement
            dated 13.11.2017 7 Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.
                              // 14 //                            OA/050/00396/2019




      12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the policy. The applicant
      Awadhesh Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984
      on daily wages, conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and
      retired on October, 2019 after 35 years of total service as temporary
      status and not been regularized.


 
The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of
      clause 5 of Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66- 66
      9/91-SPB. I dated 30th November, 1992-1992 benefits to a casual labour
      on completion of three years service in Temporary status become
      entitled to be treated at par with temporary Group 'D' employees of
      the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
      benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis
      such as counting of service for purposes of pension and terminal
      benefits as in the case of temporary employees appointed on regular
      basis while granting them pension and retirement benefits after the
      regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order relied on
      larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
      case of 
Prem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others

      reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-


                        "35. There are some of the employees who haveha not
               been regularized in spite of having rendered the services for
               30-40
                   40 or more years whereas they have been superannuated.


               As they have worked in work-charged
                                            work           establishment, not
               against any particular project, their services ought to have
               been regularized
                              zed under the Government instructions and
               even as per the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of
               Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court
               in the said decision has laid down that in case services have
               been rendered for more than ten years
                                                  ye     without the cover of
               the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be
               regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those
               employees who have worked for ten years or more should
               have been regularized. It would not be proper to regulate
               them for consideration of regularisation as others have been
               regularised, we direct that their services be treated as a
               regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be
               entitled to claiming any dues of difference in wages had they
               been continued
                            ued in service regularly before attaining the age
               of superannuation. They shall be entitled to receive the
               pension as if they have retired from the regular establishment
               and the services rendered by them right from the day they
               entered the work-charged
                                  charged establishment
                                           est            shall be counted as
               qualifying service for purpose of pension.

                        36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P.
               Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services
               rendered in the work-charged
                                       charged establishment shall be treated
               as qualifying service
                                 rvice under the aforesaid rule for grant of
               pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three
               years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible
               benefits be paid accordingly within three months.
               Resultantly, the appeals filed by the employees
                                                      emplo       are allowed
               and filed by the State are dismissed."

16.           In compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
the case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union (supra)
                                 (supra). The Department of Posts,
Government of India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers
(Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April,
1991 and scheme has been drawn up by the Department in consultation
with Ministry of Law, Fi nance and Personnel and his Excellency the
                      Finance
President of India has been graciously pleased to approve with intention to
provide benefits to casual labourers working continuously for long period.

17.           The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force,
social and beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to
extend benefits to long continuous working of casual labourers
                                                     labourers.

18.           The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 confers temporary status on
casual labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant
                                                     applicant is
appointee of year 198
                  1981 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize
and ought to have been superannuated before 30.

                                            30.11.2020 accordance with
law as regular employee for no fault of applicant made to suffer violating

Article 14
, 21
, 31A
 and 
30
                        3000
 of the Constitution of India.

19.           The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.
27.04.1997 pursuant to order dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-1) and the
statutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years certain advantages to
temporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the
pay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.
Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to
a Group 'D' employ
            employee
                   ee after completion of one year of service from date of
conferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant
of increment to a government servant on same scale of pay
                                                      pay. The legislative
intent is clear as noon day in formulating the sta
                                               statutory
                                                  tutory scheme dated
12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to
enforce the terms as social legislation to enhance social welfare and
achieve social justice. The Central Government being an ideal employer

of the Constitution of India treating temporary status casual labour after
long period at par with temporary Group 'D' employee of the Department
granting benefits and treating at par with and entitled for such benefits as
are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on regular basis. The scheme
further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity Leave as to regular
                                  // 17 //                       OA/050/00396/2019




Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary status for retirement
benefits after regulari
               regularization
                       zation as a regular Group 'D' on absorption. So also
the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation with harmonious
construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for
conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering tthree
                                                           hree years
continuous service as temporary status.

20.           The applicant was conferred temporary status on 27.04.1997
and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial
construction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after
three years since 27.04.1997 meaning thereby since 27.04.2000 has attained
status of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to
G.P.F. The applicant was in capacity of temporary employee. The
                                                             he applicant
having continuously worked as temporar
                              temporaryy status casual labourer since
27.04.1997 and on 27.04.2000 is holder of post of temporary
employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly by the
model employer state accordance with guarantee enshrined in the 
Article 14

and 
21
 of the Const itution of India. This Tribunal is of the view whereof
              Constitution
that it is unfair to continue husband of the applicant such a long in
temporary post and without considering for regularizing till retirement.

21.           The applicant acquired status of temporary employee Group
'D' of Department of Posts and it is well settled in law that entitled for
such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis.
So also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Jagrit Mazdoor Union (supra).

22.           The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory
terms no recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual
labourers available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have
not discharged statutory dduty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P.
Part IV of the Constitution of India and applicant husband not regularized
as for no fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not
discharge his duty and not regularized on time for own mist
                                                       mistakes
                                                           akes
respondents cannot take advantages and plea not even considered for
regularization available to them that since no regularization no pension etc.

23.           The applicant before retirement submitted representation
dated 31.12.2018 and 11.02.2019 (Annexure A-3)
                                          A to allow to participate in
absorption to regularize services on regular cadre post but no response. The
respondents have stated in Para 8 of the written statement that applicant
                                    // 18 //                      OA/050/00396/2019




could not be provided opportunity for regularization as Group 'D' through
selection
   ection in view of limited vacancies        kept for selection of casual
labourers. The Para 8 of written statement and averments of OA that
respondents not regularized services of applicant remains unrebutted. The
applicant was never at fault for such lack of re
                                              regularization.

24.           This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by
applicant in the O.A that respondents have not regularized services on
regular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests dated
31.12.2018 and also filed as Annexure A-3,
                                      A    and retired on 30.11.2020
without being regularized. The respondents in para 8 of written statement
not adverted to specific allegation and not specifically denied as per
requirement in Rule 3,4, and 5 of the order VIII 
of Code of Civil Procedure
.

      ribunal is of the view since respondents state failed to discharge his

statutory duty as per the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even once
considered for regularization since 198
                                    19811.. Hence respondents cannot take
advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not
regularized deceased employee before retirement. The matter of right
                                                               right, right
accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to applicant and he
ought to have at least considered for regularization before date of

superannuation.

             on. The applicant worked since 1981 till 30.11.2020 almost
more than thirty seven (37) years in the department.

                                         department

25.           The department of posts issued clarifications some of
reproduced herein above enumerating advantages of temporary employee.
So also policy dat
               dated
                   ed 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts
G.I. (5). Benefits of casual labourers on completion of three years service in
temporary status reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to
the employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken
away    by   respondents.    The     D
                                     Department
                                      epartment   of   Posts,   Ministry   of
Telecommunication & I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated
12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of implementation results in failure of
social-economic
       economic justice
                justice. So also
                             lso envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of
Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are substantive attempts to
enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to employee accrued rights
and has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justic
                                                                  justice.

                                                                         e.

Hence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no pensionry
                                   // 19 //                      OA/050/00396/2019




benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief
claimed.

26.           The sub-clause
                      clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated
30.11.1992 quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of
the postal department with effect from date of completion three years of
service in newly acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits
admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service
for purpo
    purpose
         se of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary
employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and
retirement benefits after their regularization.

27.           The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants
are regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above.
The Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and
death gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same
provisions as are applicable to the permanent civilian governme
                                                       government
                                                               nt servants
under the CCS Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The
claim for pension and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules
1965 read with Rules 2 CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary
employee retired without substantive appoin
                                     appointment
                                            tment are held entitled for
pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Rules 2021.

28.           The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules
2021 as extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where
excludes temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension
Rules 2021 are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So
also the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply
to (6) cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to
civil services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before
31st December, 2003, who retired or were retired before having been
appointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be
payable to the government servant to the extent pr
                                                provided
                                                  ovided in the Central
Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to
benefitss as admissible to any other public servant and respondents have
violated fundamental right enshrined in 
Article 14
 and 
21
 of Constitution of
India.

29.           The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of
three years service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5
                                    // 20 //                            OA/050/00396/2019




dated 30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to
pension and retirement benefits on his completion of three
                                                     three years service in
temporary status followed by regularization.

30.          The applicant stood retired on 30.11.2020 as temporary
employee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge
his duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965
read with Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of
pension, family pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee.
The status of employee was at par with regular employee on long
continuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory
Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy
decision.

31.          The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021
makes it clear that applicant who stood retired before having been
appointed in a substantive ccapacity
                             apacity as regular cadre employee for such type
of category of temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension,
retirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to
applicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant under CCS
Pension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:

                                                                   under:--

             (i)     On retirement from service on superannuation or
                     invalidation     after    having     rendered     continuous
                     temporary/quasi permanent service of not less than 10 years.

             (ii)    On seeking voluntary
                                  oluntary retirement after completion of 20 years
                     of continuous temporary service.

             (iii)   In event of death while in service.



32.          This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory
schemes clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS
Pension Rules 2021 (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the
matter and in view of whereof of the affirm view that Government of India,

9/91-SPB
     SPB-II dated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are
social legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965
and the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status
in department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly
acquired temporary status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and
pensionery benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement
Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 is failure of social
                                  // 21 //                        OA/050/00396/2019




justice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is
substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state as an ideal
employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in
Part IV of the Constitution.

33.           Thus respondents can not take advantages of their own wrong
and lapses and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and
applicant entitled to receive pension as if retired from regular establishment
                                                                         hment

                                    rs passed in similar facts in OA

No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015 upheld in CWJC No.11435 of
2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on part of Postal Department
not to regularize the services of husband, private respondent in 23 years of
service after having granted temporary status at par with Group 'D'
employee and conduct of postal department cannot be appreciated or
ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017
upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, direct
                                                        directing

respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under
old pension scheme.


40.          Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that
as per rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary
benefits on regularizat
            regularization
                        ion with 10 years of qualifying service which
includes full service after regularization and 50% service rendered under
temporary status. On working for three years as Temporary Status treated at
par with Group 'D' employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary
status employee is not regularized having served more than 20 years, it can
only be due to failure of respondents department. Temporary Status
employee officials otherwise meeting conditions for regularization and
pensionary benefits were thus eligible for pension and retirement benefits.
So also this Tribunal considered order passed in identical case OA No.143
of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not regularized and allowed OA for
grant of pension. 
In case of 
Shiv Chandra Sah
 (Supra) vide orderr dated
21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant entitled for pension
and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary Status period as
Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on 03.11.2018,

temporary status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee
confirmed at part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and
claim for pension denied that his service not regularized and applicant
denied

respondents did not issue any order of regularization during 27 years of
applicant's service and right accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary
                                  // 26 //                       OA/050/00396/2019

1972. So also
placed reliance in case OA No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated
21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of 2017 in 
Ratneshwar Singh

Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018, allowed OA and directed for fixation
of pension, grant of gratuity and all other retiral dues in light of judgment
passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and
order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA No.372/2017.

Union of India & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated
03.07.2019 upheld this Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA
No.777/2016. Their Lordships considered argument of respondents
department
 epartment that contention of department cannot be accepted that
applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be construed that
applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying for
more than 27 years.

43.           The present cases are similar to cases
                                               cases cited herein above and

In 
Yashwant Hari Katakkar
 (supra) Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the
applicant was not made permanent even when he had served the
government for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if
applicant is denied the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that
he was not regularized not a permanent employee of the government.


Keeping in view facts and circumstances appellant was deemed to
have become permanent after he served the government for such a
long period. The services shall be treated to be permanent capacity
and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.
