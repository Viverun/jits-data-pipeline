REPORTABLE :

    "I wish I had been more disabled -- then perhaps the system

    would have seen me."




                         (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)
 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                     (2 of 31)                             [CW-4343/2001]


             These words reflect not a wish for greater suffering, but

a bitter irony -- that in the rigid, checkbox-driven machinery of

the State's welfare framework, a person's lived experience of

disability may fall through the cracks. In a system meant to uplift

the disadvantaged, the petitioner stands at a paradox: disabled,

yet not disabled enough to be seen.

1.           Considering the interwoven and identical set of facts

and legal issues framed and put-forth the present petitions were

tagged     and    are   henceforth         adjudicated          vide       this    common

judgment, with consent of the counsel representing the parties, in

both the petitions.

2.           Before proceeding to examine the present petitions on

their merits, it is imperative to first delineate the foundational

facts and the core issues arising therein. A precise appreciation of

the factual matrix and procedural background is essential to

contextualize the grievances of the petitioners and the legal

questions that fall for adjudication. The salient aspects of the

petitions are, therefore, summarized as under:

In SBCWP No. 4343/2001 :-

3.           The petitioner appeared in the Rajasthan Administrative

Services Examination, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as 'RAS'

Examination) and secured an overall merit rank of 360. However,

during    the    course of       the post-examination                    formalities, the

petitioner was subjected to a medical examination by the

competent Medical Board. Upon assessment, the petitioner was

declared    medically      unfit     for    appointment             to    the     Rajasthan

Administrative Service and its allied services on account of a visual

impairment diagnosed as Congenital Nystagmus (CN).

4.           Congenital Nystagmus is an ocular motor disorder of

uncertain etiology, typically manifesting at birth or in early infancy.

It is clinically characterized by involuntary, rhythmic oscillations of

the eyes, which may affect visual acuity and ocular stability.

Despite the said diagnosis, the petitioner's visual impairment, as

assessed, was less than 20%, thereby falling below the minimum

threshold required to qualify as a benchmark disability under

applicable norms.

5.           Specifically, in accordance with the criteria laid down in

the relevant notification issued by the Union Public Service

Commission (UPSC) for the Civil Services Examination (CSE), the

petitioner was classified under Category 0, with corrected visual

acuity in the better eye recorded between 6/9 to 6/18, and in the

worse eye between 6/24 to 6/36. As such, the petitioner was not

considered eligible either under the general category (due to

medical unfitness) or under the reserved category for persons with

benchmark disabilities (due to non-qualification of the 40%

disability threshold).

6.           During the pendency and adjudication of the present

writ petition, this Court, by way of an interim order dated

03.09.2001, had granted protective relief in favor of the petitioner.

Vide the said interim direction, it was ordered that one seat in the

Rajasthan Co-operative Subordinate Service -- Inspector Grade II

be kept reserved and vacant for the petitioner, subject to the final

outcome of the writ proceedings.

In SBCWP No. 3500/2006 :-

7.           The petitioner, pursuant to his candidature in the

Rajasthan Administrative Services Examination, 2003, secured an

overall   merit      position     at     Rank      21.      Notwithstanding               such

commendable performance, the petitioner was appointed to the

Rajasthan      Accounts         Service        instead          of        the      Rajasthan

Administrative Service (RAS), albeit the fact that both services are

categorically classified as non-technical in nature under the

prevailing    Medical      Examination           Instructions             issued     by    the

Government of Rajasthan in the year 1975.

8.           Pursuant to the declaration of results and in accordance

with the post-examination protocol, the petitioner was subjected

to a medical examination on 14.11.2005. The Medical Board, upon

evaluation, declared the petitioner unfit for appointment to the

RAS cadre on account of his pre-existing condition of Congenital

Nystagmus (CN). Aggrieved by this determination, the petitioner

submitted a formal representation seeking reconsideration of the

medical opinion. In response, the petitioner was re-examined by

the Medical Board on 02.01.2006. However, the subsequent

medical opinion merely reiterated the prior conclusion of unfitness

without furnishing any cogent reasons or objective justification for

the adverse finding.

9.           It is pertinent to highlight that notwithstanding the

petitioner's superior merit position at Rank 21, the respondents

proceeded to appoint the next candidate in order of merit, one Ms.

Prabha    Gautam,       who      secured       Rank       22,        to    the     Rajasthan

Administrative Service cadre. In contrast, the petitioner was

                        (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)
 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                   (5 of 31)                         [CW-4343/2001]


appointed to the Rajasthan Accounts Service. It is a matter of

record that the petitioner has, since his appointment, continuously

served in the Rajasthan Accounts Service for a period of

approximately two decades and has discharged his official duties

with utmost diligence, integrity, and to the unqualified satisfaction

of his superior officers.


SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE

PETITIONER :-

10.          At the outset, learned counsel for the petitioner


submitted that the petitioner had consistently demonstrated

academic excellence and commitment to public service throughout

his educational and professional career. In the year 1989, the

petitioner    qualified   the    Senior       Secondary           Examination   with

71.60% marks from the Board of Secondary Education, Rajasthan,

Ajmer. Thereafter, in 1993, he completed his graduation from

Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner, securing 71.60% marks

and attaining the third position in the University merit list. The

petitioner further qualified the National Eligibility Test (NET) in his

first attempt in 1995 and subsequently completed his M.Sc. in

Agriculture (Agronomy) in 1996 from the RAU University, Bikaner

with distinction, being awarded a gold medal for his academic

performance. Demonstrating his continued dedication to academic

pursuits, the petitioner re-qualified the NET examination in the

years 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he appeared in the Rajasthan

Administrative Services (RAS/RTS) Examination and successfully

cleared all stages, securing the 360th rank in the final merit.

Subsequently, in the RAS Examination conducted in 2003, the

                      (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                        (6 of 31)                         [CW-4343/2001]


petitioner improved his performance significantly and secured an

overall rank of 21, reflecting his consistent and meritorious

academic and competitive examination record.



11.          It was further submitted that the petitioner despite

being a meritorious candidate, is repeatedly subjected to arbitrary

and discriminatory treatment by the respondent authorities,

resulting in denial of rightful appointment in the Rajasthan

Administrative Service (RAS), despite his better performance and

ranking in the merit list. Thence, the petitioner seeks appropriate

relief for the infringement of his fundamental and legal rights. It

was then apprised to the Court that on 05.07.2001, the petitioner

was declared medically unfit for appointment to the RAS on

account     of       the    pre-existing          condition        termed     Congenital

Nystagmus. Nonetheless, the said declaration was made without

affording the petitioner any meaningful opportunity of clarification

or recourse. Thereafter, on 31.07.2001, upon the petitioner's

request, a re-medical examination was conducted by the duly

constituted Medical Board. However, the petitioner was again

declared medically unfit. In this regard, it was submitted that the

said medical report was not supplied to him despite repeated

requests, thereby denying him access to a vital document

affecting his career and right to employment.



12.          Consequentially, the petitioner was constrained to

approach this Court and had filed SB Civil Writ Petition No.

4343/2001 (Dr. Deva Ram Shivram v. State of Rajasthan & Ors.),

wherein the petitioner challenged the denial of appointment solely

on the basis of medical unfitness sans taking note of the merit


                           (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                        (7 of 31)                        [CW-4343/2001]


scored by the petitioner, which he contended to be arbitrary,

without justification, and in violation of the principles of natural

justice.



13.          It was averred that in the year 2003, the Rajasthan

Public Service Commission (RPSC) issued a fresh advertisement

for the RAS/RTS Examination, 2003 for filling various posts in the

State and sub-ordinate services. The petitioner, determined to

serve the State, once again participated in the said competitive

examination.         The    petitioner        cleared      all    the   stages   of   the

examination with distinction and secured an overall 21 st rank in

the general merit category. It is crucial to note that the petitioner

did not avail of any benefit of reservation under the physically

handicapped category, as he did not possess a disability certificate

qualifying him for such classification. Further, vide communication

dated 05.07.2003, the office of the Commissioner (Disabilities)

informed the petitioner that he had less than 20% disability and

hence was ineligible to be issued a disability certificate for availing

benefits under the physically handicapped category. The said

communication is on record as Annexure-8.



14.          Thereafter, the petitioner was once again called for a

medical examination on 14.11.2005. However, to the petitioner's

grave prejudice, he was yet again declared medically unfit on

account of defective vision, without any substantial deviation in

the medical opinion or a detailed consideration of the nature of the

duties to be performed under the RAS cadre. Being aggrieved, the

petitioner submitted a detailed representation dated 10.12.2005

before the then Hon'ble Chief Minister and other competent


                           (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                   (8 of 31)                       [CW-4343/2001]


authorities seeking review of the adverse medical opinion and

consideration for service allocation (Annexure-10 in SBCWP

No.3500/2006). In response, a Medical Board was re-constituted

and the petitioner underwent a subsequent medical examination

on 02.01.2006. However, the outcome of this exercise was once

again unfavorable and remained consistent with the previous

opinion, without providing the petitioner any benefit of doubt or

reasonable accommodation.



15.          It was sequentially argued that on 21.04.2006, a

candidate namely Ms. Prabha Gautam, who stood 22 nd i.e. next in

the merit list and a rank lower to the petitioner, was appointed to

the RAS cadre service along with other candidates, while the

petitioner stood excluded without being provided any valid or

reasoned justification. It was further submitted that on the very

next day, i.e. on 22.04.2006, the Government, invoking its powers

of discretion and purported excellence, appointed the petitioner

not to the RAS cadre service, but to the Rajasthan Accounts

Service, despite the fact that both the services were classified

under the "non-technical category" under the relevant recruitment

guidelines framed and issued by the Government of Rajasthan,

Department of Personnel (Group II) in the year 1975

(hereinafter referred to as 'guidelines of 1975'). Therefore, it

can be deduced that this act of appointing the petitioner to a

service other than the one earned on merit, and lower in

preference,      without    any      objective         rationale,   is   arbitrary,

unjustified, and violative of the fundamental rights of the





                      (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                  (9 of 31)                         [CW-4343/2001]


petitioner as enshrined under the provisions of 
Articles 14
 and 
16


of the Constitution of India.



16.          It was also apprised to the Court that as per the

Instructions for Medical Examination dated 01.01.1975 bearing

No. F.15(1)DOP/A-II/74-I while holding that a candidate is not fit

according to the norms laid down in those guidelines i.e.

Guidelines of 1975, it would be permissible for a Medical Board to

recommend to Government of Rajasthan for reasons specifically

recorded in writing that the candidate in question may be

admitted to the service without any disadvantage to the State

government. At the same time, by the said guidelines it was made

unambiguous that it is to be noted that the question is one of the

likelihood of continuous service and the rejection of a candidate

need not be advised on account of the presence of a defect which

is only a small proportion of cases, if found to interfere with

continuous effect of service.



17.          In these circumstances, the petitioner was left with no

alternative remedy but to approach this Court once again by filing

the a writ petition in 2006 (connected herein), seeking appropriate

directions for appointment in the Rajasthan Administrative Service

in accordance with his merit, and to set aside the medical

unfitness     findings    as     being        unreasoned          and    arbitrary.

Nevertheless, the continued exclusion of the petitioner from the

RAS cadre service, despite demonstrable merit and in absence of

any   sustainable    medical      disqualification,         is   violative   of   his

fundamental rights and liable to be set.

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                      (10 of 31)                          [CW-4343/2001]



18.          In view of the factual background already submitted

before the Court, it was reiterated that the petitioner is an

academically         distinguished        and        professionally        accomplished

individual who has consistently demonstrated merit, competence,

and administrative capability throughout his career. Learned

counsel submitted that the petitioner is a Gold Medalist in M.Sc.

(Agronomy), conferred by a recognized university, and his

achievements in academics are reflective of his cognitive and

professional abilities. It was submitted that such academic

excellence negates any presumptive inference of incapability in

discharging       administrative          duties       under         the   RAS      cadre.

Nevertheless, the petitioner holds a 'B' Certificate of the National

Cadet Corps (NCC) and has qualified the National Eligibility Test

(NET), in addition to publishing 15 peer-reviewed research papers

and authoring a book titled "Agronomic Terminology", published by

the     Indian    Society     of    Agronomy,          IARI,     New       Delhi.   These

accomplishments substantiate the petitioner's intellectual and

administrative acumen.



19.          Moreover, despite being diagnosed with Congenital

Nystagmus, the petitioner has continuously served in various

high-responsibility public positions inter alia, Treasury Officer,

Chief    Accounts      Officer,     Assistant        General         Manager     (Medical

Services),       Comptroller       of    Sri     Karan       Narendra        Agricultural

University, Officer on Special Duty (Revenue Mobilization), Jaipur

Development Authority, Accounts Officer, Tribal Area Development

(TAD) Department, Jaipur, Accounts Officer, Jila Parishad Nagaur

and has also undergone training at the prestigious Harishchandra


                         (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                  (11 of 31)                       [CW-4343/2001]


Mathur Rajasthan Institute of Public Administration (HCM RIPA).

At no point the petitioner has faced any impairment which

obstructed the efficient performance of his official duties, nor has

any adverse report been recorded against him in this regard in the

ACRs qua him over the years.



20.          In light of the above averred achievements, it was

submitted     that   the     petitioner      has     demonstrated         consistent

administrative and professional excellence, and any inference

drawn solely from a minor physical condition is wholly unjustified,

unreasonable, and contrary to established constitutional and

statutory safeguards.



21.          Unfolding the arguments further, learned counsel had

averred that the petitioner has successfully qualified all stages of

the RAS Examination 2003 and secured 21 st rank in the general

category     merit   list,   having       undergone          the   same    rigorous

competitive process as other candidates. Thus, the denial of

appointment despite high merit is a manifest violation of 
Articles

14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution of India, which guarantee equality of

opportunity in public employment. The RAS recruitment process is

merit-centric. The petitioner being placed well within the range of

selected candidates, ought to be appointed to the RAS cadre.

Instead, a lower-ranked candidate (Rank 22) was appointed,

thereby evidencing invidious discrimination.


22.          Nevertheless, from a rational thinking it can be inferred

that the action of respondents defies all logic and reasoning as

while a person suffering from 40% benchmark disability is eligible

for appointment against the post in question, under the physically


                      (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                 (12 of 31)                    [CW-4343/2001]


handicapped category, a candidate with a lesser degree of

disability, like the case of the petitioner, and is treated as

medically unfit. Such a candidate may not be entitled to the

benefit of reservation under the physically handicapped category,

yet the statutory declaration clearly indicates that the petitioner's

condition does not disqualify him.



23.          The petitioner was not suffering from a benchmark

disability, as defined under Section 2(r) of the Rights of Persons

with 
Disabilities Act, 2016
 (hereinafter referred to as the

Act of 2016), i.e., a disability of 40% or more. In fact, the

Disability Commissioner, vide communication dated 05.07.2003,

certified that the petitioner had less than 20% disability, thereby

disqualifying him from availing any reservation but simultaneously

being unreasonably excluded from general selection. For the sake

of handiness the said definition is reproduced herein below:


             (r) "person with benchmark disability" means
             a person with not less than forty per cent. of a
             specified disability where specified disability has
             not been defined in measurable terms and
             includes a person with disability where specified
             disability has been defined in measurable terms,
             as certified by the certifying authority;



24.          The action of the respondent authorities in denying

appointment to the RAS cadre, while offering placement in the

Rajasthan Accounts Service (also a non-technical service under

the Guidelines of 1975), is arbitrary and irrational, violating the

Doctrine of Reasonableness as enunciated under the provisions of


Article 14
 of the Constitution of India and the fundamental rights

of the petitioner as enshrined under 
Article 21
 of the same.

Likewise, the denial of service on medical grounds, despite


                     (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                  (13 of 31)                            [CW-4343/2001]


medical     fitness   for   equivalent         posts,       amounts        to   hostile

discrimination and violates the spirit and objectives of the

Guidelines of 1975, which govern classification of services as

technical or non-technical and appointment thereto and 
Sections

20
 and 
21
, of the Act of 2016 which mandate non-discrimination

in public employment and equal opportunities.



25.          Subsequently, it was contended that ever since 2005,

the Union Public Service Commission and Central Government are

appointing     physically    challenged         candidates         with    benchmark

disabilities in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) cadre. By

2008, the State of Rajasthan itself had implemented similar

practices in the RAS cadre; moreso, the Hon'ble Supreme Court

and various High Courts have laid down in a catena of decisions

that   meritorious    candidates         with      lesser     or    non-benchmark

disabilities must not be excluded from appointment solely on

medical grounds if they are otherwise capable of discharging the

functions required.



26.          The petitioner is consistently rated as "Outstanding" or

"Very Good" in his Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) over the

last 20 years of government service, his official record further

affirms that there is no hindrance or barrier arising from his

physical     condition.     Thus,       excluding         the      petitioner     from

consideration due to a disability that is less than the threshold for

even claiming reservation reflects a flawed system, forcing

meritorious persons into an unjust dilemma -- to be "more

disabled" to qualify for equitable treatment. This ironical and

unjust position violates both human dignity and equal protection

under law.



27.          In support of the contentions noted hereinabove, and to

conclude the stance taken, learned counsel had placed reliance

upon the judgment passed by the Division Bench of this Court in

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. v. Ranjan Tak &

Anr., DB Civil Special Appeal (Writ) No. 953/2023, decided

on 29.11.2024, wherein in similar circumstances, the Court

directed appointment of a meritorious candidate with 30%

disability in recognition of their capabilities and in light of the

principles enshrined in the Act of 2016.




SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE COUNSEL REPRESENTING THE

RESPONDENTS :-



28.          Per contra, learned Additional Government Counsel

appearing for the respondent-State, has strenuously opposed the

reliefs sought in the writ petition and had raised the following legal

and factual contentions:



29.          Non-Claim       of      Reservation             under     Disability

Category: It was submitted that the petitioner had not, at any

stage, claimed consideration under the reserved category for

persons with disabilities and in the absence of such a claim, the

petitioner cannot subsequently assert any right to reservation

under the physically handicapped category. It is a well-settled

principle that rights flowing from a reserved category cannot be

extended to a candidate who has not claimed such benefit at the

relevant time. The law does not permit retrospective accrual of




                     (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                      (15 of 31)                      [CW-4343/2001]


such benefit where no foundational claim has been made in the

application or during the selection process.



30.          Medical Ineligibility and Supremacy of Medical

Board Opinion: It was further contended that, in accordance with

the prevailing rules and the medical guidelines operative at the

relevant time, the petitioner was declared medically unfit and

unsuitable for the RAS cadre on a recurring basis by the duly

constituted Medical Board. As per Rules 19 and 20 of the

Rajasthan        State         and        Subordinate             Services   (Direct

Recruitment          by     Combined             Competitive          Examinations)

Rules, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules of 1999),

fitness as determined by the Medical Board is a mandatory

eligibility criterion. The petitioner, being declared unfit, does not

possess any vested right to seek appointment in the RAS cadre.

Moreover, the consistent view of the Hon'ble Supreme Court is

that the opinion of the Medical Board must be accorded primacy in

service matters concerning physical fitness. 
In support of the

contentions     noted hereinabove, learned counsel had placed

reliance upon the ratio encapsulated in No.14666828M Ex CNF

Court at Principal Seat, Jodhpur, vide order dated 31.08.2024,

along with other connected appeals.



31.          Doctrine of Estoppel and Acquiescence: It was

further submitted that, in view of the petitioner's medical

ineligibility, the respondent-State, in exercise of its discretionary

powers, considered the case of the petitioner with sensitivity and

granted him appointment in the Rajasthan Accounts Service on

humanitarian grounds. The petitioner, having accepted such

appointment without protest or demur, is now estopped from

challenging the said appointment. The doctrine of estoppel by

conduct and the principle of acquiescence bar the petitioner from

seeking any alternate appointment or claiming elevation to the

RAS cadre.



32.          Qua the issue of non-Challenge to Rules and Guidelines

learned counsel had pointed out that the petitioner had neither

challenged the validity of the guidelines of the year 1975 nor the

relevant rules and guidelines that govern recruitment and fitness

for appointment. In the absence of such a challenge, the

petitioner's    claim    remains        unsustainable          in   law.    Moreso,    a

statutory rule or government order carries the presumption of

legality and must be complied with unless declared ultra vires by a

competent court. It was further submitted that, as clarified

through the affidavits of the Chief Secretary and the Principal

Secretary,     the   reservation        or     selection       of   candidates      with

disabilities for RAS and IAS services began only during the period

2005-2007. Prior to that, no such reservation existed. Despite

this, the petitioner was favorably considered and accommodated


                        (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                   (17 of 31)                        [CW-4343/2001]


based    on    his   meritorious       record      and      positive   performance

feedback, demonstrating the State's leniency and empathetic

approach.      However,     such      a    one-time        exception    cannot    be

converted into a precedent or a matter of right. Therefore, it can

be inferred that no vested right to employment in a particular

cadre is created by the appointment so granted to the petitioner in

the Rajasthan Account Service cadre.



33.           Lastly, it was argued that employment in a particular

cadre or service, especially in posts such as RAS, is not a matter

of right but subject to fulfilling statutory criteria, including medical

fitness. The discretionary power exercised by the State in offering

alternate suitable employment is within its domain and cannot be

converted into an enforceable legal right by the petitioner.


34.           In view of the aforementioned submissions, learned

Additional Government Counsel has prayed for the dismissal of the

writ petition, stating that no case is made out for judicial

interference. The action of the respondent-State is well within the

bounds of law, reason, and administrative discretion.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS :-



35.           Having heard the rival arguments advanced by the

learned counsel for both the parties, upon a perusal of the

material available on record, more specifically the erstwhile ACRs

of the petitioner, scanning the judgments cited at the Bar and

juxtaposing the contentions noted herein above, this Court at the

outset is of the view that the Indian Constitution enshrines

justice -- social, economic, and political -- as a core ideal of

the Preamble. India's model of governance is that of a welfare


                       (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                  (18 of 31)                           [CW-4343/2001]


state, where the State bears a solemn duty to protect the

interests of its vulnerable and marginalized populations. 
Article 41


as enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy, of the

Constitution of India further obligates the State to secure "the

right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of

unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement." In this

context, the Act of 2016, is a manifestation of India's commitment

to equality and dignity for all persons with disabilities. It mandates

non-discrimination     in    employment            (
Section       20
),    reasonable

accommodation, and reservation in government posts.


36.          Yet in the matter in hand, the petitioner despite being

meritorious, qualified, and aspiring was denied consideration for a

RAS cadre services not because he is able, but because his

disability is not "sufficiently severe" to meet the technical

threshold for reservation. Thus, he is excluded from both the

general category, due to functional limitations, and from the

reserved category, due to not meeting the 40% disability

threshold. This leads to a tragic administrative blind spot, a form

of constructive exclusion wherein, the petitioner is neither "abled"

nor "disabled enough" to benefit from the system. The legal

framework,       intended     to     be     inclusive,        becomes       ironically

exclusionary. Hence the grief behind the statement: "I wish I had

been more disabled." It is not a rejection of self, but a damning

critique of a system that values percentage points over real

barriers, and checkboxes over capability. It calls into question

whether the State is truly seeing its citizens, or merely scanning

them for conformity to pre-set categories under the garb of

empathy and consideration.



37.          Consequentially, it is apposite to jot down certain

undisputed facts of the present petitions:



37.1         That it is an admitted position that the petitioner

suffers    from      low     vision     and      is   diagnosed        with     Congenital

Nystagmus.



37.2         That the medical records dated 14 th March, 2001, 31st

July, 2001, 1st December, 2005, and 6th January, 2006 including

the re-examination and re-medical assessments, consistently

conclude that the petitioner is "unfit for RAS, allied services due to

defective vision." However, no satisfactory justification of rationale

behind the said opinion is noted by the concerned experts.

37.3         That the petitioner had successfully qualified all stages

of the Rajasthan Administrative Services Examination conducted in

the year 1999 and was placed at 360 th position in the overall merit

list. Subsequently, in the RAS Examinations held in the years 2001

and 2003, the petitioner once again qualified all stages and

secured a significantly improved 21st rank in the merit list. The

petitioner, in both the Rajasthan Administrative Services (RAS)

Examinations conducted in the years 1999 and 2003, had

appeared under the 'general category' and not under any reserved

category, despite being eligible for Other Backward Classes (OBC)

reservation and having a known medical condition of low vision.


Notably,    the      petitioner       successfully        secured      360 th    and    21st

positions in the final merit list, respectively, which reflects his

academic and competitive merit beyond any reservation benefit.


                           (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                    (20 of 31)                         [CW-4343/2001]


37.4         That one Ms. Prabha Gautam, who secured the 22 nd

rank in the said merit list, was appointed to the RAS cadre service.

In contrast, the petitioner, despite attaining the 21 st rank, was

initially excluded from appointment by an order dated 21.04.2006.

However, upon consideration of the petitioner's representation and

pursuant to directions issued by the office of the Hon'ble Chief

Minister,   the      petitioner    was      subsequently            allocated   to   the

Rajasthan Accounts Service on 22.04.2006. The relevant extract

from the reply to the petitioner's representation is reiterated

37.5          It is an admitted position, as per the affidavit filed by

the Chief Secretary, that upon due consideration and exercise of

discretion by the State Government, and notwithstanding the

petitioner's medical condition of low vision, he was found fit for

appointment to the Rajasthan Accounts Service. Accordingly, in

the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner

was permitted to join service, reflecting a conscious and reasoned

decision by the competent authority.



37.6          This Court further observes that at no point did the

petitioner apply under or seek the benefit of the physically

handicapped category, nor did he claim any reservation in the

selection process. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius -- the

express mention of one category (general) implies the exclusion of





                         (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                  (23 of 31)                           [CW-4343/2001]


the other (reserved), thereby confirming that the petitioner sought

consideration solely on merit.



38.          It is also pertinent to note that the petitioner does not

fall within the definition of a person with "benchmark disability" as

contemplated under the applicable legal framework, being below

the   40%      threshold.    The      Commissioner            for   Disabilities,   in

categorical terms, recorded a finding that the petitioner does not

possess a benchmark disability. Contrarily, the medical boards,

consistently from the year 1999 through 2006, opined that the

petitioner was unfit for the Rajasthan Administrative Services and

allied services, on account of his visual impairment. This apparent

contradiction between administrative and medical determinations

calls for the application of the principle audi alteram partem i.e.

the right to be heard as well as a harmonized interpretation of

medical incapacity and administrative discretion; however, in the

matter in hand the plea of the petitioner was not considered by

the medical board within the stipulated period, moreover, the

petitioner had to move from pillars to pole to attain the said

medical opinion.



39.          Notwithstanding the adverse medical opinions, the

petitioner's    professional     record,        as   reflected      in   his   Annual

Confidential     Reports    (ACRs),        is    found       to     be   consistently

exemplary. The petitioner is rated as either "outstanding" or "very

good" in all relevant service periods. No adverse, stigmatic, or

derogatory remarks appear on record. This Court at this nascent

juncture deems it appropriate the rely on the principle of Res ipsa

loquitur i.e. the thing speaks for itself, and is of the opinion that


                      (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                   (24 of 31)                                [CW-4343/2001]


the     petitioner's   service       record       speaks           to    his     efficiency,

competence, and contribution, which has proven to be an asset to

the State across various departments, corporations, and postings.


40.          The petitioner's ACRs, academic records, and service

credentials indicate consistent excellence, as reflected by ratings

of "Outstanding" and "Very Good." In terms of Rules 19 and 20 of

the Rajasthan State and Subordinate Services (Direct Recruitment

by Combined Competitive Examination) Rules, 1999, the State

Government is vested with discretionary authority to grant

appointments. While such discretion is not a vested right in favour

of the petitioner, once the government itself, through its highest

executive offices, namely the Hon'ble Chief Minister and Chief

Secretary, has exercised this discretion in the petitioner's favour

for Rajasthan Accounts Services, the subsequent exclusion from

RAS cadre appears to be not only arbitrary, but also discriminatory

and violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India.


41.          Upon perusal of the Guidelines of 1975 pertaining to

medical fitness and classification of services, it is noted that the

said guidelines divide governmental services into two broad

categories: technical and non-technical. Technical services include

posts      requiring   specialized         physical        standards,             such    as

engineering, medical, and certain Group 'B' services. In contrast,

non-technical services, such as, the Rajasthan Administrative

Services, Rajasthan Accounts Services, and analogous posts, are

not predicated upon stringent physical fitness criteria. The

Guidelines explicitly recognize that individuals with diminished

physical     capabilities,    including       low      vision,          are    capable    of


                       (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                    (25 of 31)                         [CW-4343/2001]


discharging duties effectively in non-technical services. Thus,

where no essential physical prerequisites exist, exclusion solely on

medical grounds, in absence of statutory bar or functional

incapacity, may amount to arbitrariness.



42.          Upon a comprehensive reading of the Guidelines of

1975 relating to medical assessment for government services, this

Court finds no material distinction between the functional nature

or service requirements of the Rajasthan Administrative Service

and the Rajasthan Accounts Service. Both are classified as "non-

technical services" and are not contingent upon heightened

physical standards. Thus, any differentiation in treatment between

these two cadres, on the ground of medical unfitness due to low

vision, appears to be bereft of any rational basis and is

inconsistent     with    the     object      of    the     said     guidelines.   Such

differential treatment without intelligible differentia violates the

test laid down in the ratio of 
E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil

Nadu
: (1974) 4 SCC 3.




43.          Moreover, in the ratio encapsulated in Oil and Natural

Gas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (Supra), the Division Bench

categorically held that individuals falling in the intermediate

category i.e., those with less than 40% disability but more than

negligible impairment ought not to be excluded from consideration

merely on the ground of not possessing a benchmark disability.

The Division Bench, while construing 
Sections 2(h)
, 
2(r)
, 
2(s)
, and


3
 of the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities Act, 2016
 (hereinafter

referred to as the Act of 2016), held that:





                        (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)


 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                   (26 of 31)                      [CW-4343/2001]


43.1         The term "discrimination" under 
Section 2(h)
 includes

denial of reasonable accommodation;

43.2         The principles of "equality" and "non-discrimination"


enshrined in 
Section 3
 mandate that individuals with disabilities be

treated with parity;



43.3         The definitions of "person with benchmark disability"


under 
Section 2(r)
 and "person with disability" under 
Section 2(s)


must be interpreted harmoniously to avoid exclusion of those with

less than 40% disability from the purview of equal opportunity.


44.     The Division Bench held that if persons with benchmark

disabilities are granted reservation and appointment, the exclusion

of those with a lesser degree of disability who are otherwise

meritorious, from the appointment, on grounds of medical

unfitness, would defeat the legislative intent and spirit of the Act

of 2016. It was poignantly observed that such a person cannot be

left to ponder, "Why was I not more disabled, so as to qualify for

consideration?" Such an interpretation would be contrary to

international human rights instruments, including the principles of

the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons

with    Disabilities      (UNCRPD),            2007,        The    Persons   with


Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and

Full Participation) Act, 1995
 and antithetical to the objectives

of the Act of 2016. The relevant extract from the dictum passed

by the Division Bench is reproduced herein below:


      "25. While dealing with persons with disabilities, a
      public functionary is required to act with higher degree
      of sensitivity, objectivity and in furtherance, not only
      laws, but also the spirit of the Act of 2016. Equality of
      treatment is not merely a statutory right, but a


                       (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                 (27 of 31)                    [CW-4343/2001]


      fundamental right which is at stake in the present case.
      Denial of such right not only violates the Constitution
      or Statue, but also the basic human right of specially
      abled persons to live with dignity. Learned Single Judge
      rightly observed that the treatment meted out to
      Respondent No. 1 amounts to rubbing salt to such
      injury by denying Respondent No.1 his legitimate and
      legal right and make him think the worst that the ball
      should have caused 10% more injury so that his merit
      would not be trampled upon and he could get
      appointment at least against the reserved posts. We
      would add by saying that denial of appointment to
      Respondent No. 1 has added insult to injury which
      must be deprecated.

             That is the reason why in the beginning of our
      judgment, we have observed that it is the attitudinal
      barrier which is the matter of concern. 
Section 2
,
      clause (c) of the Act of 2016, in that context, defines
      the word, 'barrier' as below:

        "2. Definitions.--In this Act, unless the context
        otherwise requires,--

        (a) ........

        (b) .......

        (c) "barrier" means any factor including
        communicational,             cultural,       economic,
        environmental,        institutional, political, social,

        attitudinal or structural factors which hampers the
        full and effective participation of persons with
        disabilities in society;"



       26. We hope and trust that the appellants while
       dealing with persons with disabilities will act free from
       such barrier which hampers the full and effective
       participation of the persons with disabilities in the
       society. We are also of the view that present is a fit
       case where cost should be imposed upon the
       appellants."





45.          The petitioner has rendered over two decades of

exemplary service in non-technical roles, where his disability did

not hinder performance. The respondents' claim of his unsuitability

for field posts is negated by the record of consistent high

performance, thus undermining the rationale for denial of RAS

cadre. Therefore, the maxim actus curiae neminem gravabit (an





                     (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                 (28 of 31)                    [CW-4343/2001]


act of the court shall prejudice no one) must apply to ensure the

petitioner's rights are not defeated by executive inconsistency.


46.          It is also noted that persons possessing benchmark

disabilities have, since the year 2005 up to 2007, been appointed

to high-ranking posts within the Indian Administrative Service

(IAS) and Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS). The petitioner

has submitted a list of 26 such instances (Reiterated in order

dated 22.01.2025), of which at least five appointments were

expressly acknowledged by the State in the affidavit filed by the

learned Chief Secretary. The only contention raised by the State is

that, during the relevant time, statutory provisions did not

explicitly permit such appointments. Notwithstanding this position,

the State adopted a sympathetic approach by offering the

petitioner an appointment in the Rajasthan Accounts Service,

albeit while declining his claim to the RAS, citing alleged non-

performance in field postings as recorded in the departmental

order-sheet.



47.          This Court finds that such selective reliance on medical

assessment and selective exclusion from a particular cadre,

despite meritorious performance and subsequent acknowledgment

of capability in another cadre, warrants judicial scrutiny under the

principles of reasonable classification and substantive equality

enshrined under 
Article 14
 of the Constitution of India.


48.          The Court, invoking the UNCRPD, 2007 principles and

the provisions of the Act of 2016, observes that the law recognizes

two distinct categories:



      (I) Persons with benchmark disabilities (≥40%)


                     (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                       (29 of 31)                           [CW-4343/2001]


      (II) Persons with disabilities (<40%)

      The interpretation, as herein drawn by the respondents, that

denies a person with lesser disability from appointment on medical

grounds, while accommodating a more disabled person under the

reservation category, is a paradoxical injustice and contrary to the

doctrine of proportional equality as enshrined under 
Articles 14
,

16
, and 
21
 of the Constitution of India. Such interpretation

frustrates the legislative intent and compels a person to lament

that they were not more disabled.



49.          The reasoning adopted in the government's internal

notes that the petitioner is fit for Rajasthan Accounts Service but

not   for   RAS,      is      fundamentally           flawed       and    based      on   a

misinterpretation of the applicable guidelines. The record shows

that from 2005 to 2007 and earlier, candidates with benchmark

disabilities were appointed to IAS and RAS posts. Thus, the denial

to the petitioner who stands higher on merit and without a claim

for reservation is arbitrary, illusory, and contrary to judicial

precedents      and    the        constitutional         mandate         of    substantive

equality; especially when once the petitioner was adjudged fit for

Rajasthan Accounts Service, and the Guidelines of 1975 treat both

cadres similarly, a contrary view for RAS cannot sustain judicial

scrutiny. The respondents' selective application of the rules

offends the principle of non-arbitrariness.



50.          
The Constitution of India and the Act
 of 2016 provide a

level playing field for differently-abled persons. When a candidate

placed 21st in merit, with outstanding service records, gold

medals, and commendable publications, is denied a rightful post


                           (Downloaded on 26/04/2025 at 01:15:42 AM)

 [2025:RJ-JP:16526]                        (30 of 31)                       [CW-4343/2001]


solely due to lesser disability, it constitutes a direct affront to


Article 14
 and amounts to per iniquitatem jus non oritur i.e. a

right does not arise from injustice. The Division Bench in Oil and

Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. & Anr. (Supra) emphasized the

need for sensitive and inclusive governance. Equal treatment and

effective participation of specially-abled persons is a constitutional

obligation, and their dignity must not be compromised by flawed

interpretations.



51.            The contention of principles of acquiescence or estoppel

on the ground of the petitioner's joining Rajasthan Accounts

Service       is    unsustainable.         The     petitioner        has   consistently

challenged the denial of his candidature for services of RAS cadre,

as evident from his filings in 2001 and 2006. Thus, the doctrine of

approbate and reprobate does not apply.



CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS :-



52.            In view of the foregoing observations and analysis, this

Court finds the rejection of the petitioner's candidature for the

RAS         cadre     services       is       arbitrary,       discriminatory,      and

unconstitutional, warranting judicial intervention under 
Article 226


of    the    Constitution      of    India.       Thence,      the    decision    dated

05.07.2001 holding the petitioner to be unfit for Rajasthan

Administrative Services and allied services due to defective vision

is hereby quashed and set aside.



53.            Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the

respondents are directed to:



53.1           Grant the petitioner appointment w.e.f. 21.04.2006 i.e.

the date on which the next candidate in merit, Ms. Prabha Gautam

                                   (Rank 22), was appointed in the RAS cadre service in the

                                   consequential benefits, including arrears, seniority, promotions

                                   and pensionary advantages;



                                   53.2           Include notional calculation for pension and other

                                   service-related benefits from the date of filing of the first petition

                                   in 2001, considering that by way of interim order dated

                                   03.09.2001, granted in SB Civil Writ Petition No.4343/2001, one

                                   post was directed to be kept vacant for the petitioner.

                                   53.4           This Court further directs that, in recognition of the

                                   undue      hardships,     humiliation         and      prolonged        discrimination

                                   endured by the petitioner, he be compensated with ₹5,00,000/-


                                   (Rupees Five Lakhs Only), to be paid by the respondent-State.


                                   54.            In a symbolic gesture of institutional redressal and

                                   acknowledgment of merit, the petitioner shall be formally granted

                                   RAS cadre appointment in the presence of the Chief Secretary of

                                   the State, reflecting a progressive and sensitive governance ethos

                                   toward differently-abled citizens.



                                   55.            The above directions shall be implemented within a

                                   period of one month from the date of pronouncement of this

                                   judgment.



                                   56.            With   these     directions,        these     writ     petitions   stand

                                   allowed. Stay application and/or pending applications, if any, shall

                                   stand disposed of.
