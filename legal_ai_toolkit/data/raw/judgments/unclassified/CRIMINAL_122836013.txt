     C.R.No.         25/2016        registered       with      Gadh         Police

2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to this application
     are that, the second respondent - Mahendra Panchal,
     resident        of     Mumbai          is     brother      of      deceased
     Hasmukhbhai, who ended his life by committing
     suicide at his village Gadalvada, Dist. Banaskantha.
     The deceased was driving a rickshaw for his livelihood.
     The deceased had borrowed Rs.6 lacs from accused
     Nos.1 to 10 and was paying unbearable amount of
     interest. It is the case of the prosecution that the
     deceased could not repay the principal amount as well
     as the interest, as a result, he was under tremendous
     pressure and distress. Before he could commit suicide,
     he wrote a letter addressed to PSI, Gadh Police Station,
     mentioning therein the harassment meted out to him
     by the accused, on the issue of borrowed money. In the
     letter, he mentioned names of 10 persons including the
     applicants, alleging therein that after borrowing the
     money from them, he could not repay the same and
     upon his request to give some time to repay the
     amount,         they    have     not        extended    the      time       and

     threatened him to take away his rickshaw and did not
     allow him to do his business. He had further mentioned
     in the letter that he is going to end his life by
     committing suicide and all the persons mentioned in
     the letter are responsible for my suicide. In this
     circumstance,        on       19.04.2016,          the        deceased
     Hasmukhbhai had consumed poisonous substance and
     committed suicide. Before he could die, he was taken to
     Palanpur Civil Hospital where his statement in form of
     dying declaration was recorded by the Executive
     Magistrate, Palanpur, wherein, he disclosed the facts of
     borrowed money allegedly taken from persons named in
     the statement. The names of the present applicants
     having not been disclosed as the deceased while
     recording the statement did not recollect their names.
     The      investigating    officer     had   also     recorded           the
     statement of the deceased on the same day under
     
Section 161
 of the Cr.P.C., wherein, the reasons for his
     suicide having been disclosed before the police and
     subsequently, he died at Civil Hospital. The brother of
     the deceased Mr. Mahendra Panchal went to hospital
     and he was appraised by the relatives about the
     financial distress of the deceased and factum of suicide
     note and dying declaration. The second respondent
     based on the input gathered by him at the hospital,
     lodged an FIR against 10 persons, including the
     applicants herein for the offences as referred above.
     After completion of investigation of the case, the IO filed

     a chargesheet against the accused for the aforesaid
     offences, which has been culminated into Sessions
     Case      No.78/2022,         which          is   pending      before        the
     jurisdictional sessions Court at Banaskantha.



3. The applicants arraigned as accused Nos. 8 and 9 in
     the chargesheet. They have preferred present quashing
     petition mainly on the ground that the charge against
     them under 
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code is not
     sustainable. Therefore, continuation of the proceedings
     against them is nothing, but a sheer abuse of process
     of law and Court.



4. Mr. Tejas Barot, learned counsel appearing for the
     applicants on instructions does not press this petition
     qua the offences punishable under 
Sections 506 (2)
,
     
384
,

,

,

 of Indian Penal Code and

     confined to this petition so far offence under Section
     306 read with 
Section 34
 of Indian Penal Code is
     concerned. The petition stands dismissed qua the
     aforesaid offences except Section 306 read with 
Section
     34
 of Indian Penal Code.



5. This Court has heard Mr. Tejas Barot, learned counsel
     for    the      applicants,     Mr.      K.P.Champaneri,              learned
     counsel for the original informant and Ms. Vrunda

6. Mr.       Tejas   Barot,   the    counsel   appearing         for     the
     applicants submitted that the FIR lacks the ingredients
     of the offences alleged, more particularly 
section 306
 of
     Indian Penal Code; that, the facts and circumstances of
     the case do not, in any way, indicate that the alleged
     act would constitute abetment to commit suicide; that
     there is complete absence of any sort of instigation or
     any positive move on the part of the applicants, causing
     the deceased to commit suicide; that the ingredients of
     abetment as laid down in 
Section 107
 of Indian Penal
     Code is completely absent in this case and as such,
     
section 306
 of Indian Penal Code is not at all attracted;
     that a bare reading of the suicide note and facts
     disclosed in dying declaration does not itself amount to
     instigation and also does not reflect mens rea on the
     part of the applicants which is necessary concomitant
     of investigation (Sanju @ Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State
     of M.P., AIR 1998 SC 2002); that there was no material
     to suggest that there was intention on the part of the
     applicants to provoke incite or encourage the deceased
     in committing the suicide and therefore, in absence of
     any material with respect of the charge of abetment of
     suicide, merely allegations of harassment disclosed in
     the suicide note and dying declaration are not sufficient
     to draw inference that the accused have abetted in the
     commission of suicide.

 R/CR.MA/11161/2016                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023





7. 
In support of the aforesaid contentions, reliance has
     been placed on the judgment of the Apex Court in
     
M.Arjun Vs. State
 represented by its Inspector of Police
     (2019) 3 SCC 315, to contend that having advanced
     money to the deceased by applicant accused might
     have occurred dispute with regard to repayment of
     money, but that by itself is not sufficient to constitute
     offence under 
Sec. 306
 of Indian Penal Code as there
     should be evidence capable of suggesting that the
     accused intended by such acts to instigate deceased to
     commit suicide.




8. In the aforesaid contentions submitted by learned
     counsel for the applicant Mr. Barot, he thus urged that
     the FIR so far as charge under Section 306 is
     concerned having been filed with ulterior motive and to
     harass the applicants and when prima facie no case is
     made out against the accused for the alleged offence,
     then the continuation of trial proceedings would
     unnecessarily harassment to the applicants which
     amount to abuse of process of law and Court and
     therefore, he prayed that the case is made out to
     exercise inherent powers to quash the FIR and
     consequential proceedings therefrom.



9. On the other hand, countering to the contentions
     raised          by   the   applicant,       learned      counsel          Mr.

 R/CR.MA/11161/2016                                    JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023




     K.P.Chanpaneri and State counsel Ms. Vrunda Shah
     submitted that, after registration of FIR, the IO
     recovered the material evidence like suicide note, dying
     declaration      of   the   deceased       and     considering            the
     sufficient evidence for the commission of alleged
     offence, the I.O filed a chargesheet for the offences as
     
referred above
. Thus, at this stage it cannot be said
     that no prima facie case is made out against the
     applicant;      that the criminal proceedings cannot be
     quashed where the allegations made in the FIR and
     chargesheet disclosed the commission of offence; that
     the High Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Section
     482 is required to be examined whether the averments
     made       in   the   FIR   and       chargesheet        case       papers
     constitute the ingredients necessary for an offence
     alleged under 
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code; that in
     the present case, the allegations as they stand make
     out an offence within the meaning of 
Section 306
 of
     Indian Penal Code; that the deceased was under

     tremendous stress of the pressure of the accused and it
     was to the extent that they tried to take away his
     rickshaw and restrained to do his livelihood work that
     is what mentioned in the suicide note by the deceased;
     that this is not a stage where the minutes and
     meticulous exercise with regard to appreciation of
     evidence may be done. Thus, therefore, it was urged
     that at this stage the High Court is not justified in
     embarking upon an inquiry as to the probability,



                                 Page 7 of 15


                                                          Downloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023

  R/CR.MA/11161/2016                         JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023




      reliability or genuineness of the allegations made
      therein and same is required to be considered at the
      stage of trial.



10. 
In support of the aforesaid contentions, reliance has
      been placed by Mr. Champaneri on the judgment of the
      Apex Court rendered in 
Pravin Pradhan Vs. State of
      Uttaranchal
 [(2012) 9 SCC 734], to contend that an
      accused by continuing course of these conduct creates
      such circumstances that the deceased was left with no
      other option, but to commit suicide which would satisfy
      the ingredients of instigation to commit suicide.




11. In the aforesaid contentions, learned counsel for the
      complainant Mr. Champaneri and State Counsel Ms.
      Shah submitted that the inherent powers vest with the
      High Court do not confer jurisdiction to act according
      to whim and caprice and the same is exercised
      sparingly with circumspection and in the rarest of rare
      cases. Thus, therefore, it was submitted that no
      exceptional case is made out to exercise inherent
      powers of this Court to quash the criminal proceedings
      and the application is liable to be dismissed.



12. The applicants herein have been charged for the act of
      abetment of suicide and other provisions as referred in
      para 1 of this judgment. It is the case of the
      prosecution that, deceased had borrowed money for
      personal use from different persons as referred in the

      suicide note and statement of the deceased in form of
      dying declaration. The complainant who happens to be
      a brother of the deceased having no any personal
      knowledge            with      respect          to    alleged          financial
      transactions. He has lodged the FIR based on the
      factum of suicide note and dying declaration. In such
      circumstances, the issue falls for determination of this
      Court           is   whether       the      FIR      and      consequential
      proceedings are liable to be quashed in exercise of
      extraordinary and inherent jurisdiction.



13. It is settled law that the High Courts are clothed with
      inherent powers to make such orders as may be
      necessary for the ends of justice. Such power though
      unrestricted and undefined should not be capriciously
      or arbitrarily exercised but should be exercised in
      appropriate cases, ex debito justitiae to do real and
      substantial justice for administration of which alone
      the court exists as the powers possess by the High
      Court under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and
      very plantitude which requires great caution in exercise
      and      same        has    to     be      exercised       sparingly          with
      circumspection and in the rarest of rare case. 
In the
      case of 
V.P.Srivastava Vs. Indian Explosives Ltd
.


      2010 (10) SCC 361, the Apex Court while dealing with
      the issue of quashing and inherent powers of the High
      Court, held that where no prima facie case is made out,
      involving the applicant accused in the alleged offence,



                                       Page 9 of 15


                                                                 Downloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023

      then the High Court is obliged in law to exercise the
      jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code.



14. Reverting back to the facts of the present case, names
      of the applicants disclosed by the deceased in his
      suicide note and further their names had not been
      disclosed in the statement of the deceased recorded in
      form of dying declaration as he could not recollect their
      names. The charge against the applicants is under
      
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code for the offence of
      abetment of suicide. To bring home the accused for the
      charge under Section 306, the prosecution has to prove

      (i) the deceased committed suicide (ii) the accused
      instigated or abetted for committing suicide and (iii)
      direct involvement by the accused in such abetment or
      instigation is necessary. 
Section 107
 of Indian Penal
      Code defines abetment as comprising (a) instigation to
      commit the offence (b) engaging in conspiracy to
      commit the offence and (c) aiding the commission of
      offence. The scope and ambit of Section 107 and its co-
      relation with 
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code has
      been settled by catena of decisions of the Apex Court.
      
In 
Kishori Lal Vs. State of M.P.
, 2007 (10) SCC 797,
      the two judge Bench of the Apex Court in para 6, while
      defining the abetment of things held as under:-


                  "Section107IPC defines abetment of a thing. The
                  offence of abetment is a separate and distinct offence
                  provided in the Act as an offence. A person, abets the
                  doing of a thing when (1) he instigates any person to
                  do that thing; or (2) engages with one or more other

                  persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing;
                  or (3) intentionally aids, by act or illegal omission, the
                  doing of that thing. These things are essential to
                  complete abetment as a crime. The word "instigate"

                  literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring
                  about by persuasion to do any thing. The abetment
                  may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid,
                  as provided in the three clauses of Section

                  107. Section 109provides that if the act abetted is
                  committed in consequence of abetment and there is
                  no provision for the punishment of such abetment,
                  then the offender is to be punished with the
                  punishment provided for the original offence.
                  'Abetted' in Section 109 means the specific offence
                  abetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of
                  which a person is charged with the abetment is
                  normally linked with the proved offence."



15. 
In 
M. Mohan Vs. State
 2011 (3) SCC 626, the Apex
      Court while dealing with the abetment, in para 44 and
      45 observed thus:-




               "45. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a
               person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a
               thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to
               instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot
               be sustained.



               46. The intention of the Legislature and the ratio of the
               cases decided by this court are clear that in order to
               convict a person under 
section 306
 IPC there has to be a
               clear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an
               active act or direct act which led the deceased to commit
               suicide seeing no option and this act must have been
               intended to push the deceased into such a position that
               he/she committed suicide."



16. In the facts of the present case, it emerges that the
      deceased borrowed a total amount of Rs.6 lacs from 10
      persons. In the suicide note, on which date and what

 R/CR.MA/11161/2016                                       JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023




     amount the applicants herein had lent having not been
     disclosed by the deceased. Even in dying declaration as
     well as the statement recorded under 
Section 161
 of
     Cr.P.C., there is no specific disclosure that how much
     amount and on which date, the applicants had lent the
     money to the deceased. The allegations of harassment
     and preventing the deceased in doing his business of
     rickshaw driving seem to be general in nature and
     vague.          No   specific    allegations       made      against         the
     applicants that they individually subjected mental
     harassment on the issue of finance advanced by them.
     In such circumstances, prima facie it appears that the
     deceased was in depression as he could not repay the
     handy loan obtained from various persons, as a result,
     he decided to end his life and accordingly, he
     committed            a   suicide        by      consuming        poisonous
     substance. Thus, considering the factual aspects as
     discussed above and in light of legal proposition on the
     issue of "abetment of suicide", this Court is of
     considered opinion that a casual remark that is likely
     to cause harassment in ordinary course of thing, made
     against the applicants would not fall within the term
     "instigation". Thus, the contents of the suicide note and
     the statement of the deceased, prima facie does not
     anyway disclosed any incriminating information in the
     nature of instigation, provocation, compelling the
     deceased to commit suicide. If we read the entire
     chargesheet case papers, this Court does not find live

      link or proximity link between the act of accused and
      act of committing suicide as nothing specifically
      disclosed by the deceased that how much amount the
      accused have lent him or how and on which date, they
      threatened him and restrained him in doing his
      business of rickshaw driving. In such circumstances,
      what role they had played in the act of instigation and
      how they aided the deceased to commit suicide, having
      not been established.



17. The contention of the first informant that the facts
      disclosed in the suicide note and material collected
      during the course of investigation would suggest that
      deceased had no option and was frustrated by the
      continuous act of instigation allegedly done by the
      accused and therefore, prima facie the offence under
      Section 306 is made out against the accused and in
      support of his submission, reliance has been placed on
      the decision of the Apex Court in 
Pravin Pradhan

      (supra).
 
This Court is of considered view that the
      suicide note referred in the case of 
Pravin Pradhan

      (supra) and considering the peculiar facts of the cited
      case, the Apex Court was of the view that the prima
      facie case is made out against the accused.
 
The facts of
      the present case are totally on different footing and the
      facts of suicide note are also totally different to the case
      of    
Pravin    Pradhan
     (supra).      Thus,    cited      case       is
      distinguisable on factual aspects and the same is not

  R/CR.MA/11161/2016                         JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023




      applicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore,
      this Court is of considered view that when there is no
      prima facie case made out for the offence under 
Section
      306
 of Indian Penal Code, then continuation of
      proceedings would amount to harassment to the
      applicants and abuse of process of law and Court. In
      such circumstances, the contention raised by the
      counsel for the original informant cannot be accepted.




18. In the foregoing reasons, this Court is of prima facie
      view that this Court is unable to find anything in the
      FIR or chargesheet case papers which could suggest
      that the applicants had instigated the deceased to
      commit a suicide. This court is in total agreement with
      the contentions raised by learned counsel for the
      applicants that lending money and asking it to back
      would not be a ground to hold the applicants
      responsible for instigation or aiding to the deceased to
      commit suicide as mere allegations of harassment
      without there being any positive act or criminal intent
      on the part of the applicants. In such circumstances,
      considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the
      present case, if the allegations for the charge of offence
      under 
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code are accepted as
      it is, do not prima facie constitute an offence under
      
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code against the applicants
      herein.

19. Hence, this is a fit case to exercise inherent power to
       quash the proceedings of FIR and other consequential
       proceedings thereof, so far as offences under 
Section
       306
 and 
34
 of Indian Penal Code are concerned. 
In the
       case of 
Ishwarpratap Singh Vs. State of Uttar
       Pradesh
, [2018 (13) SCC 612], the Apex Court held
       that there is no prohibition under the law for quashing
       the chargesheet in part. The jurisdictional Court
       concerned shall proceed further so far other offences
       registered against the applicants as referred in para 1
       of this judgment in accordance with law.




20. Accordingly, present application is partly allowed. FIR
       being I-C.R.No. 25/2016 registered with Gadh Police
       Station, Dist: Banaskantha and other consequential
       proceedings arising therefrom only for the offences
       under Sections 306 read with 34 of 
Indian Penal Code
,
       are quashed qua the applicants herein. Rule is made
       absolute to the aforesaid extent.
