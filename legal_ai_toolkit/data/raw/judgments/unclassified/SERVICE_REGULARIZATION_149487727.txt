                                       FACTS IN BRIEF



        3.     Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by the applicant in the instant OA are
        that husband of applicant late Shri Kameshwar Singh was initially appointed as
        Causal Labour in Patna GPO in year 1994. Thereafter, he was granted
        temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997 vide order dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A/3)
        with all benefits of regular Group 'D' employee.

Patna
Bench

        4.     It is the case of the applicant that as per provision of grant of Temporary
        Status Scheme, 1993, a person, who had completed three years service as
        Temporary Status Casual Labour, would be treated at par with Group 'D'
        employee, therefore, husband of the applicant was informed vide memo dated
        07.02.1998 (Annexure A-3) that he had been granted temporary status at par
        with Group 'D' employee w.e.f. 27.04.1997.



        5.     The Directorate issued guidelines vide letter dated 11.12.2018 for
        promotion of TS Casual Labourers to the post of MTS on the basis of seniority-
        cum-fitness (Annexure A/2). As the husband of the applicant has been working
        as TS for a long period on Group 'D' sanctioned post and various vacancies of
        MTS were available in the department but the respondent authority promoted
        only one person as MTS from TS vide order dated 15.11.2022 (Annexure A/6)
        ignoring the claim of husband of the applicant. Aggrieved, husband of the
        applicant submitted representation dated 15.12.2022 to the respondents with a
        request to regularize his services after completion of three years qualifying
        service of T.S. as per rules/law.



        6.     The respondents did not respond to his representation, husband of the
        applicant filed OA No.119/2023 for redressal of his grievance. OA
        No.119/2023 was disposed of by this Tribunal vide order dated 23.02.2023
        (Annexure A/7) with a direction to the respondents to consider and decide
        pending representation of applicant's husband within six months. However, the

                                             3                  OA No. /050/00839/2023




        respondents did not regularize the services of husband of the applicant as per
        DoP&T 1993 Scheme and rejected his grievance vide Impugned Order dated
        28.09.2023 (Annexure A/1) in an illegal manner.



        7.     It is also stated in the OA that respondent-authority has granted
        temporary status to the applicant's husband vide Memo dated 07.02.1998 w.e.f.
        27.04.1997 and also had been granted status at par with Group 'D' employee
        w.e.f. 27.04.1997. Hence, husband of the applicant was entitled for
        regularization as Group 'D' employee after completion of three years of service
        but the same has been rejected by the respondents illegally vide Impugned
        Order dated 28.09.2023.



        8.     Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have filed
        written statement and stated that Shri Kameshwar Singh, (now deceased) was
Patna
Bench   selected as Seasonal Casual Labour on 01.07.1986 sponsored through
        employment exchange and thereafter he was engaged for 'Sprinkling Water' on
        Khus during summer season.



        9.     It is also the averments in the WS that subsequently, vide order dated
        25.04.1996, husband of applicant was treated as Casual Labour for all purposes
        henceforth. His service may be utilized as Casual Labour as and when required
        as per rules. He was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997. He was
        treated at par with temporary status Group 'D' employee from 27.04.2000 vide
        order dated 17.05.2000, after completion of three years of service in temporary
        status. It is further stated in the Written Statement that as husband of the
        applicant was appointed as seasonal casual labour at Patna |GP on 01.07.1986
        and after he was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997 vide Patna GPO
        letter dated 07.02.1998 per Department of Posts (Multi Tasking Staff)
        Recruitment Rules, 2018 in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, PART-II-
        Section 10 |iii)(b) "By appointment of Casual Labourers of the recruiting
        Division or Unit, engaged on or before 1st September, 1993." Therefore,
        keeping in view the above mentioned Recruitment Rules, it is clear that
        husband of the applicant is not eligible for promotion in MTS cadre.
        Admittedly, husband of the applicant was never regularized to the post of MTS,
        hence, applicant is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for in this OA.

                                           4                  OA No. /050/00839/2023

                        in Para 11 directed as under:-

                             " 11 The Temporary Status would be available to the casual
                             labourers in the Postal Department on completion of one year
                             continuous service with at least 240 days of work (2036 days
                             in the case of officers observing five days week) and on
                             conferment of temporary status, House Rent Allowance and
                             City Compensatory Allowance shall be admissible. There
                             would be no justification to withhold Maternity Leave as that
                             is an obligation of the employer under the law and the state as
                             an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State
                             Policy envisaged in Part-IV of the Constitution should
                             provide the same. After rendering three years of continuous
                             service with temporary status, the casual labouers shall be
                             treated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the
                             Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
                             benefits as are admissible to Group "D" employees on regular
                             basis."

                                                                        [Emphasis supplied]

                     (ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of Yashwant
                     Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in (1996) 7 SCC 113,
                     dealing with question for determination "whether appellant is entitled to
                     any pensionary benefits since total service of more than eighteen years
                     was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The Hon'ble Supreme Court has
                     held:-

                          "3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
                          the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the
                          appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of
                          quasi-permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was
                          necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.

                                  12                      OA No. /050/00839/2023


                It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was
            in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary
            benefits.

                There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was
            not made permanent even when he had served the Government for
            18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied
            the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a
            permanent employee of the government. The appellant having
            served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to
            treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.

                Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we
            hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent
            after he served the Government for such a long period. The services
            of the appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he
            shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set
            aside the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to
            treat the appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980
            after serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of
            permanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be
            finalized within six months from the receipt of this order. The
            appellant shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date
            of retirement.

Bench   (iii)   The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical facts
        and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain Singh,
        CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017. Their Lordships was
        seisin with similar issue as decided by Central Administrative Tribunal
        Bench, Patna in O.A. No. 900 of 2012 vide order dated 18.2.2016 The
        Union of India- Ministry of Communication, Department of Posts taken
        plea as before Tribunal that services of private respondents Temporary
        Status Casual Labour, was never regularized nor worked on a regular
        group 'D' post till his retirement. Therefore he is not entitled to pensioner
        benefits. Their Lordships in case of 
Kritnarain Singh
 (supra) affirmed
        view taken by this Tribunal in OA No. 900/2012 based on Hon'ble High
        Court Patna judgement dated 15.12.2015 in CWJC No. 17204/2015. So
        also their Lordships observed that Tribunal has taken correct view
        because in similar and identical circumstances the High Court held in
        favour of an employee and that judgment stands and holds the field and
        writ application dismissed.


                                                              [Emphasis supplied]

 
(iv)    The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical case in
        facts and legal issue in case of 
Union of India versus Smt Ram Kali
        Devi, CWJC No.
 11435 of 2017 decided on 11.9.2017. Their Lordships
        were seisin with similar issue as involved in the present case. The Union
        of India, Department of Posts had challenged order dated 22.3.2017
        passed in O.A. No. 664/2015 (Patna) by this Tribunal to pay family
        pension, retiral dues to widow of deceased employee.




                 Their Lordships observed that husband of petitioner granted
        temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992 and he
        died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more than 25 years
        of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in temporary status begets
        the benefits of pension. Failure on part of postal department not to
        regularize services of husband of private respondents cannot be
        appreciated. Their Lordships decided in favour of temporary status
        employee at par with Group 'D' employee and upheld order dated
        22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna). So also observed that in

        upheld directions by this Tribunal extending benefits of pension as
        employee was granted temporary status at par with Group 'D' employee.

                                                                     [Emphasis supplied]

        (v)     The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with similar legal core
        issue as involved in the present case interpreted rules applicable in
        the present OA in hand. 
In the case of 
Union of India and others

        harness on 15.11.2007 and his legal heirs is entitled to benefit of
        pension/family pension or not ?"

                "10. Respondent is a legal heir and she is awaiting for certain monetary
                benefits for more than decade, therefore, the petitioner department is hereby

                Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of U.P., (2001) 9 SCC 687."

                                                                     [Emphasis supplied]

                        railways could not be considered for regularization". The Hon'ble High
                        Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such
                        lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The
                        Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family
                        Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased
                        employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary
                        capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary
                        employee.


                                The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of
                        family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by
                        notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for
                        a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.


        15.     In the other similar and identical situation, The Central Administrative

Patna
        Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of original applicants on
Bench
        similar facts and legal issue as involved in the present OA in hand and some of
        them are cited as under:-

 
(a)(i) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018 
Awadhesh
              Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors
 decided on 28.10.2021. The said
              O.A. was filed by Night Guard working in Department of Posts seeking pension and
              other pensionary benefits in terms of Rule 10, CCS (TS) Rules 1965 read with GID
              (3) below Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
 
The learned Tribunal observed that
              as per judgement by The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Uma Devi
's case, Department
              of Posts has circulated policy in June/July 2014 for regularization of casual labours
              having worked for ten years or more and vide judgement dated 13.11.2017 Hon'ble
              High Court Patna in CWJC No. 12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the
              policy. The applicant Awadhesh Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on
              13.1.1984 on daily wages, conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and retired
              on October, 2019 after 35 years of total service as temporary status and not been
              regularized.


 
The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of clause 5 of
              Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66-9/91-SPB. I dated 30th
              November, 1992- benefits to a casual labour on completion of three years service in
              Temporary status become entitled to be treated at par with temporary Group 'D'
              employees of the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
              benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis such as counting
              of service for purposes of pension and terminal benefits as in the case of temporary
              employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and retirement
              benefits after the regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order relied on
              larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of 
Prem
              Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others
 reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516
              reads as under :-


                       "35. There are some of the employees who have not been regularized in
                       spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas they
                       have been superannuated. As they have worked in work-charged
                       establishment, not against any particular project, their services ought to
                       have been regularized under the Government instructions and even as per
                       the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma
                       Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court in the said decision has laid down that in
                       case services have been rendered for more than ten years without the cover
                       of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be regularized of
                       such employees. In the facts of the case, those employees who have worked
                       for ten years or more should have been regularized. It would not be proper
                       to regulate them for consideration of regularization as others have been

                                               15                     OA No. /050/00839/2023




                    regularized, we direct that their services be treated as a regular one.
                    However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to claiming any
                    dues of difference in wages had they been continued in service regularly
                    before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall be entitled to receive
                    the pension as if they have retired from the regular establishment and the
                    services rendered by them right from the day they entered the work-charged
                    establishment shall be counted as qualifying service for purpose of pension.



                    36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement Benefits
                    Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work-charged
                    establishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the aforesaid rule
                    for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three years
                    only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid
                    accordingly within three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the
                    employees are allowed and filed by the State are dismissed."

                                                                          [Emphasis Supplied]

        16.   In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue "Whether deceased
        employee, the husband of the applicant who was appointed as casual lobour
        and thereafter conferred the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 27.04.1997and
        retired on 28.02.2024 after more than 36 years of active service and his legal
        heir-Smt. Dhanrajo Devi -the applicant is entitled to benefit of pension or
        family pension or not?"



        17.   Admittedly, husband of the applicant was initially engaged as
        Contingency Paid Casual Labourer in year 1986 and treated as Casual Labour
        from 25.04.1996 for all purpose and granted temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997.
        The department of posts vide instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all daily
        wagers working in post offices are to be treated as casual labourers. The

                                                 16                      OA No. /050/00839/2023




        department of posts has made Scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of
        Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme effective from 01.10.1989.
        The scheme provided provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual
        labourers. So also the scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D'
        regular employee available on conferment of status of temporary employee.



 
18.    The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before
        Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of 
Jagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus
        Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.
 1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that
        substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same
        emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
        "temporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal
        department on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240
Patna
Bench
        days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal
        employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly
        with regular employees in the department".




 
19.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in 
Jagrit Mazdoor
        Union
 (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-


                      "After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the
                      casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of
                      the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are
                      admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis."

                                                                             [Emphasis Supplied]

        20.    
In compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
        
Jagrit Mazdoor Union
 (supra). The Department of Posts, Government of
        India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary
        Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been
        drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and
        Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously
        pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers
        working continuously for long period.




        21.    The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and
        beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits
        to long continuous working of casual labourers.



        22.    The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual
        labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The husband of the applicant is

                                           17                 OA No. /050/00839/2023




        appointee of 01.07.1986 through District Employment Exchange and it is also
        an admitted that that he has been requesting to regularize and ought to have
        been regularized before 28.02.2024- date of retirement in accordance with law
        as regular employee for no fault of deceased employee - husband of the
        applicant having served for 36 years cannot be made to suffer violating 
Article
        14
, 21
, 31A
 and 
300
 of the Constitution of India.



        23.   Husband of the applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.
        27.04.1997 pursuant to order dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-3) and the
        statutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years w.e.f. 27.04.2000 certain
        advantages to temporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum
        of the pay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.
        Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a
Patna
Bench
        Group 'D' employee after completion of one year of service from date of
        conferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of
        increment to a government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent
        is clear as noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and
        writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as
        social legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The
        Central Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles
        of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating
        temporary status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group
        'D' employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and
        entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on
        regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity
        Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary
        status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on
        absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation
        with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically
        provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three
        years continuous service as temporary status.



        24.   The husband of the applicant-deceased employee - was conferred
        temporary status w.e.f. 27.04.1997 vide Memo dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-

        3) and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial
        construction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The husband of the
        applicant after three years since 27.04.1997 meaning thereby since 27.04.2000

                                            18                 OA No. /050/00839/2023




        has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly
        contributed to G.P.F. The husband of the applicant was in capacity of
        temporary employee from 27.04.1997 till 28.02.2024, date of retirement for
        more than 36 years in service. The applicant's husband having continuously
        worked as temporary status casual labourer since 27.04.1997 and on 27.04.2000
        is holder of post of temporary employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to
        be dealt fairly by the model employer state accordance with guarantee
        enshrined in the 
Article 14
 and 
21
 of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is
        of the view whereof that it is unfair to continue the applicant's husband such a
        long 36 years in temporary post and without considering for regularizing till
        retirement on 28.02.2024.



 
25.    The applicant's husband acquired status of temporary employee Group
Patna
Bench
        'D' of Department of Posts on 27.04.1997 and continued till 28.02.2024 - date
        of retirement after putting in 36 years of service and it is well settled in law
        that entitled for such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on
        regular basis. So also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Jagrit Mazdoor
        Union
 (supra).




        26.    The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no
        recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers
        available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged
        statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the
        Constitution of India and husband of the applicant was not regularized as for no
        fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his
        duty and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take
        advantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them
        that since no regularization no pension etc.


        27.    The applicant submitted representation dated 15.12.2022 to allow to
        participate in absorption to regularize services on regular cadre post but no
        response. The respondents have argued that husband of applicant could not be
        provided opportunity for regularization as Group 'D' through selection in view
        of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual labourers. The respondents not
        regularized services of applicant. The applicant was never at fault for such lack
        of regularization due to lack of vacancies. Applicant filed OA No.119 of 2023
        and vide order dated 23.02.2023 (Annexure A-7) disposed of to decide ending

                                            19                 OA No. /050/00839/2023




        representation and present another OA to regularize. This Tribunal vide order
        dated 23.02.2023 directed the respondents, thereafter vide Impugned order
        dated 28.09.2023 (Annexure A-1) - respondents held applicant's husband shall
        not be considered for regularization in MTS Cadre. But in 36 years of active
        service respondents did not regularize for no fault of husband of the applicant
        and applicant cannot be denied pension/family pension etc.


        28.    This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in
        the O.A that respondents have not regularized services of deceased employee
        on regular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests and retired on
        28.02.2024 without being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view since
        respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated
        12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 25.04.1996 as
Patna
Bench
        Casual Labaour. Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes
        and latches to deny retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee
        before retirement. The matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and
        policy applicable to husband of the applicant and he ought to have at least
        considered for regularization before date of superannuation i.e. 28.02.2024. The
        husband of the applicant worked since 1986 till 28.02.2024 almost more than
        thirty six (36) years since 28.04.1988 in the department in Contingency Paid
        capacity and worked as Causal Labour since 25.04.1996 as per respondents.



        29.    The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein
        above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated
        30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of
        casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status
        reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the deceased
        employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and cannot be taken away by
        respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.
        Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of
        implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged
        in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are
        substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to
        deceased employee accrued rights and has led to widow-applicant in present
        OA and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by
        respondents that unless regularized no pensionry benefits. The said contention
        deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief claimed.

                                             20                OA No. /050/00839/2023


        30.    The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992
        quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal
        department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly
        acquired temporary status in present case w.e.f. 27.04.1997 becomes entitled to
        benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of
        service for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary
        employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and
        retirement benefits after their regularization.



        31.    The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are
        regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The
        Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death
        gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as
Patna
Bench
        are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS
        Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension
        and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2
        CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee, husband of the applicant,
        retired without substantive appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per
        Rules 1965 and Pension Rules 2021.



        32.    The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as
        extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes
        temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021
        are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant's husband. So also
        the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6)
        cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services
        and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December,
        2003, who retired or were retired before having been              appointed in a
        substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the
        government servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services
        (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as
        admissible to any other public servant and respondents have violated
        fundamental right enshrined in 
Article 14
 and 
21
 of Constitution of India.



        33.    The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years
        service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992
        provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement

                                              21                    OA No. /050/00839/2023




        benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed
        by regularization.



        34.    The husband of the applicant stood retired on 28.02.2024 as temporary
        employee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge the
        duties. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 and
        Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension, family pension and
        retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status of employee was at par
        with regular employee on long 36 years continuation on temporary post in
        welfare state. The Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules
        2021 would prevail over any policy decision.



        35.    The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it

Patna
        clear that applicant's husband - deceased employee, who stood retired before
Bench
        having been appointed in a substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for
        such type of category of temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e
        Pension, retirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable
        to husband of the applicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant
        under CCS Pension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as
        under:-

                      (i)     On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation
                              after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent
                              service of not less than 10 years.

                      (ii)    On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of
                              continuous temporary service.

                      (iii)   In event of death while in service.



                                                                        [Emphasis supplied]


        36.    This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes
        clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021
        (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of
        whereof of the firm view that Government of India, Department of Posts
        instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992
        and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read
        conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial
        legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered
        service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes
        entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the
        part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension

                                            22                  OA No. /050/00839/2023




        Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers
        the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state
        as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy
        envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.



 
37.    Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses
        and for no fault applicant cannot be made to suffer and deceased employee -
        husband of the applicant entitled to receive pension as if retired from regular
        establishment and so also held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of
        judgment in case of 
Prem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors
 (2019) 10 SCC
        516 reproduced herein above.




 
38.    The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in

Patna
        case of 
Union of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.
 154 of 2019 decided
Bench
        on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in
        O.A. No. 372/2017 (
Bhikhani Devi Vs Union of India
) as Tribunal relied on
        ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against
        same.
 
Their Lordships in case of         
Bhikhani Devi
 (supra) observed that
        judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none
        of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that
        there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'
        unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an
        employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be
        admissible.




 
39.    The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the
        Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal
        issue dealt in detail rules applicable in case of 
Union of India and ors

        41.    Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case and legal
        issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial
        pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court
        of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and
        Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This
        Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered
        matter on facts and legal issue involved in the present case and no more res-
        integra. The applicant is also entitled for the same treatment and consequential
        benefits envisaged in the Fundamental Right under 
Article 14
 
& 21
 of
        Constitution of India guaranteed to the applicant too.

                                            24                OA No. /050/00839/2023


        42.    In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of the
        Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit to casual
        labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status of Casual
        Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme is crystal
        clear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if
        he has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by
        regularization. The husband of the applicant granted temporary status w.e.f.
        27.04.1997 and not been regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for
        no fault stood retired on 28.02.2024.



        43.    The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants
        are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules
        1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued             for grant of
Patna
Bench
        pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,
        members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension read
        with    the provisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021

        Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia provision in Rule
        75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted
        that Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a
        regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari
        Kakkar (supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if retiree
        denied pensionary benefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent
        employee not regularized after served for 18 ½ years.

        Bench Patna) vide order dated 05.07.2023 in case of deceased employee
        worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while working
        as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in Postal
        Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension etc. 
This
        Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008 (
Meena Devi vs.
        Union of India
) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015
        (
Union of India versus Meena Devi
) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,
        Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.

        Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was
        whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -
        without regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this
        Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as
        regular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at
        par with Group 'D' employee and issue pension, family pension and benefits

        47.    
In case of 
Shiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others

        O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -
        whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status
        at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other
        retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post

                                           26                 OA No. /050/00839/2023




        and applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as
        temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started
        employment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred
        status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,
        family pension.
 This Tribunal in case Shiv Shankar Sah (Supra) considered
        orders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015
        upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on
        part of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private
        respondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par
        with Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be
        appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978
        of 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing
        respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old
Patna
Bench   pension scheme.



        48.   Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above cited judgments observed that as per
        rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on
        regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service
        after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On
        working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'
        employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not
        regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of
        respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise
        meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible
        for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order
        passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not
        regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. In case of Shiv Chandra Sah
        (Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant
        entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary
        Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on
        03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service
        and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.
        Respondents challenged order dated 21.02.2022 in identical case on hand titled
        Shiv Charndra Shah (supra) in CWJC No.1415 of 2023 Union of India vs.
        Shiv Chandra Shah, upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna vide order dated
        22.08.2024.

                                            27                  OA No. /050/00839/2023


        49.    In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.
        No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue
        applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary
        status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at
        part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension
        denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on
        regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not
        issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right
        accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule
        2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. 
So also placed reliance in case OA
        No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of
        2017 in

        allowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other

        CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA
        No.372/2017.




        50.    Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India
        & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this
        Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships
        considered argument of respondents department that contention of department
        cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be
        construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying
        for more than 27 years.



        51.    The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by
        above precedents.



        52.    In case of Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus Union of India, OA No.143

In 
Yashwant Hari Katakkar
 (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court
                     held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was
                     not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½
Patna                years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary
Bench
                     benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent
                     employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances
                     appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the
                     government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be
                     permanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.

        45.      In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5
        of the Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to
        benefit to casual labourers on completion of three years service in
        temporary status of Casual Labourers (Grant of temporary status and
        regularization) Scheme is crystal clear that temporary employee is entitled
        to pension and retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of
        service in temporary status followed by regularization, The husband of
        applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and not been
        regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for no fault stood
        retired on 30.6.2018 and died on 28.5.2022.

                 The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants
        are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules
        1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of
        pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,
        members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension

        provision in Rule 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants
        1964. It is also submitted that Rule for family pension no where provides
        that the individual is to be a regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme
        Court in case of

 (supra) has held that it would
        be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on
        ground that he was not a permanent employee not regularized after served
        for 18 ½ years.

                      Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna, their
                      Lordships upheld judgements of this Tribunal in identical facts and legal
                      issue binding precedents and present case is no different and core issue
                      is no more res-integra.

        issue and binding precedents. This Tribunal is of considered opinion that
        present case is no different and core issue is involved is no more res-integra.



        56.    Respondents much emphasized that husband of the applicant while
        working as Temporary Status expressed willingness to be promoted as regular
        employee, but not appointed on regular Group 'D' employee. As evident from
        pleadings applicant worked since year 1986 as Contingency Paid but in more
        than 36 years of service could not be regularized and husband of the applicant
        never refused to be regularized on post she was working.



 
57.    Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar case of 
Union of India versus
        Ratneshwar Singh, CWJC No.13117
 of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019
        (Annexure - A/5 with OA) in paragraph 3, their Lordships held - "These
        letters nowhere indicate that the respondent-petitioner had declined to accept
        regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by
        petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted
        by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be
        construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was
        occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed
        in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in
        paragraph 11 of impugned judgment comes to the aid of respondent-
        petitioner." In view of law 
laid down in
 similar facts and contention raised by
        respondents, Ho'ble High Court, Patna their Lordships repelled similar
        contention as raised in case on hand. Arguments of learned counsel for

                                            31                  OA No. /050/00839/2023




        respondents has no force no document produced of promotion order and no
        application of refusal and repelled. In view whereof, OA deserves to be
        allowed, with all consequential benefits.




                                           CONCLUSION


        58.    For the above reasons, the Impugned Order dated 28.09.2023 is set
        aside. The deceased employee is held entitled for the pension to be computed as
        per findings supra. Respondents are further directed to settle the pension/family
