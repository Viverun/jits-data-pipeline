                           since been framed; however, no prosecution witness has been examined and
                          the trial has not made any meaningful progress. During this period, the
                          Applicant has undergone a further substantial span of incarceration. In these
                          circumstances, and having regard to the implications for personal liberty,
                          this Court considers it appropriate to entertain the present application and
                          examine the matter on its merits.

                          FACTUAL MATRIX

                          3.          The case of the prosecution, in brief, is as follows:

                          3.1.        The deceased, Moni Gupta, aged 25 years, married the Applicant,
                          Akash Gupta, on 01st December, 2016, and was residing with him at
                          Mukundpur, Delhi.

                          3.2.        On 04th April, 2023, information was received at P.S. Bhalswa Dairy
                          that the deceased had been admitted to BJRM Hospital, Jahangirpuri, with
                          suspected history of poison ingestion. During treatment, she was declared
                          dead. The crime team inspected the matrimonial home, seized certain
                          exhibits including cloth material, a packet of "Laxman Rekha", a white solid
                          substance, and the deceased's damaged mobile phone. The body was
                          preserved for post-mortem and viscera was retained for FSL analysis. On the
                          basis of this information, the present FIR came to be registered.
                          3.3.        During investigation, the father of the deceased stated that from the
                          early years of marriage, his daughter had been subjected to persistent cruelty
                          and dowry-related harassment by the Applicant and his family members. He
                          alleged that dowry articles worth approximately INR 2,51,000 were given at
                          the time of marriage, and an additional sum of INR 2,00,000 was paid in
                          2018, yet demands for money continued. It is further alleged that the

                           deceased repeatedly informed her parents that she was being beaten and
                          pressurised to bring more money from her parental home. He also referred to
                          an earlier incident when the deceased left the matrimonial home and was
                          later found at Banaras Railway Station, allegedly after being assaulted by
                          the Applicant and his family members.

                          3.4.   The statement of the minor daughter of the deceased, recorded under
                          
Section 164
 Cr.P.C. on 22nd June, 2023, alleges prior acts of violence against
                          the deceased as well as demand for money on the night preceding the
                          incident.

                          3.5.   Investigation has since been completed, a chargesheet has been filed,
                          charges have been framed, and the matter is presently pending for recording
                          of prosecution evidence.

                          SUBMISSIONS

                          4.     Ms. Nandita Rao, Senior Counsel for Applicant, urges the following
                          grounds in support of the Application:

                          4.1.   The Applicant has been falsely implicated. During six years of
                          marriage, no complaint of cruelty or dowry demand was ever lodged by the
                          deceased or her family. Even in the present case, the prosecution has not
                          identified any specific date, time, or concrete instance of an alleged dowry
                          demand or act of cruelty and relies only on broad, omnibus assertions.
                          4.2.   The statement of the minor child under 
Section 164
 Cr.P.C. was
                          recorded nearly two months after the incident and is therefore vulnerable to
                          tutoring and embellishment. The child's version alleging beatings and burn
                          injuries is entirely contradicted by the post-mortem report, which records no
                          external injuries on the body of the deceased.

                          4.3.   There is no contemporaneous material, such as messages, audio or

                           video recordings, written complaints, or any other documentary evidence, to
                          support the allegation of dowry-related harassment or sustained cruelty.
                          4.4.   The Applicant has already been in custody for more than two years
                          and six months. Investigation is complete, the chargesheet has been filed,
                          and charges have been framed. Out of 29 listed witnesses, not a single one
                          has been examined so far, and the trial is unlikely to conclude in the near
                          future. Custodial interrogation is no longer required, and there is no
                          allegation that the Applicant has attempted to threaten witnesses or interfere
                          with the proceedings. In this backdrop, it is argued that further incarceration
                          would be unjustified and disproportionate.

                          5.     Hitesh Vali, APP for the State, opposes the application on the
                          following grounds:

                          5.1.   The case concerns death of a young married woman under unnatural
                          circumstances, within seven years of marriage, thereby attracting the
                          provisions of 
Sections 304B
 and 
498A
 IPC and the statutory presumption
                          under 
Section 113B
 of the Indian Evidence Act. In such circumstances, the
                          allegations cannot be viewed lightly at the stage of bail.
                          5.2.   Reliance is placed on the material collected during investigation,
                          particularly the detailed allegations of dowry-related harassment made by
                          the complainant (father of the deceased) and the statement of the minor
                          daughter recorded under 
Section 164
 Cr.P.C. These material taken together,
                          prima facie indicate a sustained course of cruelty and harassment "in
                          connection with" dowry demands, and thus the essential ingredients of
                          
Sections 304B
 and 
498A
 IPC are duly made out, at this stage.
                          5.3    The supplementary statement of the complainant specifically alleges
                          that the deceased was beaten on 20-25 occasions on account of dowry

                           demands. It is also stated that on one such occasion, about one and a half
                          years prior to the incident, the deceased left the matrimonial home and was
                          later traced at Banaras Railway Station. Further, it is recorded that on 03 rd
                          April, 2023, the deceased informed her mother that she had again been
                          assaulted, was being pressurised to bring money from her parental home,
                          and no longer wished to live. These assertions are corroborated by the
                          statements of the complainant's wife and son.

                          5.4.   As per the Applicant's disclosure during interrogation, on the evening
                          of 03rd April, 2023, he was consuming alcohol with a relative and when the
                          deceased objected, a quarrel ensued, during which he slapped her and asked
                          her to bring money from her father. Thereafter, the deceased consumed
                          poison. The case diary also refers to a conversation retrieved from the
                          deceased's mobile phone between her and her father-in-law, in which she
                          reportedly complained of cruelty.

                          5.5.   The allegations and the material reflect a sustained pattern of cruelty
                          and harassment related to dowry, and releasing the Applicant at this stage
                          may expose the complainant and other material witnesses, who are yet to be
                          examined, to potential pressure or intimidation, thereby affecting the
                          fairness of the trial.

                          ANALYSIS

                          6.     This Court has considered the rival submissions and examined the
                          material placed on record, including the 164 statement of the minor
                          daughter, relied upon by the prosecution. The Applicant stands charged,
                          inter alia, under 
Section 304B
 IPC, which creates a distinct offence of
                          'dowry death' and is complemented by the statutory presumption under

Section 113B
 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.4 For that presumption to
                          arise, the prosecution must, at least prima facie, demonstrate: (i) the death of
                          a woman occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; (ii) such
                          death took place within seven years of marriage; and (iii) soon before her
                          death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his
                          relatives, in connection with any demand for dowry. Once these
                          foundational facts are established, the law permits a presumption that the
                          husband or his relatives caused the dowry death.

                          7.         In the present case, the first two elements are, at this stage, not in
                          dispute. The marriage took place on 1st December, 2016, and the death
                          occurred on 4th April, 2023, due to ingestion of poison. The core issue, even
                          at the threshold, concerns the third requirement, namely, whether there is
                          material to indicate that the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment
                          "soon before her death" and whether such treatment bears a proximate nexus
                          with any alleged demand for dowry.

                          8.         The prosecution places reliance on the statement of the minor child,
                          aged about six years, recorded under 
Section 164
 Cr.P.C., to establish a
                          proximate link between the alleged dowry-related cruelty and the death. In
                          that statement, the child attributes physical assault to the Applicant on the
                          night preceding the incident, including allegations of beating and burning.
                          At the same time, as confirmed by the APP for the State, the post-mortem
                          report does not record any external injuries, burn marks, or other signs of
                          recent physical violence on the body. The statement of a child witness is
                          certainly relevant and cannot be disregarded; however at this stage, it can
                          only be observed that given the young age of the witness, the delay in

                           recording the statement, and the absence of medical corroboration of recent
                          assault, its ultimate weight and reliability will require careful evaluation at
                          trial.

                          9.       The prosecution also relies on the statement of the complainant (father
                          of the deceased), who asserts that on 03rd April, 2023, the deceased spoke to
                          her mother and complained of harassment, pressure to bring money, and loss
                          of will to live. Beyond these assertions, however, the material presently
                          available does not disclose any specific, time-linked instance of dowry-
                          related harassment in close proximity to the death, save for a general
                          allegation of a monetary payment in 2018 and broad references to past ill-
                          treatment.

                          10.      There is also reference to a conversation retrieved from the deceased's
                          phone between her and her father-in-law, in which the deceased voices
                          certain grievances. However, on the material on record, it is not shown that
                          the conversation makes any specific reference to dowry or to a demand for
                          money soon before the incident, or that it records an occurrence directly
                          connected with the circumstances leading to the death. Whether this
                          conversation, read with other statements, ultimately satisfies the "soon
                          before" requirement is a matter that will fall for fuller examination at trial.

                          11.      At this stage, the absence of medically-corroborated injuries and the
                          lack of proximate, time-linked allegations of dowry demand cast a prima
                          facie doubt on whether the necessary live link between alleged cruelty and
                          the death stands made out. Whether the prosecution ultimately establishes
                          the essential ingredients of the offences is a matter that will fall for
                          appreciation on the basis of the evidence that parties may adduce at trial and
                          cannot be pre-judged at the bail stage.

                           12.      As per the nominal roll, the Applicant has undergone custody of more
                          than 2 years and 6 months. The investigation stands completed and a
                          chargesheet has already been filed. Charges have been framed and the
                          matter is now pending for recording of prosecution evidence. Out of 29 cited
                          witnesses, none has been examined so far. There is no material before this
                          Court to suggest that the Applicant has any past criminal antecedents, nor
                          has any specific instance been pointed out where he attempted to abscond or
                          interfered with the investigation. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to
                          proceed on the footing that the trial will take further time to reach
                          conclusion. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that prolonged pre-
                          trial incarceration, once investigation is over and the accused is no longer
                          required for custodial interrogation, must be approached with care,
                          particularly in the context of 
Article 21
 and the right to a speedy trial.

                          13.      The general principles governing the grant of bail are well settled.
                          Bail is not to be withheld as a form of pre-trial punishment, and the primary
                          purpose of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at trial. 5 While
                          considering a bail application, due regard must be given to the nature and
                          gravity of the accusation, the severity of the punishment in the event of
                          conviction, the prima facie evaluation of the material, the likelihood of the
                          accused fleeing from justice, and the possibility of tampering with evidence
                          or influencing witnesses.

 
14.      Having regard to the totality of circumstances, including the duration
                          of custody, the stage of the proceedings, the nature of the material on record,
                          and the settled principles governing grant of bail, this Court is of the view


                          5

                           16.   In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/complaint lodged
                          against the Applicant, it would be open to the State to seek redressal by
