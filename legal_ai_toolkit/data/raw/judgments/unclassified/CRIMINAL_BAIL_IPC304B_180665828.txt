                       The High Court of Madhya Pradesh
                              MCRC-26350-2021
                  (JAGDISH SINGH TOMAR Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)

Gwalior dated : 03/06/2021

      Shri Heerendra Singh, learned counsel for the applicant.

      Shri Neeraj Dhamaniya, learned Panel Lawyer for the State.

      Shri Ankit Saxena, learned counsel for the complainant.

      Case diary is read over by the State counsel.

      This case is heard through video conferencing.

      Applicant has filed this first application
 u/S.438
 Cr.P.C. for grant of

anticipatory bail.

      Applicant apprehends arrest in connection with offence punishable

u/
S.498-A
, 
304B
, 
34
 of IPC registered as Crime No.08/2021, by Police Station

Maharazpura, District Gwalior (M.P.).

      Learned Panel Lawyer for the State opposed the application and prayed

for its rejection by contending that on the basis of the allegations and the

material available on record, no case for grant of anticipatory bail is made out.

      The applicant is said to be aged more than 70 years and is cousin father-

in-law of deceased who died due to hanging on 08/12/2020 as against the date

of marriage being 26/02/2020. The cruelty for demand of dowry is alleged as

cause of death.

      Reading of statement of mother of deceased
 u/S.161
 Cr.P.C. reveals that

the same is implicative in nature.

      However, considering the age of the applicant which is more than 70

years who may not be able to bear the rigours of incarceration and the second

waive of Covid-19 pandemic which has paralyzed even tempo of life and also

jails are potential hotbeds for spread of Covid-19 pandemic coupled with the fact
                                                                                 2

                         that the material placed on record does not disclose the possibility of applicant

                         fleeing from justice, this Court is inclined to extend the benefit of anticipatory

                         bail to the applicant but with certain stringent conditions in view of pending

                         investigation.

                                             Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, I

                         deem it appropriate to allow this application
 u/S. 438
 of Cr.P.C. in the

                         following terms.

                                             It is hereby directed that in the event of arrest, the applicant shall be

                        released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rs.
