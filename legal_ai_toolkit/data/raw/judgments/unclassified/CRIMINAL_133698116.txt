                     BA No.287 of 2025
           --------------------------------------------
        Dated this the 09th day of January, 2025



                          ORDER



       This Bail Application is filed under Section

483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita

(BNSS), 2023.



       2.     The petitioner is the accused in Crime

No.1196/2024         of    Pudukkad       Police     Station,

Thrissur. The above case is registered against the

petitioner alleging offences punishable under


Sections 506
, 
323
 and 
376
 of Indian Penal Code.


       3.     The   prosecution     case     is    that,   on

10.11.2021 at about 09.00 PM, the petitioner

committed rape on his own daughter-in-law and

 BA No.287 of 2025


                             3





                                             2025:KER:1290

thereby committed the above said offences.


       4.     Heard the learned counsel appearing for

the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.


       5.     The   petitioner     earlier   filed    a   bail

application         before       this   Court        as   BA

No.10592/2024. After hearing the counsel for the

petitioner and the Public Prosecutor, this Court

was not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner

because of the serious allegation against the

petitioner. At that stage, the counsel for the

petitioner seeks permission to withdraw the bail

application with liberty to move it again after two

weeks and this Court granted liberty. Accordingly,

this second bail application is filed.               Now, the

petitioner is in custody for 45 days.


       6.     It is true that the allegation against the

petitioner is very serious.             According to the

 BA No.287 of 2025


                                   4





                                                  2025:KER:1290

petitioner, it is a false case foisted against the

petitioner at the instance of the daughter-in-law

of the petitioner. It is also submitted that the son

of the petitioner filed a divorce petition against

the defacto complainant and because of the

same,       the     present        complaint     is   filed.   The

petitioner also produced a disability certificate

showing        that,   he     is       having   40%    disability.

Considering the facts and circumstances of the

case and also considering the fact that the

petitioner is in custody from 26.11.2024, I think,

the petitioner can be released on bail after

imposing stringent conditions.                  There can be a

direction to the petitioner to appear before the

Investigating Officer on all Mondays at 10.00 AM,

till final report is filed.

                                                        2025:KER:1290


 
7. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle

that the bail is the rule and the jail is the

exception.          The     Hon'ble         Supreme           Court     in

Chidambaram.                
P        v.       Directorate             of

Enforcement
           [2019 (16) SCALE 870],                      after

considering all the earlier judgments, observed

that, the basic jurisprudence relating to bail

remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is

the rule and refusal is the exception so as to

ensure that the accused has the opportunity of

securing fair trial.




 
8.     Moreover, in 
Jalaluddin Khan v. Union

of India
 [2024 KHC 6431], the Hon'ble Supreme

Court observed that:




            "21. Before we part with the Judgment,
            we must mention here that the Special
            Court   and   the   High      Court   did   not
            consider the material in the charge

 BA No.287 of 2025


                                      6





                                                               2025:KER:1290

           sheet objectively. Perhaps the focus was
           more      on    the   activities       of   PFI,     and
           therefore, the appellant's case could not
           be properly appreciated. When a case is
           made out for a grant of bail, the Courts
           should        not   have    any    hesitation          in
           granting bail. The allegations of the
           prosecution may be very serious. But,
           the duty of the Courts is to consider the
           case for grant of bail in accordance with
           the law. "Bail is the rule and jail is an
           exception" is a settled law. Even in a
           case like the present case where there
           are stringent conditions for the grant of
           bail in the relevant statutes, the same
           rule holds good with only modification
           that the bail can be granted if the
           conditions in the statute are satisfied.
           The rule also means that once a case is
           made out for the grant of bail, the Court
           cannot decline to grant bail. If the Courts
           start denying bail in deserving cases, it
           will     be    a    violation     of     the       rights
           guaranteed          under       
Art.21
       of      our
           Constitution." (underline supplied)


       9. 
In 
Manish Sisodia v. Directorate
 of

 BA No.287 of 2025


                                7





                                                   2025:KER:1290

Enforcement [2024 KHC 6426], also the Hon'ble

Supreme Court observed that:




          "53. The Court further observed that, over
          a period of time, the trial courts and the
          High Courts have forgotten a very well -
          settled principle of law that bail is not to
          be withheld as a punishment. From our
          experience, we can say that it appears
          that the trial courts and the High Courts
          attempt to play safe in matters of grant of
          bail. The principle that bail is a rule and
          refusal is an exception is, at times,
          followed in breach. On account of non -
          grant of bail even in straight forward open
          and shut cases, this Court is flooded with
          huge number of bail petitions thereby
          adding to the huge pendency. It is high
          time that the trial courts and the High
          Courts should recognize the principle that
          "bail is rule and jail is exception"."



 
10. Considering the dictum 
laid down in
 the

above decisions and considering the facts and

circumstances of this case, this Bail Application is

                                                2025:KER:1290

allowed with the following directions:


     1.    Petitioner shall be released on bail

           on executing a bond for Rs.50,000/-



           (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with

           two solvent sureties each for the

           like sum to the satisfaction of the

           jurisdictional Court.



     2. The petitioner shall appear before

           the       Investigating        Officer    for

           interrogation as and when required.

           The petitioner shall co-operate with

           the      investigation    and    shall   not,

           directly     or   indirectly    make     any

           inducement, threat or promise to

           any person acquainted with the

           facts of the case so as to dissuade

           him from disclosing such facts to

 BA No.287 of 2025


                               9





                                                  2025:KER:1290

           the Court or to any police officer.


     3.    Petitioner     shall     not   leave     India

           without        permission        of         the

           jurisdictional Court.



     4.    Petitioner     shall     not   commit       an

           offence similar to the offence of

           which he is accused, or suspected,

           of the commission of which he is

           suspected.



     5. The petitioner shall appear before

           the      Investigating    Officer      on   all

           Mondays at 10.00 AM, till final

           report is filed.



     6.    If any of the above conditions are

           violated      by   the     petitioner,      the

           jurisdictional Court can cancel the

           bail in accordance with law, even

 BA No.287 of 2025


                           10





                                          2025:KER:1290

           though the bail is granted by this

           Court. The prosecution and the

           victim are at liberty to approach the

           jurisdictional court to cancel the

           bail, if there is any violation of the

           above condition.
