              (Mujib Ahmad Khan Vs. State of M.P.)
                              (1)


Gwalior, dated : 21.3.18
      Shri Ravi Ballabh Tripathi, Advocate for the applicant.
      Shri Avneesh Singh, Public Prosecutor for the respondent-State.


      Shri Atul Gupta, Advocate for the complainant.
      Case Diary is perused.

      Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard.
      I.A. No.2186/18, an application, under 
section 301(2)
 of the
Cr.P.C, is considered and allowed.

      This is first application under 
section 438
 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure.

      Applicant    apprehends     arrest   in    connection   with   Crime
No.14/2018 registered at Police Station Karera, District Shivpuri, for the
offence punishable under sections 304B read with 34 of the 
IPC
.

      Allegations against the applicant, in short, are that he being
husband of Faujiya was involved in subjecting her to cruelty and
harassment due to non satisfaction of demand for dowry and, ultimately,
Faujiya died on 13/12/17 of brain infarction.

 
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant has
been falsely implicated in the case.            Marriage of applicant was
solemnized with Faujiya on 12/4/13. She was sick since prior to her
marriage and after marriage her treatment was carried out by the
applicant and his family members only. She has not lodged any
complaint against anyone. She was also suffering from paralysis.
However, from 14/7/16, Faujiya had been residing with her parents and
has died on 13/12/17 at her parental home only. Earlier on 20/9/16,
father of Faujiya had registered a case under 
section 498A
 of the IPC
against the applicant and other family members. On 29/8/16 and
16/9/16, father of the applicant and applicant respectively had informed
the Police about being threatened by parents of the deceased of being
roped in a false case. An application under 
section 125
 of the Cr.P.C.
was also moved by father of the deceased, wherein he has specifically
                             THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH

                                    M.Cr.C.No.10191/2018

                            (
Mujib Ahmad Khan Vs. State of M.P
.)

                                            (2)


             mentioned Faujiya to be suffering from TB and Paraylsis. It is submitted
             that as per post moretm report, Faujiya has died due to brain infarction.
             As she was residing with her parents for last more than 15 months,
             therefore, ingredients of section 304B are not attracted to the fact
             situation in hand. There is no direct or indirect involvement of the
             applicant in the crime. Applicant is a permanent resident of Shivpuri and
             there is no likelihood of his absconsion.            With the aforesaid
             submissions, prayer for anticipatory bail is made.


                      In response, learned Public Prosecutor and learned counsel for
             the complainant have opposed the bail application and pray for its
             rejection. They submit that applicant, being the husband, is the main
             accused. Besides, he is absconding and that is the reason why
             investigation is not being completed. It is submitted that the applicant
             was involved in harassing the deceased for non fulfillment of dowry, in
             which regard a complaint was also lodged. Not being able to withstand
             the harassment, Faujiya fell ill and ultimately was taken by her parents
             for treatment. However, finally she succumbed. It is submitted that
             applicant being the husband, his case cannot be said to be at par with
             that of his father who has been extended the benefit of anticipatory bail
             in M.CrC. No.5894/18 vide order dated 27/2/18 inter alia considering his
             old age. Under such circumstances, it is submitted that no indulgence is
             warranted.

                      Taking into consideration the overall facts and circumstances, of
             the case, but without expressing any opinion on the merits thereof, in
             the opinon of this Court, no case for grant of anticipatory bail is made
             out.

                      The application, accordingly, stands dismissed.



                                                         (S.A.Dharmadhikari)
