                                 ORDER



      1.   The struggle for seniority between the direct

recruits   and    the      promotees       working    in   the    Bruhat

Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ("the BBMP", for short) in

the   cadre      of   First   Division      Assistants,     and    their

consequential promotions and seniority in the promotional

cadres is the subject matter of challenge, in this batch of

writ petitions.





      2.   The following facts are not in dispute.



      3.   The recruitment to various posts in the BBMP

are   governed        by   the    City     of   Bangalore    Municipal

Corporation Services (General) Cadre and Recruitment

Regulations, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the "C & R

Rules"), which were framed on 03.03.1971.



      4.   Under these Rules, the posts of First Division

Assistants ("FDA") are required to be filled up by direct

recruitment and by promotion from the post of Second

Division Assistant ("SDA"), in the ratio of 50:50.

                             - 59 -

                                      And Connected Matters





     5.   On 13.08.2012, a provisional gradation list of

the FDA appointed between the periods 01.01.1988 and

01.08.2012 was published.





     6.   After considering the objections filed by the

FDAs who were aggrieved by their assigned rankings, a

final gradation list was issued on 28.11.2013.



     7.   In this final gradation list, the five petitioners in

W.P. No.39961/2016 were assigned rankings from 256 to


277. These petitioners had been initially appointed as

SDAs between 31.12.1994 and 02.12.1995, and were

promoted to the cadre of FDA on 18.01.2018.



     8.   As the petitioners (who were the promotees)

had been promoted on 18.01.2008, which was about nine

months before the private respondents had been directly

recruited under the notification dated 04.10.2008 and in

the final gradation list dated 28.01.2013, they (the

promotees) were assigned rankings from 256 to 277,

while the private respondents i.e., direct recruits were

                             - 60 -

                                      And Connected Matters




assigned rankings from 281 to 351. In other words, the

promotees to the cadre of FDA were considered as seniors

to the directly recruited FDAs.





     9.    The direct recruits, being aggrieved by this

gradation list, preferred writ petitions before this Court in

W.P. Nos.7116-7117/2013.





     10.   During the pendency of said writ petitions, the

Establishment    and   Administrative   Reforms    Standing

Committee of the BBMP ("the Standing Committee")

passed a resolution on 04.02.2013, in which it was

recorded that there existed certain deficiencies in the final

gradation list dated 28.01.2013. The Standing Committee,

in light of the deficiencies and the objections raised by the

employees, ultimately resolved to consider the objections

of the erstwhile employees of the Town Municipal Council,

who had been absorbed into the BBMP by keeping them

outside the seniority and to finalise the seniority of the

employees of the BBMP afresh, and until then, their

promotions were required to be withheld.

                                        And Connected Matters





        11.   This   Court,   thereafter,   on    18.12.2014,

proceeded to dispose of W.P. Nos.7116-7117/2013 holding

that the seniority list dated 28.01.2013 was not in

conformity with the law and was required to be re-done,

and there was a need to direct the BBMP to implement the

resolution dated 04.02.2013 passed by the Standing

Committee. Accordingly, this Court allowed the writ

petitions and directed the BBMP to give effect to the

resolution dated 04.02.2013 passed by the Standing

Committee, immediately.





        12.   It is also pertinent to state here that the 22

direct recruits had also preferred W.P. Nos.51-72/2014

challenging the seniority list dated 28.01.2013. However,

these petitions, by an order dated 03.07.2015, were

dismissed as certain objections had not been complied

with.





        13.   Pursuant to the orders passed by this Court on

18.12.2014      in   W.P.   Nos.7116-7117/2013,    the   BBMP

                                      - 62 -

                                                      NC: 2024:KHC:2508

                                                And Connected Matters




proceeded to issue a provisional seniority list of FDAs. This

provisional seniority list was in respect of all the FDAs who

had been appointed between 03.03.1971 and 01.01.2015.



         14.    In this provisional seniority list, the BBMP

sought to apply the guidelines stated in the Government

Order ("GO") dated 05.07.1976 (based on the decision

rendered in V.B. Badami's1 case, by the Supreme Court)

and the GO dated 14.12.1987 (based on the decision

rendered in Gonal Bhimappa's2 case, by the Supreme

Court).





         15.    This provisional seniority list sought to classify

and calculate the vacancies between the direct recruits

and promotees, as indicated in the 2 aforementioned GOs

i.e., by defining Block Periods. As per the 2 GOs, the Block

Periods, were required be from the date on which the

Rules were promulgated and the dates on which direct

recruitments were first made, and the other Block Periods

were to be for the periods between the dates on which

direct recruitments were subsequently made.



     16.   The       BBMP    classified    and     calculated     the

vacancies into eight Block Periods.



     17.   The initial Block Period was the "No Rule Period"


i.e., the period during which there were no statutory rules

governing the recruitment, which was between 01.09.1966

and 03.01.1971.



     18.   The first Block Period was from the date on

which   the   statutory      rules      were   promulgated       i.e.,

03.03.1971,   till    the   date   on     which   the   first   direct

recruitment was made i.e., on 10.10.1971. Similarly,

seven other Block Periods were classified, which were the

periods between which direct recruitments were made.



     19.   In the provisional gradation list, the BBMP

placed all the promotees (the petitioners in the aforesaid

writ petitions i.e., W.P. No.39661/2016) below the direct

recruits. In other words, the direct recruits, who had been

                             - 64 -

                                      And Connected Matters




appointed as FDAs directly under the notification dated

04.10.2008 i.e., 9 months after the petitioners were

promoted on 18.01.2008 as FDAs, were considered as

seniors to the promotees. This was on the ground that the

promotees had occupied posts in excess of the posts

earmarked under the 50% quota for promotees.



     20.   The promotee-petitioners filed objections to the

said gradation list contending that it was impermissible for

the BBMP to place them below the direct recruits, since it

was an admitted fact that they were all promoted on

18.01.2008, whereas the direct recruits were recruited

subsequently on 04.10.2008 and onwards.



     21.   Despite the objections raised by the petitioners,

the BBMP proceeded finalise the gradation list           and

proceeded to issue the final gradation list on 09.09.2015.



     22.   In this final gradation list, the placement of the

promotee-FDAs (such as petitioners) below the directly

recruited FDAs (private respondents) was maintained.

     23.   This final gradation list was accompanied by

seven explanations.





     24.   The 2nd explanation stated that, the local

candidates, the erstwhile employees of the Town Municipal

Council which were merged with the BBMP, the employees

who had sought for change of cadre and the employees

appointed on compassionate appointment were considered

as direct recruits in the respective Block Periods, and their

appointment were finalized.





     25.   Similarly, the 3rd explanation stated that the

daily wage employees who had been regularized were also

considered under the direct recruitment quota.



     26.   The fourth explanation stated that the GO dated

05.07.1976 was applied in the matter of classifying and

calculating the vacancies between the direct recruits and

the promotees. The said explanation reads as follows:

     27.   As      could       be     seen             from      the        above,        the

classification and calculation of the vacancies was made as

per the GO dated 05.07.1976 and accordingly, rankings

were assigned as per the quota prescribed for the direct

recruits and promotees in the C & R Rules.

for these cases, indicated the manner in which the eight

Block Periods had been created, and said explanation

     29.     As could be seen from the above explanation,

the BBMP has clearly stated that direct recruitments had

been made on different dates and it was not clear as to

whether the direct recruitments had been done at one go

                              - 69 -

                                           And Connected Matters




or on different dates and therefore, the last of the dates

on which the direct recruitment was made, was considered

as the last date of direct recruitment for the purpose of

classifying and calculating the vacancies in the Block

Periods.





     30.   It may also be pertinent to state here that the

seventh Block Period spanned between 11.09.1977 and

04.10.2008 i.e., for a period of more than thirty-one

years. This fundamentally indicated that for this period of

thirty-one years, there had been no direct recruitments to

the post of FDAs at all and it was only on 04.10.2008 that

direct   recruitment   of   the       private   respondents   i.e.,

respondent Nos.3 to 112 had been made.



     31.   The 6th explanation also stated that the 8th

Block Period was being treated as an Open Block Period,

since the 125 excess promotions that had been in the

earlier Block Periods were to be adjusted and only after

the adjustment was completed by filling up the 125 posts

in the DR quota could the 8th Block Period be closed.

                                                                   - 70 -

                          32.      The 9th explanation stated that the details of

                the classification of the vacancies and the number of posts

                were         being          enumerated                 by       an        Annexure,              titled

                'Annexure-I'. This Annexure-I described the 'No rule

                period' and the eight Block Periods, and also indicated the

                number of posts which were available for direct recruits

                and promotees.





                          33.      The above-mentioned Annexure-I is reproduced

                herewith for the sake of clarity and better understanding:

                       34.    As could be seen from said Annexure, there was

             no occupation of the promotees in excess of their quota in

             the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th Block Periods, and only in the 2nd, 5th,

             6th, 7th and 8th Block Periods was there an encroachment

             of the promotees into the direct recruitment quota to the

             extent of 3+15+85+45 i.e., a total of 148 posts.



                       35.    The seventh Block Period i.e., the period from

             1977 to 2008, during which no direct recruitments were

             made, there was maximum encroachment of 85 direct

             recruitment posts by the promotees.

      36.   Since   the   promotee-petitioners    had      been

promoted on 18.01.2008 i.e., in the 7th Block Period and

these promotions were in excess of their quota, they were

placed below the private-respondents who had been

directly recruited on 4.10.2008.





      37.   For the subsequent eighth Block Period, which

is treated as an open Block Period, out of the 87 posts

reserved for direct recruitment and 88 posts reserved for

promotees, only 42 posts had been filled up by way of

direct recruitment and 133 posts were filled up by way of

promotion. In other words, there was a shortfall in filling

up the quota earmarked for direct recruitments to the

extent of 45 posts and there was an encroachment of the

promotees into the direct recruitment quota by the grant

of 45 excess promotions to the promotees.



      38.   The petitioners in W.P. Nos. 39961/2016 who

had been promoted on 18.01.2008 as FDAs much before

the   private   respondents       had   been   recruited    on

04.10.2008, have challenged this final gradation list dated

09.09.2015, principally on the ground that the Quota Rule

could not be applied by the BBMP, since it is glaringly

obvious that the Quota Rule had broken down completely.

It is their contention that the Rules were promulgated in

the year 1971 and the Quota Rule was never operated

ever since the promulgation of the Rules, and it is also an

admitted fact that there were no clear details regarding

the filling up of direct recruitment vacancies till 1977.



     39.   It is contended that from 1977 till 2008 i.e., for

a period of thirty one years, there was admittedly no

direct recruitment undertaken by the BBMP for the posts

of FDAs and it was, thus, obvious that the Quota Rule had

irretrievably broken down and consequently, the BBMP

could not have been applied the GOs dated 5.7.1976 and

14.12.1987 and prepare a gradation list by creating Block

Periods to classify and calculate the vacancies in order to

determine the inter se seniority of the FDAs.



     40.   The second batch of writ petitions i.e., W.P.

Nos.4296/2018     &   9775/2018       are   also   filed   by   the

promotees who have been working as Managers and who

had been promoted from the cadre of FDA.



     41.   It is their case that they were appointed as

SDAs between the period 01.09.1989 and 11.05.1994, and

were promoted as FDAs on 10.05.2007 and nearly a year

thereafter, on 04.10.2008, the private respondents had

been directly recruited as FDAs and therefore, they could

never be considered as seniors to them.



     42.   They contend that they were also promoted to

the next higher cadre of Managers on 11.05.2010, which,

according to the C & R Rules, were required to be filled up

100% by way of promotion from FDAs and a seniority list

was also published on 28.12.2013, in which they had been

assigned seniority from the date on which they had been

accorded promotions.





     43.   They contend that on 25.07.2016 i.e., nearly

six years after they had been promoted, the private

respondents had been promoted as Managers and they

were therefore, without any doubt, juniors to them in the

cadre of Manager.





     44.   They     are   aggrieved   by   an   order   dated

17.07.2017, by      which the private respondents, i.e.,

persons who had been recruited directly as FDAs and were

promoted on 25.07.2016 as Managers, have been granted

retrospective promotions with effect from 11.05.2010 on

the ground that their seniority had been refixed in the

feeder cadre of First Division Assistants (which is the

subject of the first batch of writ petitions) and they had

become eligible for promotion two years thereafter.



     45.   They are also aggrieved by the placement of

the said private respondents above them in the provisional

as well as the final seniority list published in the cadre of

Manager on 04.01.2018.





     46.   The direct recruits have also filed a petition in

W.P. No.56010/2018 challenging an order by which the

promotee-Mangers were placed in independent charge of

Assistant Revenue Officers on 03.07.2018, under Rule 32

of the Karnataka Civil Service Rules ("the KCSR"),

contending that they had been directly recruited between

the period 11.01.2008 and 23.10.2008, and they had all

been promoted as Assessors on 25.07.2016.



       47.   They also contend that the private respondents

(the    promotees)    were   promoted   as   Assessors   on

25.02.2015 and in the seniority list dated 10.01.2018,

they had been placed at Sl. Nos.406 to 436 and the

promotee-Assessors were placed at Sl. Nos.359 to 374,

and since they were given the eligibility year as 2010 by

virtue of the resolution dated 04.02.2013, they were

required to be considered as seniors to the promotee-

Assessors and in order to get over an seniority, an attempt

was being made to place them in independent charge

under Rule 32, though they did not possess the requisite

length of service.





       48.   The third batch of writ petitions i.e., W.P.

Nos.1130/2020, 3915/2020, 10879/2021 & 18471/2022

are filed by the promotees challenging the seniority list of

Assessors dated 08.11.2019.





     49.   The petitioner in W.P. No.10739/2020 and the

petitioner in W.P. No.1130/2020 are one and the same. In

the first writ petition i.e., in W.P. No. 1130/2020, he has

challenged the seniority list of Assessors dated 08.11.2019

and has also sought a direction to the BBMP to prepare the

gradation list in the ratio of 7:5:1 as per the C & R Rules.



     50.   In the second      writ    petition, i.e., in W.P.

No.10739/2020, he has challenged the Departmental

Promotion Committee ("the DPC") proceedings dated

15.02.2010 and also the subsequent gradation list of

Assessors which has been published on 11.06.2021.



     51.   W.P. No.5188/2021 is filed by the petitioners

who had been appointed on compassionate grounds and

were considered as direct recruits, challenging the final

gradation list of FDAs published (as on 01.01.2020),

Assessors on 01.08.2018 and they had been placed higher

than certain FDAs, but in the final gradation list dated

04.02.2021, they had been placed blow and their ranking

was brought down at Sl. Nos.850 to 884.



      52.   Learned counsel appearing for the promotees,

as   already    stated    above,     contend    that    there    has,

admittedly, been no direct recruitment virtually from the

time the C & R Rules were promulgated in 1971 and it was

strikingly clear that the Quota Rule had never been

operated upon and had, thus, broken down since its very

inception. They place reliance on the judgment rendered

by the Supreme Court in the case of Direct Recruit Class-

II Engineering Officers Association3 to contend that the

BBMP had seriously erred in applying the GOs dated

05.07.1976 and 14.12.1987, and applying the Block

Periods for the purposes of classifying and calculating the

vacancies and to determine the inter se seniority between

the promotees and the direct recruits, in coming to the

conclusion that there was encroachment of the promotees

into the direct recruitment quota.





     53.     They contend that since there was no direct

recruitment for more than thirty-one years, it will have to

be held that the promotions made in excess of the quota

and by encroaching upon the direct recruitment quota

would   have      to   considered         as   valid    promotions      and

consequently, the service rendered by such promotees

could not have been annulled by applying the Quota Rule

and thereby, alter their seniority.



     54.     Learned counsel appearing for the BBMP as well

as the direct recruits contended that once the C & R Rules

prescribed    a   quota    for   the       direct      recruits   and   the

promotees, the same had to be adhered to. They contend

that merely because no direct recruitment was conducted

for more than thirty-one years, it cannot be held that the

Quota Rule had broken down.

      55.   They contend that the promotions granted to

the promotees in excess of                their quota    were     only

fortuitous promotions and therefore, they cannot claim

any legal right on that basis for the proposed seniority.

They place reliance on the decision rendered by the Apex

Court in the case of Suraj Prakash Gupta4 to contend that

the promotions made in excess of their quota would only

be fortuitous promotion and on the basis of the service

rendered by such fortuitous promotions, they cannot claim

seniority if they have occupied the seats of direct recruits.

They contend that the promotees could claim seniority

only from the date the post became available to them in

their quota and any services that they had rendered by

virtue of their promotion in excess of their quota cannot be

counted for the purpose of seniority.



 
56.   It is also stated that since the seniority of the

directly recruited FDAs had been re-fixed by the final

gradation list and they were seniors to the promoted

FDAs, it had become necessary under the provisions of the

KCS (regulation of Promotion, Pay and Pension) Act, 1973

and the Rules framed under the Act to grant them

retrospective promotions.





       57.    In light of the arguments advanced, the points

that arise for consideration in this batch of writ petitions

are:



       (i)    Whether the petitioners have established
              that the Quota Rule had broken down as
              envisaged in the decision rendered by the
              Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in
              the   case    of     Direct   Recruit   Class-II
              Engineering Officers Association (supra) and
              have also consequentially established that
              their promotions were valid and they would
              thus be entitled to reckon their seniority from
              the dates on which they were promoted; and



       (ii)   Whether the private respondents (Directly
              Recruited FDAs) can be granted retrospective
              promotions as a result of the alteration of the
              seniority in the cadre of FDAs, and thereby,
              be placed in seniority above the FDAs who

           had been promoted earlier to them in the
           promotional cadres."





     58.   As stated above, the C & R Rules which were

framed in 1971 states that the post of FDAs would have to

be filled up by direct recruitment and by way of promotion

from the cadre of SDAs, in the ratio of 50:50. This

indicates that it was the intent of the Rules to ensure that

there was infusion of new talent in the FDA cadre and at

the same time, the cadre also contained SDAs whose

experience in the SDA cadre would benefit the FDA cadre,

and this would result in the FDA cadre having an ideal

blend of experience and youth.





     59.   Ideally, the BBMP was required to ensure that

the 50% of the posts in the FDA cadre were to be filled up

by way of direct recruitment and 50% of the posts were

filled up by promotion. However, it is not in dispute that

the BBMP did not undertake any direct recruitments from

1977 to 2008 i.e., for more than 31 years.

     61.     It is clear from the above that the direct

recruitments were not undertaken for this huge period of

31 years and promotions were not done in adherence to

the quota specified in the C & R Rules and this was

because of the Government instructions in that regard. It,

therefore, also follows that it was impossible for the BBMP

to adhere to the Quota Rule in the matter of direct

recruitments.





     62.     It may also be pertinent to notice here that it is

not the case of the BBMP that the promotions granted to

                                          And Connected Matters




the petitioners i.e., the promotees were either ad hoc or

temporary. In fact, the BBMP, in the statement of

objections filed in W.P. No. 4296/2018, has stated in

paragraph No.3 as follows:



           "3. It is submitted that, it is true that the
     petitioners   entered   the      service   of   erstwhile
     Bengaluru Mahangara Palike now known as BBMP
     between 1/9/1989 and 11/05/1994 as Second
     Division Clerks and it is also true that all the
     petitioners were promoted to the cadre of First
     Division Clerk with effect from 10/05/2007. It is
     also true that these respondents were appointed by
     way of Direct Recruitment to the services of the
     BBMP as First Division Clerks by the order dated
     4/10/2008. It is also true that the petitioners were
     further promoted to the cadre of managers with
     effect from 11/05/2010, without considering the
     valid objections of these private respondents by
     BBMP. It is not true and correct that the promotion
     of the petitioners was on regular basis. It is not
     correct that even in the feeder cadre to the post of
     Manager, the petitioners were seniors to the private
     respondents. The petitioners with the malafide
     intention have suppressed the fact that they are
     juniors to these respondents in the feeder cadre to
     the post of Managers and the petitioners have no

     where mentioned that they are juniors to the these
     respondents as per the final gradation list dated
     09/09/2015."



     63.   It is, therefore, clear from the above that the

petitioners-promotees were granted regular promotions,

though they were in excess of the entitlement to the quota

permissible for promotees.





     64.   The Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the

case of Direct Recruit Class-II Engineering Officers

Association (supra) has, on consideration of the case law

relating the disputes between the direct recruits and the

promotees in the matter of seniority, has declared as follows:


     "47. To sum up, we hold that:



     (A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post
     according to rule, his seniority has to be counted
     from the date of his appointment and not according
     to the date of his confirmation.



     The corollary of the above rule is that where the
     initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according
     to rules and made as a stop-gap arrangement, the

                          - 87 -

                                         NC: 2024:KHC:2508

                                    And Connected Matters



officiation in such post cannot be taken into account
for considering the seniority.



(B) If the initial appointment is not made by
following the procedure laid down by the rules but
the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly
till the regularisation of his service in accordance
with the rules, the period of officiating service will
be counted.



(C) When appointments are made from more than
one source, it is permissible to fix the ratio for
recruitment from the different sources, and if rules
are framed in this regard they must ordinarily be
followed strictly.



(D) If it becomes impossible to adhere to the
existing quota rule, it should be substituted by an
appropriate rule to meet the needs of the situation.
In case, however, the quota rule is not
followed continuously for a number of years
because     it   was   impossible   to   do   so   the
inference is irresistible that the quota rule had
broken down.



(E) Where the quota rule has broken down and
the appointments are made from one source
in excess of the quota but are made after
following the procedure prescribed by the
rules for the appointment, the appointees

                             - 88 -

                                         And Connected Matters



should       not   be     pushed       down    below    the

appointees from the other source inducted in
the service at a later date.



(F) Where the rules permit the authorities to
relax the provisions relating to the quota,
ordinarily a presumption should be raised that
there was such relaxation when there is a
deviation from the quota rule.



(G) The quota for recruitment from the different
sources      may    be      prescribed      by    executive
instructions, if the rules are silent on the subject.

(H) If the quota rule is prescribed by an executive
instruction, and is not followed continuously for a
number of years, the inference is that the executive
instruction has ceased to remain operative.

(I) The posts held by the permanent Deputy
Engineers     as   well    as    the    officiating   Deputy
Engineers under the State of Maharashtra belonged
to the single cadre of Deputy Engineers.

(J) The decision dealing with important questions
concerning a particular service given after careful
consideration should be respected rather than
scrutinised for finding out any possible error. It is
not in the interest of Service to unsettle a settled
position."

                                        (Emphasis supplied)



     65.   As could be seen from the declaration of law

rendered by the Constitutional Bench, it is settled law that

where an initial appointment was only ad hoc and not

according to the Rules, and were also made as a stop-gap

arrangement, their officiation in such posts cannot be

taken into account while considering seniority.



     66.   It is also held that where the initial appointment

is not made by following the procedure laid down by the

Rules,   but   the   appointee        continues   in   the    post

uninterruptedly till the regularization of his services, the

period of officiating service will be counted.



     67.   The Apex Court has also stated that if it

becomes impossible to adhere to the existing Quota Rules,

it should be substituted by an appropriate rule to meet the

ends of that situation. It has also declared that in case the

Quota Rule is not followed continuously for number of

years for the reason that it was impossible to do so, the

                            - 90 -

                                    And Connected Matters




irresistible inference would be that the Quota Rule had

broken down.





     68.   It has further held that if the Quota Rule has

broken down, the persons who were promoted in excess of

their quota cannot be pushed below the direct recruits who

had been appointed subsequently.





     69.   In light of this declaration of the Constitution

Bench, the issue to be examined is as to whether the

Quota Rule was not followed continuously for a

number of years because it was impossible to do so

and consequently, hold the Quota Rule had broken

down.





     70.   It would also have to be examined whether

the promotions made in favour of the petitioners

were ad hoc or a stop gap arrangement, or whether

they were in accordance with the Rules.



     71.   As already noticed above, in the proceedings

held on 31.08.2015 for considering the objections to the

                              - 91 -

gradation list, it has been clearly recorded that the BBMP

was unable undertake direct recruitments and adhere to

the Quota Rule due to Government instructions in that

regard. If, as a matter of fact, the Government has issued

instructions   to   the   BBMP        not   to   undertake   direct

recruitments, it is obvious that it was impossible for the

BBMP to undertake direct recruitment even if it so desired.



     72.   It should also be noticed here that if the BBMP

was unable to undertake direct recruitment for more than

3 decades, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that

the Quota Rule was not followed continuously for a

considerable number of years. It should also be kept in

mind that the C & R Rules were framed in 1971 and from

1977 to 2008, i.e., for 31 years, the Quota Rule was not

followed continuously. In other words, virtually, from the

date of framing the Rules, the Quota Rule was not followed

at all and the inescapable conclusion that is required to be

drawn is that the Quota Rule had broken down.

     73.   The BBMP, in its counter, has admitted that the

promotees were promoted in excess of their quota in the

cadre of FDA and these promotions were made prior to the

recruitment of the private respondents, by way of direct

recruitment in the cadre of FDA.





     74.   It is also admitted that the promotees were

promoted prior to the direct recruitment in the cadre of

Assessor and also in the cadre of Manger.



     75.   In light of the fact that the Quota Rule was not

followed continuously for 31 years, it is absolutely clear

that the Quota Rule had broken down, as contemplated

under the decision rendered in the Direct Recruit's case

referred to above.





     76.   As a consequence, the further dicta laid down in

the said case [Clause (e)] that when the Quota Rule had

broken down and appointments were made from one

source in excess of the quota and the same were made in

accordance with the Rules, the rule that the appointees

                                      - 93 -

                                                         NC: 2024:KHC:2508

                                                   And Connected Matters




should not be pushed below the appointees who had been

appointed subsequently, would also stand attracted and

would be applicable in the present case.



     77.        As already held above, the BBMP admitted that

promotions had been given to the petitioners in excess of

their quota and it only contends that these promotions

were irregular and illegal, since they contravened the

quota.   The       fact   that   the          petitioners   were    granted

promotions in accordance with their seniority and in

accordance with the Rules, though the promotions are in

excess     of     their   entitled     quota,       is   not   in   dispute.

Consequently, the petitioners cannot be pushed below the

private respondents-direct recruits in the seniority list.



     78.        There is yet another factor to be considered in

this case, in the context of the dicta at Clause (f) of the

aforementioned judgment, which states that where the

Rules permit the authorities to relax the provisions relating

to a quota, presumption should be drawn that here was

relaxation when there was deviation from the Quota Rule.

     79.   Rule 10 of C & R Rules reads as follows:


           "10. Appointment by direct recruitment
     or promotion in certain cases.- Notwithstanding
     anything   contained   in    these    Regulations   for
     Recruitment specially made in respect of any post
     the Commissioner or the Corporation may.-



           (a) Recruit by direct recruitment to a post
     reserved to be filled by promotion when he or it is
     satisfied that the persons eligible to be considered
     for appointment by promotion are in the immediate
     Lower Grade not fit to be so appointed;



           (b) Fill up by promotion any vacancy relating
     to a post which is required to be filled by direct
     recruitment provided an appointment under this
     sub-clause shall not be continued for a period of
     more six months except with the concurrence of the
     Karnataka Public Service Commission."



     80.   As could be seen from said Sub-rule (b) of Rule

10, there is indeed a provision which permits relaxation of

the Quota Rule, though the relaxation in case of making

promotions into the quota earmarked for the direct

recruits is to normally not exceed 6 months. This power to

relax, in the context of the present case wherein the

Government had issued orders/directions not to undertake

direct recruitment for 31 long years, would have to be

considered as an exercise of this power of relaxation by

the Government in relation to the deviation from the

Quota Rule. Consequently, as laid down in Clause (f) of

the Direct Recruit's case (supra), it would become

imperative to draw the presumption that the power of

relaxation had been exercised, and consequently, the

promotions made in excess of the quota would have to be

held as valid promotions.





 
81.   Reliance placed by the BBMP on the decision of

the Apex Court in the case of 
Suraj Prakash Gupta


(supra) would be of no avail, since the Apex Court was

dealing with a case relating to posts held by the

promotees therein on ad hoc basis or as a stop-gap

arrangement and the question of the Quota Rule having

broken down was not being considered.

     82.   Resultantly, the 1st question would have to be

answered in favour of the petitioner-promotees and it will

have to be held that the Quota Rule had not been followed

continuously for 31 long years and the Quota Rule had,

thus, broken down.





     83.   As a necessary consequence, it will also have to

be held that the promotions granted to the petitioners in

excess of their quota were valid and their seniority will

have to be counted from the dates on which they were

granted their respective promotions.



     84.   As a result of the above, the gradation list of

the FDAs dated 09.09.2015 is quashed, and the BBMP is

directed to re-do the seniority list without applying the

Quota Rule and assign seniority to the promotees from the

dates on which they were promoted.





     85.   As far as further promotions and the seniority

lists in the promotional cadre of Manager (which are the

subject matter of W.P. No. 4296/2018 and W.P. No.

petitioners therein were promoted as Managers much prior

to the directly recruited FDAs and only by virtue of the re-

fixation of the seniority of these directly recruited FDAs in

the   FDA   cadre   have   they       been    given   retrospective

promotions from the date on which they became eligible to

be promoted as Managers.





      86.   Since it has not been held that the seniority of

the promotee-FDAs is to be re-fixed from the date on

which they were promoted, as their promotions were valid,

the directly recruited FDAs will have to be placed below

them and they would, thus, not be entitled to claim

seniority on the basis of the applicability of the Quota

Rule. Consequently, the retrospective promotions granted

to them under the order dated 10.07.2017 shall stand

quashed. The promotions granted to them originally, shall

however, subsist.





      87.   The BBMP will have to thereby re-do the

seniority list in the cadre of Manager without granting the

directly recruited FDAs retrospective seniority and grant

them seniority only from the date that they were initially

promoted i.e., with effect from 25.07.2016.



     88.   In respect of the writ petitions which have been

filed challenging the seniority list in the cadre of Assessor

dated 08.11.2019, i.e., W.P. No. 1130/2020, W.P. No.

3918/2020,    W.P.    No.   10879/2021     and    W.P.   No.

18471/2022, it is to be stated here that the petitioners

were promoted as Assessors (re-designated post of Asst

Octroi Superintendents) from the cadre of First Grade

Revenue Inspectors, Revenue Inspectors and FDAs in the

ratio of 7:5:1, and as a consequence of the re-fixation of

seniority in the cadre of FDAs by the gradation list dated

09.09.2015, their respective seniority in the cadre of

Assessor has been altered. In light of this judgment, by

which the gradation list dated 09.09.2015 of FDAs,

wherein the seniority assigned to the directly recruited

FDAs has been quashed, the seniority of the petitioners

will have to be restored and they would have to be placed

                                 - 99 -

above the directly recruited FDAs. Consequently, the BBMP

will also have to re-do the seniority of the assessors, in

light of this judgment.





        89.    W.P. No.56010/2018, which has been filed by

the direct recruits challenging the orders, by which the

promotees were placed in independent charge under Rule

32, will have to be dismissed, since it has now been held

that the promotions granted to the promotees in the cadre

of FDA cannot be found fault with.





        90.    W.P. No.5188/2021 filed by the direct recruits

i.e.,    the    persons   who      had      been     appointed     on

compassionate grounds cannot be granted promotion on

the basis of the DPC decision dated 01.08.2018, since the

right of the promotees to be placed above the direct

recruitees has been upheld by this order. Hence, said

petition is also dismissed.





        91.    Consequently,   the       second   question   is   also

answered in favour of the promotees and it is held that the

                                  - 100 -

directly recruited FDAs could not have been granted

retrospective promotions and they could not also be

assigned      seniority   over   the       persons   who   had   been

promoted from the promotee cadre.
