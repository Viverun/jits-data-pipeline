    Course   increased to 25% in place of 15%.    The reservation of 25% 

    for   Post   Graduate   Diploma   Course,   kept   intact.   There   is   no   much 





    quarrel with regard to the existence of these two recognized sources

                    medicine, surgery, pediatrics and gynecology.   There are  
                                           
                    13   such   subjects;   (ii)   Non-clinical   subjects.     The   State  
                    Government   has   taken   the   position   that   for   in   service  
                    candidates,   the   13   clinical   subjects   are   of   relevance  
                                          
                    because in service candidates are obliged to continue in  
                    government   service   after   passing   their   postgraduate  
                    examinations.  Consequently the reservation of 25% for in  
                    service   candidates   is   applied   after   excluding   seats  
         


                    allocated   to   the   all   India   quota   and     non-clinical  
      



                    postgraduate   seats.     Presently   a   total   of   237   seats   in  
                    government colleges were available for degree courses in  
                    clinical   subjects,   of   which   59   have   been   allotted   to   in  
                    service   candidates.     For   diploma   courses,   of   the   total  





                    number   of   96   seats,   24   are   available   for   in   service  
                    candidates.



                    5      The   submission   of   the   Petitioners   is   that   the  





                    rationale   for   the   Government   Resolution   dated   22  
                    February  1996 and as noted in the earlier Government  
                    Resolution dated 24 October 1991, is the need to provide  
                    an   incentive   for   candidates   to   enter   government   service  
                    after  completing their  M.B.B.S. Since medical graduates  
                    are unwilling to do so, government service was sought to  
                    be incentivised   by setting apart a certain proportion of  
                    seats   for   in   service   candidates   to   pursue   their  


                                                                                                 23/130


                                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:41 :::

                    postgraduate   studies   either   for   a   degree   or   diploma.  
                    Hence,   it   has   been   submitted   that   bearing   in   mind   the  
                    aforesaid justification, there is no reason to exclude  50%  




                                                                                            
                    seats   of   the   all   India   quota   and     seats   in   non-clinical  
                    subjects, while working out the reservation for in service  




                                                                    
                    candidates.  As noted earlier, the reservation for in service  
                    candidates   was   increased   to   25%   by   a   Government  
                    Resolution dated 22 February 1996.

                    6       ....



                    7      However, we find that there is a lack of clarity on  
                    the part of the government in the sense that it would have  




                                                               
                    been appropriate for the government to come out with a  
                    comprehensive   Government   Resolution   setting   out   the  
                                           
                    basis   on   which   the   reservation   of   25%   for     in   service  
                    candidates should be worked out.  Since that has not been  
                    done, candidates are left in a state of uncertainty of the  
                                          
                    manner in which the reservation for in service candidates  
                    would be implemented.  This is an unsatisfactory state of  
                    affairs.     As we have noted earlier, even this Court was  
                    considerably   handicapped   without   the   Government  
         


                    Resolution dated 24 October 1991 being placed before it.  
                    Though   the   hearing   of   the   Petition   was   adjourned   on  
      



                    more than one occasion, that Government Resolution was  
                    not forthcoming.  The Court has now been informed that  
                    admissions for postgraduate degree and diploma courses  





                    had been completed and there are no vacant seats for in  
                    service candidates.  



                    8       In this view of the matter, we consider it appropriate  
                    to direct that in order to obviate the situation that has  





                    occurred for the present year, the State Government shall  
                    come   out   with   a   Government   Resolution   specifying   the  
                    manner in which the reservation for in service candidates  
                    shall   be   worked   out   from   the   next   academic   year.     We  
                    would   expect   that   this   exercise   should   be   completed  
                    expeditiously   and   well   in   time,   so   that   in   service

    12                   There is nothing even suggested and/or even argued with 




                                                                        
    regard to the restriction of 50% for Diploma Course only in 2009 MCI 

    Regulation.   The   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   directed   the   State   to

    for in-service candidates should be worked out from the next academic

    13                   On 24 November 2012, without complying with the orders 

    and directions given by this Court, the State Government proceeded 
         


    for common entrance test.                            There is nothing on record to show and 
      



    suggested   that   the   State   have   challenged   these   two   orders,   at   any 

    point of time and/or till this date.

    till   25   June   2013,   (later   on   vacated   also)   and   prayed   to   apply

    5214 of 2012) dated 5 July 2012, again reiterated and directed the 
                                           
    State in the following words:-




                    "4. The   Common   Entrance   Test   was   held   on  
                    24/11/2012.   One would have expected that in view of  
                    the directions given by Division Bench of this Court, the  
                    Government would have acted well in time and it ought to  
         


                    have   issued   the   appropriate   Resolution   as   per   the  
                    directions given by this Court.  However, unfortunately, no  
      



                    Resolution   was   issued   either   prior   to   24/11/2012   or  
                    immediately   thereafter.     The   Government   however   has  
                    issued   two   Resolutions,   the   first   Resolution   is   dated  





                    21/6/2013 and the other Resolution dated 2/7/2013 in  
                    which   totally   new   stand   has   been   taken   by   the   State  
                    Government.

                    decision   has   been taken by  the  Government  in the first  
                    Resolution dated 21/6/2013 and second Resolution dated  
                    2/7/2013, in our view, it would be appropriate to direct  
                    as an interim measure that since the Government has not  
                    issued the Resolution well in time as directed by Division

                    5/7/2012   should   prevail   after   this   order.     The   interim  
                    stay which has been granted by this Court by order dated

                    should commence. 



                    6      So far as the effect of two Resolutions viz. Resolution  
                    dated 21/6/2013 and 2/7/2013 is concerned, the same  
                    can be taken into consideration at the final hearing of this  




                                                                
                    Petition.  Petition shall be heard and disposed of finally at  
                    the   stage   of   admission.     Further   affidavit   in   reply,  
                    rejoinder to be filed within eight weeks from today."



                         The matters were kept thereafter for final disposal. Now 
                                           
    listed accordingly. 



    16                   In   pending  Writ  Petition   No. 5290 of  2013,  as recorded 
         


    above,   on   4   July   2013,   this   Court   has   again   directed   the   State   to 
      



    consider   and   distribute   the   seats   based   upon   the   then   existing 

    reservation policy and specially 1990/1996 qua Degree and Diploma 





    Course in question. 



    17                   The   issue   is   that   on   21   June   2013,   the   State   again 

    reiterated their own stand and 25% seats in each category reserved for 

    in-service candidates after excluding the seats of all India quota.  On 2 

    July 2013, the State for the first time relying on the Clause 9 (1)(b)

    under:-

                     mentioned. Taken on board.

                     urgency expressed. The learned GP appearing for the  
                     State   of   Maharashtra,   who   is   contesting   party,  
                     submitted   that   the   Medical   Education   and   Drugs  





                     Department, State of Maharashtra insisting that no  
                     seats   would   be   made   available   to   the   in   service

                     Resolution/Policy of MCI (MCI Regulations 2000).  



                     2]     However, the Public Health Department (State  
                     of   Maharashtra)   seriously   contending   that   the   said  
                     Policy   is   not   in   the   interest   of   Medical   Officers  
                     working in Health Department. Therefore, there is a  
                     clear conflict within the Department itself of the State

                     in Writ Petition  No.1937 of 2014 pointed out, apart

                     India     Regulations   of   2000   has   substantially  
                     superseded and therefore in view of the decision, the

                     inclined to grant one week time, as a last chance, to

                     to continue till then."



                         The   interim   order   so   passed   based   upon   the   statement 
         


    made is still continues. 



    25                   The State (Public Health Department) deals with providing 





    medical services to tribal and non-tribal or rural area in Maharashtra. 



    They have mechanism to appoint/select specialists which are required 





    for the community.  All, inspite of bonds, are not joining rural services. 



    Once the in-service candidates joined Post-Graduate Degree Course, 

    they   would   have   no   choice   but   to   join   such   services   after   post 

    graduation also.   No reason to restrict only for Diploma Course, by

    overlooking the importance of Degree Courses and need of speciality

    shows non-application of mind by the Public Health Department of the 

    State , apart from needs of the community.  It is certainly not within

    Health   Department,   requirement   of   Degree   avenue   for   in-service 
          


    candidates also.  It noway eliminates the right and entitlement of the 
       



    Petitioners   and   so   also   the   requirement   of   special   doctors,   degree 

    holders in rural areas. The relevant paragraph reads as under:-




              "176.          There can be no controversy that the standard  
              of education all over the country is not the same. Each State  
              has its own system and pattern of education, including the  
              medium   of   instruction.   It   cannot   also   be   disputed   that  





              children in the metropolitan areas enjoy greater privileges  
              than their counterparts in most of the rural areas as far as

              Government   to   support   a   single   entrance   examination

              educational   standards   in   different   parts   of   the   country

              urban   areas   and   whose   availability   in   a   crisis   is   quite

              recognition to merit is laudable, but the pragmatic realities  
                                          
              on the ground relating to health care, especially in the rural  
              and   tribal   areas   where   a   large   section   of   the   Indian  
              population   resides,   have   also   to   be   kept   in   mind   when  
              policy decisions are taken in matters such as this. While the  
         


              country certainly needs brilliant doctors and surgeons and  
      



              specialists and others connected with health care, who are  
              equal to any in other parts of the world, considering ground  
              realities, the country also has need for "barefoot doctors",  
              who  are  committed and are available to provide medical  





              services and health care facilities in different areas as part  
              of their mission in becoming doctors."

    and/or the State/Higher Authority can take a decision in the matter, 




                                                               
    in view of clear conflict between two relevant State Departments.  It is 
                                           
    not   because   there   is   a   conflict   between   the   Departments,   but   it   is 
                                          
    because,   if   the   State   has   a   power   to   change   a   policy/decision,   it 

    cannot be on the basis of such shaky foundation in view of conflict of 
          


    views between the concerned Departments itself.



    28                   There cannot be any dispute with regard to the power and 





    authority   of   the   State   Government   and/or   such   authority   to   take 

    decision.  But should be based upon the sufficient and clear material 





    and specifically when it is a question of change in alleged policy of 

    abolishing the reservation of 25% for Degree courses, based upon the 

    alleged   (17   November  2009)   Clause  9(3)   of   MCI   Regulation.     The 

    amendment   itself   recognized   the   requirement   of   in-service   seats, 



                                                                                             35/130

    though insistence made for Diploma Course only.  



    29                   The conflict between the two departments itself shows that

    30                   The   conflict   between   the   two   departments   that   they 

    themselves are not sure which part of the policy prior and/or new is in 
         


    the interest of public at large.  Normally, the scope of writ jurisdiction 
      



    is very limited so also the power of judicial review, but when it goes to 

    root of deciding the action and/or inaction of the State, even with 





    regard   to   the   change   in   distribution   of   seats,   thereby   completely 

    restricted   the   admission   of   the   students/Medical   Officers   for   the 





    Degree Course, it is revocable.  



    31                   We are not deciding and/or neither there is an argument 

    made that the other reservation so granted, qua diploma and/or open

    candidates   and/or   All   India   Quota,   are   bad   in   law.   The   restrictive 

    submission   is   the   change   of     policy   decision,   as   alleged   only   with

    in a given case, could have opted for the Degree Course.  There is no 

    much   issue   with   regard   to   the   rights   and   entitlement   of   in-service 




                                                               
    candidates.  The class is recognized and accepted by all and so also its 

    Authorities.     There   is   no   even   change   to   that   effect   in   the   rules. 



    Therefore,   there   is   no   reason   to   deal   with   the   requirement   and/or 
                                           
    existence   of   in-service   clause/sources   so   created   in   so   many   years. 



 
The   restriction   so   put   up   without   assessing   or   discussing   anything 

    suddenly, is an additional factor as there are apparently absent from 
          


    the   preamble   and/or   impugned   circulars/notification.   Though   the 
       



    reference   is   made   to   the   earlier   order   of   this   Court  
Dr.   Vaishali
  

    (Supra), they overlooked and misinterpreted the judgment.  The state 





    relied   upon   those   2009     Regulations   in   support   of   their   change   in 

    stand. This sudden and abrupt decision by overlooking the pending 





    Petitions and decisions given by this Court, definitely required to be 

    tested under 
Article 226
 of the Constitution of India.

    Diploma   Course   only.   There   is   no   challenge   so   far   as   the   MCI 
          


    Regulations to the extent of insistence for 50% reservation only for 
       



    Diploma.     Even   if   there   is   any   insistence   so   referred,   in   no   way

    restricted   and/or   debar   that   there   should   be   no   reservation 





    whatsoever for Degree Course.  It is relevant to note that we are not 

    dealing with the "standard of education" and/or "qualification issue"




    and "Constitutional reservation".  It is legally recognized two sources, 

    for   the   Post-Graduate   Courses.   The   restriction   so   imposed   by   this

    rules   flows   from   
Article   162

    But, at the same stroke, it is difficult to overlook all these provisions 
                                          
    which  entitled  and/or  empowered  the  State  and/or  MCI  to control

    "subject to"  other Constitutional provisions.   This definitely includes, 
       



    
Article 14
, as well as, the 
Article 41
 of the Constitution of India.  The

                                     proviso   to

                                     That is, if the appropriate legislature has  
                                     passed an Act, under 
Article 309
, the rules,  
                                     framed under the proviso, will have effect,

                     gainsaying that Section of the Act is by reason of the

                     without looking into 
Section 31
 and giving it primacy  
                     over the provisions of 
Section 30
. That is precisely the  
                     object which the expression "subject to the provisions

Section 30(1)

                     achieve.



                This itself means that the State Legislature is empowered  




                                                               
                to enact laws even if it falls within the ambit of Concurrent

                provisions. The State, therefore, is competent to enact the  
                laws   after   taking   note   of   above   provisions.   The   State  
                Legislature, therefore, if enacts laws for the respective State  
                                          
                based upon the need and to achieve the object revolving  
                around   the   State   conditions   and   in   the   interest   of  
                particular   class   or   community,   in   the   present   case  
                consumer/farmer/agriculturist   the   issue   of   repugnancy  
         


                and/or inconsistency even if any, need to be tested on the  
                basis of actual comparisons of the respective provisions of  
      



                Central as well as State enactments. The comparison itself  
                requires the existence of two conflicting laws."



                         There is no repugnancy and/or conflict of any power by 

    the State.   In the present case as it is prerogative of State to frame 

    Post-Graduate admission rules in question, based upon the declared 





    policy.   The State's power and authority flowing from 
Article 162

    the Constitution of India, is also "subject to" all other constitutional

    of their own conflicts in between the two departments, it is sufficient 

    to observe that as they themselves are not clear to implement and/or 




                                                               
    not to implement, therefore, they have clearly taken shelter of 2009 

    MCI Regulation and tried to justify their abrupt stand.   The rights of

    ought   to   have   provided   with   the   reason   and/or   the   decision.   They 
                                          
    cannot act abruptly and discriminately by taking away the rights of in-



    service candidates, to have an option of higher Degree Courses and/or 
         


    specialized courses in the field but kept open avenue only for Diploma 
      



    Course. 



    36                   At this stage, it is necessary to observe that every student, 

    one   who   passed   MBBS   examination,   though   they   are   treated   as 





    Medical Officer "in-service candidate", their rights and entitlement to 

    have a higher study of their choice, just cannot be curtailed in such 

    fashion without even giving sufficient time and/or notices.   We are

    circumstances for the simple reason that even pending these Petitions, 

    it   was   pointed   out   that   the   State   would   like   to   consider   the

    as   taken,   in   my   view,   cannot   be   stated   to   be   within   the   State 

    Government   powers/domain   and   even   if   they   have   such   powers,

    difficult to accept that it is well within the framework of law and the 
                                          
    Regulations   apart   from   their   long   standing   and   consistent 

    representation/circulars.     The   State,   for   want   of   specific   challenge 
         


    cannot take away the seats of in-service candidates, on the foundation 
      



    of "Reservation  for  in-service candidates   affect  also the  open  seats

    own circulars  and other clauses of the impugned circular.

    Constitution   itself   required   to   provide   all   resources   to   all   the

     Vs. Union of India & Ors.  3  recently and even otherwise recognized 

    the   doctrine   of   "Legitimate   Expectation"   "Promissory   Estoppel"   to 




                                                                                         
    mean   and   read   and   include   "rule   of   law",   "trust".     The   relevant 




                                                                 
    principles  are as under:-



             "1. The doctrine of legitimate expectation can be invoked  




                                                                
             as a substantive and enforceable right.



             2.      The   doctrine of legitimate  expectation is founded on  
             the   principle   of   reasonableness   and   fairness.   The   doctrine  




                                                               
             arises   out   of   principles   of   natural   justice   and   there   are  
             parallels between the doctrine of legitimate expectation and  
                                           
             promissory estoppel.



             3.      Where the decision of an authority is founded in public  
                                          
             interest as per executive policy or law, the court would be  
             reluctant to interfere with such decision by invoking doctrine  
             of legitimate expectation. The legitimate expectation doctrine  
             cannot be invoked to fetter changes in administrative policy  
          


             if it is in the public interest to do so.



             4.     The   legitimate   expectation   is   different   from  
             anticipation   and   an   anticipation   cannot   amount   to   an  
             assertable   expectation.   Such   expectation   should   be  
             justifiable, legitimate and protectable.



             5.    The   protection   of   legitimate   expectation   does   not  
             require   the   fulfillment   of   the   expectation   where   an  
             overriding public interest requires otherwise. In other words,  





             personal   benefit   must   give   way   to   public   interest  and   the  
             doctrine   of   legitimate   expectation   would   not   be   invoked  
             which could block public interest for private benefit."

    42                   There   is   no   incentive/weightage   given,   if   in-service 
                                           
    candidates want to go for Degree Course.  Such restriction is contrary 
                                          
    to the Constitutional provisions for the simple reason that the State's 

    obligation to provide/give medical services at the rural areas will be 
         


    restricted.  The student one who wants to go for Diploma Course will 
      



    join the services for incentive/weightage.   The issue is, if the whole 

    world   recognized   that   the   Degree   course   including   the   specialized 





    medical   field   and   some   one   who   after   taking   note   of   Government 

    policy,   actually   worked   in   the   rural   areas   now   wants   to   claim   the 





    weightage and incentive rights, but now in view of this, the insistence 

    is, as the State has a power, they can change this policy and control 

    even   such   students   career   and   restricted   everyone   whosoever   in-



    service and directed to go for the Diploma, in no way can be stated to

    challenged   only   with   regard   to   the   Degree   avenue,   and   not   the

    one   who   get   admission   in   Degree   course   through   their   in-service 
                                          
    channel/sources, are direct competitor with the meritorious students, 

    based upon academic marks.  The challenge is not bonafide.  It is half 
         


    hearted.  The   50%  Diploma or 25% in  two part, the  quota of open 
      



    category   remain   same.   It   is   settled   that   the   meritorious   candidates 

    need to be given preference, the open category candidates on their 





    own merits are entitled to get the Degree avenue.  But the Petitioners 

    like   person,   in   view   of   above,   have   deprived   of   their   rights   to   get 





    Degree   avenue,   therefore,   the   challenge   and/or   the   case   of   the 

    Petitioner/open category for the reasons so recorded above, is difficult

    services that they would be provided this incentive and/or weightage, 

    is absolutely unacceptable for the simple reason that their incentive 




                                                               
    has   nothing   to   do   with   their   service   conditions.     Both   things   are 

    difficult.   There was nothing expected and/or declared that for want

    are not entitled for any weightage and/or such incentive for Degree 
                                          
    Course.   Both these rights are different from the respective point of 

    view and in any way, not acceptable.  I am deciding the issue of their 
         


    weightage and incentive, based upon the admitted fact of their service 
      



    in   rural   areas.     The   submission   was   also   made   that   higher   study 

    avenue is also available for the Diploma holder and therefore,  there is 





    nothing prevent them from having higher study including PhD. It is 

    hard   to   accept   such   submission   as   the   third   person   and/or   party 





    cannot dictate how, when and which course student should adopt to 

    get   the   higher   degree.  For  the   reasons  recorded   above,  there  is  no 

    question   to   entertain   the   Petition   filed   by   the   non-in-service 

    candidates.

    the admission rules.  Apart from the facts of the case and the reasons 

    so recorded above, the same Full Bench Judgment itself clarified that 




                                                               
    "if change warrants, then only change is permissible".   The relevant 
                                           
    paragraph 54 reads as under:-




             "54.  That in relation to policy matters the Courts would  
                   not ordinarily interfere with the Government decision  
                   does not, however, mean that the Government can act  
                   arbitrarily.   That  would  be  totally  destructive  of the  
          


                   Rule of Law and the Constitutional Scheme and the  
                   peculiar   position   of   the   Government   in   a  
       



                   constitutional   set   up.   Arbitrary   decisions   would   be  
                   inconsistent with 
Article 14
 of the Constitution. The  
                   minimum that is, therefore, necessary is adverting to  





                   the   relevant   material,   eschewing   all   irrelevant  
                   considerations and a proper exercise of mind. More  
                   serious   thought   process   is   required,   and   clearer  
                   indication of application of mind is mandated, when

                   important aspect of life. In the present case, therefore,  
                   a   change   should   have   been,   as   indicated   in   the  
                   Gujarat case, preceded by views expressed by expert

    is arbitrary, discriminatory and different treatment has been given to

    now, to continue to study without rendering service in Government 
         


    hospitals,   clinics   and   get   the   Degree   Course.     The   experience   of 
      



    medical officers, who have been actually and practically working in 

    these hospitals/clinics, cannot be stated to be of no use and cannot be 





    stated   to   be   that   they   are   less   meritorious   compared   to   the   open

    interfering   with   the   rest   of   the   notification,   not   inclined   to   give

    Degree, as well as, the Diploma.  



    53                   For the above reasons the submission revolving around the 

    Maharashtra   University   Act   is   also   unacceptable.     The   University 

    and/or such authorities are also and always under obligation to follow

    University Health Science Act, 1998
 (for short MUHS Act) with regard 

    to "control and "regulate" and to distribute the seats at Graduate and 




                                                               
    post-graduate level is unacceptable.   The power and authority based 
                                           
    upon   the   constitutional   provisions   cannot   be   permitted   by   the 
                                          
    University Act, so far as medical/dental education and relates aspects. 



    The well recognized "control", regulation/rules under the 
IMC Act
 and 
         


    regulations cannot be taken away by the MUHS Act.  This in no way 
      



    sufficient to deny the Petitioners' right/entitlement.  The limited role 

    of   the   University   to   register   and/or   enroll   students   and   to   control 





    examinations and its results in time, just cannot be overlooked.   The 

    power   is  different   and so  also  the   field.    The   submission  revolving 





    around the MUHS Act are rejected for above reason itself.

    The State , the MCI, as well as, the open candidates submission by 
                                          
    overlooking this and submission to maintain the notification as it is 

    stating it to be within the domain and power of the State is therefore, 
          


    unacceptable.



    56                   The   issue   of   jurisdiction,   the   Petitioners   being  in-service 





    candidates is also not acceptable in view of earlier orders passed by 

    this Court and the pendency of the present Petitions, specially at this 





    state of final hearing of the matter.

    reservation/distribution of the seats should be on the basis of original 

    declaration   of   1996   circulars,   though   circulars   were   already

    creation of vacuum, once the impugned circular/letter set aside.  The 
         


    position/rules/operating   before   coming   into   force   of   the   impugned 
      



    circular be restored for this year 2014-2015. The state may, if time 

    permit   frame  policy/admission rule in view of above  reasons.   The 





    admission process should not be hampered/stopped.  I am inclined to 

    observe so far as the rights of State to fix the percentage, as they are 





    free to do so, the percentage so fixed for two sources each Diploma 

    and   Degree,   need   to   be   followed   for   the   year   2014-2014   in   the 

    circumstances.

    JUDGMENT:- (Per- M.S.SONAK, J.) (Dissenting)

                              Pronounced on                     : 24 March, 2014


               1]        With deepest respect to my elder brother, I am unable to




                                                                        
               agree with the opinion now expressed by him. Hence, the present

               dissent.



               2]
                                           
                         The Petitioners in these batch of Petitions (except Writ

               Petition No.1933 of 2014) in effect, seek an appropriate writ to direct
                                          
               the State of Maharashtra (State) to provide for 'reservation' or a

               'quota' of 25%                   seats for "in-service candidates" at the Post
         


               Graduate Degree Courses for the academic year 2014-15 at State
      



               run Medical Colleges.



               3]        As of now, the PGM-CET 2014 Brochure issued by the

               Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), at clause

               7.1 provides that the seats available for admission to medical





               postgraduate courses will be distributed as 50% to all India Quota

               and remaining 50% to the State Quota. From the State quota all the

               PG Degree Seats will be distributed to regular PGM CET (Non In-



               service) candidates. Further, from the State quota 50% Diploma



                                                                                                      68/130


                                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:42 :::

               Seats from Government Medical Colleges will be distributed to the

               In-service Candidates from the Public Health Department and ESIS




                                                                                               
               Department as per GR of Medical Education and Drugs Department




                                                                       
               No. 1013/CR 137/ Edu-2 dated 2.7.2013.



               4]        Thus, in terms of clause 7.1 of the aforesaid Brochure to be

               read with GR dated 2.7.2013, the State has provided for a

               reservation or a quota to the extent of 50% Postgraduate Diploma




                                                               
               Seats to the in-service candidates. By this batch of Petitions (except
                                           
               Writ Petition No.1933 of 2014), the Petitioners who are in-service
                                          
               candidates, seek reservation or quota in respect of Postgraduate

               Degree Seats for the academic year 2014-15. The reliefs in each of
         

               the Petitions are not happily worded. However, in substance, the
      



               Petitioners seek a writ of mandamus to strike down the GR dated

               2.7.2013 and to provide for reservation or quota in respect of

               Postgraduate Degree Courses.



               5]        The facts necessary for appreciation of the challenge are few





               and not in serious dispute. There is no dispute that the Petitioners

               are employees of the State rendering services as "Medical Officers".



               Consequently, the Petitioners clearly answer the definition of 'in-



               service candidates'.                       By Government Resolution (GR) dated

               6.1.1990, the State was pleased to reserve 15% seats for


                                                                                                    69/130

               Postgraduate Degree Courses and 25% seats for Postgraduate

               Diploma Courses for in-service candidates in purported compliance

               Maharashtra vs. Anjali Thukral. By GR dated 22.2.1996, the

               percentage of reservation for Postgraduate Degree Courses was




                                                               
               increased from 15% to 25%. On or about 11.6.2012, Writ Petition

               No.5214 of 2012 came to be filed in this Court seeking inter alia a

               direction to the State to specify the manner and modality for




                                                               
               determination of the precise content of 25% of reservation in
                                           
               Postgraduate Degree and Diploma Courses for the in-service
                                          
               candidates. This Petition was disposed of by judgment and order

               dated 5.7.2012 to which reference in some details shall be made
         

               hereafter. Suffice at this stage to mention that by judgment and
      



               order dated 5.7.2012 directions were issued to the State to come out

               with a GR specifying the manner in which the reservation for in-



               service candidates shall be worked out from the next academic year,





               i.e., 2013-2014, so that the in-service candidates for whom such

               reservation is intended to act as an incentive, are not left in a state





               of uncertainty. As there was no compliance with the directions

               issued by this Court on 5.7.2012, on or about 20.6.2013, Writ

               Petition No.5290 of 2013 came to be filed, in which an interim order

               was made restraining the State from displaying the select list until

               25.6.2013. On 21.6.2013, the State issued a GR, which provided for


                                                                                             70/130

               reservation for Postgraduate Degree and Diploma Courses to in-



               service candidates. Within a few days thereafter, i.e., on 2.7.2013,




                                                                                        
               the State issued yet another GR, which provided for reservations to




                                                                
               Postgraduate Diploma Courses to the in-service candidates, but did

               into factual aspects as to what decision has been taken by the State

               in GR dated 21.6.2013 and GR dated 2.7.2013, as an interim

               Petition No.5214 of 2012 should prevail. In passing this interim

               order, this Court clarified that such interim order was being passed
         

               without going into the factual aspect as to what decision has been
      



               taken in GRs dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 and "since the

               Government has not issued Resolution well in time as directed by

               the Division Bench of this Court". This Court, in the interim order





               dated 4.7.2013, further made it clear that in so far as the effect of

               two GRs dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 is concerned, the same can





               be taken into consideration at the final hearing of the Petition and

               the Petition was directed to be disposed of at the stage of

               admission. On 28.11.2013, the State published the PGM-CET 2014

               Brochure to govern admission to the Postgraduate Degree and

               Diploma Courses for the academic year 2014-2015. As noted earlier,

               clause 7.1 of the Brochure, by reference to GR dated 2.7.2013 has

               candidates to the effect that benefit of reservation be extended to




                                                               
               Postgraduate Degree Courses as well. The representations so
                                           
               made were considered and rejected by the State by communication
                                          
               dated 1.3.2014, which is also been impugned in some of the

               Petitions.

               Petitioners, inter alia, in Writ Petition No.5290 of 2013 made two

               submissions:



                       A)         Upon coming into the force of the 
Maharashtra





                       University of Health Sciences Act, 1998
 (1998 Act) with

                       effect from 3.6.1998, the Maharashtra University of Health





                       Sciences and alone has the power to frame rules relating to

                       control and regulation of admission at the Graduate and

                       Postgraduate level in Medical Colleges. This according to

                       him is clear from the provisions of 
Section 5(k)
 of 1998 Act.



                       In case of failure on the part of the University to frame rules


                                                                                             72/130

                       relating to control and regulation of admission, the State in

                       terms of 
Section 9(4)
 of 1998 Act is empowered to issue a




                                                                                        
                       directive to the University for framing such rules, whereupon




                                                                
                       it shall be the duty of University to comply with such

                       directive. As the field in this regard is covered by the




                                                               
                       statutory provisions contained in 1998 Act, the State is

                       denuded of its power to issue any GRs in exercise of its

                       executive powers conferred by 
Article 162
                      of the




                                                               
                       Constitution of India. Accordingly, Mr. Anturkar submitted
                                           
                       that the GRs issued by the State after coming into force of
                                          
                       1998 Act, i.e., after 3.6.1998, which includes in particular,

                       the GR dated 2.7.2013 is ultra vires, null and void and
         

                       should be so declared. Upon such declaration, the GR
      



                       dated 6.1.1990, which provided for reservation for in-service

                       candidates, both for Postgraduate Degree as well as

                       Diploma Courses revives. This is because in the year 1990,





                       the field had not been occupied by a statute like the 1998

                       Act. On this basis, Mr. Anturkar submitted that the GR dated





                       2.7.2013 ought to be struck down and reservations to in-



                       service candidates to Postgraduate Degree Courses

                       provided by the GR dated 6.1.1990, ought to be restored;

                       vs. State of M.P. and ors. - (1999) 7 SCC 120, Mr. Anturkar

                       contended that the Medical Council of India (MCI), by virtue




                                                                                        
                       of Entry 66 of List I of the Constitution of India may have the




                                                                
                       power to lay down standards of eligibility or basic

                       qualifications for admission to Graduate or Postgraduate




                                                               
                       Medical Courses, but beyond this stage the field is covered

                       by Entry 25 of List III of the Constitution of India and

                       accordingly, the State alone is empowered to deal with the




                                                               
                       control and regulation of admissions to Graduate and
                                           
                       Postgraduate Medical Courses. Mr. Anturkar, then submitted
                                          
                       clause 9(1)(b) of the MCI Regulations 2000, which provide

                       that 50% of seats in Postgraduate Diploma Course shall be
         

                       reserved for in-service candidates who have served atleast
      



                       three years in remote difficult areas, was really a clause

                       beyond the purview of powers vested in the MCI. The State,

                       therefore, had no reason to regard itself as being bound by





                       such a clause. In any case, Mr. Anturkar submitted that a

                       regulation framed by MCI in the matter of Postgraduate





                       Medical Education are only directory or recommendatory.



                       Thus, the State has erred in relying upon the MCI

                       Regulations for the purposes of restricting reservation only

                       to Postgraduate Diploma Courses.



                                                                                             74/130

               7]        Mr. Sakseria and Mr. Khandeparkar, the learned counsels


               appearing in some of the Petitions expressed their inability to agree




                                                                                        
               with at least the first submission advanced by Mr. Anturkar. They, in




                                                                
               unison, contended that it is a prerogative of the State to determine

               the manner and extent of reservation. The State, in absence of any




                                                               
               statute regulating admissions to Medical Courses, is very much

               competent to issue GRs in exercise of powers conferred by 
Article

               162
 of Constitution of India. They submitted that 1998 Act is




                                                               
               basically concerned with affiliation of health science Colleges and
                                           
               the provisions thereof have no role to play in the matter of actual
                                          
               grant of admissions or for that matter determination of the manner

               and extent of reservation. The Government Pleader appearing for
         

               the State, naturally supported such submissions and contended that
      



               the field in the matter of determination the manner and extent of

               reservation was by no means covered by the provisions of 1998 Act

               and consequently it was the prerogative of the State to deal with and





               determine such matters.



               8]        Mr. Sakseria and Mr. Khandepakar, however, attacked the

               denial of reservation to in-service candidates for the Postgraduate

               Degree Courses, primarily on the following grounds:



                        (a)        That there is obviously a dispute between two

                        Departments of the State as a result of which the State


                                                                                             75/130

                        itself is unclear as to what its policy is. This dispute and

                        confusion is reflected not only in the correspondence on




                                                                                        
                        record, but also in the PGM-CET 2014 Brochure. In the




                                                                
                        circumstances, the GR dated 2.7.2013 cannot even be

                        called as the policy decision of the State. The actual policy




                                                               
                        decision of the State is contained in GR dated 22.2.1996 or

                        in any case GR dated 21.6.2013. Accordingly, for the

                        academic year 2014-15, it is this policy decision that needs




                                                               
                        to be enforced;    

 
(b)        Assuming that the GR dated 2.7.2013 indeed
                                          
                        represents the current policy decision, then the same is

                        stated to be based upon the MCI Regulations of 2009
         

                        which provided for reservations to in-service candidates to
      



                        the Postgraduate Diploma Courses. The 2009 Regulations

                        had already been superseded by 2012 Regulations, by the

                        time GR dated 2.7.2013 came to be issued. Further, 2012





                        Regulations have been struck down by the Supreme Court

                        in the case of 
Christian Medical College Vellore & Ors vs.





                        Union of India
 - 2013 (9) SCALE 226.
 As such, the GR

                        dated 2.7.2013 is based upon non-existing material and

                        consequently has no legs to stand on.



 
(c)        Further, in the case of 
Christian Medical College


                        (supra), the Supreme Court has categorically ruled that


                                                                                             76/130

                        MCI is only concerned with specification of minimum

                        standards and has no role to play in the matter of




                                                                                                   
                        admissions to Medical Colleges. Such admissions fall




                                                                           
                        within         exclusive           domain   of   the   respective        States.




                        Determination of extent of reservation which is a part of




                                                                          
                        admission process is therefore, not within the province of

                        MCI. For this additional reason, the State was not at all

                        justified in seeking to place reliance upon MCI Regulations




                                                               
                        in order to sustain the validity of GR dated 2.7.2013.



                        (d)        Finally, it was urged that the policy of denial of
                                          
                        reservation to in-service candidates for Postgraduate

                        Degree Courses is ex-facie, arbitrary, unconstitutional and
         

                        violative of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution of India. The
      



                        classifications between Postgraduate Degree and Diploma

                        Courses, is a classification based upon no intelligible

                        differentia. In any case, taking into consideration the





                        objective of providing incentives to in-service candidates,

                        such differentia has absolutely no rational nexus with such





                        objective. The denial of reservation to in-service candidates

                        to Postgraduate Degree Courses, would be contrary to

                        social and public interest, inasmuch as medical graduates

                        denial of such reservation, would affect the health concerns

                        of inhabitants of rural, remote and difficult areas. For all




                                                                                        
                        these reasons, they submitted that the policy of the




                                                                
                        Government, as expressed through GR dated 2.7.2013, is

                        ex-facie, illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory, unconstitutional,




                                                               
                        null and void.



               9]        The Government Pleader Shri. S.K. Shinde defended the




                                                               
               State action of restricting reservations for in-service candidates to
                                           
               Postgraduate Diploma Courses only. In this regard, he submitted
                                          
               that reservation in favour of in-service candidates can never be

               demanded as a matter of right. The same is purely within the realm
         

               of policy. If this be so, then surely the nature and extent of such
      



               reservation is also within the realm of State policy. Without going

               into the issue of whether the MCI Regulations are binding or not, if

               the State as a policy measure, has decided to fall in line with MCI





               Regulations, which referred to reservations for in-service candidates

               at Postgraduate Diploma Courses, such policy can never be





               regarded as arbitrary, irrational or absurd. The circumstance that

               there may be some better policy or that the policy now proposed is

               not perfect, is not a ground to exercise the powers of judicial review.



               The judgment and order dated 5.7.2012 in Writ Petition No.5214 of

               2012 had directed the State to draw a balance bearing in mind


                                                                                             78/130

               relevant considerations including that reservation for in-service

               candidates affect the open seats available to meritorious students




                                                                                        
               and that in-service candidates foster the public health requirement of




                                                                
               the community. There is absolutely no arbitrariness involved in the

               policy decision, inasmuch as, the class of in-service candidates has




                                                               
               been treated equally. The classification in this case is really between

               in-service candidates on one hand and the non in-service

               candidates on the other. Such classifications is certainly based upon




                                                               
               the intelligible differentia. The extent of reservation to be provided to
                                           
               in-service candidates, is within the policy domain of the State, which
                                          
               position has in fact been asserted by the Petitioners themselves. In

               such circumstances, there is no scope for judicial review. Further,
         

               Mr. Shinde submitted that no writ of mandamus can issue to the
      



               State to provide for reservation, which is infact the precise relief

               which the Petitioners in these batch of Petitions seek. For all these

               reasons, Mr. Shinde learned Government Pleader submitted that the





               Petitions may be dismissed.



               10]       At this stage, brief reference is necessary to Writ Petition

               No.1933 of 2014, which is filed by and on behalf of 'non-in-service

               candidates'. As of now, such candidates support the Government

               Policy as expressed by the GR dated 2.7.2013. However, it is their

               case that should this policy be upset and the earlier policy restored,


                                                                                             79/130

               then as observed by this Court in its judgment and order dated

               5.7.2012 in Writ Petition No.5214 of 2012, the open seats available




                                                                                                   
               to meritorious students are bound to be affected. As of now, there is




                                                                           
               no reservation in favour of in-service candidates, insofar as

               Postgraduate Degree Courses are concerned. This means that




                                                                          
               Postgraduate Degree Courses, as of now, are to be filled-in on basis

               of open merit. No doubt, even in-service candidates are eligible to

               and entitled to compete in the open category for such Postgraduate




                                                               
               Degree Courses. However, there is no reservation in their favour. In
                                           
               case, such reservation is reintroduced, Dr.Sadavarte,                                 learned
                                          
               counsel appearing for the Petitioners in this Petition, contended that

               the      non        in-service          candidates   will   be    severely       prejudiced.



               Dr.Sadavarte, further submitted that providing extent of reservations
      



               is a part of determination of standards as held by the Supreme Court

               in the case of Dr. Preeti Srivastava (supra). Accordingly, it is within

               the domain of MCI to provide for extent of reservation. The State





               has no legislative and consequently executive competence to

               provide for any reservations over and above those which may be





               prescribed or provided by MCI in its Regulations.



 
11]       Mr.Ganesh Gole, learned counsel, appearing for the Medical

               Council of India submitted that the Supreme Court in the case of

               
Christian Medical College
 (supra) had only set aside the MCI


                                                                                                        80/130

               Regulations which provided for an All India Common Entrance Test

               (NEET). However, the rest of the provisions contained in




                                                                                        
               Regulations of 2009 or 2012 were not in issue and consequently the




                                                                
               same have not been struck down or set aside. Mr.Gole submitted

               that the MCI Regulations for Postgraduate Education are binding




                                                               
               upon the State and further the MCI has acted well within its powers

               in prescribing reservation for in-service candidates to Postgraduate

               Diploma Courses and not for Postgraduate Degree Courses.




               Mr.Gole, submitted that the basic rule when it comes to admissions
                                           
               at Postgraduate level is that the same should be on basis of merit.



               Some dilution to this basic rule has been permitted, inter alia by

               way of reservations in favour of in-service candidates. However,
         

               such reservation can be only to the extent and manner provided by
      



               the MCI and not any further.



               12]       At the outset, it is clear that the main relief which the





               Petitioners seek in these Petitions is a writ of mandamus to direct

               the State to provide for reservation to in-service candidates to the





               Postgraduate Degree Courses for the academic year 2014-15.



               Therefore, the first and foremost issue to be decided, is whether a

               writ of mandamus can issue to the State to provide for a reservation

               or a quota to in-service candidates for admissions to Postgraduate

               Degree Courses.



                                                                                             81/130

               13]       This Court, in its judgment and order dated 5.7.2012 in Writ




                                                                                            

               Petition No.5214 of 2012, has made it clear that in absence of




                                                                    
               Governmental Policy providing for reservation of seats for them, in-



               service candidates could not have asserted a legal or a




                                                                   
               constitutional right to a quota as "in-service candidates". This right

               originates in Governmental Policy. The relevant observations in this

               regard read thus:



                       In the absence of a governmental policy providing for
                                           
                       the reservation of seats for them, in service candidates
                       could not have asserted a legal or constitutional right to
                       a quota as in service candidates. The right originates in
                                          
                       governmental policy. Hence, while framing the policy,
                       government is entitled to frame the terms of
                       entitlement, though in a fair and non-discriminatory
                       manner. An incentive is an encouragement and in
                       conferring an incentive, government can lay down
         

                       conditions to govern it. Reservation for in service
                       candidates affect also the open seats which are
      



                       available to meritorious students. The government has
                       to draw the balance bearing in mind relevant
                       considerations, including the fact that in service
                       candidates as employees of government hospitals
                       foster the public health requirement of the community.



                                                                (emphasis supplied)


               14]       From the aforesaid, it is clear that if the State were to have a





               policy of providing no reservations or                  a quota for in-service

               candidates, then the State would neither be infringing any legal or

               constitutional provisions nor would it be acting in any arbitrary or

               capricious manner. This means that there is neither any legal right

               vested in any in-service candidates to demand for such reservation


                                                                                                 82/130

               or quota nor is there any corresponding legal, statutory or

               constitutional duty in the State to provide for the same. Unless such




                                                                                        
               basic predicates exist, there arises no question for issuance of a writ




                                                                
               of mandamus.



               15]       In order to seek a writ of mandamus, the Petitioners who are

               in-service candidates have to demonstrate that they have a legal

               right to obtain reservations or quota for admission to the




                                                               
               Postgraduate Degree Courses. Correspondingly, such Petitioners
                                           
               are also required to demonstrate that the Respondents owe a legal
                                          
               duty to them to provide for such reservations or quota. The condition

               precedent for issue of writ of mandamus is that there is in it one
         

               claiming a legal right to performance of legal duty by one against
      



               whom it is sought. 
In case of 
Mani Subrat Jain vs. State of Haryana


               - (1977) 1 SCC 486, the Supreme Court has observed thus:



                        "It is elementary though it is to be restated that no one
                        can ask for mandamus without a legal right. There must
                        be a judicially enforceable right as well as a legally
                        protected right before one suffering a legal grievance can
                        ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be





                        aggrieved only when a person is denied a legal right by
                        someone who has a legal duty to do something or to
                        abstain from doing something."



              16]        Another principle in the matter of issuance of writ of

              mandamus is that such a writ will not lie to seek or enforce a mere



                                                                                             83/130

              concession or a relaxation. For a writ of mandamus to issue, the

              right claimed must be judicially enforceable and legally protected. 
In




                                                                                        
              case of 
Rajalakshmia vs. State of Mysore
 - AIR 1967 SC 993, a




                                                                
              concession was extended in favour of one batch of employees. The

              applicants who were left out applied for a writ of mandamus.




              However, such writ was declined by observing that a concession

              could not be claimed as a matter of right by a writ of mandamus.



              Similarly, for a writ of mandamus to issue, it has to be established




                                                               
              that there is dereliction of a legal duty. The duty which can be
                                           
              enforced by a writ of mandamus must be legal and not merely moral,
                                          
              equitable or permissible.



              17]        In the present case, as observed earlier there is no right as
      



              such vested in-service candidates to claim reservations. The origin

              of such reservations is itself in the realm of Government policy.



              Correspondingly, there is no legal duty in the State to provide for





              such reservation. No writ of mandamus would therefore lay at the

              instance of in-service candidates to direct the State to provide for





              any reservations to in-service candidates. Merely because the State,

              by way of policy has chosen to provide such reservations for

              admission to Postgraduate Diploma Courses, there is no warrant to

              issue a writ of mandamus directing that the State should also extend

              this benefit of reservations to Postgraduate Degree Courses.



                                                                                             84/130

               18]       Even in the matter of constitutional reservations, which




                                                                                        

               undoubtedly stand upon a much higher pedestal, the Supreme Court




                                                                
               of India in the case of Dr.Gulshan Prakash & ors. vs. State of

               Haryana & ors. - AIR 2010 Supreme Court 288, rejected a plea that




                                                               
               the State was duty bound to provide for reservation for SC / ST and

               backward class category at the postgraduate level, by observing

               thus:



                       19)     As stated earlier, 
Article 15(4)
 is an enabling
                                           
                       provision and the State Government is the best judge to
                       grant reservation for SC/ST/Backward Class categories at
                       Post-Graduate level in admission and the decision of the
                                          
                       State of Haryana not to make any provision for
                       reservation at the Post-Graduate level suffers no infirmity.

                       In our view, every State can take its own decision with
                       regard to reservation depending on various factors. Since
         

                       the Government of Haryana has decided to grant
                       reservation for SC/ST categories/Backward Class
      



                       candidates in admission at MBBS level i.e. under
                       graduate level, then it does not mean that it is bound to
                       grant reservation at the Post-Graduate level also. As
                       stated earlier, the State Government, in more than one
                       communication, has conveyed its decision that it is not in





                       favour of reservation for SC/ST/Backward Classes at
                       Post-Graduate level. In such circumstances, Court cannot
                       issue mandamus against their decision and their
                       prospectus also cannot be faulted with for not providing
                       reservation in Post-Graduate Courses. However, we make





                       it clear that irrespective of above conclusion, State of
                       Haryana is free to reconsider its earlier decision, if they so
                       desire, and circumstances warrant in the future years.

               19]       Again, in a context of reservations contemplated by Article

               SCC 147, has held that the provisions for reservation is only an

               enabling provision and consequently no writ can be issued




                                                                          
               compelling the Government to make such reservation. 
In the case of

               
Union of India vs. R. Rajeshwaran
 & anr.- (2003) 9 SCC 294, the

               Supreme Court of India in the context of making a provision for




                                                               
               reservation of seats for admissions to all-India pool in the MBBS and
                                           
               BDS list, ruled that no writ of mandamus would be issued to provide
                                          
               for such reservation. The Supreme Court went to the extent of

               observing that its previous decisions where such writ of mandamus
         

               was issued cannot be held to be laying down correct law. The
      



               relevant observations in para '9' read thus:




                       9. In Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab - (1999) 7 SCC 209,
                       this Court held that 
Article 16(4)
 of the Constitution
                       confers a discretion and does not create any





                       constitutional duty and obligation. 
Language of 
Article
                       15(4)
 is identical and the view in

1986) 2 SCC 679 and Superintending Engineer, Public
                       Health v. Kuldeep Singh-
 (1997) 9 SCC 1999 that a





                       mandamus can be issued either to provide for reservation
                       or for relaxation is not correct and runs counter to
                       judgments of earlier Constitution Benches and, therefore,
                       these two judgments cannot be held to be laying down
                       the correct law. In these circumstances, neither the
                       respondent in the present case could have sought for a
                       direction nor the High Court could have granted the same.

                                                                     (emphasis supplied)



                                                                                                        86/130





                                                                           ::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:43 :::

               20]       If therefore, no writ of mandamus can issue to the State to




                                                                                        

               make reservations for even SC/ST and backward class categories

               for admissions at the postgraduate level, then in my opinion, no writ




                                                                
               of mandamus can equally issue to the State to provide for any

               reservation or quota in favour of in-service candidates. Again, if no




                                                               
               writ of mandamus can issue to the State directing it to provide for

               reservation in favour of in-service candidates, then surely no writ of




                                                               
               mandamus can issue to the State directing it to provide for
                                           
               reservation or quota to in-service candidates to the Postgraduate

               Degree Courses.



               21]       The next important issue which arises for determination is
         


               whether the policy of the State to provide for reservation or quota to
      



               in-service candidates for admission only to Postgraduate Diploma

               Courses and not to Postgraduate Degree Courses is illegal,





               arbitrary, discriminatory absurd, irrational, null and void.



               22]       In order to attempt an answer to the aforesaid question, it is





               necessary to outline the scope of judicial review when it comes to

               testing Government policy.




               23]       This Court whilst exercising the power of judicial review of



                                                                                             87/130

               administrative action does not act as an appellate authority. The

               scope of judicial review is confined to the question whether the




                                                                                        
               decision taken by the State is against any statutory provisions or




                                                                
               violative of the fundamental rights or other constitutional rights. The

               correctness of reasons which prompted the State to make a policy




                                                               
               or to change a policy or to adopt one course of action instead of

               another, is normally not a matter of concern in judicial review of this

               nature. As long as policy decisions do not infringe legal or




                                                               
               constitutional rights, a constitutional court will not substitute its own
                                           
               judgment for the judgment of the executive in such matters. In
                                          
               assessing legality or propriety of such policy decision of the State,

               the Court cannot interfere even if a second view is possible and in
         

               the opinion of the Court such second view is better or wiser or more
      



               practical. In matters of framing of policy, it is well settled that the

               State has sufficient liberty and freedom. The State has to take into

               consideration several complex factors and it is not possible for the





               Courts to consider the competing claims and conflicting interest for

               purposes of determining which way the balance tilts.



 
24]       Thus the position in law is that normally, the Court while

               exercising power of judicial review will not interfere with the

               government policy, unless the same is established as being in

               violation of any statutory or constitutional provision. With the

               question whether a particular policy is good, bad, wise or foolish, a

               Court of law is normally unconcerned. It is not for the Court to advise

               Court is fairer, wiser or more scientific. It is not within the domain of

               the Court to weigh the pros and cons of policy or to scrutinize it and

               purpose of varying, modifying or annulling it, based on howsoever

               sound and good reasoning, except where it is arbitrary or violative of

               dangerous if the Court is asked to test the utility, beneficial effect of
                                          
               the policy or its appraisal merely on the basis of pleadings in a

25]       In the case of 
Asif Hameed Vs. State of Jammu and Kashmir


               1989 supp (2) SCC 364, the Supreme Court observed thus :




                       "While exercising power of judicial review of administrative
                       action, the Court is not an appellate authority. The
                       Constitution does not permit the court to direct or advise
                       the executive in matters of policy or to sermonise qua any
                       matter which under the Constitution lies within the sphere

               the State directing the grant of permission. The Supreme Court

               reversed the High Court by observing thus:



                       So long as there is no violation of any fundamental rights
                       and if the principles of natural justice are not offended, it
                       was not for the High Court to lay down the policy that
                       should be adopted by the educational authorities in the
                       matter of granting permission for starting schools. The




                                                               
                       question of policy is essentially for the State and such
                       policy will depend upon an overall assessment and
                                           
                       summary of the requirements of residents of a particular
                       locality and other categories of persons for whom it is
                       essential to provide facilities for education. If the overall
                                          
                       assessment is arrived at after a proper classification on
                       reasonable basis, it is not for the courts to interfere with
                       the policy leading up to such assessment.

Maharashtra Board of Secondary & Higher

 (1984) 4 SCC 27, the High Court

              issued a writ of mandamus directing the Board to provide for





              reevaluation of answer papers. The Supreme Court reversing the

              High Court observed thus:-




                        "The Court cannot sit in judgment over the wisdom of the

                        fully effectuate the purpose of the enactment or it may be
                        lacking in effectiveness and hence calling for revision and
                        improvement. But any drawbacks in the policy
                        incorporated in a rule or regulation will not render it ultra

                        that in its opinion, it is not a wise or prudent policy, but is
                        even a foolish one, and that it will not really serve to

28]        In the case of 
Arun Roy Vs. Union of India

               the Supreme Court ruled that it is open for the State to take a

               opine whether such policy is good or bad. A Court of law can only
                                          
               interfere if such policy contravenes statutory or constitutional

               29]        In the case of Metropolis Theatre Company v. State of

               Chicago- 57 L Ed 730, the Supreme Court of United States

               observed that in matters of the judicial review of Government policy,





               certain measures of freedom or 'play' in the 'joints' needs to be

               conceded to the executive. Mere errors are not subject to judicial





               review. It is only palpably arbitrary exercise which can be declared

               as void. The Court observed thus:



                       "The Court cannot strike down a policy decision taken by
                       the State Government merely because it feels that
                       another policy decision would have been fairer or wiser or
                       more scientific or logical. The Court can interfere only if
                       the policy decision is patently arbitrary, discriminatory or


                                                                                             91/130

                       mala fide".



               30]         It is also settled position in law that the Government has the

               power to change policy. The executive power is not limited only to




                                                                              
               frame policy, but the executive also has the power to change, re-



               change, adjust and readjust the policy by taking into account the




                                                                             
               relevant and germane considerations. As long as the changed policy

               is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, there is little scope for

               559, the Supreme Court was considering a position where in

               pursuance of 1964 promotion policy, a select list was prepared and
         


               the       Petitioner          included           therein.   However,      just     before      the
      



               appointment, there was a change in the policy, as a result of which

               the Petitioner was denied appointment. The High Court ruled in





               favour of the Petitioner by observing that the State had acted in

               arbitrary manner to depart from its consistently held policy

               "overnight by making fresh selection and without antecedent





               reformulation". Disapproving the approach of the High Court, the

               Supreme Court observed thus:




                       "A policy once formulated is not good for ever, it is
                       perfectly within the competence of the Union of India to
                       change it, rechange it, adjust it and readjust it according

                       directives as to how the Defence Ministry should function

                       to treat employees equally is binding the Union of India

               505, the High Court set aside the changed policy in the matter of

               promotion to the post of Air Marshal on the ground that "the new

               promotion policy was not framed after an in-depth study" and a writ

                       of the desirability of such a change which would require

               time and again.



               35]       The Petitioners, apart from urging that the policy is ultra vires,

               null and void, have failed to demonstrate why it is so. Admittedly, the





               policy is not in breach of any legal or statutory provisions. There is

               no law which requires the State to provide for any reservation or

               quota in favour of in-service candidates. Accordingly, the policy does





               not fall foul of any law or statutory enactment.



               36]       The contention of the Petitioners that the policy is arbitrary,

               does not appeal to me. The Supreme Court as also Medical Council

Dr. Pradeep Jain & ors vs. Union of India & ors
.




               - (1984) 3 SCC 654, the Supreme Court drew out the distinction




                                                               
               between the admissions to MBBS Courses and MD or MS Courses
                                           
               by observing that at the stage of postgraduate admissions
                                          
               excellence cannot be allowed to be compromised by any other

               considerations because that would detrimental to the interest of the
         

               Nation. The observations in paragraph 22 deserve mention:



                        22.    So much for admission to the M.B.B.S. course, but
                        different considerations must prevail when we come to
                        consider the question of reservation based on residence
                        requirement within the State or on institutional preference
                        for admission to post graduate courses, such as, M.D.,





                        M.S. and the like. There we cannot allow excellence to be
                        compromised by any other considerations because that
                        would be detrimental to the interest of the nation. It was
                        rightly pointed out by Krishna Iyer, J. in Jagdish Saran's
                        case, and we wholly endorse what he has said:

                              produce. If the best potential in these fields is cold-
                              shouldered for populist considerations garbed as
                              reservations, the victims, in the long run, may be the
                              people themselves. Of course, this unrelenting strictness
                              in selecting the best may not be so imperative at other

                         These passages from the judgment of Krishna Iyer, J. clearly
                         and forcibly express the same view which we have




                                                                   
                         independently reached on our own and in deed that view has
                         been so ably expressed in these passages that we do not
                         think we can usefully add anything to what has already been
                         said there. We may point out that the Indian Medical Council




                                                               
                         has also emphasized that playing with merit, so far as
                         admissions to post graduate courses are concerned, for
                         pampering local feeling, will boomerang. We may with
                                           
                         advantage reproduce the recommendation of the Indian
                         Medical Council on this point which may not be the last word
                         in social wisdom but is certainly worthy of consideration:



                             "Student for post-graduate training should be selected
                             strictly on merit judged on the basis of academic record
                             in the undergraduate course. All selection for post-
                             graduate studies should be conducted by the
                             Universities."



                        The Medical Education Review Committee has also expressed
      



                        the opinion that "all admissions to the post-graduate courses in
                        any institution should be open to candidates on an all India
                        basis and there should be no restriction regarding domicile in
                        the State/Union Territory in which the institution is located." So
                        also in the policy statement filed by the leaned Attorney





                        General, the Government of India has categorically expressed
                        the view that:

                             "So far as admissions to the institutions of post-
                             graduate colleges and special professional colleges
                             is concerned, it should be entirely on the basis of all





                             India merit subject to constitutional reservations in
                             favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."

                        We are therefore of the view that so far as admissions to

                        are concerned, it would be eminently desirable not to
                        provide for any reservation based on residence
                        requirement within the State or on institutional preference.

                        be given preference for admission to the post-graduate

               38]       In the case of Dr. Preeti Srivastava (supra), the Supreme
      



               Court had ruled that at the level of super specialities, there cannot

               be any reservation because in dilution of merit at this level would





               adversely affect the national goal of having the post possible people

               at the highest level of professional and education training. In the





               context of next below stage of Postgraduate Education in medical

               speciality, the Supreme Court ruled that similar considerations

               should prevail though perhaps to a slightly lesser extent than in the

               super specialities. However, the Supreme Court cautioned that the

               element of public interest in having the most meritorious students at

               this level of education is present even at the stage of postgraduate

               teaching. In this regard, reference can be usefully made to the




                                                                                        
               observations in paragraph 24, which reads thus:



                       24. At the next below stage of postgraduate education
                       in medical specialities, similar considerations also prevail
                       though perhaps to a slightly lesser extent than in the
                       superspecialities. But the element of public interest in




                                                               
                       having the most meritorious students at this level of
                       education is present even at the stage of post-graduate
                       teaching. Those who have specialised medical knowledge
                       in their chosen branch are able to treat better and more
                       effectively patients who are sent to them for expert




                                                               
                       diagnosis and treatment in their specialised field. For a
                       student who enrols for such speciality courses, an ability
                                           
                       to assimilate and acquire special knowledge is required.

                       Not everyone has this ability. Of course intelligence and
                       abilities do not know any frontiers of caste or class or race
                                          
                       or sex. They can be found anywhere, but not in everyone.
                       Therefore, selection of the right calibre of students is
                       essential in public interest at the level of specialised
                       postgraduate education. In view of this supervening public
         

                       interest which has to be balanced against the social equity
                       of providing some opportunities to the backward who are
      



                       not able to qualify on the basis of marks obtained by them
                       for postgraduate learning, it is for an expert body such as
                       the Medical Council of India, to lay down the extent of
                       reservations, if any, and the lowering of qualifying marks, if
                       any, consistent with the broader public interest in having





                       the most competent people for specialised training, and
                       the competing public interest in securing social justice and
                       equality. The decision may perhaps, depend upon the
                       expert body's assessment of the potential of the reserved
                       category candidates at a certain level of minimum





                       qualifying marks and whether those who secure admission
                       on the basis of such marks to postgraduate courses, can
                       be expected to be trained in two or three years to come up
                       to the standards expected of those with post-graduate
                       qualifications.

               8 SCC 203, the Supreme Court was called upon to rule on the

               validity of the proviso to clause 9(2)(d) of the MCI Regulations 2009,

               obtained, when it came to determining the merit of in-service

               candidates. Based upon such clause, in-service candidates were not

               only claiming weightage when it came to competition with other in-



               service candidates, but also vis-a-vis open merit category

               observing that the same permits encroachment upon open category,

               where merit alone ought to be the determining factor. The
         

               observations in paragraphs 24, 25 and 27, which are relevant, read
      



               thus:



                        24] We have referred to the above mentioned
                        judgments only to indicate the fact that this Court in
                        various judgments has acknowledged the fact that





                        weightage could be given for doctors who have rendered
                        service in rural/tribal areas but that weightage is available
                        only in in-service category, to which 50% seats for PG
                        admission has already been earmarked. The question is
                        whether, on the strength of that weightage, can they





                        encroach upon the open category, i.e direct admission
                        category. We are of the view that such encroachment or
                        inroad or appropriation of seats earmarked for open
                        category candidates (direct admission category) would
                        definitely affect the candidates who compete strictly on
                        the basis of the merit.

                        channel i.e. the channel exclusively earmarked for in-

                        service candidates are also free to compete through the
                        open category just like any other who fall under that
                        category. Further, it is also relevant to note that those who




                                                                
                        get admission in postgraduate courses through the open
                        category have to execute a bond stating that they would
                        serve rural/tribal areas after completion of their
                        postgraduation. In fact, weightage is given to those
                        candidates who have rendered service in rural/tribal areas




                                                                
                        when they compete for admission to PG (Medical)
                        Courses in in-service category for whom 50% seats are
                                           
                        earmarked.

                        27] We notice that the seats earmarked for the open
                        category by way of merit are few in number and
                        encroachment by the in-service candidates into that open
                        category would violate clause 9(1)(a) of the MCI
                        regulations, which says students for PG medical courses
         


                        shall be selected strictly on the basis of the inter se
                        academic merit i.e. on the basis of the merit determined
      



                        by the competent test. Direct category or open category is
                        a homogeneous class which consists of all categories of
                        candidates who are fresh from college, who have
                        rendered service after MBBS in Government or private





                        hospitals in remote and difficult areas like hilly areas,
                        tribal and rural areas and so on. All of them have to
                        complete on merit being in the direct candidate category,
                        subject to rules of reservation and eligibility. But there can
                        be no encroachment from one category to another.



                        Candidates of in-service category cannot encroach upon
                        the open category, so also vice-versa.

               The benefit of reservation is available to all in-service candidates

               uniformly. The in-service candidates constitute a distinct class and

               as long as there is equality amidst this class, there arises no





               question of discrimination or violation of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution

               of India. It is settled principle that equality is amongst equals. The





               discrimination which the Petitioners perhaps allege, is, as between

               in-service candidates and non in-service candidates. This is

               because "non in-service candidates" are entitled to admission to

               Postgraduate Degree Courses retained under the State quota.

               amount to deprivation. All that the policy provides is that when it




                                                                
               comes to Postgraduate Degree Courses, the admission shall be
                                           
               strictly on basis of inter se merit.              There can be neither any
                                          
               arbitrariness, nor any discrimination in such an approach.



               42]       Again, there can be no discrimination as between in-service
      



               candidates and non in-service candidates. Admittedly, both belong

               to a different class. The classification between them, even according

               to the Petitioners themselves is based upon an intelligible differentia.



               The object of Postgraduate Medical Education is not, as may be

               perceived by the Petitioners, to offer incentives and encouragement





               to in-service candidates. Rather the object of Postgraduate Medical

               Education is to ensure that most meritorious students obtain

               admissions. The dilution of merit is permitted only to a certain extent

               and on account of certain peculiar exigencies. Accordingly, providing

               of reservation to in-service candidates for Postgraduate Diploma


                                                                                             103/130

               Postgraduate Degree Courses, can neither be described as being




                                                                                         
               arbitrary or discriminatory. It cannot be said that there is no rational




                                                                 
               nexus between the classification and the object which such

               classification seeks to achieve. Accordingly, the charge that in-



               service candidates have been discriminated against, for want of

               reservation to Postgraduate Degree Courses, fails and is required to

               be rejected.

                         In the case of State of M.P. Vs. Gopal D. Tirthani - (2003) 7
                                          
               SCC 83, upon which the reliance was placed by the Petitioners

               themselves, it has been held that the classification between in-



               service candidates and non in-service candidates is based upon an
      



               intelligible differentia. On this basis setting aside separate and

               exclusive source of entry or channel for admission to in-service

               candidates came to be upheld. However, the further contention





               raised by the in-service candidates that a separate entrance exam

               ought to be held for them was repealed by the Supreme Court in





               emphatic terms. The in-service candidates had contended that they

               have served for the Government soon after their graduation in

               remote and hilly areas and were detached from theoretical studies

               and therefore it would be too much to expect from them such

               theoretical knowledge of Medical Science as would enable them to


                                                                                            104/130

               basis, it was forcefully submitted that the State ought to be directed




                                                                 
               to conduct two separate examinations for the two classes,

               particularly since the two channels were separate, exclusive and




                                                                
               assessment of merit of one class would not affect the assessment of

               merit of the other. Rejecting such contention, the Supreme Court

               observed thus :

In the case of 
Dr. Preeti Srivastava and Anr. v. State
                                           
                       of M.P. and Ors.
, the Constitution Bench has expressly
                       discarded the submission that there need not be any
                       qualifying marks prescribed for the common entrance
                                          
                       examination. The Medical Council of India, as an expert
                       body, is the repository of the nation's faith for laying down
                       the extent of reservations, if any and the lowering of
                       qualifying marks consistent with the broader public
         

                       interest in having the most competent people for
                       specialized training and the competing public interest in
      



                       securing social justice and equality. Even when it is
                       permissible to prescribe lesser qualifying marks for a
                       reserved category (not a mere separate channel of entry
                       of candidates) and the general category of candidates at
                       the post-graduate level, there cannot be a big disparity





                       between the two. The level of disparity in qualifying marks
                       subject to its being permitted by the expert body, must be
                       minimal so that the candidates seeking admission into
                       post graduation can put up to a certain level of excellence.


                       Referring to Ajay Kumar Singh and Ors. v. State of Bihar





                       and Ors., Nivedita Jain, and Post Graduate Institute of
                       Medical Education & research, Chandigarh and Ors. v.
                       K.L. Narasimhan, the Constitution Bench observed that it
                       is true that in spite of having been admitted through any
                       channel or may be by reservation, merely because
                       everybody has to take the same post-graduation
                       examination to qualify for a post-graduate degree, it is not
                       a guarantee of quality. A pass mark is not a guarantee of
                       excellence. There is a great deal of difference between a

                       person who qualifies with the minimum marks and a
                       person who qualifies with high marks. It excellence is to

                       qualifying should be able to secure good marks while
                       qualifying. Attaining minimum qualifying marks has a
                       direct relation with the standards of education. Qualifying




                                                                 
                       marks is an assessment of the calibre of students chosen
                       for admission. If the students are of a high calibre, training
                       programmes can be suitably moulded so that they can
                       receive the maximum benefit out of a high level of




                                                                
                       teaching. If the calibre of the students is poor or they are
                       unable to follow the instructions being imparted, the
                       standard of teaching necessarily has to be lowered to
                       make them understand the course which they have
                       undertaken; and it may not be possible to reach the levels




                                                                
                       of education and training which can be attained with a
                       bright group. The assemblage of students in a particular
                                           
                       class should be within a reasonable range of variable
                       calibre and intelligence, else the students will not be able
                       to move along with each other as a common class.



                       Hence, the need for a common entrance test and
                       minimum qualifying marks as determined by experts in the
                       field of medical education.

                       27. The in-service candidates may have been away from
                       academics and theories because of being in service. Still
                       they need to be assessed as eligible for entrance in P.G.
                       For taking up such examination, they must either keep
                       updating themselves regularly or concentrate on studies





                       preparatory to entrance examinations but without
                       sacrificing or compromising with their obligations to the
                       people whom they are meant to serve on account of being
                       in State services.

               44]       The next contention, though faintly urged was that assuming

               the policy may be proper, but the manner in which the change came

               to be brought out, renders the same arbitrary, null and void. As

               observed earlier, even the changed policy, in my opinion, does not

               infringe any statutory or constitutional provisions. In fact, the policy

               is consistent with that formulated by the MCI and approved by the

               held field for a considerable period even after the MCI Regulations

               of 2009 came in force, is hardly a ground to urge that the earlier




                                                                
               policy should continue forever or the same should never be

               changed. As observed observed by the Supreme Court in the case

               of Tamil Nadu Education Dept. Ministerial & General Subordinate

               of today, even as the science of old may sour into superstition now,
                                          
               and vice-versa.



               45]       Besides, at this stage, it is necessary to refer to the decision
      



               of this Court dated 5.7.2012 in Writ Petition No.5214 of 2012 in

               which directions came to be issued to the State to come out with a

               Government Resolution specifying the manner in which the





               reservation for in-service candidates shall be worked out. In the said

               decision, this Court observed that the State while framing the policy





               is entitled to frame the terms of entitlement in a fair and non-



               discriminatory manner. An incentive is an encouragement and in

               conferring an incentive, government can lay down conditions to

               govern it. Reservation for in service candidates affect also the

               open seats which are available to meritorious students. The

               government has to draw the balance bearing in mind relevant

               considerations, including the fact that in service candidates as

               requirement of the community. There is no reason to presume

               that such considerations were not taken into account by the

               State in issuing GR dated 2.7.2013.



               46]       The next contention, that the GR dated 2.7.2013, cannot be




                                                                
               regarded as a policy decision at all, is unacceptable. There is no
                                           
               dispute that GR dated 2.7.2013 has been issued by the State in

               exercise of executive powers vested in it by 
Article 162
 of the
                                          
               Constitution of India. The circumstance that there may be or that

               there is some dispute between two Departments of the State, is
         


               quite irrelevant. That by itself does not rob GR dated 2.7.2013 of its
      



               legal efficacy. As long as the GR dated 2.7.2013 stands, and the

               intention of the State to implement the same is made known vide





               clause 7.1 of the PGM-CET 2014 Brochure, it cannot be said that

               there is no policy decision of the State in existence. Accordingly, the

               contention as to the non-existence of policy decision requires to be





               rejected.

               upon this issue in great details, because even de hors such

Dr. Preeti Srivastava

               needs to be rejected. The paragraph is a part of the minority opinion.

               Judge in the

 case.
 
As noted earlier, the

               majority in the case of 
Dr. Preeti Srivastava
 (supra) at paragraph 24
         

               has observed that it is for an expert body such as MCI to lay down
      



               the extent of reservations, if any, in the context of postgraduate

               admissions.




 
48]       The learned counsels for the Petitioners may be technically

               right in their submissions that the MCI Regulations 2009 were not in





               existence when the GR dated 2.7.2013 was issued, as by then MCI

               Regulations, 2012 were in force. However, the further submission

               that even the MCI Regulations, 2012 had by then being struck down

               by the Supreme Court in the case of 
Christian Medical College


               (supra) does not appear to be well founded.

               amendments to the MCI Regulations by which a National Eligibility-




               cum-Entrance Test (NEET) came to be introduced and further was




                                                                
               to be actually conducted by MCI itself. Accordingly, by majority, the

               Supreme Court struck down the amendments to the MCI

               Regulations by which such NEET came to be introduced. Therefore,




                                                                
               it cannot be said that clause 9(VII) of MCI Regulations 2012, which
                                           
               provides that 50% of seats in Postgraduate Diploma Courses shall
                                          
               be reserved for Medical Officers in Government service was not in-



               existence or had been struck down by the Supreme Court. Further,
         

               as observed earlier, this issue is irrelevant particularly as there can
      



               be no dispute that the State, even de hors MCI Regulations is

               competent to take a policy decision in this regard. Besides, in the

               present case, this Court by its judgment and order dated 5.7.2012





               had issued specific directions to the State to come out with an

               appropriate policy keeping in mind the interest of both, in-service





               candidates as well as non in-service candidates. There is no reason

               to presume that the considerations adverted to by this Court in its

               judgment and order dated 5.7.2012 were not taken into account by

               the State in taking the policy decision.

               49]       The        contention              that   MCI   is     only     concerned           with


 
specifications of minimum standards and therefore has no role to

               founded. However, the issue as to whether determination of

               extent of reservation is not a part of determination of standards

               is not free from doubt. The Supreme Court in the case of 
Dr.




                                                                             
               Preeti Srivastava
 (supra), has in terms observed that it is for an

               expert body such as the MCI to lay down the extent of reservations




                                                                  
               (paragraph 24).
 
The position appears to have been reiterated in
                                           
               paragraph 23 of the decision in case of

Christian Medical Colleges
 (supra), one of the issues

               framed was whether the views expressed by the Constitution Bench

               in the case of 
Dr. Preeti Srivastava
 (supra) have any impact on the
         


               issues raised in said batch of Petitions.
 
A careful reading of the
      



               decision in the case of 
Christian Medical College
 (supra) would

               indicate that the contention of the learned counsels for the





               Petitioners that 
Christian Medical College
 (supra) has watered down

               the ratio of 
Dr. Preeti Srivastava
 (supra) is not at all well founded.
 
In





               the case of 
Christian Medical College
 (supra), the Supreme Court

               has essentially ruled that the MCI, itself conducting NEET, as

               opposed to providing for NEET cannot be said to have determined

               standards for Postgraduate Medical Education. Accordingly, the

               notification to the extent it enabled the MCI to itself conduct NEET


                                                                                                         111/130

               came to be struck down.




               50]       In this case, it is not necessary to go into the larger issue as to




                                                                 
               whether the MCI Regulations bind the State in matter of formulation

               of policy when it comes to admission to Postgraduate Medical




                                                                
               Courses concerned. Suffice to state that there is a long line of

               decisions which takes the view that Regulations framed by the MCI

               in the matter of Graduate or Postgraduate Medical Education relate




                                                                
               to Entry 66 List-I of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the State
                                           
               in exercise of its executive powers relatable to Entry 25 List - III of
                                          
               the Constitution of India cannot frame policies which may be

               inconsistent with or repugnant to the MCI Regulations. At this stage,
         

               however, it is not necessary to go into this issue, particularly as it is
      



               clear that the State could have formulated the policy contained in

               GR dated 2.7.2013, even without reference to the MCI Regulations

               and in exercise of its executive power under 162 of the Constitution





               of India.

               Advocate appearing in some of the Petitions that he very specifically

               submitted that he is not raising any ground on the basis of doctrine

Pimpalwar vs. State of Maharashtra

               respective Petitions or not.




               52]       Lest the point remains un-answered, it is necessary to point

               out that in none of the Petitions there are any specific pleadings

               sufficient to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel or legitimate




                                                                
               expectation. 
In the case of 
Dr. Ashok Kumar Maheshwari vs State
                                           
               Of U.P.-
 (1998) 2 SCC 502, the Supreme Court has held that "bald
                                          
               pleadings cannot be made the foundation for invoking the doctrine

               of promissory estoppel". In the case of Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd.




               vs. Commercial Tax Officer - 2005 (1) SCC 625, the Supreme Court
      



               has held that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel

               clear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the Petition itself

               by the party invoking the doctrine and bald expressions without any





               supporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted

               because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position





               relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient

               to press into aid the doctrine.

               (supra), which lays down that the doctrines of promissory estoppel

               did not place reliance upon any decision of this Court or the

               Supreme Court of India which has taken a view contrary to the that

               expressed by the Full Bench of this Court in the case of 
Ashwin

               doctrine of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation stands
                                          
               fully answered by the dictum of the Full Bench of this Court.




 
54]       In the case of 
Ashwin Pimpalwar
 (supra) this Court was called
      



               upon to consider plea of promissory estoppel in respect of similar

               rules framed under 
Article 166
 of the Constitution of India, though in

               a different context. Under the earlier Government Resolution of





               1971, admission to the post graduate courses was on the basis of

               the marks obtained in the "subject concerned" at the final M.B.B.S.





               examination. The marks in the subject which was opted for post-




               graduation study were alone to be considered as decisive. However,

               under subsequent resolution of 1989, the "aggregate marks"



               obtained at the first, second and final M.B.B.S. examinations were

               the decisive criterion. This change in rules was challenged by

               invoking the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate

               expectations. The Full Bench rejected such challenge by observing




                                                                                         
               that it was not possible to accept the contention that the prospectus




                                                                 
               once issued by the Government, cannot be altered at all at a

               subsequent stage. The Government which has competence to issue




                                                                
               rules or regulations, has, as a corrollary, powers to amend or alter or

               even repeal and reissue such rules and regulations. It was difficult to

               accept the proposition that the rule of promissory estoppel operates




                                                                
               even qua the rules for admission to the medical colleges. Altered
                                           
               situations needed alteration in the rules and if on the basis of the
                                          
               relevant material, the Government comes to the conclusion that the

               rules need a change, the plea of promissory estoppel cannot be
         

               urged to abort such a change. The Full Bench expressed itself,
      



               thus :



                         32. Does the rule of promissory estoppel operate so
                         that the admission rules once issued could not be
                         altered subsequently by the Government? It is assumed





                         in some decisions that a student preparing for the
                         qualifying examination on the basis of the Prospectus
                         relating to postgraduate courses prevailing at that
                         particular point of time is entitled to continue to receive
                         benefits or advantages arising therefrom and





                         consequently no change can be made to his prejudice. It
                         is difficult to accept such a broad proposition. Students
                         entering educational institutions with the ultimate aim of
                         completing their scholastic career at the peak are
                         expected to strive for academic excellence, and
                         accordingly, it cannot be assumed that a student would
                         only look at a GR operating at or about the time when he
                         intensifies the preparation for the qualifying examination
                         and regulating admission to post-graduate courses.



                                                                                            115/130


                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 29/03/2014 18:59:44 :::

                         Then again, a student is indeed expected to do his best
                         throughout his scholastic career. The heights are
                         reached not by a sudden flight. They are reached by




                                                                                         
                         those who toil upwards in the night while their
                         companions slept. (The borrowing from the lines of
                         Longfellow is acknowledged). In a highly competitive




                                                                 
                         examination there is a neck to neck race even among
                         those who spare no pains or times to achieve the
                         coveted goal. Quite often, imponderable factors or
                         fortuitous circumstances may affect the fate. Under such




                                                                
                         circumstances, it would be unrealistic to posit a theory of
                         promissory estoppel based on the elusive concept of the
                         preparation time for the qualifying examination.



                         35. Consider, again, some actualities of life. It may be




                                                                
                         that the Government may feel that an amendment is
                         needed even after the prospectus is published.



                         Suppose, for example, a diploma or a degree or the
                         study in a particular educational institution is treated as
                         equivalent for the qualification provided in the
                                          
                         prospectus. If subsequently the Government receives
                         reliable evidence that the institution is either non-existent
                         or a fraudulent one, cannot the prospectus be amended
                         by deleting the equivalence accorded to such diploma or
         

                         degree? There cannot be, on principle, any such
                         prohibition for the Government to introduce such a
      



                         change.



                         44. Is that principle attracted, having regard to the
                         factual aspects and the circumstances available here?
                         We have indicated earlier, while discussing the doctrine





                         of promissory estoppel, some of the peculiar features of
                         academic pursuits. They are not to be equated with
                         commercial activities or trade dealings, which raise
                         questions of immediate and easily exigible profits and
                         other advantages. In particular, prosecuting a





                         postgraduate professional course could not be linked
                         with a narrow and selfish desire for promotion of private
                         interest. The very concept of a profession is the
                         antithesis of activities of a lesser calibre. Merely
                         because of a promulgation of a particular rule or order
                         by the Government authorities, a student particularly
                         aspiring for a post-graduate degree, and that too in a
                         professional course, cannot with grace or legal force
                         contend that he could have a legitimate expectation in


                                                                                            116/130

                         an overriding or even a reasonable need of change.



                         When viewed from the point of view of the duty of a
                         Government to effect appropriate changes, whether it be
                         in the matter of legislation, pure and simple, or in relation

                         warrant the same, such a restriction would be to make
                         societies stagnant and the Government non-functional.

               specific pleadings that the State had at any time held out any

               tenure. In absence of such representation, there arises no question

               of invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

               State whilst students were undergoing their course in Medical

               Colleges, by observing that no promise was made either in the

               prospectus or in the rules for admission that the fees prevailing at

               no point in confusing one with the other. Besides, the decision of the

               arbitrary, unreasonable and not taken in public interest, where the

               doctrine of legitimate expectation is to be applied. If it is a question

               in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be

               justified on "Wednesbury reasonableness". The decision-maker has

               the choice in balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change

               expectation merely permits the Court to find out if the change of

               policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is

               made. A claim based merely on legitimate expectation without

               anything more cannot ipso facto give a right. For legal purposes,




                                                                
               expectation is not same as anticipation. Legitimacy of an

               expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of

               law.

               Court which had granted relief applying doctrine of legitimate

               expectation, by observing thus:




                       21. The High Court has lost sight of the fact that





                       education is a dynamic system and courses/subjects
                       have to keep changing with regard to market demand,

                       society. In such matters, the courts cannot interfere lightly

                         The learned counsels appearing of the Petitioners then
                                          
               contended that the GR dated 2.7.2013 had in fact been stayed by

               this Hon'ble Court in its interim order dated 4.7.2013 in Writ Petition
         

               No.5290 of 2013 and therefore the State had no right whatsoever to
      



               rely upon the same as its policy in clause 7.1 of the Brochure of

               PGM-CET 2014. The learned counsels contended that by interim

               order dated 4.7.2013, this Court, upon due consideration of GRs





               dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 issued directions that the position

               which prevailed prior to the judgment of the Division Bench dated





               5.7.2012 (supra) should prevail. This, according to the Petitioners,

               constitutes a clear judicial snub to the GR dated 2.7.2013.



               61]       A careful reading of the interim order dated 4.7.2013 in Writ

               Petition No.5290 of 2013 would indicate that such is not the position.

               In the first place, the interim order dated 4.7.2013 concerns

               admissions to the Postgraduate Courses in the academic year 2013-




                                                                                         

               14. The interim order came to be passed upon this Court being




                                                                 
               appraised that despite directions contained in the judgment and

               order dated 5.7.2012 (supra), the State has not issued any GR "well




                                                                
               in time". Accordingly, this Court observed that it was making the

               interim order "without going into factual aspect as to what decision

               has been taken by the Government in the GRs dated 21.6.2013 and




                                                                
               2.7.2013". Further this Court made it clear that insofar as the effect
                                           
               of two GRs dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013 is concerned, the same
                                          
               can be taken into consideration at the final hearing of the Petition

               and that the Petitions be disposed of finally at the stage of
         

               admission. From all this, it is clear that the interim order was not to
      



               apply for the admission to the Postgraduate Courses for the

               academic year 2014-15 as it was reasonably expected that the

               Petitions would be taken up for final hearing before the





               commencement of the academic year 2014-15. The Petitions have

               accordingly been so taken up for final hearing. In the circumstances,





               I see no merit in the submission that the GR dated 2.7.2013 was

               "stayed" by the interim order dated 4.7.2013. If this submission is to

               be stretched any further, then it would mean that even the GR dated

               21.6.2013, of which the Petitioners now seek implementation was

               also similarly "stayed". In the context of admissions for the academic


                                                                                            121/130

               year 2014-15, which were to commence in April 2014, it cannot be

               said that the GR dated 2.7.2013 or the admission Brochure dated




                                                                                         
               28.11.2013, which clarifies policy, was not issued "well in time".



               Clearly, therefore, there is no merit in the submission of the

               Petitioners that the GR dated 2.7.2013 could not have been made or




                                                                
               accepted as the Government policy in the matter of reservations to

               in-service candidates.



               62]       In the present case, it cannot be said that the change in the
                                           
               policy is abrupt, so as to warrant interference. Admittedly, there was
                                          
               an issue with regard to determination of quota or seats for in-service

               candidates, which prompted the filing of Writ Petition No. 5214 of
         

               2012. The said Petition was disposed of by judgment and order
      



               dated 5.7.2012, in which the manner of computation of seats was in

               fact upheld, but directions were issued to the State to come out with

               Resolution specifying the policy to be adopted from the academic





               year 2013-14. As there was delay in formulation of policy, Writ

               Petition No.5290 of 2013 came to be filed, wherein interim order was





               made on 4.7.2013 that admissions be proceeded with on basis of

               the position prevalent prior to the judgment and order dated

               5.7.2012. By this time, the policy as contained in GR dated 2.7.2013

               was already in place. The Brochure published on 28.11.2013, also

               made it clear that for the academic year 2014-15, reservations/quota


                                                                                            122/130

               for in-service candidates would be in accordance with the policy

               contained in GR dated 2.7.2013. Thus, in the context of academic




                                                                                         
               year 2014-15, it cannot be said that the GR was not issued "well in




                                                                 
               time". Accordingly, it is not possible to accede to the submissions of

               the learned counsels for the Petitioners that that the position which




                                                                
               prevailed at the time when the interim order dated 4.7.2013 was

               made, prevails even now at the stage of final hearing of the

               Petitions. Further, there is no merit in the contention that the change




                                                                
               in policy as disclosed in GR dated 21.6.2013 and 2.7.2013, amounts
                                           
               to an abrupt change. It is not and it can perhaps not be the case of
                                          
               any of the Petitioners that they have altered their positions

               drastically, relying upon the GR dated 21.6.2013 and consequently,
         

               it would be unjust or inequitable to permit enforcement of policy
      



               contained in GR dated 2.7.2013. In the context of admissions for the

               academic year 2014-15, the change between 21.6.2013 and

               2.7.2013, is by no means such as to deride the same as being





               abrupt or arbitrary. If the submission of the Petitioners is to be

               accepted, then the State would be in no position to implement





               changed policy until all the current in-service candidates secure

               admissions against reservations or quota for Postgraduate Degree

               and Diploma Courses. This, in my opinion, would not be a

               reasonable or a rational manner of giving effect to State policy.



                                                                                            123/130

               63]       There is yet another aspect that needs mention. In the event,


               the Petitioners' plea that G.R. dated 2.7.2013 is arbitrary,




                                                                                         
               unreasonable, null and void is accepted and the said G.R dated




                                                                 
               2.7.2013 is struck down then, that by itself would not revive the GR

               dated 21.6.2013 which had been cancelled by the GR dated




                                                                
               2.7.2013. There is no such principle on basis of which it could be

               urged that once a GR is quashed, the earlier GR which it had

               superseded or cancelled automatically revives. Further it is not for




                                                                
               the Court to order such revival, because under such guise, the Court
                                           
               would itself be enacting a policy. In case, a Court finds a policy to be
                                          
               arbitrary, discriminatory, unconstitutional, null and void, it is within

               the domain of the Court to strike down same. However, it is not for
         

               the Court to re-formulate any policy or to declare that any old policy
      



               stands revived.



 
64]       In the case of 
State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Hirendra Pal Singh
 -




               2011 (5) SCC 305, the Supreme Court observed thus:



                       27. Thus, the High Court erred in issuing directions to
                       the State authorities to proceed, as an interim measure,





                       under a non-existing law. Such an order seems to have
                       been passed only to fill up the vacuum. Generally
                       quashing of a subsequent notification would not affect in
                       revival of an earlier notification in whose place the
                       subsequent notification had been issued, however, the
                       legal effect of an earlier law when the later law enacted in
                       its place is declared invalid, does not depend merely upon
                       the use of the words like substitution or suppression. It
                       depends upon the totality of circumstances and the

                       29. Therefore, it is evident that under certain
                                           
                       circumstances, an Act which stood repealed, may revive
                       in case the substituted Act is declared ultra
                       vires/unconstitutional by the court on the ground of
                                          
                       legislative competence etc., however, the same shall not
                       be the position in case of subordinate legislation. In the
                       instant case, the L.R. Manual is consisted of executive
                       instructions, which can be replaced any time by another
         

                       set of executive instructions. (Vide Johri Mal).

                       30. Therefore, question of revival of the repealed
      



                       clauses of LR Manual in case the substituted clauses are
                       struck down by the court, would not arise. In view of this,
                       the interim order would amount to substituting the legal
                       policy by the judicial order, and thus not sustainable.

                       must also take note of the position in law that the
                       Court cannot issue a writ of Mandamus to the
                       legislature to enact a law and similarly a Court cannot




                                                                                         
                       direct a subordinate legislative body to enact a
                       particular rule. In State of Tamil Nadu vs. K.Shyam

                       Act of the legislature is struck down for want of
                       legislative competence or on the ground that it is
                       violative of the fundamental rights in Part-III of the
                       Constitution, it would be unenforceable in view of
                       
Article 13(2)
 and the old Act would revive. But this




                                                                
                       proposition of law, the Supreme Court held, is not
                       applicable to subordinate legislation. Hence, even if
                       the Court were to strike down the amendment made to
                       Rule 49, that would not result in a revival of Rule 49 in
                       its original form. We must, however, clarify that for the




                                                                
                       reasons that we have already indicated, we have come

                       third paragraphs of Rule 49 was valid.

               (1977) 2 ALL ER 182 , the Lord Lawton observed thus:



                       "In the United Kingdom aviation policy is determined by
         


                       ministers within the legal framework set out by parliament.
                       Judges have nothing to do with either policy - making or
      



                       the carrying out of policy. Their function is to decide
                       whether a minister has acted within the powers given to
                       him by statute or the common law. If he is declared by
                       court after due process of law, to have acted outside his





                       powers, he must stop doing what he has done until such
                       time as Parliament gives him the powers he wants. In a
                       case such as this I regard myself as a referee. I can blow
                       my judicial whistle when the ball goes out of play; but
                       when the game restarts I must neither take part in it nor





                       tell the players how to play."

68]       Insofar as Mr. Anturkar's submission that the field is covered

               by the 1998 Act and therefore, the State is denuded of its executive

               powers to issue GR dated 2.7.2013 is concerned, the same is not




                                                                
               acceptable. The perusal of the provisions of 1998 Act would indicate
                                           
               that the same primarily relate to establishment and incorporation of
                                          
               the University of Health Sciences in the State and to provide for

               matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. On the basis of
         

               provisions contained in 
Section 5(k)
 of the 1998 Act, it cannot be
      



               said that the power to prescribe the reservations or define the extent

               of reservation is vested exclusively in the University and the State

               shall have no say or powers in that regard. Besides, it is the





               contention of Mr. Anturkar himself that if the statute contains

               provision for making sub-ordinate legislation, then so long as such





               legislation has not been enacted, the statute although brought in

               force, cannot be made operative. However, even assuming that Mr.

               Anturkar's submission that the field stands occupied by the 1998 Act

               is to be accepted, then even 
in that case
 there is no question of

               revival of an executive instruction of 1990, on basis of which the

               Petitioners can claim for any reservations for in-service candidates

               to Postgraduate Degree Courses.




               69]       There were no submissions advanced by the Petitioners with

               regard to the manner of working out of the reserved seats, although




                                                                
               the reliefs were sought for in some of the Petitions in this regard. As

               a matter of abundant caution, therefore, it is made clear that this

               Court finds no infirmity whatsoever in the manner in which the

               reservations to in-service candidates to the Postgraduate Diploma
                                          
               Courses. In fact, in my opinion, this issue stands settled by the

               judgment of this Court dated 5.7.2012(supra) wherein at paragraph
         

               6, this Court observed thus:



                        6.     .........................In that view of the matter, the
                        question that can be considered by the Court is as to
                        whether the modality which has been followed by the
                        State Government as explained above is so patently
                        arbitrary as to warrant the interference of this Court on the





                        ground that there is a violation of the fundamental right
                        under 
Article 14.
 The object of an in service quota is to
                        provide an incentive for government service. The in
                        service quota is made available to candidates who are in
                        government service, to pursue postgraduate degree or





                        diploma courses. It cannot be held that the underlying
                        rationale for excluding the seats which are set apart for
                        the All India quota and the seats in non-clinical subjects is
                        violative of 
Article 14.
 The State Government has no
                        control over the allotment of seats under the All India
                        quota. If the government has taken a policy decision to
                        the effect that since in service candidates are required to
                        attend to patients, consequently, the reservation should
                        be allocated to clinical seats, it would be difficult for the
