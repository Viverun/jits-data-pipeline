 the accused persons, therefore, the burden of proving that fact rested on
them, which they have miserably failed to discharge in the present case.



22. It has been argued by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State, duly assisted
by Ld. Counsel for the complainant that the phone calls received by PW6
Satender from the mobile no. of the accused Sandeep on 29.11.2014 and
the phone call made on the said mobile phone of the accused Sandeep by
PW2 Pramod Kumar on the same day, wherein, the deceased disclosed
about the beatings given to her by the accused persons and cruelty and
harassment meted out to her on the demands of dowry, constitute dying
declaration and the accused persons could be convicted solely on the
basis of the said dying declaration itself.



23. It is further submitted by the Ld. Addl. PP for the state that the
identity of the accused persons were fully established in the present case
as they were duly identified by all the prosecution witnesses before the
Court.



24.      In support of his contentions, the Ld. Addl. PP for the State, duly
assisted by the Ld. Counsel for the complainant had relied upon the
decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in "

 Submissions made on behalf of the accused persons:



25.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that the deceased was aged less than 18 years at the time of her marriage
with accused Sandeep. The said fact has been duly proved by the defense
through the evidence of DW2 Kanwar Pal Singh. In his testimony, DW2
brought on record the Scholars Register and Transfer Certificate Form
and on the relevant stage, at serial no. 5160 the entry pertaining to
deceased Nisha was duly recorded and as per the said entry Ex. DW-2/A,
deceased Nisha took admission in their school on 14.07.2007 and she left
the said school on 30.06.2011. As per the said entry, the date of birth of
deceased Nisha was 01.07.1996. The said entry Ex. DW-2/A was
registered on the basis of school admission application Ex. DW-2/B and
the passing certificate issued from her previous school dated 10.07.2007
Ex. DW-2/C. Therefore, on 19.04.2012, the deceased was less than 16
years of age. Furthermore, it was argued by the Ld. Defense counsel that
the marriage of the deceased Nisha was solemnized by her family
members against her wish and consent. Deceased Nisha was not happy
with the said marriage with accused Sandeep and therefore, she
committed suicide by hanging herself. It was only after her death by
suicide, her family members have leveled false allegations against the
accused persons and no dowry was ever demanded by the accused
persons and no cruelty was committed by them upon the deceased.



26.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that the charges in the present case were framed on 28.01.2016 and in
spite of number of summons being sent to the public witnesses belonging                               Digitally
                                                                                                      signed by

 to the family of the deceased, they chose not to appear before this court
to get their testimonies recorded. The testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar
was recorded only on 23.01.2017, after he had filed a false and frivolous
complaint against accused Sandeep and his brother-in-law Chawan. The
said motivated complaint ended up in registration of FIR no. 865/16
 u/s
307
/
34
 IPC, 1860 at PS Loni, Ghaziabad, UP. The falsity of the
allegations in the said FIR came to light during the investigation and
ultimately the police proceeded ahead to file the cancellation report in
the said case FIR. The cancellation report was accepted by the concerned
court. The sole purpose of the complainant Pramod Kumar in getting the
said false FIR registered against accused Sandeep and Chawan (mediator
of the marriage) was to pressurize and extort money from the accused
persons.



27.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that in the present case the prosecution has failed miserably to satisfy the
most essential ingredient of the offence punishable
 u/s 304-B
 IPC, 1860,
i.e. " soon before the death" the deceased was subjected to cruelty on
the demands of dowry. The prosecution through the testimonies of PW2
Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender Kumar tried to prove that accused
Sandeep had telephonically contacted them on 28.11.2014. Furthermore,
as per the case of the prosecution, accused Sandeep made them talk to
the deceased and at that time the deceased had disclosed about the
harassment and torture meted out to her on that day by the accused
persons. However, from the testimony of PW28 Ajeet Singh, CDR of the
mobile phone of the accused Sandeep was brought on record and no such
                                                                                                      Digitally

 call was made by him from his mobile phone on the said day.



28.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that the prosecution could not prove the subsequent opinion about the
hanging, since the concerned doctor who had given the second opinion
was never cited as one of the prosecution witnesses. The reason behind
the same was that the said second opinion was not supporting the case of
the prosecution.



29.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that from the testimonies of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender
Kumar only general and cryptic allegations have been leveled against the
accused persons. There are no specific incidents that have come to light
through their testimonies and from the deposition of prosecution
witnesses, it has not come on record, the manner in which the alleged
cruelty was committed upon the deceased, so as to drive her to commit
the suicide.



30.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there are number of material improvements and contradictions in the
testimony of two star prosecution witnesses PW2 Pramod Kumar and
PW6 Satender and they cannot be considered as sterling witnesses. Both
the said witnesses could not withstand the rigors of the cross
examination conducted by Ld. Defense counsel.

 that the testimony of PW24 Mannu is also of no use to the case of
prosecution, since his testimony is hearsay in nature. Furthermore, there
is no ocular witness of the cruelty meted out to the deceased at the hands
of the accused persons. PW12 Sonu Kumar is a planted witness, and he
was made part of the prosecution list of witnesses by the IO, in order to
falsely create the evidence qua the most essential ingredients of 
section
304-B
 IPC, 1860 i.e. "soon before the death", he allegedly went to
handover the invitation card of the marriage of his brother at the house of
the accused persons and that he met the deceased there and he was being
told about the said torture by the deceased herself. However, the said
witness could not withstand the test of cross examination and his
testimony is also not of sterling character. He could not bring on record
the said invitation card, thereby, making his entire testimony
unbelievable.



32.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that the prosecution could not prove that the alleged demand of Rs. 2
lacs      constituted as a dowry demand, since it is the case of the
prosecution itself that the said demand was allegedly raised by the
accused persons to enable accused Sandeep to start a new business.
Furthermore, there are material improvements and contradictions in the
testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender in this regard.



33.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that the star prosecution witness PW2 Pramod Kumar is not a reliable
witness. In his examination in chief, he has deposed that the marriage of                             Digitally
                                                                                                      signed by

 deceased Nisha took place on 17.04.2012, however, during his cross
examination, he had changed the date of marriage between the deceased
and accused Sandeep to 19.04.2012.



34.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that as per the prosecution version, deceased Nisha was adopted by her
chacha PW2 Pramod Kumar. However, during his cross examination,
PW2 Pramod Kumar could neither tell about the date of birth of the
decease nor could he depose about the date the alleged adoption.
Similarly, the other chacha of the deceased PW6 Satender had also
deposed that he was not aware of the date of birth of the deceased, in
spite of deposing before the court that the deceased was living in their
house with them. Furthermore, all the prosecution witnesses PW2
Pramod Kumar, PW6 Satender and PW9 Devendra have categorically
deposed that the deceased was around 18-19 years at the time of her
marriage. However, it was categorically brought on record through the
testimony of DW2 Kanwar Pal Singh that the date of birth of the
deceased was 01.07.1996, thereby, making her less than 16 years at the
time of her marriage.



35.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there is a material contradiction between the testimony of PW2
Pramod Kumar, wherein he had deposed that the deceased stayed at the
house of his mama at village Budheda for about 6-7 years and thereafter,
she was brought to Delhi to live with him and his brother PW6 Satender.

However, his brother PW6 Satender had deposed that since the                                          Digitally

Kumar.         However, the father of the deceased PW9 Devendra had
deposed that his daughter remained with his brother PW2 Pramod
Kumar at village Budheda, till she was about 12 years old.



36.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there are material improvements and contradictions in the testimony
of PW2 Pramod Kumar qua the dowry demand of Rs. 2 lacs raised by
the accused persons and when the said demand was satisfied by him. He
could not prove the source from which he had arranged the said amount
and also could not depose the mixture of currency denomination. As per
the prosecution story, it was the cousin brother of PW2, namely PW10
Rajesh Kumar who had allegedly given a loan of Rs. 2 lacs to PW2,
however, in his cross examination PW10 had admitted that he could
manage to save only Rs. 4,000/- per month from his salary at that time.



37.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there was no previous complaint filed by the family members of the
deceased regarding the alleged dowry demands or the torture meted out
to the deceased at the hands of the accused persons.



38.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there are material contradictions amongst the star prosecution
witnesses, on the aspect of who had raised the dowry demands. As per
PW2 Pramod Kumar, the demand of Rs. 2 lacs was raised by accused
Sandeep alone. However, PW6 Satender had deposed that all the accused                                 Digitally

 persons used to raise a demand of Rs. 2 lacs from the family members of
the deceased.



39.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there are contradictions in the inter-se testimony of the prosecution
witnesses with respect to who all were present at GTB hospital on the
date of the incident. As per the father of the deceased PW9 Devendra, he
met accused Mahesh at the hospital and no other family member of the
accused Sandeep was present there besides accused Mahesh. However,
PW2 Pramod Kumar had deposed that no one from the family of the
accused persons was present in the hospital. However, the IO PW14 SI
Raj Kumar had deposed that when he reached the hospital for the first
time, accused Mahesh and his mother (accused Vikram Devi @
Krishana) were present.



40.      It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that it has come in the testimony of PW10 Rajesh Kumar, who had
allegedly lent Rs. 2 lacs to PW2 Pramod Kumar, that he was being
informed by PW2 Pramod Kumar that the said amount of money was
required by him to be given to accused Sandeep for his
employment/business, however, he had not deposed anywhere that PW2
had informed him that deceased Nisha was being harassed by accused
Sandeep on the account of dowry demands.



41.       It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that the testimony of PW12 Sonu Kumar is also not trustworthy, since                                  Digitally

 his statement was recorded by the IO after two months of the incident.
Furthermore, he had made material improvement on his version stated
before the police on the point of harassment suffered by the deceased and
the demands of dowry raised by the accused persons. He was duly
confronted with his earlier statement recorded by the police.



42.       It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that testimony of PW13 Mannu is also of no material relevance, since he
is only a hear-say witness and he had merely deposed as to what was
being told to him by his nephews PW2 Pramod and PW9 Devendra.



43.       It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons
that there are material contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution
witnesses, in so far as the place where the statements Ex. PW2/A and Ex.
PW6/A were recorded by the concerned SDM. It has come in the
testimony of PW15 SI Pravesh Kumar that the concerned SDM had
recorded the statements of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender in the
GTB hospital. However, in the testimony of PW18 Ct. Monu, it has
come that on 30.11.2014, he went to the SDM office and the statements
of PW2 and PW6 were recorded there.

 Relevant Law & the case laws:



45.      Before coming to the discussion of the evidence adduced by the
prosecution on merits, this court deems it necessary to discuss the law
and the judgments passed by the superior courts in this regard.



46.      In order to succeed in charge under 
Section 498A
 of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 the prosecution is required to prove that the accused
had subjected the deceased to cruelty, as defined in the explanation to the
section. For this purpose, the provision of 
Sec. 498A
 IPC, 1860 is
reproduce as under:-

             "
Sec. 498A
 IPC, 1860. Husband or relative of
             husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty:

             Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the
             husband of a woman, subjects such woman to
             cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a
             term which may extend to three years and shall also
             be liable to fine.

             Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,
             "cruelty means"--

             (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is
             likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to
             cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health
             (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or

             (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment
             is with a view to coercing her or any person related                                  Digitally
                                                                                                   signed by
                                                                                                   ATUL


             to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property
                                                                                           ATUL    AHLAWAT

                                                                                                   2024.09.20
                                                                                                   13:17:36
                                                                                                   +0530

              or valuable security or is on account of failure by her
             or any person related to her to meet such demand."



47.      It is clear from a bare reading of the said provision in conjunction
with the 'Explanation' appended to the said section, that it is not every
cruelty which is punishable under 
Section 498A
 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860. The cruelty, so as to attract penal provisions, contained in

Section 498A
 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, has necessarily to be a willful
conduct, which is of such a nature that it is likely to drive a woman to
commit suicide or cause grievous injury or danger to her life or health.
The use of the expression "willful" in the explanation to 
Section 498A
 of
Indian Penal Code, 1860, indicates that the conduct attributed to the
accused, in order to be culpable, needs to be deliberate, aimed at causing
injury to the health of the woman or bringing misery to her. If the
accused knows or is reasonably expected to know that his conduct is
likely to cause injury to the life, limb or health of the aggrieved woman
or if his conduct is of such a nature, that causing injury to the life, limb
or health can be a natural consequence for the woman, who is recipient
of such a conduct, it will attract criminal liability on the part of the
husband or his relative, as the case may be.



48.     It is easily believed that everyone is presumed to intend the natural
consequences of his act and such a presumption must necessarily be
drawn even if there is no intention to cause any injury or harm to the
woman. Whether the conduct in question is likely to drive the woman to
cause injury to her life, limb or health, will depend upon a number of                                  Digitally
                                                                                                        signed by
                                                                                                        ATUL
                                                                                                ATUL    AHLAWAT
                                                                                                AHLAWAT Date:

                                                                                                        2024.09.20
                                                                                                        13:17:43
                                                                                                        +0530

 factors such as social and economic status of the parties, the level of
awareness of the aggrieved woman, her temperament, state of her health,
physical as well as mental and how she is likely to perceive such a
behavior. If a woman is harassed with a view to coerce her or any of her
relatives to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable
security, it will also constitute cruelty, as defined in the explanation to

Section 498A
 of Indian Penal Code.



49.      The expression "Cruelty" takes in its ambit mental cruelty as well
as physical torture of the woman. If the conduct of the accused with a
woman is likely to cause a reasonable apprehension in her mind that her
living with the husband will be harmful and injurious to her life and
safety, such a conduct would attract criminal liability, envisaged in

Section 498A
 of IPC, 1860.



50. If the woman has been harassed on account of her failure or the
failure of her relatives to meet an unlawful demand for property or
valuable security, that also constitutes cruelty, within the meaning of

Section 498A
 of IPC. The expression "harassment" has not been defined
in 
Section 498A
 of IPC, but its dictionary meaning is 'to subject
someone to continuous vexatious attacks, questions, demands or other
unpleasantness, etc'. However, it is not harassment of every nature
which is punishable under 
Section 498A
 of IPC. In order to attract
criminal liability, there should be torture physical or mental, by positive
acts. Such acts should be aimed at persuading or compelling the woman
or her relatives to meet an unlawful demand of any property or valuable                               Digitally

 security or it should be actuated by the failure of the woman or her
relative to meet such a demand



51. It is also pertinent to reproduce the provision
 u/s 304B
 IPC, as
under:-

          " Sec. 304B. Dowry Death
          (1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any
          burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under
          normal circumstances within seven years of her
          marriage and it is shown that soon before her death
          she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her
          husband or any relative of her husband for, or in
          connection with, any demand for dowry, such death
          shall be called "dowry death", and such husband or
          relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.
          (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished
          with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
          than seven years but which may extend to
          imprisonment for life."



52. It is clear from the said provision that in order to establish a charge
under

53.     The term "Dowry" has not been defined in 
Section 304B
 of IPC,
but, since this expression has been defined in 
Section 2
 of Dowry
Prohibition Act, 1961 it is required to be given the same meaning for the
purpose of under 
Section 304B
 IPC as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court
in "
Satvir Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab and Anr.
" 2001 (4) Crimes 45
(SC). 
Section 2
 of Dowry Prohibition Act defines dowry as under:


              "....Definition of 'dowry'. In this Act, "dowry"

              means any property or valuable security given or

54.       Dowry would include property or valuable security which is
actually given or which is agreed to be given, in relation to the marriage
of a person in question. The property or valuable security may be given
or may be agreed to be given before marriage or at the time of marriage
or at any time after the marriage, so long as it is connected with the
marriage. However, there has to be a link between the property given or
agreed to be given and the marriage. If at any time before or at the time
of or even during marriage, the parents of a woman or any other person
related or connected to her agree to give some cash, valuable security or
property to her husband or in-laws after marriage, that also would be
covered within the definition of dowry as the agreement or promise in
such a case would be attributable to the marriage or proposed marriage
and if there is demand for any cash property, valuable security etc. which
is promised, but not given, it would constitute demand for dowry. If the
husband of the girl or any other person related or connected to him,
demands something from the girl or her parents or any other person
related to or connected with her, saying that the articles being demanded
by them were expected to be given or ought to have been given in
marriage, that would also, to my mind, constitute demand of dowry
because even though such an article may not have been agreed or
promised to be given by the girl or her family members, it might have
been in the contemplation of the boy and/or his family members, on
account of the expectation that such an article would be given at the time                             Digitally
                                                                                                       signed by
                                                                                                       ATUL
                                                                                               ATUL    AHLAWAT
                                                                                               AHLAWAT Date:

                                                                                                       2024.09.20
                                                                                                       13:18:09
                                                                                                       +0530

CNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015    State Vs. Sandeep & Ors.   FIR No. 1665/2014   Page no. 68/110
 of marriage. Therefore,        such demand would be considered to be a
demand in connection with the marriage though made after the marriage
has been solemnized.



55.      Even demands of articles such as T.V., fridge, jewellery, clothes,
furniture, etc. which usually are given or expected in marriages in our
country, would, considering the objective sought to be achieved by
incorporating Section 304B in 
IPC
, 1860 and enacting 
Dowry
Prohibition Act, 1961
, fall within the purview of 
Section 304B
 of IPC,
1860 .



56.      
In the case of " 
Pawan Kumar & Ors. v. State of Haryana
", AIR
1998 SCC 958, the Apex Court has specifically held that demand of T.V.,
Fridge, etc. though not agreed to be given or promised or even demanded
prior to or at the time of marriage, to be a demand for dowry for the
purpose of 
Section 304B
 of Indian Penal Code. If cash or some property,
etc. is demanded by the boy or his family members, after marriage,
saying that they were expecting such cash, property, etc. to be given in
marriage, and the girl, or her parents or any other person related or
connected to her promise to fulfill such a demand, that also may fall
within the purview of dowry, as the promise though made after marriage,
would nevertheless be referable to the marriage, having been made with
a view to preserve the marriage. In case, if the demand is made after
marriage and it is in respect of a property or valuable security, which was
not demanded, was not expected to be given and also was not in
contemplation at any time up to solemnization of marriage, demand of
                                                                                                      Digitally

                                                                                                      ATUL

                                                                                                      2024.09.20
                                                                                                      13:18:17
                                                                                                      +0530

 such cash, property or valuable security, etc. cannot be said to be in
connection with the marriage and, therefore, would not constitute
demand of dowry.



57.     
In the case of " 
Satbir Singh Vs. State of Punjab
", 200 14 Crimes 45
(SC) while dealing with this issue, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, inter
alia, observed as under:


              "....... Thus, there are three occasions related to
              dowry. One is before the marriage, second is at the
              time of marriage and the third is "at any time" after
              the marriage. The third occasion may appear to be
              an unending period. But the crucial words are "in
              connection with the marriage of the said parties".

              This means that giving or agreeing to give any
              property or valuable security on any of the above
              three stages should have been in connection with
              the marriage of the parties. There can be many other
              instances for payment of money or giving property
              as between the spouses. For example, some
              customary payments in connection with birth of a
              child or other ceremonies are prevalent in different
              societies. Such payments are not enveloped within
              the ambit of "dowry". Hence the dowry mentioned
              in Section 304B should be any property or valuable
              security given or agreed to be given in connection
              with the marriage......"

                                                                                                    Digitally

 58.      
In the case of "
Appasaheb and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra
" , AIR
2007 SC 763, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:


              "...... In view of the aforesaid definition of the word
              "dowry" any property or valuable security should be
              given or agreed to be given either directly or
              indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage
              and in connection with the marriage of the said
              parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of property
              or valuable security must have some connection
              with the marriage of the parties and a correlation
              between the giving or taking of property or valuable
              security with the marriage of the parties is essential.
              Being a penal provision it has to be strictly
              construed. Dowry is a fairly well known social
              custom or practice in India. It is well settled
              principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act
              is passed with reference to a particular trade,
              business or transaction and words are used which
              everybody conversant with that trade, business or
              transaction knows or understands to have a
              particular meaning in it, then the words are to be
              construed as having that particular meaning........ A

               termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is
              normally understood. The evidence adduced by the

              demand for "dowry" as defined in 
Section 2
 of the
              Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants
              as what was allegedly asked for was some money
              for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing
              manure....."



59.        The 
Indian Penal Code
, 1860, and the 
Dowry Prohibition Act,
1961
, are both remedial and penal statutes. As such, Courts are expected
to construe the provisions in a way that the purpose is fulfilled through
and within the limits of language employed in the statute. If a case is
established then the Courts are to be stringent in dealing with the
culprits. The Courts while taking a stringent view and despite the
obligation of the legislative enactment a success, have also to keep in
mind that the charge should be made out.



60.       The main ingredients to be proved for establishing a case under

Section 304B
 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, are (i) unnatural death of a
woman within seven years of her marriage and (ii) she being subjected to
cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband, in
connection with any demand of dowry.



61.      The words "it is shown" occurring in 
Section 304B
 IPC, 1860, are

 circumstances envisaged by 
Section 304B
 IPC, 1860, do exist on the
prosecution. This being shown or established, the question of
presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act would arise. In
other words, to draw a presumption under 
section 113B
 of the Evidence
Act, the necessary ingredient that need to be shown is that soon before
the death of the girl, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment in
connection with the demands of dowry, has to be proved. Only when
these facts are proved then by virtue of the deeming provision of 
section
304B
 IPC, the Court shall presume that the husband or any relative of
the husband had caused dowry death. Though cruelty at any time after
the marriage may cause depression in the mind of the victim, the cruelty
and harassment envisaged by 
Section 304B
 IPC is to be 'soon before the
death' of a woman.



62.         The Courts are required to scrutinize the evidence carefully
because cases are not rare in which occasionally there is a demand and
then the atmosphere becomes calm and quiet and then again there is
demand. Where a wife dies in the house of her husband within a short
span of seven years of her marriage, it is of considerable difficulty to
assess the precise circumstances in which the incident occurred because
ordinarily independent witnesses are not available as the torture and
harassment is confined to the four walls of the house. The Courts are,
however, required to be vigilant to scrutinize the evidence regarding the
harassment and torture carefully if the witnesses are the relatives of the
deceased and relations between them and her in laws are strained for any
reason whatever it might be.

63.       Urge for living is a natural phenomenon in mankind. A person
would not embrace death unless there is some psychological problem or
mental agony or such circumstances that the person committing suicide
may think that life he or she is living is more miserable than the pangs
and agony of death. The power of tolerance would vary from person to
person. Some persons try to make the life easy by tolerance while others
even on petty points bring an end to their life. Reliance is placed upon
the judgment of the Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court reported as "
Gurditta
Singh v. The State of Rajasthan
", 1992 Crl. L. J. 309 .




64.        The importance of Proximity Test is both for the proof of an
offence of 'dowry death' as well as for raising a presumption under

Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act. The expression "soon before her
death" used in the substantive 
section 304B
 IPC and 
Section 113B

Evidence Act is impregnated with the idea of proximity test. No definite
period has been indicated with respect to the expression " soon before"

used in 
Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act, however, Illustration (a) of the
Act is relevant. The determination of the period which can come within
the term "soon before" is left to be determined by the Courts, depending
upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to
indicate that the expression "soon before" would normally imply that the
interval should not be too much between the concerned cruelty or
harassment and the death in question. There must be existence of a
proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry
demand and the concerned death. If the alleged incident of cruelty is                                 Digitally

 remote in time and has become stale enough not to disturb mental
equilibrium of the woman concerned, it would be of no consequence. It
is well settled by several judgments that mere suspicion cannot be a
substitute for proof of guilt. 
In the case reported as "
State of Punjab v.
Bhajan Singh and Ors.
" AIR 1975 SC 258, it was observed by Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India as under:


              "......... The circumstances of this case undoubtedly
              create suspicion against the accused. Suspicion, by
              itself, however strong it may be, is not sufficient to
              take the place of proof and warrant a finding of guilt
              of the accused....."



65.      Further more, in another case reported as " 
Mousam Singha Roy &
Ors. v. State of West Bengal
" , 2003 (3) JCC 1358 , it was observed by
Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:


              ''......Before we conclude, we must place on record
              the fact that we are not unaware of the degree of
              agony and frustration that may be caused to the
              society in general and the families of the victims in
              particular, by the fact that a heinous crime like this
              goes unpunished, but then the law does not permit
              the courts to punish the accused on the basis of
              moral conviction or on suspicion alone. The burden
              of proof in a criminal trial never shifts, and it is
              always the burden of the prosecution to prove its

               acceptable evidence. 
In a similar circumstance this
              Court in the case of 
Sarwan Singh Rattan Singh Vs
              State of Punjab
 (AIR 1957 SC 637) stated thus:


                       It is no doubt a matter of regret that a foul
              cold blooded and cruel murder should go
              unpunished. There may also be an element of truth
              in the prosecution story against the accused.
              Considered as a whole, the prosecution story may
              be true; but between 'may be true' and 'must be true'
              there is inevitably a long distance to travel and the
              whole of this distance must be covered by the
              prosecution by legal, reliable and unimpeachable
              evidence before an accused can be convicted....."



66.       Further more, in another case reported as "
Sher Singh @ Partapa
v. State Of Haryana
," 2015 (3) SCC 724, it was observed by Hon'ble
Supreme Court as under:


              "7.....It is noteworthy that whilst 
Section 113A
 of
              the Evidence Act reposes discretion in the Court to
              draw a presumption so far as the husband's
              abetment in his wife's suicide, Parliament has
              mandated the Court to draw at least an adverse
              inference under Section 113B in the event of a
              dowry death. It seems to us that where a wife is
              driven to the extreme step of suicide it would be

              9. Death can be accidental, suicidal or homicidal.

              The first type is a tragedy and no criminal
              complexion is conjured up, unless statutorily so
              devised, as in Section 304A; but even there the
              culpable act is that of the person actually causing
              the death. It seems to us that 
Section 304B
 of the
              IPC, inasmuch as it also takes within its
              contemplation "the death of a woman ..... otherwise
              than under normal circumstances", endeavours to
              cover          murders     masquerading         as     accidents.

 
Justifiably, the suicidal death of a married woman
              who was meted out with cruelty by her husband,
              where her demise occurred within seven years of
              marriage in connection with a dowry demand
              should lead to prosecution and punishment under
              Sections 304B and/or 306 of the 
IPC
. However, if
              the perfidious harassment and cruelty by the
              husband is conclusively proved by him to have had
              no causal connection with his cruel behaviour based
              on a dowry demand, these provisions are not
              attracted as held in 
Bhagwan Das v. Kartar Singh

              (2007) 11 SCC 205, although some reservation may
              remain regarding the reach of Section 306.

               prosecution, ubiquitously and in dereliction of duty,
              in the case of an abnormal death if a young bride
              confines its charges to Section 304B because the
              obligation     to    provide             proof   becomes         least
              burdensome for it; this is the significance that
              attaches to a deeming provision. But, in any death
              other than in normal circumstances, we see no
              justification for not citing either Section 302 or
              Section 306, as the circumstances of the case call
              for. Otherwise, the death would logically fall in the
              category of an accidental one. It is not sufficient to
              include only Section 498A as the punishment is
              relatively light. Homicidal death is chargeable and
              punishable under Sections 302 and 304B if
              circumstances prevail triggering these provisions.
              
This Court has repeatedly reiterated this position,
              including in 
State of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh
, 1991 (3)
              SCC 1 and quite recently in 
Jasvinder Saini v. State
              (Govt. of NCT of Delhi

as a deeming provision and observed that the word ' shown' in 
Sec. 304B

IPC would connote 'prove'. It further observed as under:-

               discharge the husband or his family members of
              their guilt. This interpretation provides the accused
              a chance of proving their innocence. This is also the
              postulation of 
Section 101
 of the Evidence Act. The
              purpose of 
Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act and
              
Section 304B
 of the IPC, in our opinion, is to
              counter what is commonly encountered - the lack or
              the absence of evidence in the case of suicide or
              death of a woman within seven years of marriage. If
              the word "shown" has to be given its ordinary
              meaning then it would only require the prosecution
              to merely present its evidence in Court, not
              necessarily through oral deposition, and thereupon
              make the accused lead detailed evidence to be
              followed by that of the prosecution. This procedure
              is unknown to Common Law systems, and beyond
              the contemplation of the 
Cr.P.C

68.      In the background of the above, I shall now discuss the evidence
brought on record in the present case. It is trite law that the accused
persons can be convicted on the basis of credible evidence brought on
record and the appreciation of the said evidence must be done in correct
and true perspective manner and in the natural course of events, what
would have been occurred. Appreciation of evidence beyond reasonable
doubt does not mean that it should be assessed beyond any iota of doubt.

place evidence at a higher degree of preponderance of probabilities
compared to what is degree of preponderance of probability in civil
cases. The theory of Beyond Reasonable Doubt means expecting higher
degree of preponderance of probabilities and the natural conduct of
human beings, as held by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in "

69.       
Section 3
 of the Indian Evidence Act defines "evidence". The
evidence can be broadly divided into oral and documentary. "Evidence"
under the Act can be said to include the means, factor or material,
lending a degree of probability through a logical inference to the
existence of a fact. It is an adjective law highlighting and aiding the
substantive law. Thus, it is neither wholly procedural nor substantive,
though trappings of both could be felt.



70.     The definition of the word "proved" though gives an impression of
a mere interpretation, in effect, is the heart and soul of the entire Act.
This clause, consciously speaks of proving a fact by considering the
"matters before it". The importance is attached to the degree of
probability in proving a fact through the consideration of the matters
before the court. What is required for a court to decipher is the existence
of a fact and its proof by a degree of probability, through a logical
inference.



71.      Matters are necessary, concomitant material factors to prove a fact.                         Digitally

 All "evidence" would be "matters" but not vice versa. In other words,
matters could be termed as a genus of which evidence would be a
species. Matters also adds strength to the evidence giving adequate
ammunition in the Court's sojourn in deciphering the truth. Thus, the
definition of "matters" is exhaustive, and therefore, much wider than that
of "evidence". However, there is a caveat, as the court is not supposed to
consider a matter which acquires the form of an evidence when it is
barred in law. Matters are required for a court to believe in the existence
of a fact.



72.      Matters, do give more discretion and flexibility to the court in
deciding the existence of a fact. They also include all the classification of
evidence such as circumstantial evidence, corroborative evidence,
derivative evidence, direct evidence, documentary evidence, hearsay
evidence,         indirect   evidence,         oral        evidence,     original    evidence,
presumptive evidence, primary evidence, real evidence, secondary
evidence, substantive evidence, testimonial evidence, etc.



73.      In addition, they supplement the evidence in proving the existence
of a fact by enhancing the degree of probability. As an exhaustive
interpretation has to be given to the word "matter", and for that purpose,
the definition of the expression of the words "means and includes",
meant to be applied for evidence, has to be imported to that of a "matter"
as well. Thus, a matter might include such of those which do not fall
within the definition of 
Section 3
, in the absence of any express bar.

 74.       What is important for the court is the conclusion on the basis of
existence of a fact by analyzing the matters before it on the degree of
probability. The entire enactment is meant to facilitate the court to come
to an appropriate conclusion in proving a fact. There are two methods by
which the court is expected to come to such a decision. The court can
come to a conclusion on the existence of a fact by merely considering the
matters before it, in forming an opinion that it does exist. This belief of
the court is based upon the assessment of the matters before it.
Alternatively, the court can consider the said existence as probable from
the perspective of a prudent man who might act on the supposition that it
exists. The question as to the choice of the options is best left to the court
to decide. The said decision might impinge upon the quality of the
matters before it.



75.      The word "prudent" has not been defined under the Act. When the
court wants to consider the second part of the definition clause instead of
believing the existence of a fact by itself, it is expected to take the role of
a prudent man. Such a prudent man has to be understood from the point
of view of a common man. Therefore, a judge has to transform into a
prudent man and assess the existence of a fact after considering the
matters through that lens instead of a judge. It is only after undertaking
the said exercise can he resume his role as a judge to proceed further in
the case.



76.      The aforesaid provision also indicates that the court is concerned
with the existence of a fact both in issue and relevant, as against a whole
                                                                                                      Digitally

 testimony. Thus, the concentration is on the proof of a fact for which a
witness is required. Therefore, a court can appreciate and accept the
testimony of a witness on a particular issue while rejecting it on others
since it focuses on an issue of fact to be proved. However, the evidence
of a witness as whole is a matter for the court to decide on the
probability of proving a fact which is inclusive of the credibility of the
witness. Whether an issue is concluded or not is also a court's domain.



77.     While appreciating the evidence as aforesaid along with the matters
attached to it, evidence can be divided into three categories broadly
namely, (i) wholly reliable, (ii) wholly unreliable and (iii) neither wholly
reliable nor wholly unreliable. If evidence, along with matters
surrounding it, makes the court believe it is wholly reliable qua an issue,
it can decide its existence on a degree of probability. Similar is the case
where evidence is not believable. When evidence produced is neither
wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable, it might require corroboration, and
in such a case, court can also take note of the contradictions available in
other matters. The aforesaid principle of law has been enunciated in the
authority of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in "
Vadivelu Thevar v.
State of Madras
 ", 1957 SCR 981 wherein it is held as under:


              "In view of these considerations, we have no
              hesitation in holding that the contention that in a
              murder case, the court should insist upon plurality

               shall in any case, be required for the proof of any
              fact". The legislature determined, as long ago as
              1872, presumably after due consideration of the
              pros and cons, that it shall not be necessary for
              proof or disproof of a fact to call any particular
              number of witnesses. In England, both before and
              after the passing of the 
Indian Evidence Act, 1872
,
              there have been a number of statutes as set out in
              Sarkar's Law of Evidence -- 9th Edn., at pp. 1100
              and 1101, forbidding convictions on the testimony
              of a single witness. The Indian Legislature has not
              insisted on laying down any such exceptions to the
              general rule recognized in
 s.134
 quoted above. The
              section enshrines the well-recognized maxim that
              "Evidence has to be weighed and not counted". Our
              Legislature has given statutory recognition to the
              fact that administration of justice may be hampered
              if a particular number of witnesses were to be
              insisted upon. It is not seldom that a crime has been
              committed in the presence of only one witness,
              leaving aside those cases which are not of
              uncommon occurrence, where determination of
              guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If
              the Legislature were to insist upon plurality of
              witnesses, cases where the testimony of a single
              witness only could be available in proof of the                                    Digitally

               crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the
              discretion of the presiding judge comes into play.

              The        matter   thus        must           depend       upon            the
              circumstances of each case and the quality of the
              evidence of the single witness whose testimony has
              to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony
              is found by the court to be entirely reliable, there is
              no legal impediment to the conviction of the
              accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of
              an accused person may be proved by the testimony
              of a single witness, the innocence of an accused
              person may be established on the testimony of a
              single witness, even though a considerable number
              of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the
              truth of the case for the prosecution. Hence, in our
              opinion, it is a sound and well-established rule of
              law that the court is concerned with the quality and
              not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for
              proving or disproving a fact. Generally speaking,
              oral testimony in this context may be classified into
              three categories, namely:

              (1) Wholly reliable.

              (2) Wholly unreliable.

              (3) Neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.



              In the first category of proof, the court should have                                               ATUL

               no difficulty in coming to its conclusion either way

              -- it may convict or may acquit on the testimony of
              a single witness, if it is found to be above reproach
              or suspicion of interestedness, incompetence or
              subornation. In the second category, the court,
              equally has no difficulty in coming to its
              conclusion. It is in the third category of cases, that
              the court has to be circumspect and has to look for
              corroboration in material particulars by reliable
              testimony, direct or circumstantial. There is another
              danger in insisting on plurality of witnesses.
              Irrespective of the quality of the oral evidence of a
              single witness, if courts were to insist on plurality of
              witnesses in proof of any fact, they will be
              indirectly encouraging subornation of witnesses.
              Situations may arise and do arise where only a
              single person is available to give evidence in
              support of a disputed fact. The court naturally has to
              weigh carefully such a testimony and if it is
              satisfied that the evidence is reliable and free from
              all taints which tend to render oral testimony open
              to suspicion, it becomes its duty to act upon such
              testimony. The law reports contain many precedents
              where the court had to depend and act upon the
              testimony of a single witness in support of the
              prosecution. There are exceptions to this rule, for
                                                                                                     Digitally

               example, in cases of sexual offences or of the
              testimony of an approver; both these are cases in
              which the oral testimony is, by its very nature,
              suspect, being that of a participator in crime. But,
              where there are no such exceptional reasons
              operating, it becomes the duty of the court to
              convict, if it is satisfied that the testimony of a
              single witness is entirely reliable. We have,
              therefore, no reasons to refuse to act upon the
              testimony of the first witness, which is the only
              reliable evidence in support of the prosecution."



Appreciation of Evidence:

the offences punishable
 u/s 498A

 IPC, 1860, for having
committed the dowry death of the deceased Nisha and for committing
cruelty upon her before her death.



79.      In the present case, the date of marriage between the deceased and
her husband accused Sandeep is not disputed and the accused persons
have duly admitted the marriage invitation card dated 19.04.2012
alongwith the list of dowry articles in their statements recorded
 u/s 294

Cr.PC and the same were exhibited as Ex. PX-6 (colly). Therefore, it is
established by the prosecution that the deceased Nisha got married to
accused Sandeep on 19.04.2012. Furthermore, it is also not disputed that                                Digitally

 the deceased Nisha expired on 30.11.2014, as proved by the prosecution
through the postmortem report Ex. PX-2, which is also one of the
admitted documents, being duly admitted by the accused persons
 u/s 294

Cr.PC on 01.02.2024. Therefore, it is established beyond reasonable
doubt that the death of the deceased Nisha took place within 7 years of
her marriage.



80.       So as to attract the presumption of law enshrined under 
section
113-B
 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, from the statements of the
uncles of the deceased namely Pramod Kumar and Satender, Ex. PW2/A
and Ex. PW6/A, recorded before the concerned SDM/Executive
Magistrate were enough and the prosecution had to discharge the initial
burden of proof after establishing the essential ingredients mentioned in

Section 113-B
 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which the prosecution
has been able to meet in the present case.



81.      The death of the deceased Nisha was duly proved by the
prosecution through the MLC Ex. PW30/A, wherein, she was brought to
the main casualty, GTB Hospital in unconscious and unresponsive state
with alleged history of hanging. Upon local examination, bruises marks
were found at anterior aspect of her neck. The postmortem report no.
1635/2014 is an admitted document and same was exhibited as Ex. PX-

concerned doctor found extravasation of blood in soft tissue of neck,
bruising of muscles, epiglottis was found to be congested and
osteocartilaginous structure of the neck was found to be intact. As per the                           Digitally

 opinion of the concerned doctor, the cause of death was "Asphyxia as as
result of ante-mortem hanging".



82.      It is also not disputed in the present case that the deceased had
hanged herself by trying an end of the chunni around her neck and the
other end of the chunni around the ceiling fan of the room situated on the
ground floor of the matrimonial house of the deceased. It is not the case
of the prosecution that the deceased was killed by the accused persons or
that she was hanged after she had been already killed. There are no
allegations of the offence punishable
 u/s 302
 IPC, 1860 against the
accused persons. The fact that the deceased committed suicide by
hanging, has not been disputed by the accused persons. Therefore, the
prosecution has been able to fully establish that the deceased Nisha had
died otherwise then in normal circumstances, since committing suicide is
not the end of the human life under normal circumstances. Furthermore,
since the date of marriage is also not disputed by the accused persons
and they had admitted the marriage invitation card Ex. PX (colly), in
which the date of the marriage is duly mentioned as 19.04.2012.

Therefore, the death of the deceased Nisha, which has been established
through the PM report Ex. PX2 took place on 30.11.2014, therefore, it is
established beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died within 7
years of her marriage and her death had occurred otherwise than under
normal circumstances. Therefore, the only thing that needs to be now
appreciated from the evidence brought on record, is that whether the
prosecution is able to establish that soon before her death, deceased
Nisha was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband or any                                   Digitally

 relative of her husband for or in connection with any demands of dowry?



83.      The prosecution is relying heavily on the testimony of star
witnesses i.e. PW2 Pramod Kumar, PW6 Satender, PW9 Devendra
Kumar and PW12 Sonu Kumar, to establish that soon before her death,
the deceased Nisha was subjected to cruelty and harassment in
connection with dowry demands.

complainant of the present case that he had taken the deceased in
adoption and ever since her childhood, deceased Nisha stayed with him
and he had taken care of the deceased and finally got her married to
accused Sandeep on 19.04.2012. There are specific allegations leveled
by him in his complaint Ex. PW2/A, recorded before the concerned
SDM. The concerned SDM had also recorded the statement of the
brother of PW2 Pramod Kumar, namely PW6 Satender and in his
statement Ex. PW6/A, PW6 Satender had also leveled similar allegations
against the accused persons.



85.      It has come through the testimony of PW6 Satender that "On
29.11.2014 at about 9.00-9.30 PM, I received a phone call from accused
Sandeep and he made Nisha talk to me over the phone. On phone Nisha
told me that accused persons i.e. Sandeep, his father, his mother, brother
Mahesh, nanads namely Rekha and Alka were present at her matrimonial
house and they were giving beatings to her on the issue of dowry

aaker baithker baat kerte hai". Thereafter, I again received a phone call
from Sandeep's mobile phone and Nisha was on the phone. Nisha told
me that aforesaid accused persons were giving beatings to her and are
saying to go to your parental house and bring the cash. On this, I told her
that we will come at her matrimonial house on the next day."



87.      It has further come in the testimony of PW6 Satender that "On the
same night, I made a call to mediator namely Chaman Singh and told all
the facts to him. On this he got annoyed and started scolding me while
saying 'yeh tumhara aapas ka mamla hai aur ise aap hi niptaao' on
29.11.2014 I told all the facts regarding receiving phone of Sandeep and
on this my brother also made a call to Sandeep from his mobile phone
and my brother told him that due late hours we are unable to come at
your house. However, we would come in the next morning. My brother
further told him that we are not having sufficient money/cash to fulfil
your demand for the business of Sandeep. On 30.11.2014 I received a
phone call from Chaman (Mediator) and he told me 'tumhe Sandeep ke
business ke liye paisa dena hi padega anyatha achha nahi hoga'."

 91.      The testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender qua the
calls received by them and the fact that the deceased had informed them
about the beatings received by her, one day prior to her death and the
said harassment was with respect to dowry demands, was corroborated
through the testimony of other prosecution witnesses i.e. PW9 Devendra
Kumar, who is the father of the deceased.



92.      The testimony of PW2 and PW6 has to be appreciated in the
background of the testimony of other prosecution witnesses, wherein,
they had leveled specific allegations against the accused Sandeep making
dowry demands from the family members of the deceased.



93.      It has come in the testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar, PW6
Satender and PW9 Devendra Kumar that one month after the deceased
gave birth to a child, accused Sandeep left her back at the house of her
chacha PW2 Pramod Kumar and did not return back for a long time. He
raised a demand of Rs. 2 lacs from PW2 Pramod Kumar as a condition
precedent for taking his wife and child back to his house. PW2 Pramod

 Pramod Kumar and other prosecution witnesses such as PW6 Satender
and PW9 Devendra Kumar on the aspect of dowry demands being raised
upon the deceased and that she was subjected to harassment and cruelty
as the deceased had told him personally about the same. It has
categorically come in his testimony that "I used to talk with Nisha
whenever she used to visit the house of Pramod there at Budheda. She
used to complain against her husband and her in-laws regarding demand
of dowry." His testimony is not merely hear-say, as argued by the Ld.
Counsel for the accused persons.



95.      It is being argued on behalf of the State that the phone calls made
between accused Sandeep and PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender
on 29.11.2014, wherein, the deceased had informed her uncles about the
beatings received by her at the hands of the accused persons on the
account of dowry demands, constitute dying declaration. Careful perusal
of the testimony brought on record by the prosecution, clearly reflects
that the deceased had allegedly disclosed to her uncles PW2 Pramod
Kumar and PW6 Satender that she was beaten up by the accused persons
and from the said statement, it cannot be held that the deceased had
given her mind as to the said beatings had driven her to such an extent
that she was going to commit suicide on the very next day. There is no
circumstance surrounding her death, that is disclosed in the said alleged
statement, therefore, the same cannot be held to be a dying declaration.



96.      As far as the allegations against accused Sandeep is concerned,

 prosecution has been able to establish that he had subjected the deceased
to harassment, soon before her death and that the demands of dowry
were being raised. The said allegations were duly corroborated by the
CDR and CAF of the mobile phones being used by accused Sandeep,
PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender.



97.      However, as far as the other accused persons are concerned, the
allegations are cryptic and vague in nature and it does not inspire any
confidence. The initial burden of proof lied on the prosecution and the
burden would not shift on the accused persons, merely on the fact that
unnatural death had occurred within 7 years of marriage, without even
proving the dowry demand prior to the incident. However, in the present
case, the prosecution has been able to discharge its initial burden of
proving the demand of dowry prior to the incident. There is only one
specific allegation against accused Vikram Devi @ Krishana that around
7-8 days prior to the marriage between her son accused Sandeep and the
deceased, she had raised a demand of a car on PW2 Pramod Kumar.
Thereafter, all the allegations against her are cryptic in nature and no
specific allegations with any date, time etc., were leveled against her.



98.      Similarly, as far as accused Jagat Singh is concerned there are only
general and cryptic allegations that he had raised the dowry demands
along with other co-accused persons and that he had also given beatings
to the deceased on 29.11.2014. Furthermore, there are also general and
cryptic allegations of him being involved in committing harassment and
torture of the deceased, prior to her death. It has come in the testimony                             Digitally
                                                                                                      signed by

 of PW-6 Satender that after he had received a phone call from accused
Sandeep and when he was made to speak to his niece Nisha, he had
given a call on the mobile phone of accused Jagat Singh and requested
him not to torture his niece. Further, making a phone call to the father-in-
law of the deceased is quite normal in ordinary circumstances, as it
might have been made to get his son Sandeep reprimanded, in the hope
that he changes his behaviour towards his wife Nisha and merely making
a phone call does not suggest involvement of accused Jagat Singh,
especially when except the testimony of PW6 Satender qua making the
said phone call, there is no material evidence brought on record to show
his involvement.



99.      Furthermore, the said fact was not corroborated in the testimony of
the complainant PW-2 Pramod Kumar or PW9 Devendra Kumar. The
factum of the said call was also not stated by complainant in his
statement Ex. PW2/A before the concerned SDM. Furthermore,
regarding the said call made by PW-6 Satender to the accused Jagat
Singh was an improvement from his earlier statement Ex. PW6/A
recorded before the concerned SDM. Furthermore, the prosecution did
not bring on record any CAF/CDR of the mobile phone of the accused
Jagat Singh, to prove that the said call was made to him by PW-6
Satender.



100. Similarly, the allegations leveled against accused Alka and Rekha
are also vague and cryptic in nature and the same also does not inspire
any confidence. It is not disputed that both of them were married and                                 Digitally

 living separately at their respective matrimonial houses. The only
explanation given by the prosecution regarding their involvement is that
their respective matrimonial houses were situated near the matrimonial
house of the deceased and that both of them were having a lot of say in
the matrimonial life of their brother accused Sandeep and deceased
Nisha. There are general allegations of accused Alka and Rekha raising
dowry demands upon the deceased, along with their other family
members.



101. As per the testimony of the PW-2 Pramod Kumar and PW-6
Satender Kumar, they were both allegedly informed by the deceased on
29.11.2014, that both accused Alka and Rekha were present in her
matrimonial home and they along-with their other family members gave
beatings to the deceased. However, it is also the case of the prosecution
that PW-12 Sonu Kumar had visited the house of the accused persons on
29.11.2014 to deliver a marriage invitation card and when he met the
deceased, he was informed that some quarrel had taken place and her
husband and her in laws were harassing her on account of demand of
dowry. During his cross examination conducted by Ld. Defense counsel
on 07.07.2018, PW-12 Sonu Kumar had categorically admitted that on
that day when he visited the matrimonial house of the deceased, he met
accused         Sandeep, Vikram Devi, Mahesh and Jagat. There was no
mention of accused Rekha and Alka being present there and except for
the testimony of PW-2 and PW-6, their presence in the matrimonial
house of the deceased on 29.11.2014 could not be proved. There are
inherent contradictions in the statements of the prosecution witnesses                                Digitally
                                                                                                      signed by

 and accordingly the statement of PW2 and PW6 cannot be believed as
far as the involvement of the accused Rekha and Alka giving beatings to
the deceased Nisha on 29.11.2014 or they have tortured the deceased on
the demands of dowry.



102. It is not disputed that certain dowry articles were exchanged at the
time of the marriage of the deceased, since the accused persons had
categorically admitted the list of dowry articles Ex. PX-6 (colly), along-

with the original marriage card, vide their statements recorded
 u/s 294

Cr.P.C on 01.02.2024. The allegations against accused Vikram Devi @
Krishana of raising a demand of a car, prior to 7-8 days of the marriage
is sought to be proved by the prosecution. All the material public
witnesses, including PW-2 Pramod Kumar, PW-6 Satender and PW-9
Devendra Kumar have categorically deposed qua the same. The receipt
of the Alto car is not disputed by the accused persons. However, there
are no charges framed
 u/s 3
 and 
4
 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
against the accused persons and they are not facing trial for raising the
said dowry demands. Except for the said demand of a car, the
prosecution could not bring on record any other cogent evidence to show
the involvement of the accused Vikram Devi @ Krishana in raising
further demands of dowry and committing torture/harassment of the
deceased in relation with the said dowry demands.



103. It is trite law as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
in catena of judgments that

 burning and dowry demand. The prosecution must at first establish the
existence of the necessary ingredients constituting an offence punishable

u/s 304-B
 IPC. Once these ingredients are satisfied, the rebuttable
presumption of causality, provided
 u/s 113-B
 of Indian Evidence Act,
1872 operates against the accused persons.



104. As discussed above, the phrase "soon before" as appearing in

section 304-B
 IPC cannot be construed to mean " immediately before".
The prosecution must establish existence of "proximate and live link"

between the dowry death and cruelty or harassment for dowry demand
by her husband or relatives of the husband.



105. 
Section 304-B
 IPC does not provide a pigeon hole of an offence in
categorizing the death as homicidal or suicidal or accidental. The death
of the deceased could fall under any of the three scenarios yet it could
amount to occur "otherwise than under normal circumstances".



106. Conjoint reading of 
section 304-B
 IPC and 
section 113-B
 Indian
Evidence Act, thus predicate the burden of the prosecution to
unassailably substantiate the ingredients of the two sections, by direct
and convincing evidence, so as to avail the presumption engrafted under
the law against the accused persons. Proof of cruelty or harassment by
the husband or his relatives charged is thus the sine qua non to invoke
the spirit of the said statutory presumption. If the prosecution fails to
demonstrate with cogent, coherent and persuasive evidence to prove the
same, the accused person cannot be held guilty of taking refuge only                                   Digitally

 upon the presumption to cover up the short fall in its efforts to prove the
case of the prosecution.



107. The presumption of law as laid down in 
section 113-B
 of Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 was upon the wisdom of the legislature of relieving
the prosecution of the rigor of proof, of often practically inaccessible
evidence, which was guarded within the closed confines of the
matrimonial home. However, in absence of cogent evidence spelling out
the ingredients of the offence, especially the most essential ingredient of
harassment/cruelty soon before the death, against any of the accused
persons, does not shift the burden to meet the reverse onus upon them.



108. In the facts of the present case, it seems that accused Jagat Singh,
Vikram Devi @ Krishana, Mahesh Chand, Alka and Rekha have been
roped in only because of their close relationship with accused Sandeep
(husband of the deceased). Accused Mahesh Chand is the elder brother
of accused Sandeep and he was already married and living separately
with his family. As far as accused Alka and Rekha are concerned, they
were the nanads of the deceased and they were also married and living
separately in their respective matrimonial houses. They also had no say
or only a little say, as far as the matrimonial dispute between their
brother accused Sandeep and deceased was concerned, wherein, the
deceased was being tortured by her husband accused Sandeep.
Therefore, the prosecution could not establish through cogent and
coherent evidence of accused Jagat Singh, Vikram Devi @ Krishana,
Mahesh         Chand, Alka     and        Rekha         of   having        committed         the            Digitally

 cruelty/harassment upon the deceased Nisha, soon before her death.
Therefore, no reverse onus could be introduced against them to refute the
case of the prosecution and to prove their innocence.



109. However, through the clear and unimpeachable evidence of dowry
demands raised by the accused Sandeep, six month after the birth of his
son and him being given Rs. 2 lacs by PW-2 Pramod Kumar as a
condition precedent of him taking his wife and child back home, coupled
with the categorical testimonies of PW-2 Pramod Kumar and PW-6
Satender, when appreciated with the testimony of PW-12 Sonu Kumar
and further corroborated by the CDR of accused Sandeep, PW-2 Pramod
Kumar and PW-6 Satender, in the considered opinion of this Court, the
prosecution has been able to discharge this burden that soon before her
death, accused Sandeep had committed cruelty/harassment upon the
deceased Nisha on the demands of dowry. Hence, all the essential
ingredients of the offence punishable
 u/s 304-B
 IPC are established by
the prosecution. Therefore, reverse onus is casted upon accused Sandeep,
to refute the case of the prosecution and prove his innocence.



110. It is trite law that the accused person can take two contradictory
defenses and the same is not a taboo under the law. In the present case,
the accused Sandeep has taken different defenses and the same shall be
appreciated here, to see whether he is able to refute the presumption of
law raised against him.



111. The first defense taken up by accused Sandeep is that the deceased                                Digitally
                                                                                                       signed by

                                                                                                       2024.09.20

 Nisha was a short tempered girl and that she used to insist to go to a
beauty parlour, however, when she was refused/not allowed to go to the
said beauty parlour, she committed suicide on 30.11.2014. The said
defense of the accused Sandeep, does not inspire any confidence in the
mind of this Court, since nothing material was brought on record by the
accused person to substantiate his defense. Furthermore, there is not
even an iota of evidence brought on record, wherein, the desire of the
deceased to visit a beauty parlor could be established. Furthermore, it is
difficult to fathom that a young woman, who had an infant son, would
take her own life, just because she was not allowed to visit a beauty
parlor. The said defense is so improbable that no reasonable prudent
person would believe the same. Furthermore, the defense could not
establish that the deceased was a short tempered girl. Lastly, the said
defense was in the form of suggestions given to PW2 Pramod Kumar,
who is the complainant of the present case and the said defense was not
given as suggestions to the other material prosecution witnesses.



112. The second line of defense adopted by the accused persons was
that the deceased was below 18 years of age at the time of her marriage
and her marriage was solemnized against her wishes. Therefore, she was
not happy with her marriage and subsequently committed suicide. It is
true that through the testimony of DW2 Kanwar Pal Singh, it was
brought on record that the date of birth of the deceased was 01.07.1996.
Her marriage admittedly took place on 19.04.2012, therefore, the defense
was able to establish that the deceased was a minor at the time of her
marriage. However, merely because her age is proved, does not ipso                                     Digitally

 facto establish that her consent was not there and she was married by her
family members against her wishes. The marriage of a minor Hindu girl
is a valid marriage in the eyes of law. The said marriage is merely
punishable under the law, however, the marriage itself was not a nullity.
The said marriage is neither void nor voidable under the provisions of
the 
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
. The said marriage could have been
voidable at the instance of the contracting party, who was a child at the
time of the marriage i.e. the deceased Nisha, as per 
section 3
 of the
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Furthermore, the marriage was
duly consummated and the deceased was blessed with a baby boy. There
is not even a shred of evidence to show that the deceased was married
against her wishes or that she was unhappy with her marriage with
accused Sandeep and that due to the said discontent, she went to the
extent of ending her life prematurely. Therefore, the said defense of the
accused persons is also liable to be rejected, as it does not inspire any
confidence.



113. There is no merit in the arguments raised by the Ld. Defense
counsel regarding the credibility of the star prosecution witnesses. The
minor contradictions and improvements are not of such nature so as to
strike at the very root of the case of the prosecution. The minor
contradictions such as the discrepancy in the date of the marriage of the
deceased with accused Sandeep is immaterial, since the date of marriage
is not disputed in the present case and same was admitted by the accused
persons in their statements recorded
 u/s 294
 Cr.PC. The contradictions

 educational qualifications and the schools that were attended by her is
also of no consequence to the facts of the present case, since the same
was not the moot point of adjudication. It made little or no difference
that the deceased was adopted by her chacha PW2 Pramod or not.
Furthermore, it was immaterial whether she stayed in her village or in
Delhi prior to her marriage. The moot question in the present case was
whether the deceased was married to accused Sandeep and whether she
died otherwise than in normal circumstances, within 7 years of her
marriage. Furthermore, the last material question to be ascertained was
that whether she was subjected to cruelty/harassment in connection with
the demands of dowry, soon before her death. Rest everything, relating
to her life prior to her marriage was not relevant for the purpose of the
inquiry in the present case.



114. The other improvements/contradictions such as the date of the
phone call received by PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender was also
not material, since "soon before" could be satisfied by either 28.11.2014
or 29.11.2014. The fact that said phone calls were received on
29.11.2014 and the same was proved by the prosecution through the
corroborative evidence such as CDR and CAF of the mobile phones, had
duly established that the said phone calls were received by the family
members of the deceased, soon before her death. Therefore, the
testimony of PW2 and PW6 was substantially corroborated by the
material relevant evidence brought on record by the prosecution and
merely because in their statements before the SDM, both PW2 and PW6
had stated that the said calls were received on 28.11.2014 and not on                                  Digitally

 29.11.2014, does not have any bearing on their credibility and the
outcome of the present case.



115. The death of the deceased took place within the closed confines of
the room in her matrimonial house. The accused Sandeep was expected
to come out with an explanation as to how the deceased had died. The
said explanation is warranted in view of 
section 106
 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872 R/w 
section 313
 of Cr.PC. In his statement
 u/s 313

Cr.PC, there are general and evasive replies to the incriminating
evidence brought on record against him in the present case. He had
simplicitor denied all the questions being put him and he had merely
stated that since all the witnesses were interested witnesses, they had
falsely deposed against him. The explanation offered by him, as far as
pertaining to the suicide committed by the deceased is not tenable.

Therefore, in the view of this Court, in light of the statutory presumption

u/s 113-B
 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 R/w 
section 106
 and 
section
114(h)
 of the Indian Evidence Act, further adverse inference is drawn
against him. The accused Sandeep has failed to discharge the burden of
the reverse onus clause.



Conclusion & Findings:



116. As per the celebrated judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in "Sharad Birdichand Sarda Vs. State of Maharastra" AIR 1984
SC 1622, the five golden rules of circumstantial evidence were
elucidated, wherein, it was held that the onus remains on the prosecution
to prove the complete chain of events which shall undoubtedly come                                     Digitally

 towards the guilt of the accused persons and it shall rule out any other
hypothesis that may point in the favour of the accused. Each and every
incriminating circumstance must be clearly established by reliable and
clinching evidence and circumstances so proved must form a chain of
events from which the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt of
accused should be safely drawn and no other hypothesis in favour of the
accused persons must be there. 
Reliance is placed upon the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in "
Wakkar Vs. State of UP
 " (2011)
3 SCC 306 and "Sahadeven Vs. State of Tamil Nadu " AIR 2012 SC
2435.




117. In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is that
the circumstantial from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be
fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature.

Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be
no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further, the proved circumstances
must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused
and totally inconsistent with his innocence, as held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India in "Hanuman Govind Nargundkar Vs. State of
MP" AIR 1952 SC 343, "Bodh Raj Vs. State of J&K" 
AIR 2002 SC
3164 and "Sharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs. State of Maharashtra
" AIR
1984 SC 1622 and "C. Chenga Reddy and Ors. Vs. State of A.P." (1996)
10 SCC 193.

 defense and he is presumed to be innocent till he is proved to be guilty.
Suspicion, however, strong can never take place of proof. There is
indeed a long distance between accused "May have committed the
offence" and "Must have committed the offence", which must be
traversed by the prosecution by adducing reliable evidence. 
Emphasis is
supplied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
"
Kailash Gaur Vs. State of Assam
" (
2012) 2 SCC 34 and "Padala Veera
Reddy Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh
" AIR 1990 SC 79. In the present
case, the prosecution has been able to travel the long distance from
"may" to "must" by leading reliable evidence qua accused Sandeep
through the testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar, PW6 Satender, PW9
Devendra Kumar, PW10 Rajesh Kumar, PW12 Sonu Kumar, PW13
Mannu and PW21 Ajeet Singh. Their testimonies were fully supported
and corroborated by the medical evidence i.e. the postmortem report Ex.
PX-2 and the subsequent opinion Ex. PX-3.




119. There is another golden thread which runs through the web of
administration of justice in criminal cases, is that if two views are
possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of
the accused and other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to
the accused should be adopted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
India in "Kali Ram Vs. State of Himanchal Pradesh" AIR 1973 SC
2773. In the facts of the present case, the prosecution was able to prove
all the material links of the chain of circumstantial evidence and the said
chain pointed towards the guilt of accused Sandeep and no other
hypothesis inconsistent with his guilt could be brought on record.                                     Digitally

 However, in the facts of the present case, in light of the discussions
above, the prosecution could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused Vikram Devi @ Krishana, Mahesh Chand, Jagat Singh, Rekha
and Alka have committed the offences, under which charges were
framed against them. The evidence brought against them is too scant and
cryptic in nature, so as to satisfy the material links of the chain of the
prosecution case, so as to conclude that no other hypothesis against their
guilt was possible. Therefore, benefit of doubt must be granted to them.



120. In view of the aforesaid, the accused Sandeep S/o Jagat Singh is
hereby held guilty and convicted for committing the offence punishable
under 
section 304-B
 of the Indian Penal Code,1860 and for committing
the offence punishable under 
section 498-A
 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860. He is taken into custody. His previous bail bonds/surety bonds
stands canceled.



121. In view of the aforesaid, the accused Mahesh Chand S/o Jagat
Singh, Jagat Singh S/o Late Sh. Pyare Lal, Vikram Devi @ Krishana
W/o Jagat Singh, Alka W/o Anuj Chokar and Rekha W/o Chawan Singh
are acquitted for committing the offence punishable under 
section 304-B

of the Indian Penal Code,1860 and for committing the offence
punishable under 
section 498-A
 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they
shall be set at liberty.
