 BAIL APPL. NO.9155 OF 2023

                                       2



                                    ORDER



                    This is an application for anticipatory bail.


             2.     Petitioner are the accused in Crime No.671/2023

       of Keezhvaipur Police Station, Pathanamthitta alleging

       commission of offence under 
Section 323
, 
324
, 
294(b)
,

       
506
 and 
498A
 of the Indian Penal Code.


             3.     The petitioner got married to the de facto

       complainant       on     15.01.2021.    Allegation     against   the

       petitioner is that after the marriage, he subjected the

       de facto complainant with physical and mental cruelty, by

       stating that she was not good looking, alleging that she

       was an aged person and by assaulting her.


             4.     Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner

       would submit that the petitioner is absolutely innocent in

       the matter and the allegations have been raised only to

       settle     the   other    matrimonial   disputes      between    the

       petitioner and the de facto complainant.             It is submitted
 BAIL APPL. NO.9155 OF 2023


                                    3




       that even if the above allegations are accepted as true,

       the offence under 
Section 498A
 IPC is not made out.


             5.    I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor also.


             6.    Having regard to the facts and circumstances of

       the case and taking into account the nature of the

       allegations against the petitioner and also taking note of

       the fact that custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not

       necessary for the purpose of any investigation, I am of the

       opinion that anticipatory bail can be granted to the

       petitioner subject to strict conditions.


             In the result, this bail application is allowed.    It is

       directed that the petitioner shall be released on      bail, in

       the event of arrest in crime No.671/2023 of Keezhvaipur

       police Station subject to the following conditions:-


             (i) Petitioner shall execute separate bonds for sums

       of    Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with two

       solvent sureties each for the like-sum to the satisfaction of

       the jurisdictional Court;

             (ii) Petitioner shall appear before the investigating

       officer in Crime No.671/2023 of Keezhvaipur Police station

       as and when summoned to do so;



             (iii) The petitioner shall not attempt to contact the de

       facto complainant or interfere with the investigation or to

       influence or intimidate any witness in Crime No.671/2023

       of Keezhvaipur police station;



             (iv) The petitioner shall not involve in any other

       crime while on bail.



             If any of the aforesaid conditions are violated, the

       investigating officer in Crime No.671/2023 of Keezhvaipur

       police    station     may   file       an   application   before   the
