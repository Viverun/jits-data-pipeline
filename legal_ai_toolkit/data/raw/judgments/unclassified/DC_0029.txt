drinks before moving out of the mall. He went to a grocery store in

the mall itself and picked up two drinks and he paid for the drinks at

the counter. Thereafter, they left for the parking lot and left the mall

in car. Once, outside the mall, she suggested that she knows a place

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State               3/29
 outside the mall where they could talk. He took the car to the parking

lot behind the mall, where she asked him to park the car in front of a

pan shop. She asked him to get her a bottle of water from the pan

shop. He went out of the car and purchased one water bottle and

came back to the car. When he came back to the car, she had already

opened the coffee drink for him and offered the same to him. He sat

in the car and drank the coffee and within seconds, he lost his

consciousness.          He was spotted next day morning by his family

members and police. He found out that his purse, lap-top, car stereo

and other belongings were missing. He was taken to the hospital. On

been recovered. He went to Patiala House Courts and identified his

lap-top, car stereo, mobile phone etc. On 10.10.2008, he went to

police that accused Eva had refused to get herself identified. He took

the recovered goods on superdari from the court. He produced the

case property in court, namely, mobile phone, lap-top bag, lap-top,

watch, car stereo mouth, pan drive. In his cross-examination, he

grocery shop of the mall. After 10 minutes' driving, they reached the

spot from where he purchased drinking water. The distance between

the shop from where he purchased the water bottle and the place

where he parked the car, was about 10 feet. It took about 3-4 minutes

in purchasing the water bottle and coming back to the car. He denied

the suggestion that taking advantage of the darkness, he tried to

molest the accused and tried to be physical with her and she left the

spot saying that she is going to the PS to report against him. He also

denied the suggestion that because of the fear on being involved in

the said case, he falsely implicated the accused in this case. He

5.       All the incriminating circumstances were put to the accused

but she denied the same. She stated that she was already in custody

in FIR No. 541/08 of P.S. Dwarka and the present case was falsely,

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State   14/29
 imputed against her by the police and the recoveries were planted.

She stated that she does not know any Amit Saxena or Shah Nawaj at

all. She stated that she does not know as to what was happening

around her at that time. She was pregnant and was a diabetes patient

and, therefore, she refused to take part in TIP. She did not make any

disclosure statement but was made to sign on blank papers. She also

stated that police had arrested Anthony William Messy - her

colleague and brought him to her house in custody in early hours on

22/23.09.2008 and thereafter she was falsely implicated in the present

case. Initially, she stated that she does not wish to lead any defence

defence but subsequently, an application under 
Section 315
 Cr.P.C

was filed by her to herself step in the witness box and in the interest

of justice, the said application was allowed and the accused herself

deposed as DW-1. She stated that on 24.09.2008, she was in custody

regarding a case of P.S. Dwarka.                    She does not know anything

regarding Amit Saxena. She was told about this case when she was

in judicial custody.          She stated that she is a patient of diabetes and

there was no occasion for her to give any cold drink to him, which

contained intoxicants. She placed on record a medical certificate in


S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08    Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State          15/29
 this regard as Ex. DW1/A. She stated that she was also arrested in

another FIR No. 314/08 under 
Section 328
/
379
/
411
 IPC of P.S.

Defence Colony, in which she was acquitted on 25.07.2011 and a

certified copy of that judgment was proved as Ex. DW1/B. She

stated that she was convicted in FIR No. 541/08
 u/s 302
/
328
/
34
 IPC.

She stated that she is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this

case.      In her cross-examination by the Ld. Addl. PP, she could not

tell as to why and how she was identified in court by Ami Saxena and

Shah Nawaj. She admitted that she was arrested on 24.09.2008 by

officials of P.S. Dwarka from her house. She could not tell as to why

she was involved in cases of similar type of offences.



6.       Ld. Addl. PP argued that the prosecution has been able to prove

its case beyond all reasonable doubts. It is stated that the victim/

informant Amit Kumar Saxena has identified the accused in the court

and has supported the prosecution case.                           The poisoning of the

informant was duly proved by PW-4 Dr. Anil Mota. The stolen

articles were recovered from the house of the accused when she was

arrested on 24.09.2008 in FIR No. 541/08 of P.S. Dwarka. The

informant/victim has identified the stolen articles in judicial TIP. The

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State                   16/29
 accused had refused to take part in judicial TIP. The accused had also

stolen the mobile phone and purse of another victim PW-16 Shah

Nawaj, who has also identified the accused in the court. On these

grounds, the conviction under 
Section 328
 and 
379
 IPC has been

prayed by the prosecution.





7.       Ld. Counsel for the accused has filed written arguments

without addressing any oral arguments.                    It has been stated that the

prosecution case of giving intoxicating substance by the accused to

the victim is highly improbable as both of them were strangers and

nobody would accept that a stranger would give cold drink.                     It has

been stated that the alleged incident took place on a busy road and it

is not possible that the same would not be witnessed by anybody. It

has been stated that no receipt for purchase of mobile phone and

other articles was with the complainant. There is a delay of six days

in registration of case. Even the original discharge summary of the

complainant from Max Balaji Hospital was not filed, which creates

doubt regarding his discharge. It is stated that the articles were

recovered by the IO of P.S. Dwarka but they were not sealed. There

are no signatures of the complainant on the site plan which creates

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State                 17/29
 doubt about its preparation or his visit to the spot alongwith the IO.

It has been stated that the prosecution has failed to prove its case

beyond doubts and the benefit of doubt be given to the accused and

she be acquitted.





8.       I have heard both the sides and have perused the records of the

case. Accused has faced trial for the offences
 u/s 328
/
379
/
411
 IPC

read with 
section 120-B
 IPC. 
Section 328
 IPC deals with the offence

of causing hurt by means of poison etc. with intent to commit an

offence. The section inter-alia prescribes punishment for the person

who administers any intoxicating drug or other thing with intent to

cause hurt to a person. In order to prove the offence
 u/s 328
 IPC

prosecution is obliged to prove that accused administered poison with

the intention or knowledge that it is likely to cause hurt.



9.       The offence of theft is defined under 
section 378
 IPC as

whoever intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of

possession of any person without consent of that person, in order to

take such property, is said to commit theft. Hence, in order to prove

the offence of theft the article moved should be movable property; it


S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State    18/29
 should have been moved out of the possession of the person without

his consent; and that the accused should have done it with dishonest

intention.





10.      Except for the victim himself, there is no other eye witness of

this case. PW-1 Amit Kumar Saxena is the victim, who deposed to

have met the accused on 18.09.2008 between 6:00-7:00 p.m at Saket

Mall and at the suggestion of the accused, they went to a grocery

shop in the mall, from where the accused picked up two drinks and

he paid for the same. Then, they came out of the mall and the

accused suggested that she knows a place outside the mall where they

could talk. He took the car behind the mall where she asked him to

park the car in front of a pan shop and asked him to get her a bottle of

water from the pan shop. When he came back with the water bottle,

she had already opened the coffee drink and offered it to him. He sat

in the car, drank the coffee and within seconds, he lost his

consciousness. Next morning, he found his purse, lap-top, car stereo

and other belongings to be missing and he was taken to hospital. He

identified the accused in the court. He also stated to have identified

his lap-top, car stereo, one credit card, DL and mobile phone on

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State    19/29
 04.10.2008 in TIP at Patiala House Courts. He stated that he also

went to Tihar Jail on 10.10.2008 for the purpose of identification of

accused but he was told that she does not want to take part in the

identification proceedings.





11.      PW-4 Dr. Anil Mota proved the discharge summary of the

victim as Ex.PW4/A, according to which, he was admitted on

19.09.2008 and was discharged on 21.09.2008 and he was diagnosed

for 'unknown poisoning'.





12.      Accused Eva was arrested on 24.9.2008 by PW 15 Inspector

Sudhir Singh and she got recovered laptop, mobile, wrist watch, car

stereo mouth, ID cards etc. from her house. These articles were

identified by the victim in TIP carried out by PW-13 Sh. Sameer

Bajpai, Ld. MM.              PW-5 Ct. Sheela and PW-8 HC Ramesh Chand

also deposed about recoveries and arrest of the accused on 24.9.2008.



13.      Apart from the victim of this case, yet another victim namely

PW-16 Shahnawaj also deposed regarding his experience with the

accused when he was given some substance in tea whereafter he

became unconscious and lost his mobile phone and purse. He also

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State   20/29
 identified the accused in the court as the girl who had given him the

tea, and after drinking the tea he had become unconscious.



14.      PW-17 SI Praveen Kumar proved disclosure statements and

seizure memos of FIR No. 541/08
 u/s 302
/
328
/
341
 IPC PS Dwarka in

which she was arrested. In her disclosure she had stated that she used

to have Ativan 2 mg tablets which had intoxicating effect. She also

disclosed to have administered intoxicating tablets to one Amit in the

month of August and thereafter to have robbed him of his mobile

phones, car stereo mouth etc. and thereafter to have left him in car

near AIIMS area. In one of the seizure memos, 20 pills of Ativan 2

mg were recovered from the handbag of the accused.



15.      There is yet another circumstance which is against the accused.

Suggestions were given to the victim that taking advantage of the

darkness, he tried to molest the accused and she left the spot for

going to police station and out of fear, he implicated her in a false

case. The victim denied this suggestion. Another suggestion was put

to him that he had himself taken stupefying pills to stress out and

made false complaint to police. However, the victim denied this


S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State    21/29
 suggestion as well.





16.      In the statement of the accused recorded u/s 313 Cr PC, no

such thing was stated by the accused. Nor she stated such a thing

when she herself entered the witness box. All this show that the

hollowness of defence of the accused and thus strengthens the

prosecution case.





17.      She admitted as DW-1 that she was earlier convicted in FIR

No. 541/08
 u/s 302
/
328
/
34
 IPC of PS Dwarka but was acquitted in

another FIR No. 314/08
 u/s 328
/
379
/
411
 IPC of PS Defence Colony.

In her cross examination she could not give any reply as to why she

was involved in similar type of offences nor she could give any reply

as to why she was identified by Amit Saxena and Shahnawaj.



18.      The accused did not take part in TIP.                    No reasonable

explanation was offered by her for not participating in TIP. She only

stated that she did not know what was happening around her at that

time. She was pregnant and was a patient of diabetes and therefore

she refused to take part in TIP. However, this stand is contrary to the

stand taken by her earlier at the time of TIP. At that time, she refused

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State            22/29
 to take part in TIP on the ground that she had already been shown to

the witness. In view of the contradictory stands taken by the accused

for not taking part in the judicial TIP, adverse inference is to be

drawn against the accused.





19.      The arguments of the defence were that the accused and the

victim were not known to each other and it was improbable that one

would accept drink from a stranger. The argument made is meritless.

First of all there is no improbability in such an offer and secondly, the

victim was admitted in hospital with unknown poisoning which

confirms that the coffee drink consumed by the victim was laced with

sedative. The accused in her examination u/s 313 Cr PC stated that

she herself was diabetic and hence there was no occasion for her to

offer such a drink to the victim is contrary to record.             This

explanation given by the accused is not worth while and does not

appeal to reason. There is no reason as to why the accused would

implicate the accused in this case.





20.      An argument was made that the original discharge summary

was not produced and hence the very creation of the discharge


S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State     23/29
 summary is doubtful. The argument lacks merit. A copy of the

discharge summary was filed alongwith the charge sheet. In her

reply to the question put to her in her SA, that the discharge summary

was proved according to which the victim was diagnosed to be

suffering from 'unknown poisoning', she replied 'I do not know'.

Then she herself entered the witness box and stated that she herself

being a diabetic, she had no occasion for giving drink to him which

contained intoxicants. These stands taken by the accused show the

hollowness of her claims.





21.      Another argument made was with respect to there being no

witness of the incident. The victim was given intoxicating substance

in the car whereafter he became unconscious and thereafter theft was

committed. As such, there was no occasion for the independent

persons to witness the offence. In case there are public persons who

had witnessed the offence, then it becomes incumbent upon the

prosecution to examine them, but if the incident was not witnessed by

any independent person, no defect can be attached to non

examination of such independent witnesses.                        There is thus no

substance in the argument in this regard.



S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State               24/29

 22.      Next objection raised was that no receipt of mobile phone etc.

was brought on record. In the cross examination of the victim, he

had replied that he had purchased the mobile etc. from UK. A

suggestion was put to him that he did not purchase them from UK but

he denied the suggestion. Moreover, the witness had identified his

articles in judicial TIP. As such, no benefit can be drawn from this

circumstance.





23.      Yet another objection was that there was a delay of 6 days in

registration of case.             The incident in question took place on

18.9.2008. The victim was admitted in hospital on 19.9.2008 and he

remained there till 21.9.2008. The victim was cross examined in

detail but no question was put to him regarding delay. FIR was

registered at 2 Pm whereas the accused was arrested on 24.9.2008 at

5.45 PM. So, in any case, the FIR had been registered before arrest

of the accused in other FIR No. 541/08 of PS Dwarka. Thus, delay

in registration of case is not fatal.





24.      Similarly, non sealing of case property at the time of recovery

is not fatal as the recoveries were not case property of FIR 541/08.


S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08    Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State    25/29
 And when the case properties of the present FIR were seized by the

IO thereafter he deposited the same in maalkhana. Likewise, non-

taking of signatures of victim of the site plan is not that serious.

These lapses on the part of investigating agency cannot make the

prosecution case wholly unreliable. In Dharmendra Singh vs. State

of Gujarat 2002 Cr LJ 2631, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that

defective or doubtful investigation does not necessarily lead to

discredit the main prosecution case if prosecution evidence inspires

and circumstances lead to such a conclusion and the prosecution

story rings truth.





25.      It is not the law that whenever there is a discrepancy, invari-

ably its benefit has to go to the accused. Only in the case of major

discrepancies, which make the prosecution case absolutely unaccept-

able, that such a benefit can go to an accused but if the discrepancy is

only minor in nature, no fatality can be attached to it. In 
A. Shankar
vs. State of Karnataka
 2011 (6) SCC 279, Hon'ble Supreme Court made

following observations in this regard:






            17. In all criminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur
           in the depositions of witnesses due to normal errors of observation,
           namely, errors of memory due to lapse of time or due to mental
           disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence.


S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State           26/29
            Where the omissions amount to a contradiction, creating a serious
           doubt about the truthfulness of the witness and other witnesses also
           make material improvement while deposing in the court, such
           evidence cannot be safe to rely upon. However, minor
           contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on
           trivial matters which do not affect the core of the prosecution case,
           should not be made a ground on which the evidence can be
           rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its opinion about the
           credibility of the witness and record a finding as to whether his
           deposition inspires confidence. "Exaggerations per se do not render
           the evidence brittle. But it can be one of the factors to test credibility
           of the prosecution version, when the entire evidence is put in a
           crucible for being tested on the touchstone of credibility." Therefore,
           mere marginal variations in the statements of a witness cannot be
           dubbed as improvements as the same may be elaborations of the
           statement made by the witness earlier. "Irrelevant details which do
           not in any way corrode the credibility of a witness cannot be labelled
           as omissions or contradictions." The omissions which amount to
           contradictions in material particulars, i.e., materially affect the trial or
           core of the prosecution's case, render the testimony of the witness
           liable to be discredited.

26.      Similarly, in the case of 
Sucha Singh & Anr. v. State of Punjab


[(2003) 7 SCC 643] Hon'ble Supreme Court held that:


 
"20. Exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt must
                 not nurture fanciful doubts or lingering suspicion and thereby
                 destroy social defence. Justice cannot be made sterile on the
                 plea that it is better to let hundred guilty escape than punish an
                 innocent. Letting guilty escape is not doing justice according to
                 law. (See 
Gurbachan Singh v. Satpal Singh & Ors.
 (AIR 1990
                 SC 209).
 
Prosecution is not required to meet any and every
                 hypothesis put forward by the accused (See 
State of U.P. v.
                 Ashok Kumar Srivastava
 (AIR 1992 SC 840). A reasonable
                 doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or merely possible doubt, but a
                 fair doubt based upon reason and common sense.
 It must grow

S.C. No. 45/10    FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State                 27/29
                  out of the evidence in the case. If a case is proved perfectly, it is
                 argued that it is artificial; if a case has some flaws inevitable
                 because human beings are prone to err, it is argued that it is too
                 imperfect. One wonders whether in the meticulous
                 hypersensitivity    to eliminate a rare innocent from being
                 punished, many guilty persons must be allowed to escape. Proof
                 beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish. 
(See 
Inder
                 Singh and another v. State (Delhi Admn
.) (AIR 1978 SC 1091.
                 Vague hunches cannot take place of judicial evaluation. 'A
                 Judge does not preside over a criminal trial, merely to see that
                 no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that
                 a guilty man, does not escape. Both are public duties.'
 
(Per
                 Viscount Simen in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutor
                 91944 AC (PC 315) quoted in 
State of U.P. v. Anil Singh
 (AIR
                 1988 SC 1998). Doubts would be called reasonable if they are
                 free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any
                 favourite other than truth."






27.      So far as 
Section 411
 IPC is concerned, this Section penalize

dishonest receiving of stolen property. 
In 
Trimbak vs. State
 AIR

1954 SC 39 it was laid down that in order to bring home the guilt of a

person under this section, prosecution must prove, amongst other

things, that some person other than the accused, had possession of the

property before the accused got possession thereof. In other words,

accused must have got possession of the stolen articles from other

person and he should have retained them knowing that those are

stolen articles. It thus postulates that there should be a thief and

another person to retain the goods.
 One who commits theft and keeps

the stolen articles himself will thus only be liable to conviction u/s


S.C. No. 45/10    FIR No. 698/08    Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State                28/29
 379 and not
 u/s 411
 IPC. Accused is thus acquitted
 u/s 411
 IPC.




28.      If the deposition of all these witnesses is read together, it is

found that the prosecution has been able to prove its case beyond

doubt. Statement of victim has its own sanctity. Nothing has come

on record as to why the accused would be falsely implicated by the

victim. Accused refused to take part in TIP for no plausible reason.

He identified the accused in Court.                       His stolen articles were

recovered from the accused. Sedative tablets were recovered from

the accused from her handbag. The articles were identified by the

victim in judicial TIP. There is thus no reason to disbelieve these

circumstances.          Prosecution has been able to prove that accused

administered some sedative to the victim and thereafter she caused

theft of his belongings. All the ingredients of the offences
 u/s 328


and 
379
 IPC are fulfilled. The accused is thus convicted for the

offences
 u/s 328
 and 
379
 IPC.

State

                             ORDER ON SENTENCE


                 Accused has been convicted for the offence
 u/s 328
 and

379
 IPC, vide judgment dated 12.03.2014.

                 Counsel for the convict has argued that the convict is a
lady, who is pregnant at present and is also a mother of five years old
daughter. Ld. Counsel has stated that the convict lost her father when
she was eighteen years of age. Her second husband John has also
abandoned her. It is also stated that the convict is facing problems in
jail due to her pregnancy and is presently in MI Room of jail. Further,
it has been stated that the convict has already undergone custody of
about three and half years during the trial of this case and hence a
lenient view may be taken against her and she may be awarded the

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State              30/29
 sentence of the period already undergone by her.

                 Ld. Addl. PP, on the other hand, has prayed for
maximum sentence.

                 I have heard both the sides and have perused the records
of the case. 
Section 328
 IPC prescribes for a punishment of either
description for a term upto ten years and with fine. 
Section 379
 IPC
prescribes a punishment of either description for a term upto three
years or with fine or with both.

                 Records show that the convict was arrested on
25.09.2008 and she was released from jail on 15.02.2012 on bail.
She has thus already undergone custody of more than 40 months
during the course of trial. The convict is in family way and is
expected to deliver on 15.08.2014. Although, the offence of the
convict does not deserve any lenient view but purely taking into
consideration the circumstance that the convict is already in family
way and her daughter is only five years of age and that she has
already undergone a custody of about 40 months during the course of
trial of the present case, the convict is awarded the sentence of the
period already undergone by her for the offences under 
Section
328
 and 
379
 IPC. The convict shall, however, pay fine of Rs.
10,000/- for the offence under 
Section 328
 IPC and in default of
payment of fine, she shall suffer simple imprisonment for a
period of three months.

                 At this stage, fine amount of Rs. 10,000/- has been
deposited in the court.

                 Convict be released from jail, if not required in any other

S.C. No. 45/10   FIR No. 698/08   Eva Jennifer & Anr. vs. State        31/29
 case.

                 A copy of the judgment and sentence has been supplied
to the convict, free of cost.

                 File be consigned to the Record Room.
