                                 to enable the Arbitral Tribunal to make the award without any delay.
                                 The Arbitral Tribunal should record day to-day proceedings. The
                                 proceedings shall normally be conducted on the basis of documents
                                 and written statements.



                                 64 (3) (a) (v) - While appointing arbitrator(s) under sub-clause (i), (ii)

                                 made by such Tribunal will, however, not be invalid merely for the
                                 reason that one or more arbitrator had, in the course of his service,
                                 opportunity to deal with the matters to which the contract relates or
                                 who in the course of his/their duties expressed views on all or any of
                                 the matters under dispute.

                                 reasons upon which it is based. The analysis and reasons shall be
                                 detailed enough so that the award could be inferred there from.



                                 64 (3) (b) (ii) - A party may apply for corrections of any
                                 computational errors, any typographical or clerical errors or any
                                 other error of similar nature occurring in the award and

                                 receipt of award to make an additional award as to claims presented
                                 in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the arbitral award.

                                 ruling or award shall be made by a majority of Members of Tribunal.
                                 In the absence of such a majority, the views of the Presiding

                                 64(5) Where the arbitral award is for the payment of money, no
                                 interest shall be payable on whole or any part of the money for any

                                 64(6) The cost of arbitration shall be borne by the respective parties.

                          4.    Disputes have arisen between the parties on account of the alleged
                          hindrances faced by the petitioner during the execution of work such as
                          delayed execution of LHS Bridges by other agencies, delayed Ganga Bridge
                          work by other agencies, delayed relocation of cable junction boxes, non-

                          blanketing material, additional tax burden owing to implementation of GST
                          and eventually arbitrary and malafide termination of the contract by the
                          respondent on 31.12.2018.

                          5.    The petitioner invoked the Dispute Resolution Clause vide
                          communication dated 30.09.2022. In the said communication, while setting
                          out the grievances of the petitioner and the claims sought to be raised by the
                          petitioner upon the respondent, it was inter-alia sought as under:

                                  "Also, as per modified clause 64 of GCC-2014, the Company is
                                  submitting herewith duly signed Annexure-XV of modified clause 64 of
                                  GCC-2014. The Company further request Railways to refer the
                                  dispute to the independent arbitrator, who shall be appointed with the

                          6.    In response, the respondent addressed a communication dated
                          15.03.2023 to the petitioner, inter-alia, stating:

                                 Arbitrator/Contractor's nominee. In above referred Arbitration case:



                                 1.    Shri Arunendera Kumar, Retd. CRB/Railway Board

                                 2.    Shri Alok Ranjan, AM/CE, Railway Board

                                 It is therefore requested to suggest at least two names out of the above
                                 panel within 15 days positively, so that further action can be taken
                                 into the matter accordingly."



 
7.    The petitioner vide communication dated 29.03.2023 stated that the
                          aforesaid suggestion of the respondent, and the appointment procedure
                          sought to be followed was not in accordance with the judgments of Supreme
                          Court in 
TRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd.
 (
2017) 8 SCC
                          377, Bharat Broadband Network Limited v. United Telecoms Limited

Gangotri
                          Enterprises vs. General Manager, Northern Railway
 (2022) DHC 004520.
                          The petitioner accordingly suggested the names of three persons, one of
                          whom could act as the petitioner's nominee. The petitioner also requested
                          that one of the persons named by the respondent in its communication dated
                          15.03.2023 not be appointed as a co-arbitrator or a presiding arbitrator since
                          the said person was already acting as the presiding arbitrator/co-arbitrator in
                          three other railway arbitrations. Finally, it was stated in the communication
                          dated 29.03.2023 that "in case this is not acceptable to you, we will be
                          constrained to take legal action as per

 of Indian Arbitration and
                          Conciliation Act, 1996".


                          8.    Instead of paying heed to and responding to the petitioner's
                          communication dated 29.03.2023, the respondent addressed another
                          communication dated 10.04.2023, reproducing the contents of its earlier

                           communication dated 15.03.2023 verbatim. In response, the petitioner
                          addressed a communication dated 11.05.2023, suggesting the names of its
                          nominee arbitrators as per the appointment procedure insisted upon by the
                          respondent.

                          9.    Subsequently, the arbitral tribunal came to be constituted, and the
                          same was intimated to the petitioner vide communicated dated 24.05.2023,
                          which inter-alia records as under:

                                 "The General Manager, Northern Railway, Baroda House, New Delhi
                                 appointed the Arbitral Tribunal consisting of following members, to
                                 settle the disputes arising out of the subject contract."



                          10.   It is also notable that while constituting the arbitral tribunal, the
                          respondent did not refer all of the claims sought to be raised by the
                          petitioner to arbitration; some of the claims were excluded from the purview
                          of arbitration. This was ostensibly on the basis that the said claims fell
                          within the "scope of excepted matters".

                          11.   In the circumstances, the present petition has been filed by the
                          petitioner seeking constitution of an independent arbitral tribunal. Although
                          the prayer in the present petition, as initially framed, raises a grievance as
                          regards exclusion of certain claims from the purview of arbitration and seeks
                          reference of the said claims to the arbitral tribunal as already constituted,
                          during the course of arguments learned counsel for the petitioner has
                          strenuously contended that the procedure envisaged under Clause 63 and
                          Clause 64 of GCC is not a valid appointment procedure, and therefore an
                          independent arbitral tribunal is required to be constituted to adjudicate the
                          disputes between the parties.

"Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the arbitration
                                  agreement, as incorporated in Clause 64 of the Indian Railway
                                  General Conditions of Contract, 1999, enables the respondent to
                                  appoint a panel of three Gazetted railway Officers as members of the
                                  Arbitral Tribunal. He submits that the same is not in consonance with
                                  law and is inoperable in view of the judgment of this Court in 
Margo
                                  Networks Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Railtel Corporation of India Ltd.
 (2023 SCC

                                  It is further submitted that the petitioner raised serious objection/s to
                                  the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, as constituted vide
                                  communication dated 24.05.2023. It is submitted that an independent
                                  arbitral tribunal is required to be constituted to adjudicate the dispute
                                  between the parties in view of the settled legal position in a catena of
                                  cases.



                                  In the circumstances, the petitioner does not press Prayer A in the
                                  present petition; and seeks that an independent arbitral tribunal be
                                  constituted to adjudicate all the claims of the petitioner."



                          13.   Subsequently, an affidavit dated 29.04.2024 has also come to be filed
                          on behalf of the petitioner in these proceedings wherein it has been, inter-
                          alia, stated as under:

                                "4. That I say, by way of the instant petition I pray to this Hon'ble court for
                                appointment of the independent arbitral tribunal for adjudication of the
                                disputes as detailed out in the instant petition rather than referring the claims
                                to the existing arbitral tribunal which is constituted against principles of law.



                                5. That I say, my Ld. Counsel upon my instruction has maintained the same
                                stand before the Hon'ble Court which finds mentioned in the order dated
                                25.08.2023 as passed by this Hon'ble Court in the instant petition. Copy of

                          14.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that Clause-63 and Clause-
                          64 of the GCC have been the subject matter of examination in numerous
                          judicial pronouncements. It has been held that the procedure contemplated
                          therein for constituting a tribunal does not meet the requirements of law.

                           Consequently, while dealing with the petition under 
Section 11
 of the
                          Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, this Court and also several other
                          High Courts have appointed independent Arbitral Tribunals in identical
                          context.

                          15.   
In this regard, reliance has been placed on the judgments in the case
                          of 
Margo Networks Pvt. Ltd. &Anr. v. Railtel Corporation of India Ltd.
,
                          2023:DHC:4596 and Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. v. General Manager
                          Northern Railway (Supra).


 
16.   On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondent has contended
                          that the arbitral tribunal having already been constituted, there is no
                          occasion for this Court to substitute/appoint another tribunal to adjudicate
                          the disputes between the parties. Further, it is contended that the respondent
                          has not referred certain claims to arbitration since the same fall in the
                          category of 'excepted matters'. Learned counsel for the respondent has
                          relied upon the cases of M/s 
Emaar India Ltd. v. Tarun Aggarwal Projects
                          LLP &Anr.
 2022 
SCC OnLine SC 1328, Mitra Guha Builders (India)

                          17.   At the outset, it is noted that this Court has had occasion to examine
                          the validity of the procedure for appointment/constitution of an arbitral
                          tribunal in the backdrop of contractual stipulations identical to those in the
                          present case.

In the case of

                           that:


 
(i)         In the context of appointment procedure contemplating
                                  appointment out of panel of arbitrators maintained by one of the
                                  contracting parties, it is mandatory that the panel should be sufficiently
                                  broad-based, failing which the appointment procedure does not meet
                                  with the requirements of law, and in such a situation an independent
                                  arbitral tribunal is required to be appointed by this Court. 
Referring to
                                  Voestalpine Schienen Gmbh vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation
                                  Ltd
, (2017) 4 SCC 665, held that an arbitrator panel must be broad-


                                  based and not restrictive. This requirement was not fulfilled when the
                                  panel was comprised solely of ex-employees of a party.

                                  (ii)        A valid appointment procedure must be balanced and not
                                  confer excessive say or authority on one of the parties to the arbitration
                                  regarding the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. An appointment
                                  procedure that contemplates that one party appoints two out of three
                                  members of the arbitral tribunal contravenes this requirement.

                          19.      In the present case, the procedure contemplated under Clauses 63 and
                          64 for appointing/constituting an arbitral tribunal is also vulnerable on both
                          the above counts.

 
20.      The relevant observations made by this Court in 
Margo Networks
                          Pvt. Ltd.
 (Supra) are as follows:


 
"35. Thus, in an appointment procedure involving appointment from a
                                        panel made by one of the contracting parties, it is mandatory for the
                                        panel to be sufficiently broad based, in conformity with the principle
                                        
laid down in
 
Voestalpine
 (supra), failing which, it would be incumbent
                                        on the Court, while exercising jurisdiction under 
Section 11
, to
                                        constitute an independent and impartial Arbitral Tribunal as
                                        mandated in 
TRF
 (supra) and Perkins (supra). The judgement of the
                                        Supreme Court in CORE does not alter the position in this regard.

                                  36. 
In the facts of the present case, applying the principles laid down
                                 in 
Voestalpine
 (supra) and in view of the aforesaid judgments of this
                                 Court, including in 
L&T Hydrocarbon Engineering Limited
 (supra), it
                                 is evident that the panel offered by the respondent to the petitioner in
                                 the present case is restrictive and not broadbased. The same
                                 adversely impinges upon the validity of the appointment procedure
                                 contained in clause 3.37 (supra), and necessitates that an
                                 independent Arbitral Tribunal be constituted by this Court.




                                 37. This brings us to the next issue that arises in the context of the
                                 arbitration clause in the present case, viz. whether "counter
                                 balancing" is achieved in a situation where one of the parties has a
                                 right to choose an arbitrator from a panel whereas 2/3rd of the
                                 members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the other party.



                                                                   ***


                                 42. .... The "counter balancing" as contemplated in Perkins (supra)
                                 cannot be said to have been achieved in a situation where one of the
                                 parties has a right to choose an arbitrator from a panel and where
                                 the remaining (2 out of 3) arbitrators are appointed by the other
                                 party."



 
21.   The observations made in 
Margo Networks Pvt. Ltd.
 (Supra) have
                          been referred with approval by this Court in 
Taleda Square Private Limited
                          v. Rail Land Development Authority
 2023 SCC OnLine Del 6321, Kalyan
                          Toll Infrastructure Ltd v. Union of India and Others 2024 SCC OnLine

                          Del 2166.


 
22.   Consequently, in terms of the said judgment in 
Margo Networks Pvt.
                          Ltd.
 (Supra) and other judgments of the Coordinate Bench of this Court, it is
                          incumbent on this Court to appoint an independent arbitral tribunal to
                          adjudicate the disputes between the parties.


                          23.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has also drawn attention to the fact
                          that in identical context, this Court, having found that the appointment

                          to adjudicate the disputes between the parties. 
In this regard, reference may
                          be made to 
S.N. Naik & Brothers v. Union of India
 2024 SCC OnLine
                          Bom 995, wherein, it has been observed as under :-


                                 "18. Thus, in the case of CORE (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
                                 applied the above clause 64(3)(b)(ii) and held that the High Court could
                                 have not appointed independent sole arbitrator. 
However, in the case of
                                 CORE (supra)as discussed hereinafter, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
                                 not called upon to decide whether clause 64(3)(b)(ii) is in confirmity of
                                 principles laid down in 
TRF
 (supra) i.e. whether the arbitral panel is
                                 broad based and in Perkins (supra), more particularly, whether the
                                 counter balance is achieved in appointing the arbitral panel.
 
The
                                 Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CORE (supra) has not whittled
                                 down the principles laid down in 
TRF and Perkins
 (supra).
 The issues
                                 answered in the judgment of CORE (supra) are, whether the retired
                                 railway officers are eligible to be appointed as arbitrators and whether
                                 the General Manager is eligible to nominate the arbitrators.



                                 19 In Tantia Constructions (supra) the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
                                 doubted the view taken in the case of CORE (supra) observing that once
                                 the appointing authority itself is incapcity from referring the matter to
                                 arbitrator it does not follow that notwithstanding this yet appointments
                                 may be valid depending upon the facts of the case. However, CORE
                                 (supra), has not dealt with the issue of counter balance achieved in terms
                                 of Perkins (supra). As such, the law laid down in the judgment of CORE
                                 (supra) is limited to the issues answered in CORE (supra). The same is
                                 the view taken by the Delhi High Court in the below discussed judgments.



                                                xxx               xxx                     xxx


 
23. I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Delhi
                                 High Court in the case of 
Gangotri
 (supra) and 
Ganesh Engineering

                                 (supra) that the judgment of CORE (supra) of the Hon'ble Supreme
                                 Court does not deal with the issue, whether the arbitral panel appointed
                                 is broad based in confirmity with voelstapine (supra) and whether the
                                 counter balancing is achieved as laid down in Perkins (supra). Coming
                                 to the facts of the present case, 2/3 arbitral panel is appointed by the
                                 respondent so also for the 3rd member of the arbitral tribunal 4 names
                                 are suggested by the respondent from which the petitioner is required to
                                 choose 2 names and from the 2 names chosen by the petitioner, the
                                 respondent will appoint one. Thus, the respondent has a complete say in
                                 the appointment of the tribunal.

                                  24. Having considered the law on the subject the question as raised at
                                 para 8(1) can be answered as under:-



 
Clause 64(3)(b)(ii) of the General Conditions of Contract provides
                                 for unilateral appointment of arbitral tribunal at the hands of one of the
                                 parties and, thus, is in violation of the principles laid down in

 (supra) and Perkins (supra) and also in

                                 said clause is ex-faice invalid and the tribunal constituted thereunder is
                                 non-est and void ab initio.

Union of India (UOI) vs. Singh Builders Syndicate
 (2009) 4 SCC
                                 523, the High Court rejected the contention on behalf of the Government
                                 that the Court was not vested with any powers to appoint a Sole
                                 Arbitrator in distinction to the Arbitration Agreement which provided for
                                 the Tribunal of three members. The Apex Court upheld the order of this
                                 Court appointing a Sole Arbitrator by observing that the appointment of
                                 the Sole Arbitrator was valid.




                                 23. In view of the submissions made as well as Clause 7 of the Services

Section 11

                          of the A&C Act, 1996.

                          26.

J. S. R. Constructions v. National Highways Authority of India
                          and Anr.

                                 "19. In answer to question (ii), this Court finds that the present petition
                                 is maintainable. There is no merit in the argument of the respondents that
                                 since an Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted to adjudicate the disputes
                                 between the parties, the present petition is not maintainable. In Perkins

                                     challenge at an appropriate stage in terms of remedies available
                                     in law. Similar controversy was gone into by a Designated Judge
                                     of this Court in Walter Bau AG and the discussion on the point
                                     was as under : (SCC pp. 805-06, paras 9-10)
                                       "9. While it is correct that in Antrix and Pricol Ltd., it was
                                       opined by this Court that after appointment of an arbitrator
                                       is made, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not under
                                       
Section 11(6)
 but such remedy lies elsewhere and under
                                       different provisions of the 
Arbitration Act
 (
Sections 12
 and

                                       13), the context in which the aforesaid view was expressed
                                       cannot be lost sight of. In Antrix, appointment of the
                                       arbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as per the alternative
                                       procedure agreed upon, whereas in Pricol Ltd., the party
                                       which had filed the application under 
Section 11(6)
 of the
                                       Arbitration Act had already submitted to the jurisdiction of
                                       the arbitrator. In the present case, the situation is
                                       otherwise.

                                       10. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid
                                       and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising
                                       jurisdiction under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Arbitration Act,

                                      the jurisdiction under 
Section 11(6)
 cannot be
                                      countenanced in law. In the present case, the agreed upon
                                      procedure between the parties contemplated the
                                      appointment of the arbitrator by the second party within 30
                                      days of receipt of a notice from the first party. While the
                                      decision in Datar Switchgears Ltd. may have introduced
                                      some flexibility in the timeframe agreed upon by the parties
                                      by extending it till a point of time anterior to the filing of the
                                      application under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Arbitration Act, it
                                      cannot be lost sight of that in the present case the
                                      appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is clearly contrary
                                      to the provisions of the Rules governing the appointment of
                                      arbitrators by Icadr, which the parties had agreed to abide
                                      by in the matter of such appointment. The option given to
                                      the respondent Corporation to go beyond the panel
                                      submitted by Icadr and to appoint any person of its choice
                                      was clearly not in the contemplation of the parties. If that
                                      be so, obviously, the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane
                                      is non est in law. Such an appointment, therefore, will not
                                      inhibit the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under
                                      
Section 11(6)
 of the Arbitration Act. It cannot, therefore, be
                                      held that the present proceeding is not maintainable in law.

                                      The appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond 30
                                      days of the receipt of notice by the petitioner, though may
                                      appear to be in conformity with the law laid down in Datar
                                      Switchgears Ltd., is clearly contrary to the agreed
                                      procedure which required the appointment made by the
                                      respondent Corporation to be from the panel submitted by
                                      Icadr. The said appointment, therefore, is clearly invalid in
                                      law."

                                     33. We may immediately state that the opinion expressed in the
                                     aforesaid case is in consonance with the binding authorities we
                                     have referred to hereinbefore."



                                    28. In TRF Ltd., the Managing Director of the respondent had
                                    nominated a former Judge of this Court as sole arbitrator in
                                    terms of the aforesaid Clause 33(d), after which the appellant had
                                    preferred an application under 
Section 11(5)
 read with 
Section
                                    11(6)
 of the Act. The plea was rejected by the High Court and the
                                    appeal therefrom on the issue whether the Managing Director
                                    could nominate an arbitrator was decided in favour of the
                                    appellant as stated hereinabove. As regards the issue about fresh
                                    appointment, this Court remanded the matter to the High Court
                                    for fresh consideration as is discernible from para 55 of the
                                    judgment. In the light of these authorities there is no hindrance in
                                    entertaining the instant application preferred by the applicants.

                                                        xxx               xxx                    xxx

                                    to entertain the instant application preferred by the applicants.
                                    We, therefore, accept the application, annul the effect of the letter
                                    dated 30-7- 2019 issued by the respondent and of the appointment

                                    issue, which has arisen for consideration is whether, as submitted
                                    by Mr. Seth, this petition is not maintainable as there is already an

                                     11(6) of the Act was not an appropriate remedy and it was upon for
                                    the party to raise objections as to the constitution and jurisdiction
                                    of the Arbitral Tribunal itself under the provisions of the Act.




 
34. Similarly, he had also relied upon the judgment of this Court in
                                    
Newton Engineering & Chemicals
 (supra) to contend that there
                                    was no provision under the Act empowering the Court to terminate
                                    the mandate of the Arbitrator appointed in terms of the agreement
                                    between the parties and the remedy to any challenge against the
                                    appointment of Arbitrator was under 
Section 13
 of the Arbitration
                                    and Conciliation Act before the Arbitrator.
 I am not in agreement
                                    with the submissions made by Mr. Seth by relying upon aforesaid
                                    two judgments for the simple reason that in Perkins Eastman
                                    Architects DPC (supra), the Supreme Court while dealing with an
                                    application under 
Section 11(6)
 read with 
Section 11(12)(a)
 of the
                                    Act of 1996 held that as per the scheme of 
Section 11
 of the Act, if
                                    there are justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality
                                    of the persons nominated, and if other circumstances warrant
                                    appointment of an independent Arbitrator by ignoring the
                                    procedure prescribed, such appointment can be made by the Court.



                                    35. If that be so, there is no impediment for this Court to appoint an
                                    independent Arbitrator for adjudicating the dispute and difference
                                    between the parties...."



                                 21. In view of the aforesaid, there is no impediment in entertaining the
                                 present petition. This Court therefore annuls the effect of the letter dated
                                 12.07.2023 issued by the respondent no.1; and the letter dated
                                 19.07.2023 issued by the presiding arbitrator, whereby it was purported
                                 to be informed that the Arbitral Tribunal stood constituted."

                          an arbitral tribunal, which inherently lacks jurisdiction, cannot validly

                                 who is ineligible to act an Arbitrator, lacks the inherent jurisdiction to
                                 render an Arbitral Award under the A&C Act. It is trite law that a
                                 decision, by any authority, which lacks inherent jurisdiction to make
                                 such a decision, cannot be considered as valid. Thus, clearly, such an
                                 impugned award cannot be enforced."



 
28.   There is also no merit in the respondent's contention that certain
                          claims are not liable to be referred to arbitration because they fall within the
                          scope of excepted matters. Whether or not any particular claim is precluded
                          from arbitration on account of being an excepted matter is an aspect that can
                          be gone into by a duly constituted arbitral tribunal. Reference in this regard
                          is apposite to

                                 'excepted matters'. However, this aspect would require an in depth
                                 examination of the factual matrix which can be done by a duly

                           observed therein as follows:



                                 "G. The doctrine of competence-competence

                                 ...



                                 162. The legislature confined the scope of reference under 
Section
                                 11(6A)
 to the examination of the existence of an arbitration
                                 agreement. The use of the term "examination" in itself connotes that
                                 the scope of the power is limited to a prima facie determination. Since
                                 the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code, the requirement of
                                 "existence" of an arbitration agreement draws effect from 
Section 7

                                 of the Arbitration Act. In DuroFelguera (supra), this Court held that
                                 the referral courts only need to consider one aspect to determine the
                                 existence of an arbitration agreement - whether the underlying
                                 contract contains an arbitration agreement which provides for
                                 arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the
                                 parties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of examination under
                                 
Section 11(6A)
 should be confined to the existence of an arbitration
                                 agreement on the basis of 
Section 7
. Similarly, the validity of an
                                 arbitration agreement, in view of 
Section 7
, should be restricted to the
                                 requirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the
                                 agreement be in writing. This interpretation also gives true effect to
                                 the doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of
                                 substantive existence and validity of an arbitration agreement to be
                                 decided by arbitral tribunal under 
Section 16
. 
We accordingly clarify
                                 the position of law laid down in 
Vidya Drolia
 (supra) in the context of
                                 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act.




                                 163. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement
                                 generally lies on the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In
                                 jurisdictions such as India, which accept the doctrine of competence-
                                 competence, only prima facie proof of the existence of an arbitration
                                 agreement must be adduced before the referral court. The referral
                                 court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial by allowing
                                 the parties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or
                                 validity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of the
                                 existence and validity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of
                                 evidence ought to be left to the arbitral tribunal. This position of law
                                 can also be gauged from the plain language of the statute."

                           of appointing an arbitrator, the Court's role is limited to determining the
                          prima facie existence of an arbitration agreement, and "nothing else". It was
                          observed therein as follows:

                                "113. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration
                                and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it was observed in In Re:

                                Interplay (supra) that the High Court and the Supreme Court at the stage
                                of appointment of arbitrator shall examine the existence of a prima facie
                                arbitration agreement and not any other issues. The relevant observations
                                are extracted hereinbelow:

                                    "209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or
                                    High Court at the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator
                                    shall "examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration
                                    agreement and not other issues". These other issues not only
                                    pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also
                                    include any other issues which are a consequence of
                                    unnecessary judicial interference in the arbitration
                                    proceedings. Accordingly, the "other issues" also include
                                    examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by the
                                    referral court at the 
Section 8
 or 
Section 11
 stage. The process
                                    of examination, impounding, and dealing with an unstamped
                                    instrument under the 
Stamp Act
 is not a timebound process, and
                                    therefore does not align with the stated goal of the 
Arbitration
                                    Act
 to ensure expeditious and time-bound appointment of
                                    arbitrators. [...]"

                                                                                  (Emphasis supplied)

 
114. In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re. Interplay, it
                                is clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of arbitrator
                                is limited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the arbitration
                                agreement, and nothing else. For this reason, we find it difficult to hold
                                that the observations made in Vidya Drolia and adopted in 
NTPC v. SPML
                                Infra Ltd.
 that the jurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the
                                issue of "accord and satisfaction" under 
Section 11
 extends to weeding
                                out ex-facie non-arbitrable and frivolous disputes would continue to apply
                                despite the subsequent decision in In Re. Interplay."


                                123. The power available to the referral courts has to be construed in the
                                light of the fact that no right to appeal is available against any order
                                passed by the referral court under 
Section 11
 for either appointing or
                                refusing to appoint an arbitrator. Thus, by delving into the domain of the
                                arbitral tribunal at the nascent stage of 
Section 11
, the referral courts also

                          31.    Thus, it is not open for the respondent to resist arbitration based on
                          their assertion that some of the claim/s fall within the scope of "expected
                          matters". However, the respondent would be well within its right to move an
                          appropriate application under 
Section 16
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
                          Act, 1996, raising appropriate objections in this regard.

                          the legal position as noted hereinabove, it is incumbent on this Court to
                          appoint an independent arbitral tribunal to adjudicate the disputes between
                          the parties.

                          33.    Accordingly, Mr. Justice (Retd.) Dinesh Maheshwari, Former Judge,
                          Supreme Court of India (Mobile No.:9485006617) is appointed as the Sole
                          Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the parties.

                          34.    It is clarified that the respondent shall be entitled to raise appropriate
                          jurisdictional objections/move application under 
Section 16

                          claim/s sought to be raised fall within the scope of excepted matters.
                          Needless to say, in the event of any such application being filed, the same
                          shall be dealt with and adjudicated upon by the learned Sole Arbitrator in

                          opinion with regard thereto.

                          35.    The learned Sole Arbitrator may proceed with the arbitration
                          proceedings subject to furnishing to the parties requisite disclosures as
