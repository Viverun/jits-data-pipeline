                                            7/28




         from13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 for the purpose of service

         benefits like M.A.C.P. and other benefits for the reasons that

         they have entered into the respective cadre on regular basis on

         31.03.2015
 vide Annexure-P7 to C.W.J.C. Such regularization

         of the members of the respondents are not with retrospective

         effect so as to claim any service benefits for contractual service.

         The respondents have not questioned the validity of order dated

         31.03.2015 related to regularization to the effect that they are

         entitled to have the benefit of regularization with retrospective

         effect from the date they were initially appointed on contractual

         basis, i.e., with effect from 13.12.2006. It is also submitted that

         conditions stipulated in the order dated 31.03.2015 insofar as

         condition nos.(vii), (viii) and (ix)a have not been questioned. In

         other words they have accepted the terms and conditions

         stipulated in the order of regularization dated 31.03.2015. It is

         further submitted that M.A.C.P. Rules/Schemes is applicable to

         only regular holder of the post and not in respect of

         adhoc/contract employees during the intervening period from

         the inception of M.A.C.P. Rules issued in the year 2010

         (M.A.C.P. Scheme dated 07.10.2010). No doubt, M.A.C.P.

         Scheme 2010 was modified in respect of paragaph-9 while

         substituting       the     word      "adhoc/contract   employee"   was
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            8/28





         substituted as only "adhoc" In other words, from the inception

         of the M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules issued in the year 2010 insofar

         as paragraph-9, the word "contractual employee" has been

         substituted to the extent of only "adhoc employees". Since the

         members of the respondents are not adhoc employees and they

         cannot claim any service benefits towards the M.A.C.P. benefits.


                           7. In support of the aforementioned contentions,

         the learned counsel for the appellants relied on two decisions of

         the Hon'ble Supreme Court, namely, (2022) 2 Supreme Court

         Cases 25 {Union of India and others Versus N. Murugesan

         and others (paragraphs-25, 26 and 27.2)} and (2018) 9

         Supreme Court Cases 293 {K. Anbazhagan and another

         Versus Registrar General, High Court of Madras and

         another (paragraphs-32, 34 and 36)}.


                           8. It is further submitted that the learned Single

         Judge has not appreciated to the extent that the members of the

         respondents have not questioned the validity of certain

         conditions stipulated in the order of the regularization dated

         31.03.2015 and so also has not apprised applicability of

         M.A.C.P.       Schemes/Rules 2010 read with modified on

         27.05.2013 to the extent of replacing of certain words in

         paragraph-9 of M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules 2010.              It is also
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            9/28





         submitted that the learned Single Judge has taken note of the

         decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Central

         Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Another

         Versus Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another {(1986) 3 SCC 156}

         to extend benefits to the respondents. The cited decision has no

         assistance to the respondents in the backdrop of regularization

         order and its condition read with eligibility clause in the

         M.A.C.P. Scheme. There is no challenge to the conditions

         stipulated in the order of regularization and so also Para-9 to the

         M.A.C.P. It is further submitted that the factual aspect of the

         matter is required to be taken note of read with the decision of

         the Hon'ble Supreme Court. To that effect, the learned Single

         Judge has committed error in extending relief to the members of

         the respondents.



                           9. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents

         submitted that there is no error committed by the learned Single

         Judge. He has relied on clause-9 of the regularization order

         dated 31.03.2015. It is further submitted that modified M.A.C.P.

         notification or letter dated 27.05.2013 which is restricted to the

         word "adhoc" while substituting "adhoc and contractual

         employee". Contractual employees would also fall under the

         definition of adhoc employees. Therefore, the members of the
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            10/28





         respondents are entitled to have the benefit of counting their

         contractual service from 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 towards

         grant of M.A.C.P. benefits. Hence, there is no infirmity in the

         order of the learned Single Judge so as to interfere and L.P.A. is

         liable to be rejected while affirming the order of the learned

         Single Judge.



                           10. Heard the learned counsels for the respective

         parties.



                           11. Members of the respondents were appointed

         on contract basis to various posts on 13.12.2006 and their

         services were regularized on 31.03.2015 with the conditions

         stipulated cited supra. The respondents have not questioned the

         validity of certain conditions imposed in the order of the

         regularization in particularly condition nos.(vii), (viii) and (ix) a

         and so also their regularization is prospective in nature, i.e., with

         effect from 31.03.2015 and they were regular holder of the

         various posts only with effect from 31.03.2015. In other words,

         they were holders of substantive post w.e.f. 31.03.2015. For the

         purpose of extending M.A.C.P. benefits or any other service

         benefits, such service is required to be taken only in respect of

         regular service rendered by an employee. In the present case,

         contractual service from 13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 cannot be

         counted for the purpose of extending any service benefits. In the

         light of conditions imposed in the order of regularization and

         Para-9 of M.A.C.P. Scheme. It is to be noted that service

         conditions ordinarily notified under 
Article 309
 of the

         Constitution of India and eligibility clause invariably it is for

         regular employee unless and until regularization order is with

         retrospective effect. The respondents have not questioned the

         terms and conditions stipulated in the order of regularization,


                           12. Paragraph-9 of the M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules

         2010 reads as under:

                           13. The M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules 2010 and its

         modification on 27.05.2013 may be under 
Article 309
 of the

         Constitution of India or under 
Article 166
 of the Constitution of

         India and such Scheme is applicable to regular employees

         during the intervening period from 07.10.2010 to 26.05.2013.

         From 27.05.2013 onwards M.A.C.P. Scheme is applicable to

         adhoc employees only and not for contractual employee. It is to

         be noted that under M.A.C.P. Rules 2010, M.A.C.P. benefits

         were not extended to adhoc employees and contractual

         employees. By virtue of decision dated 27.05.2013, the State

         Government took a policy decision to the effect that such of

         those adhoc employees and their services could be counted for

         the purpose of extending M.A.C.P. under 2010 M.A.C.P.

         excluded.



                           14. It is necessary to extract the relevant portion

         of the Hon'ble Supreme Court decisions cited on behalf of the

         appellants. Paragraphs-25, 26 and 27.2 of the Hon'ble Supreme

         Court decision in the case of Union of India and others

         Versus N. Murugesan and others {(2022) 2 Supreme Court

         Cases 25} read as under:



                                           "25. Acquiescence would mean a tacit
                                           or passive acceptance. It is implied
                                           and reluctant consent to an act. In
                                           other words, such an action would
                                           qualify a passive assent. Thus, when
                                           acquiescence          takes     place,   it
                                           presupposes knowledge against a
                                           particular act. From the knowledge
                                           comes passive acceptance, therefore
                                           instead of taking any action against
                                           any alleged refusal to perform the
                                           original contract, despite adequate
                                           knowledge of its terms, and instead
                                           being       allowed    to     continue   by
                                           consciously ignoring it and thereafter
                                           proceeding further, acquiescence does
                                           take place. As a consequence, it
                                           reintroduces a new implied agreement
                                           between the parties. Once such a
                                           situation arises, it is not open to the
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                           party that acquiesced itself to insist
                                           upon the compliance of the original
                                           terms. Hence, what is essential, is the
                                           conduct of the parties. We only dealt
                                           with the distinction involving a mere
                                           acquiescence. When acquiescence is
                                           followed by delay, it may become
                                           laches. Here again, we are inclined to
                                           hold that the concept of acquiescence
                                           is to be seen on a case-to-case basis."



                                           Approbate and reprobate


                                            26. These phrases are borrowed from
                                             the Scots law. They would only
                                             mean that no party can be allowed to
                                             accept and reject the same thing, and
                                             thus one cannot blow hot and cold.

                                             The principle behind the doctrine of
                                             election is inbuilt in the concept of
                                             approbate   and    reprobate.   Once
                                             again, it is a principle of equity
                                             coming under      the contours of
                                             common law. Therefore, he who
                                             knows that if he objects to an
                                             instrument, he will not get the
                                             benefit he wants cannot be allowed
                                             to do so while enjoying the fruits.

                                             One cannot take advantage of one
                                             part while rejecting the rest. A
                                             person cannot be allowed to have

                                             the benefit of an instrument while
                                             questioning the same. Such a party
                                             either has to affirm or disaffirm the
                                             transaction. This principle has to be
                                             applied with more vigour as a
                                             common law principle, if such a
                                             party actually enjoys the one part
                                             fully and on near completion of the
                                             said enjoyment, thereafter questions
                                             the other part. An element of fair
                                             play is inbuilt in this principle. It is
                                             also a species of estoppel dealing
                                             with the conduct of a party. We have
                                             already dealt with the provisions of
                                             the 
Contract Act
 concerning the
                                             conduct    of   a   party,    and   his
                                             presumption of knowledge while
                                             confirming an offer through his
                                             acceptance unconditionally.

                                               conduct of parties. As in the case of
                                               estoppel it cannot operate against

                                                reprobate". Where one knowingly
                                                accepts the benefits of a contract
                                                or conveyance or an order, is
                                                estopped to deny the validity or

                                                This rule is applied to do equity,
                                                however, it must not be applied in
                                                a manner as to violate the
                                                principles of right and good
                                                conscience.


                                                 26. It is evident that the doctrine
                                                 of election is based on the rule of
                                                 estoppel, the principle that one
                                                 cannot approbate and reprobate is
                                                 inherent in it. The doctrine of
                                                 estoppel by election is one among
                                                 the species of estoppel in pais (or
                                                 equitable estoppel), which is a

                                                 appellants were same as those
                                                 other judicial officers of the State
                                                 as per order of this Court. The
                                                 High Court in its judgment
                                                 although observed that Fast Track
                                                 Courts cannot be said to have
                                                 been created in "pensionable
                                                 establishment"    but    the     said
                                                 conclusion has been arrived at
                                                 without    considering     relevant
                                                 materials and without giving any
                                                 cogent reasons. We thus are of the
                                                 view that appointment of the
                                                 appellants was in "pensionable
                                                 establishment".

                                                 Appointments are made both on
                                                 permanent or temporary basis
                                                 against     permanent            post    or
                                                 temporary post. The appointment
                                                 can also be made on ad hoc basis
                                                 on permanent or temporary post.

                                                 There is one common feature of
                                                 appointments         of         permanent,

                                                 i.e. those appointments are made
                                                 against      the         post      whether

                                                 post. A contractual appointment
                                                 is not normally made against a
                                                 post.       Further,            contractual
                                                 appointments         are        also    not

                                                 of the appellants cannot be
                                                 termed          as              contractual

                                                 years only because the posts were
                                                 contemplated for five years only,
                                                 the appointment of the appellants
                                                 at best can be said as "tenure
                                                 appointment".               Although

16.    (2018) 9 Supreme Court Cases 293 {K.

         Anbazhagan and another Versus Registrar General, High

         Court of Madras and another} decision has some bearing and

         its supports        the argument of the learned counsel for the

         appellants insofar as distinguishing contractual employee and

         regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court distinguished

         adhoc employee and regular employee in the case of 
State of

         Karnataka and Others vs. Uma Devi
 reported in (2006) 4

         SCC 1 read with full bench decision of this Court in the case of

         
Ram Sevak Yadav and Another vs. The State of Bihar and

         Others
 in C.W.J.C. Nos. 267 and 472 reported in 2013 (1)

         PLJR 964. Therefore, the contentions of the respondents to the

         effect that contractual employee could be treated as adhoc

         employee is impermissible.




 
17. The learned Single Judge proceeded to allow

         the petition of the respondents with reference to decision in the

         case of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation

         Limited and another Versus Brojo Nath Ganguly and

         Another {(1986) 3 SCC 156}. The aforementioned decision is

         distinguishable to the extent that for the purpose of claim of the

         respondents are entitled to M.A.C.P. while counting service of
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            23/28





         contractual service during the intervening period from

         13.12.2006 to 31.03.2015 read with the conditions stipulated in

         the order of regularization and in not questioning Para-9 of the

         modified M.A.C.P. dated 27.05.2013 insofar as replacing the

         certain words "adhoc and contractual employee" in 2010

         M.A.C.P. Schemes/Rules and restricted only to the extent of

         adhoc employees. The cited decision is not applicable in view

         of the of Hon'ble Supreme Court decision in the case of 
Nair

         Service Society vs. Dr. T. Beermasthan
 reported in (2009) 5

         SCC 545. Paragraph No. 48 thereof reads as under:


                                                       "48. Several decisions have
                                                    been cited before us by the
                                                    respondents, but it is well

In     our       opinion        the

                                                     as a block."


                            18.      The      principle        
laid   down      in
         the



         aforementioned case is that before taking note of any judicial

         pronouncement it is for the Court to analyze the factual aspects

         of the matter read with the relevant rules or executive order

         governing particular post.                  In the present case, service

         conditions have been stipulated in the order of regularization. If

         there are any arbitrariness in the condition stipulated in the order

         of regularization, the respondents have failed to question the

         same. Further, they have failed to question modified M.A.C.P.

         dated 27.05.2013 insofar as replacing certain words in

         paragraph-9 of M.A.C.P. 2010 Schemes and it is beneficial to

         only ad hoc employee and not to contractual employee.



 
19. Taking note of these factual aspects as well

         as    the     principle      
laid    down        by
    the   various   judicial

         pronouncements that at no point of time, contractual employees

         services could be counted for service benefits unless and until
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            25/28





         regularization order stipulates that regular employees is entitled

         to count contractual service towards other service benefits.




         Whereas in terms of conditions in the regularization order dated

         31.03.2015, Respondents are not entitled to count contractual

         service towards M.A.C.P. benefits.



                            20.     In the present case, in fact, conditions

         stipulated in the order of the regularization is disadvantage to

         the respondents' members. In other words, whatever the service

         benefits which were to be given to the regular employee like the

         members of the respondents are with prospective effect, namely,

         with effect from 31.03.2015, the date on which their services

         were regularized.

                                  "5. We have heard learned counsel for the
                                  respective parties at length.

                                  At the outset, it is required to be noted and it
                                  is an admitted position that for the period
                                  between 1985 till 31.03.1995 the respondent
                                  served as a casual/contractual employee and
                                  her services came to be regularised as per the
                                  Scheme w.e.f. 31.03.1995. As such, under
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            26/28





                                  the Scheme of Regularisation, there is no
                                  mention that the casual services shall be
                                  counted towards service benefits/ pensionary
                                  benefits. Even as per the clarification issued
                                  by the DOPT in the year 2009, it was
                                  clarified that such appointee is not entitled to
                                  claim any benefit out of the services
                                  rendered by him/her on contractual basis
                                  before he/she was appointed on regular basis
                                  on a government post.

                                  9. Now so far as the submission on behalf of
                                  the respondent that in other departments
                                  under the scheme the employees of such
                                  departments are entitled to their services
                                  rendered as casual/contractual counted for
                                  qualifying service for pensionary/service
                                  benefits is concerned, merely because some
                                  other departments might have such schemes,
                                  the respondent shall not be entitled to the
                                  same benefit in absence of any scheme in the
                                  appellants' department/ department in which
                                  the respondent rendered her services. The
                                  appellant - Doordarshan Prasar Bharti
                                  Corporation of India is an autonomous
                                  independent department/body. As observed
                                  hereinabove, neither the rule nor the
                                  regularisation scheme provide that services
                                  rendered as casual/contractual shall be
                                  treated as temporary service and/or the same
                                  shall be counted for the purposes of
 Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                            27/28





                                  pensionary/ service benefits."



                            In the case of K. Anbazhagan and another cited

         Supra in paragraph 34 aptly applicable to the present case.


                            22. Adhoc/contractual            employee    means    an

         employee, whose services have been engaged for specific

         purpose and for specific period or for work essentially

         temporarily in nature. Further, adhoc means appointment for a

         particular job for adhoc or temporarily employee. The adhoc

         appointments are not contractual. Such a distinction has been

         made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.

         Anbazhagan and another cited Supra decided on 13.08.2018.

         In the cited decision, it is observed that although temporary,

         adhoc and contractual appointment are used in contradiction to a

         regular and permanent appointment but between adhoc and

         contract      appointment,         distinction     is   there   in   service

         jurisprudence         and      both      the     expressions    cannot   be

         interchangeably used.



                            23. Contractual employees whose services are

         regularized on the basis of past temporary service, shall not be

         entitled to any other benefits from the original date of his

         joining on contractual basis or from any other retrospective date

         as is evident from the conditions stipulated in the order of
              Patna High Court L.P.A No.1554 of 2019 dt.31-01-2024

                                                         28/28





                      regularization dated 31.05.2015. As long as those conditions are

                      not questioned before competent forum and such conditions are

                      set aside in such an event only the respondents are entitled to

                      have certain benefits with reference to past contractual service.

                      As on this day whatever the terms and conditions stipulated in

                      the order of regularization dated 31.03.2015 are intact,

                      therefore, the learned Single Judge has committed error in

                      allowing the writ petition.



                                         24. Accordingly, the appellants have made out a

                      case so as to interfere with the order of the learned Single Judge

                      dated 07.08.2019 and it is set aside while rejecting C.W.J.C.

                      No.13542 of 2019.



                                         25. The present L.P.A. stands allowed.



                                                                        (P. B. Bajanthri, J)


                                                                    ( Ramesh Chand Malviya, J)
