                                        Mr. Aditya Singh, learned counsel for the
                                  applicants.

                                        Mr. Deepak Bisht, learned B.H. for the State.
                                        The applicants have filed the present
                                  anticipatory bail applications under 
Section 438

                                  Cr.P.C. for the following common relief:-

 
"To direct that in case the applicant is arrested by
                                        the investigating officer in connection with the FIR
                                        No.83 of 2019 dated 22.08.2019 under 
Section 304B

                                        IPC, P.S. Clementown, District Dehradun
                                        (cognizance taken under 
Section 304B
 IPC vide order
                                        dated 25.01.2021 passed by the learned CJM,
                                        Dehradun, in Criminal Case No.803 of 2021) she
                                        shall be released on bail on any condition which this
                                        Hon'ble Court may set upon the applicant herein.
                                         It is argued by learned counsel for the
                                  applicants that, initially, an FIR was lodged under
                                  
Sections 326
, 
498-A
, 
323
,

,

 IPC and u/s ¾
                                  
D.P. Act
 with P.S. Clementown, District Dehradun
                                  against them; thereafter, they were arrested,
                                  accordingly, bail applications were filed, in which
                                  this Court as well as the Coordinate Bench granted
                                  them bail vide orders dated 06.12.2019 and
                                  15.01.2021 respectively. He further submitted that
                                  after granting the bail, charge sheet was submitted
                                  against the applicants under 
Section 304B
 IPC also;
                                  he submits that since the accused have already been
                                  enlarged on bail in the aforesaid offences;
                                  accordingly, they are also entitled for anticipatory
                                  bail under 
Section 304B
 IPC as well. It is also
                                  submitted by learned counsel for the applicants that,
                                  if any offence is added in the charge sheet, in that
                                  circumstance, the accused will put their appearance
                                  and move an application for granting bail in added
                                  offence also, the concerned court will grant bail in
                                  the added offence i.e. the original bail will continue
                                  in the added offence also, as per the law laid down
 by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the Constitutional
Bench in 
Sushila Aggarwal and Others vs. State
(NCT of Delhi) and Another
, reported in (2020) 5
SCC 1.


      Heard learned counsel for the accused and
learned counsel for the State. I have also gone
through the ruling of the Hon'ble Apex Court.

 
When the matter came up for hearing before
the Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court 
in 
the
above case
 (Supra), in paragraph no.7, following
two questions were framed:-




      "(1) Whether the protection granted to a
      person under 
Section 438
 Cr.P.C. should be
      limited to a fixed period so as to enable the
      person to surrender before the Trial Court
      and seek regular bail.



      (2) Whether the life of an anticipatory bail
      should end at the time and stage when the
      accused is summoned by the court."



       From the perusal of the judgment (supra), it is
clear that the questions framed in the aforesaid
paragraph relate to the anticipatory bail under

Section 438
 Cr.P.C., although, in paragraph no.7.1,
the Hon'ble Apex Court also dealt with 
Sections
437
 and 
439
 Cr.P.C., but in paragraph no.77.1, the
Apex Court clearly held that, 'the observations
about the width and amplitude of the power
under Section 438, made in answer to the first
question, are equally relevant here too'.

       It is clear that the Hon'ble Apex Court
answered the questions framed regarding the
anticipatory bail as envisaged under Section 438
Cr.P.C. and not under Sections 437 and 439 Cr.P.C.

 
Although, the Hon'ble Apex Court also
discussed the judgment rendered in the case of

Pradeep Ram vs. State of Jharkhand and
Another
, reported in (2019) 17 SCC 326, but the
Constitutional Bench of the Apex Court did not
overruled the judgment of 
Pradeep Ram
 (supra).


       Now, it is a settled law, that if the anticipatory
bail is granted, it will continue till the conclusion of
the trial; if some offences were added, then the
 accused will have a right to put his appearance and
move an application in the added offence also, the
concerned Court will enlarge the accused in the
added offence also, and there is no need to file fresh
bail bonds and the anticipatory bail will continue.

       While in the present matter, no such
anticipatory bail was granted to the accused. The
accused were enlarged on regular bail only under

Sections 326
, 
498-A
, 
323
, 
504
, 
506
 IPC and u/s ¾

D.P. Act
, but the charge sheet has subsequently
been submitted under 
Section 304B
 IPC against the
accused; accordingly, the Court cannot direct the
subordinate Court to enlarge the accused on bail on
the same sureties as furnished earlier.

       In these circumstances, the present
anticipatory bail applications are hereby rejected.

       Pending applications, if any, stand disposed
of.
