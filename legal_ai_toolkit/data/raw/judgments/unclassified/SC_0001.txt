PROSECTUION CASE

7.     The prosecution case is that on 25.10.2016, at about 7.30 PM, Jeet
Kumar, the victim was standing with his cousin Ajeet Kumar (PW-7)
outside their house situated in the jhuggi cluster at K Block, Jahangir
Puri, when he expressed a desire to partake chicken. Ajeet suggested that
they should proceed to a chicken shop situated in the A Block Market,
Jahangir Puri. Both of them proceeded on a motorcycle to the chicken
shop (Saleem Chicken Wala), where Jeet stopped his motorcycle to
answer the call of nature. While they were easing themselves, six men
arrived there on two motorcycles. Ajeet recognized them and was aware
of the fact that case FIR No.382/2016 had been registered against them

CRL.A. 717/2018                                                        Page 4 of 28

 on a complaint made by Jeet. Besides the accused, A-1 to A-5, one Ajay
was also present at the spot. The appellant grabbed Jeet by his face and
said "Tu hamare khilaf gawahi dega". Thereafter, all the accused started
beating him. A-5 took out a pistol and fired at Jeet, who was hit by a
bullet on his arm. To save himself, Jeet ran towards a nearby country
liquor shop. All the six accused followed him in hot pursuit. PW-7 also
ran after them. On reaching near the country liquor shop, Jeet was
thrashed by the accused persons, who said "Is sale ko jaan se mar dete
hai, na hoga gawah na hogi gawahi". A-5 fired at the chest of Jeet, who
sustained injuries and fell down on the ground. On seeing this, PW-7
fled from the spot, rushed to his aunt, Bimla (mother of the victim) and
his parents and informed them about the incident. By the time they
reached the scene of crime, Jeet was not present there. PW-7 along with
the family members rushed to BJRM Hospital, where the victim had
been taken.       As no doctor was attending to the victim, his family
members rushed him to Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi where he
was declared „brought dead‟. This incident set into motion the criminal
machinery.

 FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT

19.    The trial court agreed with the argument advanced by the defence
counsel and held that there were several contradictions in the testimony
of PW-7, the sole eye witness, which created doubt about his presence at
the scene of crime and gave a clear impression that the FIR had been ante
timed and he had been introduced later on. In other words, he was not
present at the scene of the crime. The aforesaid conclusion was drawn
on the ground that the conduct of PW-7 was found to be doubtful
particularly, when he claimed to be present at the scene of crime and was
a witness to the accused persons thrashing his cousin but had neither
intervened or tried to save him; nor did he raise an alarm when his cousin
was allegedly beaten up by the accused and they had fired at him. The
trial court further observed that the injured was not removed to the
hospital by PW-7 or any of his relatives but by a third person, one Surya,
resident of Jahangirpuri, whose name was mentioned by the MLC doctor,
PW-1 but he was not arrayed as a prosecution witness though he was the
best person to tell where and how he had found Jeet and taken him to the
hospital.

20.    After discarding the testimony of the sole eye witness (PW-7), the
trial court proceeded to examine the remaining two circumstances,
firstly, fleeing away of the accused on motorcycles from the scene of
crime and secondly, recovery of the weapon of offence, as brought out
by the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. Referring to the
testimonies of the public witnesses, PW-10, PW-11 and PW-12, who had
deposed that they had gone to the spot to purchase liquor, had heard


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                 Page 10 of 28

 sounds of two gunshots and seen the accused persons fleeing from the
spot on two motorcycles, the trial court opined that there were several
inter se contradictions, sufficient to disbelieve the prosecution version
that the aforesaid witnesses had seen the accused persons fleeing from
the scene of the crime immediately after the commission of the offence.
Thus, the first circumstance set up by the prosecution, was rejected
outright.

21.    Coming to the second circumstance relating to the recovery of the
weapon of offence on the disclosure statement made by the appellant and
the co-accused, Sandeep @ Bachha (A-5), the impugned judgment relied
on the testimony of three police witnesses, PW-19, PW-20 and PW-30 to
hold that the said witnesses had fully supported and corroborated each
other for proving recovery of the weapon of offence at the instance of the
appellant. Thereafter, the trial court went on to conclude that recovery of
the weapon of the offence could not be attributed to Sandeep @ Bachha
(A-5) as the recovery had already been effected at the instance of the
appellant herein, before the arrest of A-5. Holding that once the
prosecution had been able to prove the recovery of the weapon of offence
at the instance of the appellant and further, the forensic evidence brought
on record showed that the bullet found in the dead body had been fired
through the said weapon, the said circumstance pointed towards the guilt
of the appellant and accordingly, the learned ASJ convicted him under

Section 302
 IPC while acquitting all the other accused persons.
Aggrieved by the said decision, A-4, the appellant herein has filed the
present appeal.

 ARGUMENTS ADVANCED

22.    The main thrust of the arguments addressed by Mr. Subodh K.
Pathak, learned counsel for the appellant is that the trial court grossly
erred in convicting the appellant under 
Section 302
 IPC solely on the
basis of one circumstance, i.e. recovery of the weapon of offence. He
cited 
Section 26
 of the Indian Evidence Act to contend that the
confession by an accused while in custody of the police is to be treated as
an unreliable evidence and cannot be proved by the prosecution and only
that part of the disclosure statement of the accused can be proved which
relates distinctly to the discovery of evidence consequent upon
information given by him, as contemplated under 
Section 27
 of the Act.
He disputed the stand taken by the prosecution that recovery of the
weapon of offence was made on the appellant‟s disclosure statement and
argued that the said recovery was doubtful and a planted one as the IO
did not prepare the site plan of the place of recovery and further, the
sketch of the pistol and the magazine bears the signatures of only PW-19
and PW-20, both of whom are police witnesses.

23.    It was pointed out that while the appellant had been arrested on
29.12.2016, the recovery of the weapon of offence was allegedly made
two days later, on 31.12.2016 and the weapon of offence was dispatched
to the FSL for a report after a period of two months, i.e. on 1.3.2017, all
of which casts a shadow of doubt on the recovery and the manner in
which the investigation was conducted. Learned counsel also referred to
the disclosure statement of the co-accused, Prateek @ Bholu (A-2) made
on 26.12.2016 wherein, he had stated that he could get the weapon of
offence recovered from Anu, a friend of the appellant and wondered why


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                  Page 12 of 28

 the police did not take any steps to get the weapon recovered at his
instance. He stated that even otherwise, it was the version of the
prosecution itself that the weapon of offence was used by A-5 and fact of
the matter is that the said weapon was falsely planted on the appellant.
Lastly, it was argued that assuming without admitting that the weapon of
offence used by A-5 was recovered on the disclosure made by the
appellant, it is not even the case of the prosecution that he had used the
said weapon of offence to fire at the deceased, for being convicted for his
murder.

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

24.    We have heard the arguments advanced by Mr. Subodh K. Pathak,
learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Amit Gupta, learned APP and
carefully scanned the evidence brought on record in the light of the
findings returned in the impugned judgment.

25.    As noted above, the testimony of the sole eye witness, Ajeet
Kumar (PW-7) was discarded by the trial court on the ground that there
were several inconsistencies in his deposition and it was doubtful if he
was at all present at the scene of the crime. Once the testimony of PW-7
was discarded, all that is left for examination is the circumstantial
evidence. The twin circumstances referred to by the learned ASJ is the
fleeing away by the accused on motorcycles from the scene of crime and
the recovery of the weapon of offence. The first circumstance was
discarded on account of the glaring contradictions in the testimony of the
public witnesses i.e., PW-10, PW-11 and PW-12, who claimed that they
had heard sounds of gunshots being fired and had witnessed the accused




CRL.A. 717/2018                                                  Page 13 of 28

 persons fleeing away from the scene of crime. The only other
circumstance relates to the recovery of the weapon of offence.

26.    Considering the fact that at no stage did the prosecution project a
case that it was the appellant, who had fired at the deceased, rather it was
their consistent stand that it was A-5, who had taken out a pistol from his
possession and fired at the victim on his chest and he had succumbed to
the said injuries, we are left wondering as to where was the occasion for
the trial court to have convicted the appellant for the offence under

Section 302
 IPC on the ground of recovery of the weapon of offence?
The only role allegedly attributed to the appellant in the entire incident
was that he had grabbed the victim by his face and thrashed him by
saying that "Tu hamare khilaf gawahi dega". Thereafter, the appellant
alongwith the other accused persons had started beating Jeet, who tried to
save himself by running towards a nearby country liquor shop. On
reaching near the said country liquor shop, the appellant and the other
accused persons had again caught hold of Jeet and thrashed him. The
prosecution version has consistently been that it was A-5, who had taken
out a pistol and fired at Jeet. That being the admitted case of the
prosecution throughout and the trial court having acquitted A-5 for the
offence punishable under 
Section 302
 IPC, the conviction of the
appellant for the said offence is not sustainable only on the basis of
alleged recovery of the weapon of offence on his disclosure statement.

27.    We are, therefore, in complete agreement with the submission
made by learned counsel for the appellant that there was no occasion for
the trial court to have convicted the appellant on the sole circumstance of
recovery of the weapon of offence on the basis of his disclosure


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                   Page 14 of 28

 statement when, it was never the prosecution case that the appellant was
the one, who was in possession of the pistol on that day and had fired at
the deceased with the said weapon.        When as per the case of the
prosecution, A-5 was in possession of the weapon of offence and he had
fired on the deceased, it is hard to digest that A-5 would have handed it
over to the appellant.

28.    The view expressed above is also fortified on a scrutiny of the
questions put to the appellant under 
Section 313
 Cr.PC. It was not the
version of the prosecution that he had pulled out a pistol and fired at the
deceased. The only circumstance alleged against the appellant was
regarding his presence at the scene of the crime alongwith the co-
accused, where he had allegedly threatened the deceased and given him
kicks and fist blows. In fact, it was the case of the prosecution that A-5
had pulled out a pistol and fired on the chest of the deceased whereafter,
the appellant and the other co-accused had fled from the spot on
motorcycles. A specific suggestion on these lines was made to the said
effect to A-5, while recording his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.

NO SUBSTANTIVE CHARGE FRAMED                           AGAINST         THE
APPELLANT UNDER SECTION 302 IPC

29.    Though no argument has been advanced before us by the learned
counsel for the appellant on the absence of a substantive charge framed
against the appellant under 
Section 302
 IPC, we would be failing in our
duty if we overlook the said error committed by the trial court. A glance
at the charges framed against the accused, as reproduced hereinabove,
clearly brings out that all the accused were charged for harbouring a
common intention of causing the death of the deceased, an eye witness in


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                  Page 15 of 28

 case FIR No.382/2016, PS Mahindra Park, for the offence punishable
under 
Section 302
 IPC read with 
Section 34
 IPC. No substantive charge
was framed against any of the accused individually. Considering the fact
that the remaining accused, A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-5 have been acquitted
for the offence under 
Section 302
 IPC and their acquittal has not been
challenged by the State by filing an appeal, and further, taking note of the
fact that all the accused were collectively charged for the offence under

Section 302
 IPC read with 
Section 34
 IPC and not individually, it is not
understood as to how could the appellant be convicted under 
Section 302

IPC simpliciter. This, in our opinion, is an error that goes to the root of
the matter.



30.    The patent fallacy of convicting an accused for a substantive
offence without there being any charge framed against him, has been
repeatedly highlighted by the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions. 
In

Nanak Chand vs. State of Punjab
 reported as AIR 1955 SC 274, the
appellant along with six other co-accused had been charged for
committing offences under Section 148 and Section 302 read with

Section 149
 IPC and the trial court had acquitted three of the six accused
while convicting the appellant therein and three others for the offences
referred to hereinabove. In the appeal filed against 
the said judgment
, the
High Court had acquitted three of the remaining accused of the offence
under 
Section 302
 IPC read with 
Section 34
 IPC but convicted the
appellant alone for the substantive offence under 
Section 302
 IPC. In
view of the fact that no separate charge had been framed by the trial
court under 
Section 302
 IPC, the Supreme Court held that the High Court
could not have convicted the appellant for the said offence. Rejecting the

CRL.A. 717/2018                                                   Page 16 of 28

 plea of the prosecution that non-framing of a substantive charge against
the appellant was an error in framing of charge that was a curable
irregularity, it was held as follows:-




            "13...................In the present case, however, there
            is no question of any error, omission or
            irregularity in the charge because no charge under
            
section 302
 of the Indian Penal Code was in fact
            framed. 
Section 232
 of the Code of Criminal
            Procedure permits an appellate court or a court of
            revision, if satisfied that any person convicted of
            an offence was misled in his defence in the absence
            of a charge or by an error in the charge, to direct
            a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in
            whatever manner it thinks fit. In the present case
            we are of the opinion that there was an illegality
            and not an irregularity curable by the provisions
            of 
sections 535
 and 
537
 of the Code of Criminal
            Procedure. Assuming, however, for a moment
            that there was merely an irregularity which was
            curable we are satisfied that, in the circum-
            stances of the present case, the irregularity is not
            curable because the appellant was misled in his
            defence by the absence of a charge under 
section
            302
 of the Indian Penal Code.

            14.        By framing a charge under section 302,
            read with 
section 149
 of the Indian Penal Code
            against the appellant, the Court indicated that it
            was not charging the appellant with the offence of
            murder and to convict him for murder and
            sentence him under 
section 302
 of the Indian
            Penal Code was to convict him of an offence with
            which he had not been charged. In defending
            himself the appellant was not called upon to meet
            such a charge and in his defence he may well
            have considered it unnecessary to concentrate on
            that part of the prosecution case............."

                                                  (emphasis added)

CRL.A. 717/2018                                                         Page 17 of 28


 31.    
In 
Suraj Pal vs. State of U.P.
 reported as AIR 1955 SC 419, where
twenty accused including the appellant therein had been charged with
offences under 
Sections 147
, 
323
/
149
, 
307
/
149
 and 
302
/
149
 IPC and
held guilty by the trial court, in the appeal, the High Court set aside the
conviction of ten of the co-accused.        As for the remaining ten co-
accused, the High Court opined that nine of them could only be
convicted under 
Sections 323
/
149
 IPC, thus leaving the appellant therein,
who alone was held guilty of the substantive offence under Section 307
and 
Section 302
 IPC. The said decision was challenged by the appellant
before the Supreme Court that held that once specific charges had been
framed, which referred to all the accused having acted together with a
common intention of firing upon the deceased and there was no
amendment to the charge, the appellant could not have been convicted
for the substantive charge for the offence under 
Sections 302
 and 
307

IPC as if he was acting alone. Holding that such a course of action was
not legitimate, the Supreme Court observed as follows:-




            "4......................The appellant might well have
            relied on the absence of any such amendment as
            being an indication that he was not called upon to
            defend himself on the footing of his being the
            author of the pistol fire. In a case so serious as
            that which involves the sentences of
            transportation for life, and of death, and
            particularly in a case like the present one, where
            the death sentence has been awarded in the trial
            court by distinguishing this appellant from all the
            other accused in respect of his individual act by
            way of pistol fire, it is difficult to say that the
            accused has not been prejudiced by the absence



CRL.A. 717/2018                                                     Page 18 of 28

             of specific charges under 
sections 307
 and 
302
,
            Indian Penal Code.

            5.        Further, the medical evidence indicates
            that P.W. 2 as well as the deceased Surajdin had
            gun-shot wounds on their person. The evidence of
            the Doctor is to the effect that these wounds may
            have been caused by a country pistol which, it is
            alleged, the appellant had in his hand. It has been
            suggested on behalf of the defence that the
            Medical Officer was not competent to speak about
            it and that if the prosecution wanted to rely
            thereupon, they should have called an arms expert
            to speak to the same. Whether or not this comment
            is legitimate, it is clear that if the appellant is to be
            found directly responsible for inflicting the
            wounds, noted as gun-shot wounds by the Medical
            Officer, he might well have availed himself of the
            opportunity to elucidate, by cross-examination or
            positive defence, the nature of the firearm which
            would have caused the actual injuries found on the
            bodies of PW-2 and of deceased Surajdin. In all
            the circumstances above noticed, we are satisfied
            that the absence of specific charges against the
            appellant under 
sections 307
 and 
302
, Indian
            Penal Code has materially prejudiced him. We
            must accordingly set aside the convictions and
            sentences of the appellant under 
sections 307
 and
            
302
 of the Indian Penal Code.............."

            (emphasis added)


32.    
In 
Krishna Govind Patil vs. State of Maharashtra
 reported as AIR
1963 SC 1413, which is case of Section 302 read with 
Section 34
 IPC,
the Supreme Court made the following observations:-




      "8.......While it acquitted Accused 1, 3 and 4 under Section
      302, read with 
Section 34
 of the Indian Penal Code, it
      convicted Accused 2 under Section 302, read with 
Section 34
,

CRL.A. 717/2018                                                         Page 19 of 28

       of the said Code, for having committed the offence jointly with
      the acquitted persons. That is a legally impossible position.
      When accused were acquitted either on the ground that the
      evidence was not acceptable or by giving benefit of doubt to
      them, the result in law would be the same: it would mean that
      they did not take part in the offence. The effect of the acquittal
      of Accused 1, 3 and 4 is that they did not conjointly act with
      Accused 2 in committing the murder. If they did not act
      conjointly with Accused 2, Accused 2 could not have acted
      conjointly with them......."



33.    
In 
Baul and Another vs. State of U.P.
 reported as AIR 1968 SC
728, there were three accused charged with the offence under 
Sections
302
/
34
 IPC and the Sessions Court convicted all of them. In the appeal,
the High Court acquitted one of the accused and altered the sentence of
the other accused to Section 325 read with 
Section 109
 IPC. But the
conviction of the third accused was altered from 
Sections 302
/
34
 IPC to

Section 302
 IPC simpliciter. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal of
the third accused by making the following observations:-




      "7. No doubt the original prosecution case showed that
      Sadhai and Ramdeo both hit the deceased on the head with
      their lathies. One is tempted to divide the two fatal injuries
      between the two assailants and to hold that one each was
      caused by them. If there was common intention established
      in the case the prosecution would not have been required to
      prove which of the injuries was caused by which assailant.
      But when common intention is not proved the prosecution
      must establish the exact nature of the injury caused by
      each accused and more so in this case when one of the
      accused has got the benefit of the doubt and has been
      acquitted. It cannot, therefore, be postulated that Sadhai
      alone caused all the injuries on the head of the deceased.
      Once that position arises the doubt remains as to whether


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                    Page 20 of 28

       the injuries caused by Sadhai were of the character which
      would bring his case within Section 302. It may be that the
      effect of the first blow became more prominent because
      another blow landing immediately after it caused more
      fractures to the skull than the first blow had caused. These
      doubts prompt us to give the benefit of doubt to Sadhai. We
      think that his conviction can be safely rested under 
Section
      325
 of the Indian Penal Code, but it is difficult to hold in a
      case of this type that his guilt amounts to
      murder simpliciter because he must be held responsible for
      all the injuries that were caused to the deceased. We convict
      him instead of Section 302 for an offence under 
Section 325

      of the Indian Penal Code and set aside the sentence of
      imprisonment for life and instead sentence him to rigorous
      imprisonment for seven years."



34.    A similar view was expressed by the Supreme Court in 
Subran @
Subramanian vs. State of Kerala
 reported as (1993) 3 SCC 32, as
follows:-


            "11. Since, appellant 1 Subran had not been
            charged for the substantive offence of murder
            under 
Section 302
 IPC, even the trial court, which
            tried the six accused persons, was not justified in
            recording a conviction against him for the
            substantive offence of murder punishable under
            
Section 302
 IPC after framing a charge against
            him for the offence under Section 302 read with
            
Section 149
 IPC only. A person charged for an
            offence under 
Section 302
 IPC read with Section
            149 cannot be convicted, of the substantive
            offence under 
Section 302
, IPC without a specific
            charge having been framed against him as
            envisaged by law. Conviction for the substantive
            offence in such a case is unjustified because an
            accused might be misled in his defence by the
            absence of the charge for the substantive offence


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                   Page 21 of 28

             under 
Section 302
 IPC simpliciter and, therefore,
            in defending himself, he cannot be said to have
            been called upon to meet that charge and he
            could very well have considered it unnecessary to
            concentrate on that part of the prosecution case
            during the cross-examination of the prosecution
            witnesses. Therefore, the conviction of the first
            appellant for an offence under Section 302 was
            not permissible." (emphasis added)



35.    Again in 
State of West Bengal vs. Vindu Lachman Das Sakhrani @
Deru
 reported as 1995 SCC (Crl) 175, a case where both, husband and
wife were charged for committing an offence under 
Sections 302
/
34
 IPC
and the husband was acquitted but the wife was convicted for the
substantive offence, the Supreme Court reiterated its stand that there
being no charge under 
Section 302
 IPC simpliciter against the wife, she
could not have been convicted and in the following words:-




            "4. .................Both
                               husband and wife were charged
            with an offence under Section 302 read with
            
Section 34
 I.P.C. The charge which was based on
            the common intention of the two failed with the
            acquittal of the husband and there being no charge
            under Section 302 simpliciter against the wife she
            could not be convicted. In any case there is no
            evidence on the record to show that she
            independently committed the offence."



36.    
In 
Nallabothu Venkaiah vs. State of A.P.
 reported as (2002) 7 SCC
117, the Supreme Court was faced with two questions of law. Firstly,
whether the appellant could be convicted under 
Section 302
 IPC without
the aid of 
Section 149
 IPC, in the absence of any substantive charge

CRL.A. 717/2018                                                  Page 22 of 28

 under 
Section 302
 IPC. Secondly, whether the appellant could be
convicted under 
Sections 302
/
149
 IPC on selfsame evidence on the basis
of which other accused were acquitted. After analyzing a catena of earlier
decisions on the above aspect, the law was distilled in the following
words:-




      "24. On an analytical reading of a catena of decisions of
      this Court, the following broad proposition of law clearly
      emerges: (a) the conviction under Section 302 simpliciter
      without aid of Section 149 is permissible if overt act is
      attributed to the accused resulting in the fatal injury which is
      independently sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
      cause the death of the deceased and is supported by medical
      evidence; (b) wrongful acquittal recorded by the High Court,
      even if it stood, that circumstances would not impede the
      conviction of the appellant under Section 302 read with
      
Section 149
 IPC; (c) charge under Section 302 with the aid
      of Section 149 could be converted into one under Section
      302 read with 
Section 34
 if the criminal act done by several
      persons less than five in number in furtherance of common
      intention is proved."



37.    In Koppula Jagdish @ Jagdish vs. State of A.P. reported as (2005)
12 SCC 425, three accused persons were charged under Section 302 read
with 
Section 34
 IPC for sharing a common intention to commit the
murder of the victim. The trial court convicted all the three accused. In
the appeal, the High Court acquitted two of the accused and the
conviction of the third accused was modified from Section 302 read with

Section 34
 IPC to 
Section 302
 IPC simpliciter. In the above facts, the
Supreme Court observed as under:-

      "3. Undisputedly, all the three accused persons were charged
      under Section 302 read with 
Section 34
 IPC for sharing
      common intention to commit murder of the victim. The other

CRL.A. 717/2018                                                    Page 23 of 28

       two accused persons as stated above, have been already
      acquitted by the High Court. There is neither any allegation
      nor evidence that the appellant alone inflicted all the
      injuries or the fatal one. This being the position, the
      appellant could not have been convicted under Section 302
      simpliciter but could have been convicted only with the aid
      of 
Section 34
 IPC, which also is not possible in the case in
      hand as the other two accused persons with whom he could
      have shared the common intention have been already
      acquitted by the High Court. In our view, the High Court was
      not justified in convicting the appellant under 
Section 302

      IPC."



38.    
In Annareddy Sambasiva Reddy & Ors. Vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh reported as (2009) 12 SCC 546, placing reliance on its earlier
decisions in 
Surajpal
 (supra), 
Pandurang, Tukia and Bhillia vs. State of
Hyderabad
 reported as (1955) 1 
SCR 1083 and Nanak Chand
 (supra)
referred to 
Section 464
 of the Cr.P.C., which deals with the fact of
omission of framing, or absence of, or error in charge, the Supreme Court
held that no straightjacket formula can be applied and every case must
depend on its merits. The essential and important aspect to be kept in
mind is:- has omission to frame a specific charge resulted in prejudice to
the accused.




39.    In the instant case too, it is an admitted position that no separate
charge was framed against the appellant for the substantive offence under

Section 302
 IPC. Once charges were framed by the trial court against all
the accused collectively and not individually and no effort was made by
the prosecution to approach the trial court for amending the charges as
framed, the appellant alone could not have been convicted for a

 substantive offence under 
Section 302
 IPC. This is an illegality which is
not curable in the circumstances of the present case as in the absence of
any substantive charge framed against him under 
Section 302
 IPC, the
appellant was misled in his defence.



40.    Moreover, there is no direct evidence against the appellant for
upholding his conviction under 
Section 302
 IPC. Mere recovery of the
weapon of offence at the instance of the appellant cannot be the sole
premise on which a judgment of conviction under 
Section 302
 IPC could
be recorded. It is too slender an evidence to hold him guilty of such an
offence. This is particularly so when the fifth accused, who as per the
prosecution, is the one who had pulled out the pistol and fired at the
deceased, has been acquitted by the learned ASJ.         There is also no
explanation as to why despite the second accused, who was arrested on
26.12.2016, three days before the appellant was arrested, stated in his
disclosure statement that he could get the weapon of offence recovered
from a third person, no steps were taken in that direction. In the absence
of any other evidence connecting the appellant with the commission of
the murder of the deceased, the trial court could not have proceeded to
convict him for the offence under 
Section 302
 IPC while proceeding to
acquit the remaining accused. For the aforesaid reason too, the impugned
judgment is unsustainable, being contrary to the settled legal position and
is accordingly quashed and set aside alongwith the order on sentence.



41.    Before parting with this case, we would also like to highlight
another disturbing feature i.e., the lapse on the part of the trial court in
omitting to frame a charge against the appellant and the fifth accused for


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                  Page 25 of 28

 the offence under 
Section 25
 of the Arms Act, particularly when the
original charge-sheet and the supplementary charge-sheet filed in the
present     case   specifically   refer   to   the   provisions   of    
Sections
302
/
411
/
120B
/
34
 IPC and 
Section 25
/
27
 of the Arms Act. Vide order
dated 5.4.2017, the trial court had framed the charge against all the
accused except for the fifth accused, Sandeep @ Bachha, who was yet to
be arrested, under 
Section 302
 IPC read with 
Section 34
 IPC, without
making any reference to 
Sections 25
 and 
27
 of the Arms Act. Even at the
stage of amending the original charge vide order dated 19.5.2017, on
account of an error in recording the correct FIR number wherein the
deceased was an eye witness, the prosecution failed to point out that no
charge had been framed under 
Sections 25
/
27
 of the Arms Act, nor did
the trial court notice this omission or take any step to amend the charge.
The third occasion for amending the charge arose when the fifth accused
was finally apprehended and a supplementary charge-sheet was filed
against him. Vide order dated 30.8.2017, charge was famed against the
said accused, who as per the prosecution version, had taken out a pistol
and fired at the chest of the deceased. Yet again, no charge was framed
against him under 
Sections 25
/
27
 of the Arms Act. Even the sanction
order dated 31.7.2017 under 
Section 39
 of the Arms Act for prosecution
of the appellant and A-5 were not taken into account by the learned ASJ
for framing the charge against them under 
Sections 25
/
27
 of the Arms
Act. Ironically, this lapse went undetected not only by the learned ASJ,
but also by the learned APP even during the course of the trial when PW-
27, the sanctioning authority had appeared and testified that she had
accorded sanction under 
Section 39
 of the Arms Act for the prosecution


CRL.A. 717/2018                                                        Page 26 of 28

 of the appellant and A-5 under 
Section 25
 of the Arms Act and the
ballistic expert witnesses, PW-22, PW-24 and PW-25 had appeared and
proved their reports in respect of the weapon of offence, the empty
cartridge etc. As a result of this negligence on the part of the prosecution
and omission on the part of the trial court, no charge came to be framed
against the appellant and A-5 under 
Sections 25
/
27
 of the Arms Act,
which can only be described as a colossal blunder. Such a casual manner
of framing the charge is a matter of serious concern.



42.    To sum up, here is a case where the appellant has been convicted
under 
Section 302
 IPC without any foundation laid for the said offence
and though evidence was led by the prosecution for proving the charge
under 
Sections 25
/
27
 of the Arms Act, it could not yield any result in the
absence of any charge framed against the appellant and A-5 for the said
offence, due to gross negligence on the part of the prosecution,
compounded by the oversight attributable to the trial court. It is
noteworthy that the case was assigned to a Pilot Court and it was the
same Judicial Officer who had framed the charge and conducted the trial
to finally deliver the impugned judgment of conviction.



43.    As a result of the above discussion, the appeal is allowed. The
impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence qua the appellant
are quashed and set aside. The appellant is acquitted for the offence
punishable under 
Section 302
 IPC and is directed to be released
forthwith, unless required to be detained in any other case. The bail bond
and surety bond offered by him stand discharged. The appellant shall
fulfill the requirements of 
Section 437-A
 of the Cr.P.C. at the earliest.

 44.    The appeal is disposed of. Trial court record be sent back forthwith
alongwith a certified copy of this judgment. The Registry shall forward a
copy of this judgment to the concerned ACR Committee of the learned
ASJ for perusal.
