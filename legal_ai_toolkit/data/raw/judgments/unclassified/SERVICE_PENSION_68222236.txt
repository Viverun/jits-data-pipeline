In all the above appeals, the respondents as complainants filed
complaints before the District Forum against the appellant claiming certain
relief. The District Forum allowed the
complaints against the opposite party and passed a common order. Against the said impugned order, this appeal
is preferred praying to set aside the order of the District Forum dt.29.9.2006
in COP.NO.263/2001 to COP No.406/2001 

 

   

 

 M.
THANIKACHALAM J, PRESIDENT.  


 

  

 


1. The opposite party in all the above
complaints, are the appellants.  


 

  

 


2. This common order shall dispose of all
the above appeals.  


 

  

 


3. The
respondents in all the above appeals, as complainant, independently filed the
complaints, seeking direction against the opposite parties; 



1.                 
To
pay 18% interest on the delayed disbursement of commuted amount, 

 

  

 


2.                 
For
a sum of Rs.5000/- towards expenses incurred in making complaints to the
opposite party, 

 

  

 


3.                 
For
a sum of Rs.1 lakh as compensation, for mental agony and suffering, caused due
to deficiency in service and 

 

  

 


4.                 
For
cost,  

 

  

 

on the
following grounds  

 

  

 

  

 


4. The complainants, who were the employees
of the opposite party bank, opted for voluntary retirement, under the VRS 2000
scheme, then retired from service on various dates, (as indicated in each
complaint, for which annexure is also given in the judgement of the District
Forum). The opposite party, while
calculating the pension, has not given notional addition of 5 years weightage,
as per Regulation 29(5) of the Indian Bank Employees Pension Regulations
1995. Further pension was also not
calculated on the complainants Last Pay drawn basic, including gratuity,
Provident Fund, etc. Pension was not
given immediately after one month, whereas after the lapse of several months,
pension and gratuity were given. For the
delayed payment of pension, as well gratuity, interest was also not given.  


 

  

 


5. The complainants, though given letters,
immediately for commutation, amount was given after the delay of several
months. The opposite party should have
paid the interest for the delayed commutation, or they should have paid full
pension, till the credit of commutation amount, which they failed, should be
construed as deficiency in service. Because of the delayed payment, the
complainants were compelled to borrow money to meet the day today expenses,
thereby they have been put to undue mental agony and suffering. Despite representation by the complainants,
on various dates, the opposite party failed to rectify the defects, which also
should be construed as deficiency in service.
Therefore, the opposite party should be directed to pay the amount, as
indicated in the complaints, and for this purpose, complaints were filed.  


 

  

 


6. The appellant/opposite party, filing a
detailed version in OP.No.309/2001, adopted the same, in other complaints, and
brief facts pertaining to the cases as follows: 


 

  

 


7. The dispute raised in all the complaints
is between the employer and employee, and in this view the complainants are
neither consumers nor the opposite party is a service provider. Therefore, the complainants will not come
within the meaning of consumer, and the service said to be rendered by the
opposite party also will not come within the meaning of service, which should
follow the complainants are not at all maintainable.  


 

  

 


8. The various averments in the complaint,
would prove that the dispute is between the employer and employee, regarding
the alleged benefits accrued in the service, which will not come within the
definition of service, as ruled by the   Apex Court, as well as by
the National Commission, including various State Commissions. There was no service rendered by the bank,
since the definition for service does not include, the rendering of any service
free of charge or under the contract of personal service. The voluntary retirement cannot be considered
as falling within the scope of the term service
and it is purely a scheme made between the employer and employee. The complainant in OP.309/2001, being the
President of Indian Bank Voluntary Retirers Welfare Association, filed Writ
Petitions, before the Honble High Court, for the same reliefs, which was
suppressed in the complaints, in order to mislead the Consumer Fora.  


 

  

 


9. There was mass voluntary retirement of
3294 employees, during the short span of period, and while calculating the
pension and other benefits, the delay was very negligible, which cannot be
termed as wanton delay. There is no
provision for payment of interest, under the Pension Regulation, and in this
view, the claim of interest is baseless. No prejudice has been caused to the
complainant in commuting the commutation w.e.f. the date of retirement, since
the pension can be restored after 15 years from the date of retirement. The other allegations are denied as
false. The complainant has not availed
any service from the bank, and
therefore, there is no deficiency in service also. Hence it is prayed all the complaints may be
dismissed with cost.  


 

  

 


10. The District Forum, Chennai (North), after
receiving affidavits from the parties, marking certain documents, receiving
written arguments, hearing either side, analysed the rival contentions,
elaborately. The deliberation let to the
conclusion, that the reliefs sought for by the complainants, are not relating
to any retirement benefits, or dispute in the service condition, that the
complainants are consumers, as contemplated in the 
Consumer Protection Act,
1986
, herein after called the Act, that the Fora has got jurisdiction to
adjudicate the dispute, raised before the Consumer Fora, that for the delayed
payment of commutation, all the complainants are entitled to interest at 18%
p.a., and the, starting date should be arrived at as per the regulations. On the basis of the above findings, the
following directions were issued by the District Forum, as per the order
dt.29.6.2006, directing the opposite party 

 


1.
to pay 18% interest for the
delayed payment of commuted pension as per the rules and regulations, till the
date of filing of the complaint, and the date should be arrived as per the
regulations. 


 

  

 


2.                 
to
pay damage of Rs.3000/-, towards
expenses made by them. 


 

  

 


3.                 
to
pay a sum of Rs.15000/- to each complainant under the heading rendering
deficiency in service, which caused mental agony and other kind of sufferings,
and  

 

  

 


4.                 
to
pay a cost of Rs.2500/- to each complainant. 


 

  

 


The above
directions caused grievance and the result is above appeals, against all the
complaints. 


 

  

 


11. The complainants though claimed more
compensation and more expenses, the District Forum has not conceded in
entirety, except interest. For the negativing
portion of the claim, the aggrieved complainants, have not preferred any
independent appeals, though a feeble attempt was made in the written statement
to enhance the amount, which may not be possible, generally, unless separate
appeals are filed.  


 

  

 


12. Heard the learned senior counsel Mr. A.L.Somayaji,
appearing for appellant as well as the counsel for the respondents, perused the
written submission in addition to the documents filed by them, order of the
District Forum, and also the rulings relied on by the parties.  



13. The learned senior counsel, appearing
for the appellant, to upset the findings of the District Forum in all the complaints,
urged on three grounds, viz.  



 1. that the complainants are not consumers as
defined under 
Sec.2(1)(d)
 of the Act and the payment of pension made under the
terms of contract of personal service, will not come within the definition
under 
Sec.2(1)(o)
.  


 

  

 


2.           
that
even after the complainants retired voluntarily, the relationship between them
and the bank has not come to an end, and therefore if at all they have to
agitate their right under the 
Industrial Dispute Act
, since the benefit claimed
in all the complaints are retiral benefits. 


 

  

 


3.           
that
the contract of personal service continues to subsist, even after the voluntary
retirement, and therefore they should be construed as employees as defined
under Regulation 
Regulation 2(1)
 of the Pension Regulations. 


 

  

 

  

 


Elaborating the
above points, taking us to various decisions of the Apex court, as well as the
National Commission, including State Commissions, a strenuous submission was
made to eclipse the findings of the District Forum, for which, the ultimate
prayer was allowing all the appeals.  


 

  

 


14. The learned counsel for complainants/
respondents, on the other hand submitted, that after the voluntary retirement,
which was accepted, the relationship between the complainants and the bank has
come to an end, or the relationship of master and servant ceased to exist, and
therefore it is not necessary for the complainants, to approach anyother forum,
for relief. It is the further submission
of the learned counsel for the
respondents/complainants, that the benefits claimed in all the complaints, are
not retiral benefits, under Pension Regulations such as for calculation of
pension, or for gratuity or something like that, whereas the claims made in all
the complaints relate to claim of interest, for the delayed payment of commutation
amount, for compensation, due to deficiency in service, and therefore there is
no necessity for the complainant to go elsewhere and the Forum chosen by them,
is having enormous jurisdiction, which cannot be denied. It is the further submission of the learned
counsel that pension is paid recognizing the past service, and it is not gratis
or free payment, and therefore the past service should be construed as
consideration, and in this view, the service expected to be served by the bank
should come within the definition of service under the Act, as well the
complainants also should come within the meaning of consumers. The learned counsel
elaborately arguing on the above points, took much pain to project a case of
acceptance, relying on mostly   Apex Court rulings,
supported by rulings rendered by National Commission also.  


 

  

 


15. By going through the written
submissions, and the decisions brought to our notice, in depth, as well as the
factual aspects of the case, giving our anxious thought, and taking into
consideration the purpose of enacting the 
Consumer Protection Act
, we are
constrained and convinced to accept the submissions of the learned counsel for
the complainants, since in our view the submissions are supported by the ratio,
laid down by the Apex Court.  


 

  

 


16. The respondents were the employees of
the appellant bank, not in dispute, and they opted for voluntary retirement in
VRS 2000 scheme, announced by the bank, is also not under challenge. As detailed in the complaints, all the complainants
were retired from service, under the above said scheme on various dates, as
available in the annexure attached with the District Forum judgement also. All the complainants are entitled to pension,
gratuity etc., as provided under Indian Bank (Employees) Pension Regulation
1995, including commutation amount, on their option, which they did also. In order to provide pension benefits, and
other benefits, admittedly the opposite party has created Indian Bank
(Employees) Pension Fund, and to the said fund, contributions were also made
by the Bank, at the rate prescribed under the said regulations. The Bank/ opposite party, alone is the
competent authority to calculate the pension, gratuity, commutation, etc., and
they are not controlled by anyother external agency, and in this view, the bank
alone is answerable to its ex-employees, whether they retired on superannuation
or under voluntary scheme. The
complainants in all the cases having retired voluntarily, they are entitled to
pension, gratuity commutation of pension, are also not under challenge. 


 

  

 


17. In all the complaints, though the
complainants have stated that while calculating the pension, notional addition
of 5 years weightage was not given, on that basis admittedly they have not
claimed any relief in the complaints.
The complaints are not aimed to refix the pension or to calculate the
gratuity or anyother retiral benefits.
Therefore, at any stretch of imagination, as rightly submitted by the
learned counsel, the complainants are not claiming any retiral benefits, before
the Consumer Forum. The main grievance
of the complainants, appears to be that, within the reasonable time, as per the
regulations, immediately pension was not paid, commuted value of the pension also was not
paid, and till the commuted value was deposited, full pension was also not
paid, which are also admitted facts. At
later point of time, say with 3 or 4 months delay, amounts were paid to all the
complainants. Under the pension scheme,
the pensioners are entitled to commute the pension, in this way here also all
the complainants, sought for commutation, amount fixed, not paid
forthwith. As said in the written
submission, since many people had gone under the VRS scheme at a time,
naturally there would be delay, and in this view, here also delay had taken
place, for which, generally we cannot blame.
Butwhen the delay was caused, whether it was administrative delay or
otherwise, the retired employees benefits were deprived of. Therefore, they have claimed interest, which
we will discuss at later stage. When commutation
of pension was calculated, commuted amount was not paid, ordinarily till the
commuted amount is paid, or deposited in the account of the retired employee, full
pension should be paid. If full pension
is not paid, reduced pension, as per the commutation was later paid, as in this
case, then they should be compensated by paying interest, for the commuted
amount, and this is the prayer made in all the case. This claim, though in a way connected with
retirement, it will not come as retiral benefit directly, since for the
deficiency said to have been committed by the bank, interest as well as
compensation are claimed, for which admittedly, there is no provision in the
Pension Regulations. Therefore, all the
complainants have approached the Consumer For a and the jurisdiction is under
challenge.  


 

  

 


18.  In this context we have to see the
definition for consumer and service. 



 
Sec. 2(1)(d)(ii)
 defines: 



 Consumer means any person who hires or
avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or
partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and
includes any beneficiary of such services other than the person who (hires or
avails of) the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid or
partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such services
are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person 

 

  

 

It is the
submission of the learned senior counsel for the appellant, that the
complainants have not paid any consideration, to avail any service, and
therefore, they will not come within the meaning of consumer, which is
questioned, challenged. 



 
Sec.2(1)(o)
 defines Service as  

 

 Service means service of any description,
which is made available to potential (users and includes, but not limited to,
the provision of) facilities in connection with banking, financing, insurance,
transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, boarding or
lodging or both (housing construction) entertainment, amusement or the
purveying of news or other information, but does not include the rendering of
any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service. 


 

  

 


The last sentence
would indicate, if the service is free of charge, or under a contract of
personal service, that will not come within the meaning of service, thereby
ousting the jurisdiction of Consumer Fora.
Therefore, we have to see, whether there was any consideration paid by
the complainant, whatever may be its form, to bring them within the meaning of
consumer, and whether the opposite party has to render service as given in the
definition. If these two conditions are
fulfilled, then there would be no difficulty, to exercise jurisdiction, by the
consumer Fora.  


 

  

 


19. In the Pension Regulations or in
anyother Act, under which the parties will come, there is no prohibition or
bar, to exercise jurisdiction, under the 
Consumer Protection Act
. In other words, either impliedly or expressly,
the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum, is not excluded under the Pension
Regulations also. 
The Act
, as repeatedly
held by the Apex Court, was enacted to have an easy access of justice, speedy
in nature, less expensive, in addition to the benefits available in anyother
Act, which is incorporated so in 
Sec.3
, which says Act not in derogation of anyother law thereby making it
clear, even if anyother provisions are available under anyother Act elsewhere,
unless it is barred specifically, the benevolent provisions of this Act, has to
be extended to the person who seeks the help, which is the dictum of the Apex
Court.  


 

  

 


20. The Apex Court, in 
Kishore Lal Vs. Chairman,
Employees State Insurance Corporation
 reported in AIR 2007 SC 1819, had
an occasion to consider the applicability of the Act, with reference to 
Employees
State Insurance Act, 1948
.
 
Considering
the previous judicial pronouncement, wherein it is observed the Act being a
beneficial legislation, should receive liberal consideration, then further
saying referring 
Secretary, Thirumurugan
Cooperative Agricultural Credit Society Vs. M. Lalitha and Ors
, that The court had gone to the
extent of saying that if two different fora have jurisdiction to entertain the
dispute in regard to the same subject, the jurisdiction of the consumer forum
would not be barred, and the power of the consumer forum to adjudicate upon the
dispute could not be negated. It is not the case
of anybody, that this kind of case is barred under any provisions of this Act,
or anyother law, though barred, as claimed by the learned senior counsel on
behalf of the appellant, considering the definition for service and consumer,
which we will deal hereafter at appropriate time.



 

  

 


21. The submission of the learned counsel
for complainants, that the past service rendered by the complainants, which
created a right to claim pension, is the consideration to come as consumer
under 
sec. 2(1)(d)
Iii), cannot be so easily ignored, since the Bank is
providing retirement benefits to its employees, on the basis of the past
service alone. Now, it is the settled
position of law, as declared by the Supreme Court in Gorakpur Univesity and others Vs.
Dr. Shiktra Prasad nagendra and others reported in AIR 2001 SCW page 2819 that the pension and
gratuity are no longer mattes of any bounty to be distributed by Government,
but are valuable rights acquired and property in the hands and any delay in
settlement and disbursement thereof should be viewed seriously and dealt with
severely by imposing penalty in the form of payment of interest . But for the service rendered by the
complainants, the bank is not liable to pay pension, and the complainants also
are not entitled to claim pension. The consideration, contemplated under the
definition, need not be in cash and it may be of any kind, ensuring or creating
such right, and in this view we are of the considered opinion, that the past
service rendered by the complainants, should be taken as consideration, and
therefore it cannot be said that there is free of service, and the definition
for consumer, cannot be invoked.  


 

  

 


22. The learned senior counsel for the
appellant, in order to overcome this difficulty, would urge that even after the
voluntary retirement, the relationship between the complainants and the bank,
remains intact, as that of servant and master, and therefore when they are in
service (deemed to be in service or relationship exist), they cannot invoke the
jurisdiction of consumer fora, and if at all, they have to invoke the

Industrial Dispute Act
, and in this view, this Fora has no jurisdiction. 
In support of the above submissions, ruling
rendered by the Honble Bombay High court, also relied on. On the other hand, it is the submission of
the learned counsel for complainant, that as per the ruling of the Honble
Supreme Court, in 
Shampu Murari Sinha Vs. Project and Development India Ltd.
, reported
in AIR 2002 SCW 1165, the relationship of
the employer and the employee, comes to an end on retirement, and therefore,the
view expressed by Bombay High court,
which is also distinguishable cannot be extended or followed, as applicable to
the present case.



 

  

 


23. In the Pension Regulations 1995, we find
a clause, relating to recovery of pecuniary loss, caused to the bank under
clause 5, which says  

 

No departmental proceedings, if not instituted while the employee was
in service, shall be instituted in respect of an event which took place more
than four years before such institution.  


 

  

 


Further, under the heading Commercial
Employment, after retirement, there is a condition, which says  

 

 If a pensioner who immediately before his
retirement was holding the post of an officer and wishes to accept any
commercial employment before the expiry of two years from the date of his
retirement, he shall obtain the previous sanction of the Bank to such
acceptance. 


 

  

 


24. On the basis of the above provisions, submissions
were made, as if still there is a relationship of master and servant, and that
is why even after the retirement, for taking action, as well as to control the service,
conditions are imposed, and therefore, if the dispute comes between the employer
and the employee, the forum is elsewhere.
In fact, if the employer and employee relationship subsist, there is no
need for this kind of condition to be incorporated, under the Pension Regulations,
because an employee, while in service, not entitled to go for another service,
and if he commits any irregularity, an action could be taken, under the
existing rules. Because of the fact, the
relationship between employer and employee, ceased, still to have control for
limited purpose, the above said conditions were incorporated, that does not
revive the employer, employee relationship, after retirement. This clause is made applicable only to the
post of an officer, not to all.

Considering this status and commercial employment, not to be misused
some restrictions imposed, and re-employment elsewhere was not totally, prohibited. For these reasons it cannot be a ground, to
say that the employer and employee relationship continues, even after the
retirement.  


 

  

 


25. The fallacy of the submission is
exposed, even by the circular issued by the Bank, where the retired employees
are not treated as employees, which is also pointed out by the District Forum,
as seen from paragraph 34 of the judgement. The bank had issued a circular
dt.8.3.2001, clarifying that the retirees are not employees, they should be
considered on commercial terms. In the
said circular, and it was further clarified that for the subjects relating to
loans, housing loan and NSC loans etc., the retirees are considered only as  general
public. This circular is not
challenged. Though a control was sought
to be exercised under the Pension Rules for limited purpose, against the
retirees, when the question of benefit comes, they are excluded from the
purview of employees, treated only as public.
Thus, we find the bank is blowing hot and cold, which is not permissible
and acceptable.  


 

  

 


26. Aid is also sought, on behalf of the
appellant to urge that the employees are if at all entitled to move the civil
court, or anyother forum, and not to come under the Consumer For a, from the decision in 
Sudhir Chandra Sarkar Vs. Tata
Iron and Steel Co. Ltd., and others
, reported
in (1984) 3 Supreme Court Cases 369, when this Act, has
not come into force, the Supreme Court
has observed, that Pension and gratuity in
the matter of retiral benefits and for recovering the same must be put on
par. The gratuity, like pension, is a
retirement benefit for long and continuous service as a provision for old age. It is earned as a matter of right on
fulfilling the conditions subject to which it is earned. It is not a gratuitous payment depending upon
the discretion or sweet will or fancy of the employer. Like pension, it can also be recovered
through civil suit. In the case on
hand, as pointed out above, it is not the case of the complainants that they
are entitled to gratuity amount or pension amount, and their case relates to
delay in payment, for which they claim interest, in view of the fact, there was
deficiency in service. Therefore, on
fact, the above ruling is not applicable, and the same will not advance the
case of the appellant to oust the jurisdiction of the Fora, or to drive the
complainant elsewhere to claim the benefits, which they have claimed in all the
complaints.



 

  

 


27. 
In 
Kishore Lal
 case
, 
referred above
, the
  Apex Court, referring the
decision rendered by it in Indian Medical Association case, has observed 

 

A
contract of service is excluded for consideration from the ambit of definition
of service in 
CP Act
, whereas a contract for service is included. As regards service rendered free of charge
under 
Section 2(1)(o)
, the court held that the medical practitioners,
government hospitals/nursing homes and private hospitals/nursing homes, who
render service without any charge whatsoever to every person availing of the
service would not fall within the ambit of service under 
Sec.2(1)(o)
 of the
Act.



 

  

 


In the case of
existing service, i.e., where employee and employer relationship continues, it
can be said, that there is personal service, which is excluded under the
definition. As pointed out by us above,
which is also supported by judicial precedents, the relationship of employer
and employee, snapped or came to an end, in this case, on acceptance of the
voluntary retirement, and therefore applying the above observation, expelling
the complainants from the definition, is an impossible one.  


 

  

 


28. 
In 
UCO Bank and
others Vs. Sanwar Mal
 reported in 2004
ii LLJ 243, we find an observation in paragraph 9, which reads:




Moreover,
resignation brings about complete cessation of master and servant relationship
whereas voluntary retirement maintains the relationship for the purpose of
grant of retiral benefits, in view of the past service. 


 

  

 


On the strength of
the above observation, an attempt was made to say, the relationship is still maintained. 
In the case involved in 
the above decision
,
it seems the benefit claimed was retiral benefits, in view of the past service
rendered. In our case, the benefits
claimed is not one of retiral benefits, whereas for not granting retiral benefits in time, having granted
belatedly, interest and compensation alone are claimed. In the above judgement, it is said the
relationship for the purpose of granting of retiral benefits maintained, since
retiral benefits were claimed and not for anyother purpose, that too, when the
benefits were already given.



 

  

 


29. The Apex Court, has considered the
exclusion clause available in 
Sec.2 (1)(o)
 of the Act, in 
State of Orissa Vs. Divisional Manager, LIC and another
, reported in
II(1996) CPJ 31 (SC) and held that the respondent therein being a
Government servant, is bound by the service conditions and the state was
rendering services, free of charge, and in this view, in case of Government
Servant, Consumer Protection Act, is not applicable. When this decision was relied on before the
District Forum, it was rightly rejected, distinguishing on facts, that case
relates to Government servant, whereas the case on hand something different, in
which distinction, we are unable to find any error.
 
This is the position, in the case decided by
the National Commission, in 
State of Haryana Vs. Lila
Ram
 reported in IV (2008) CPJ 146 (NC), which can be
seen from paragraph 4 of the judgement.
 
In this case, 
Regional
Provident Fund Commissioner Vs. Bhavani
, reported in 2008-II-LLJ-1079
(SC),
which we are going to advert herein after elaborately was referred and
distinguished.
 
As seen from paragraph 6
of the order in 
State of   Haryana Vs. Lila Ram  

 

The
 ruling therein pertains to whether contributor to the Employees
Provident Fund would fall within the definition of a consumer. It was in that context that the   Apex Court has ruled that a member of EPF scheme is
a consumer. The case in hand pertains to
the retiral benefits of a State Government servant and, therefore, he would not
be covered under the definition of a consumer under 
Sec.2(1)(d)(ii)
 of the CP
Act, 1986.



 

  

 


thereby
indicating, if a person claims benefits under the employee provident fund, he
would come under the 
Consumer Protection Act
.
In the case on hand, in the place of Employee Provident Fund, the
complainants claim the benefit from the bank.
The Bank lone is entitled to disburse the retiral benefits, and any
deficiency, they alone are answerable.
Therefore, that ruling also will not come to the aid of the
appellant.  


 

  

 


30. A Division Bench of Bombay High court, in 
Philips Employees Union, Mumbai Vs. P.T. Jagtap and others
 reported in 2005
II LLJ 107, has observed, that even after the voluntary retirement,
the employee-management relationship continues, applying the said principle
here also, the case should be rejected, as per submission of the learned senior
counsel.



 

  

 


In the paragraph 6
of 
the said decision
, it is said  

 

  

 

The facts in the present case are clearly distinguishable as the
grievance raised by the  Union is
that the employees were not paid the amount of commuted pension and monthly
pension as promised in VRS and there was a shortfall in payment. In the circumstances, the conciliation
officer is not right in contending that after having accepted the VRS the
relationship between the employee and management has come to an end. The grievance of the petitioners had a direct
nexus with the 2001 VRS which had been accepted by them and certain benefits
have  been given to them and for that
limited purpose they could be said to be workmen within the meaning of

Industrial Disputes Act
.


(highlighted) 

 

  

 

There benefits
claimed, had direct nexus with the VRS scheme, and the dispute was regarding
commutation amount, as well as pension, in that sense it had certainly direct
nexus with the VRS. Therefore, the Division bench cautiously and consciously exercised
the words for
the limited purpose, they could be said to be workman within the meaning of
Industrial Disputes Act and not otherwise, which was rightly distinguished,
elaborately by the learned counsel for respondent, in the written submission,
which is well acceptable to us.

Therefore, on the basis of this decision also, which is beyond our reach,
to say between the appellant and the respondent, employer and employee
relationship continues, to say Consumer For as jurisdiction is ousted.  


 

  

 


31. 
In a case reported in 
Comptroller and Auditor General of India & another Vs. Shivkant
Shankar Naik
 reported in 1
(2003) CPJ 276 (NC), considering the
factual position, and the person who claimed the benefit was a Government
servant, and remedy is also available
for him, before the Administrative Tribunal, which is held dispute regarding payment
of provident fund, not consumer dispute, it is not the case before us. Here also, the 
Regional Provident Fund
Commissioner
 case was distinguished.



 

  

 


32. In Dr. K.T.
Shivaiah Vs. The Chairman & Managing Director, Canara Bank reported in I (1992) CPJ 244, the National Commission has held the
failure on the part of the respondent bank, not crediting the commuted value of
the pension in the SB account of the appellant therein, was deficiency in
service, for which interest also should be paid, which was fixed at Rs.18%,
which is relied on by the complainant, sought to be explained by the learned
senior counsel, as seen from para 22 of the written argument of the appellant. The explanation offered appears to be futile
exercise, since we find no merit in the distinction sought to be made, since
the ratio is directly applicable to our present case also, which cannot be
denied.  


 

  

 


33. The learned counsel for respondents/
complainants, drew our attention to say that all the complaints would come
within the jurisdiction of the 
Consumer Protection Act
, a ruling of the   Apex Court in 
Regional Provident Fund Commissioner Vs.
Bhavani
 in 2008 II LLJ 1079 (SC), and the ratio decidendi established
therein reads  

 

When the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner who is the person
responsible for must be held to be a service giver within 
sec.2(1)(o)
 of
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the respondent squarely comes within
definition consumer under 
sec.2(1)(d)(ii)
 as such a member and availing
services of the Pension Scheme, the inevitable conclusion is that consumer
forum has jurisdiction and 
Consumer Protection Act
 has applicability in
resolving matters arising out of the scheme.



 

  

 


There the
responsibility of Regional Provident Fund Commissioner is discussed,
confirming, the person responsible for the working of 1995 pension scheme,
concluding, he should be held to be service giver, within the meaning of

Sec.2(1)(o)
 of Consumer Protection Act.
In the place of Regional Provident Commissioner, we have to substitute
the bank, since the bank should be construed as service giver because of the
admitted provision that all the complainants were the employees of the bank and
accrued the right of pension, for the past consideration viz. service. The above
ruling is squarely applicable by all force, to the case in hand. The Apex Court elaborately considered the
definition under 
Sec.2(1)(d)(ii)
 as well as 2(1)(o), and finally came to the
conclusion that the respondent therein viz.
Bhavani, who was a worker in cashew factory, managed by Kerala State Cashew
Development Corporation, who is coming under the purview of Employees Provident
Fund and Family Pension Scheme, comes squarely within the definition of
consumer, within the meaning of 
Sec.2(1)(d)(ii)
, since she had contributed
amount, then availing the service rendered by the Regional Provident Fund
Commissioner, who is expected to implement the scheme. Here also, under the Pension Regulations, a
fund created, whether it comes under trust or not, which is for the benefit of
the retirees, is managed and controlled by the bank, as service provider, and
therefore they cannot easily escape, explaining that the relationship still
continues or voluntary retirees are outside the purview of consumer or service
rendered freely. We are unable to find
any materials, to distinguish the above said ruling. Applying the ratio therein, unquestionably,
we have to come to a conclusion, that all the complainants are consumers and under
the VRS scheme, the bank is a service provider. 


 

  

 


34. In our cases, admittedly, within the
specified time or the reasonable time commuted amount was not paid, at the same
time, full pension also not paid till the date of deposit of the commuted
value, whereas reduced pension alone has been paid which should be construed as
deficiency in service, on the part of the bank. 


 

  

 


35. The learned counsel for the complainants
drew our attention to the circular issued by the Indian bank dt.12.12.2005,
wherein they have rectified the mistake, which they have committed in the case
of the complainants, when it comes to other employees, probably retired on and
after 1.7.2003, whereas refusing to give the same benefits to the complainants,
who have retired previously. If the
stand taken by the bank before us is legally sound, and acceptable, supported
by a judicial precedent, as urged, certainly in our view they would not have
corrected the mistake by amending the regulation 41(6), which says Where however, payment of
commuted value of pension could not be made within the first month after the
date of retirement or within the first month after the date when the
commutation becomes absolute as the case may be, the difference between the
monthly pension and the commuted pension shall be paid for the period between
the date following the date of retirement or the date when the commutation
becomes absolute, as the case may be, and the date preceding the date on which
commuted value of pension is deemed to have been paid . It is not known, why the bank is so
adamant, in not extending the same benefit to the complainants, who were also
their employees once, rendered service, opted to go on voluntary retirement,
when the scheme was introduced. It is
not charitable on the part of the appellant also, to extend the said benefits
to the complainants, since other banks of the same nature had extended, the
said benefits to their employees, who are also covered under the same VRS,
formulated by the Central Government. As
seen from the communication emanated from the Bank of India,dt.30.10.2001,
though there is no provision in Pension Rules, including Central Civil service,
for payment of interest, they have decided to pay full pension, to such
employees upto date of the credit of the commutation amount to their bank
account, which should be the normal procedure.
Even in the case of Government employees, what we understand is, when
there was some delay in crediting the commuted value of the pension, full
pension is paid upto the date of the credit of the commuted value, and
thereafter alone reduced pension is given, thereby compensating the retirees
not causing any problem. The bank,
instead of following this natural law, which was accepted by them later, denied
the benefits, though they are entitled to serve to its ex-employees and on
their failure they, compelled them to come to the consumer fora,
and having come to the Consumer Fora, the retirees got the benefits legally,
acceptably, justifiably, in which there is no error of any kind, requiring our
interference.  


 

  

 


36. The rate of interest claimed is 18%. The District Forum, felt in the absence of
detailed particulars, calculating interest, quantifying the same, may not be
possible, and that is why in the first direction, suitable provision is made
for the grant of interest, fixing the date, which has to be accepted. The rate of interest @18% is also recognized
by the courts as 
referred above
, and therefore we find no reason to reduce the
rate of interest also. The payment of
lumpsum, will not compensate the benefits deprived, by not paying the commuted
value, and therefore the complainants who were deprived of the commuted value
is entitled to claim interest, claim accepted, which is now confirmed.  


 

  

 


37. The learned senior counsel urged only the
jurisdiction before us, and they have not questioned about the cost awarded or
the compensation awarded by the District Forum.
Though the complainants have claimed each Rs.1 lakh by way of
compensation, considering the position and the long drawn battle before the High
Court, though it is for someother relief, as well as the uncompromised stand
taken by the bank against its employee, who are entitled to be treated kindly,
granted only a moderate sum of Rs.15000/- each, as compensation, which also
requires to be confirmed. 


 

  

 


38. For the above reasons, we find no merit in
the appeals, and all the appeals deserves to be dismissed. 


 

  

 


39. In
the result, all the appeals in FA.No.685/2006 to FA.No.828/2006 are dismissed, with cost of Rs.1000/- in each
appeal, to be paid by the appellants to the respondents. The common orders of the District Forum in
COP.Nos.263/2001 to COP.Nos.406/2001 dt.29.9.2006, are confirmed.
