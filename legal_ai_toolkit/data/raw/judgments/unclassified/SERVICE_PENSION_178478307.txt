ON   01.04.2022, ALONG WITH WPC 29890/2018, THE COURT ON
16.08.2022 DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018

                                     -3-



                             JUDGMENT



        Dated this the 16th day of August, 2022



       The petitioners are retired employees of the

Union     Bank      of     India/second       respondent.    The

grievance of the petitioners is regarding non-

updation of their pension in consonance with the

increase in pay band arising out of bi-partite

settlements between the management of the Bank

and the employees union from time to time. The

writ     petitions       are     hence     filed   seeking   the

following reliefs;

    WP(C)29890/2018

         "(a) To issue a writ of mandamus or any
    other writ order or direction directing the
    respondents to update the pension of petitioner
    as mandated by regulation 35(1) and 56 of the
    Pension Regulations and to pay arrears of
    pension with interest at the rate of 12 percent
    per annum yearly compounding as the amounts
    detained has been earning similar interest to
    the Pension Fund.

         b)   To issue such other writ, order or
    direction which this Hon'ble Court find fit and
    proper in the interest of justice and in the
    circumstances of this case."

 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -4-


     W.P.(C) No.41327/2018


     "a.To issue a writ of mandamus or any other
     writ or order directing the second respondent
     to update the pension of the petitioner in tune
     with the revised pay scale arising out of the
     Bipartite   Settlements  in   compliance   with
     regulation 35(1) and 56 and to pay the same to
     the petitioner."



      2.    The essential facts are as under;

      Prior to 1985, the employees of the second

respondent        were     covered              by    the     Contributory

Provident        Fund      Scheme           under          the     
Employees

Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act,

1952
.      While     so,     based          on        a    memorandum     of

settlement arrived at between the managements of

58    banks      represented               by        the     Indian     Banks

Association and workmen represented by the All

India Bank Employees Association, it was decided

to introduce a pension scheme for the workmen in

lieu of employers contribution to the provident

fund.       Accordingly,              the            first        respondent

formulated and notified the Union Bank of India

(Employees)        Pension           Regulations,                1995   ('the
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -5-



Regulations')         and    constituted               a    pension     fund

called     'the     Union      Bank          of   India       (Employees)

Pension     Fund'     under       an       irrevocable         trust.      The

petitioners         opted         for        pension          under        the

Regulations and authorised the bank to transfer

the    entire     contribution             with    interest         thereon

to the newly created pension fund. Transfer was

effected       accordingly           and        from       then    onwards,

contributions        to     the   employees             provident     fund,

which was part of the petitioners' wages, was

paid to the pension fund. The petitioners                               rely

on Regulation 35(1), as amended on 18.05.2002, to

contend that their basic pension is bound to be

updated in consonance with the increase in the

pay band. Reliance is also placed on Regulation

56    which    provides       that,         in    case       of    doubt    as

regards        application              of        the        Regulations,

corresponding        provisions            of     the      Central    Civil

Service     Rules,      1972      or       Central         Civil   Services

(Commutation of Pension) Rules, 1981, applicable
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                      -6-



for Central Government Employees, can be adverted

to. The petitioners therefore contend that their

basic pension is liable to be revised in the same

manner      as    that    of     retired       Central        Government

Employees whenever pay band is revised.


      3.    Adv.        George       Cherian,       learned       Senior

Counsel appearing for the petitioners contended

that Pension Regulations is the outcome of                               a

Memorandum         of    Settlement          entered     between       the

managements and employees unions on 29.10.1993.

As    per        the    recital        in     the    Memorandum         of

Settlement, the bank was to introduce a pension

scheme      for          workmen        employees        in     lieu    of

employers'        contribution          to   the    provident      fund.

The pension scheme is to be in tandem with the

Central Government/Reserve Bank of India pattern.

The rate of basic pension was decided to be 50%

of   the    average       pay    as     defined     in    the    pension

scheme,      subject       to    a      minimum     of    Rs.375       per

mensem. Clause 12 of the Settlement contemplated
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -7-



the making of provisions prescribing qualifying

service, amounts of pension, payment of pension,

commutation of pension, family pension, updating

and other general conditions                   on the same lines

as is in force in the Reserve Bank of India.

Attention is drawn to Ext.P9 in W.P.(C) No.29890

of    2018,    issued      by     the      Government     of   India,

declining      the     recommendation          for   updating     the

pension of Reserve Bank employees on the premise

that    any    change     in      the      manner   of   calculating

pension is likely to result in similar demands

from     employees        of      public      sector     banks    and

financial institutions, most of which are facing

financial difficulties. It is pointed out that,

in spite of its earlier stand that any change in

the mode of calculation of pension of the Reserve

Bank employees will result in a contagion effect,

the     Government,          by       Ext.P10,       approved     the

recommendation for increase in the pension and DA

of RBI employees. It is hence contended that the
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -8-



benefit      of    such        increase      ought    to    have      been

extended to the employees of Public Sector Banks

like the second respondent also.



       4.    Referring         to    Regulation       35(1),     it     is

submitted         that    the       Regulation,       as    originally

notified, was to the effect that,                     'in respect of

employees         who    retired           between    first     day     of

January      1986,       but    before       31st    day   of   October

1987, basic pension and additional pension will

be updated as per the formula given in Appendix-

I'.    The    Regulation,           as     amended    on   18.05.2002,

reads as under;



             'Basic        pension           and      additional
      pension,      wherever         applicable,       shall     be
      updated      as     per       the     formula    given    in
      Appendix-I'.


The words 'will be' in the original text having

been    replaced         with       'shall     be',        by   way     of

amendment, it is unambiguous that basic pension

is bound to be updated in accordance with the
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -9-



increase in pay bands. That apart, Regulation 56

also makes it abundantly clear that the pension

scheme     is    in    tandem        with        the   Central     Civil

Services Pension Rules.



      5.    Another forceful contention urged by the

Senior     Counsel      is    that,         pension     fund     of     the

second     respondent        has       grown      manifold       over     a

period of time and as on 31.03.2017, Rs.11,032.28

Crores     is    available       in        the    fund.   Relying        on


Regulation 5(2)
, it is contended that the pension

fund can be utilised only for payment of pension

or    family       pension       in        accordance      with         the

Regulations. It is pointed out that the average

payment made towards pension/family pension is a

meager 23.91% of the annual growth. Moreover, the

employees who joined service after 31.03.2010 are

covered under the PFRDA Scheme of pension of the

first respondent. As such, the pension liability

of the second respondent will get extinguished

over a period of time. It is alleged that,                              the
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -10-



second       respondent      is       withholding        the     pension

legitimately due to retired employees like the

petitioners, with the evil design of utilising it

for     payment     of     dividend          and   other       purposes.

Reference is made to the decisions of the Apex

Court       to   contend    that      pension      is    no    longer    a

bounty to be disbursed according to the whims of

the    employer      and     has      acquired        the     status    of

property under 
Article 300A
 of the Constitution

of India.



 
6.    Learned     Standing           Counsel     for    the    Bank

argued that the contentions urged on behalf of

the petitioners have no legal backing and the

only question to be considered is whether pension

is     being      disbursed          in     accordance        with     the

stipulations in the Regulations. It is submitted

that    Regulation         35(1)      clearly      states      that    the

basic pension shall be updated as per the formula

given in Appendix I. The petitioners have no case

that the periodical updation of pension is not in
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -11-



accordance with Appendix I.                   The contention that

the updation ought to be in accordance with the

Central Civil Service Pension Rules or at least

in    tandem      with     revision          of     pension     of    RBI

employees, is too far fetched to be accepted.

Finally, it is submitted that the same issue was

considered and rejected by the Punjab and Haryana

High Court in 
M.C.Singla v Union of India
 [2012

SCC OnLine P&H 7136].




 
7.    In   the     Memorandum          of    Settlement        dated

29.10.1993 between the managements of banks and

the employees association, the precursor to the

Regulations, the understanding was to introduce a

pension          scheme              broadly          on        Central

Government/Reserve Bank of India pattern.                              The

Pension     Regulations        does         not    contain    any     such

provision, except Regulation 56, which stipulates

that,      in    case     of    doubt         in    the      matter     of

application of the Regulations, regard can be had
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -12-



to the corresponding provisions of Central Civil

Service       Rules,    1972     or     Central   Civil     Services

(Commutation of Pension) Rules, 1981 applicable

for Central Government employees.                 The contention

of the respondent Bank is that there is no scope

for doubt in the application of the Regulations,

since Regulation 35(1) is categoric to the effect

that        basic   pension          and    additional      pension,

wherever applicable, shall be updated as per the

formulae       given     in      Appendix-I.          The    further

contention is that even the petitioners have no

case that the basic pension is not being updated

in accordance with the formulae in Appendix-I.

To buttress this argument, reliance is placed on

the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court

in 
M.C.Singla
 (supra).




       8.    In my considered opinion the judgment in

M.C.Singla was rendered by considering Regulation

56 in isolation.            In       the    instant    case,     the
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -13-



petitioners        contend      that        there     cannot          be   any

consideration            distinct from the purpose behind

constitution of the pension fund.                              I find the

submission to be well founded.                        
Regulation 5(2)


makes it abundantly clear that the sole purpose

of   the    fund     is    payment          of    pension        or   family

pension      to     the     employee             or   his        family    in

accordance        with    the   Regulations.              Going       by   the

undisputed figures, only 23.91% of the fund is

being utilised for payment of pension and family

pension.          Another    crucial             aspect     is    that     the

employees      who    have      after        2010     are      covered      by

another scheme.           Therefore, the beneficiaries of

the Pension Regulations are a vanishing class.

This will definitely result in the trust being

left with a huge some of money after the death of

the last beneficiary.



      It is also to be noted that the employer's

contribution          towards          pension            is      also      an

entitlement of the employee, earned by reason of
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -14-



the service rendered by him. 
In this context, it

is pertinent to take into account the position of

law emanating from the judgments in 
D.S Nakara

and others v. Union of India
 [(
1983) 1 SCC 305]

and Sudhir Chandra Sarkar v. Tata Iron and Steel

Co. Ltd and others
 [(
1984) 3 SCC 369] and State

of   Jharkhand         v.     Jitendra       Kumar      Srivastava    and

another
 [(2013) 12 SCC 210].




      9.     
In       
D.S.Nakara
       (supra),         after    detailed

consideration of this aspect, the Apex Court held

as under;




           "31.       From   the    discussion    three    things
     emerge: (i) that pension is neither a bounty
     nor   a    matter       of   grace   depending      upon   the
     sweet      will    of    the    employer     and    that   it
     creates a vested right subject to 1972 Rules
     which are statutory in character because they
     are enacted in exercise of powers conferred
     by the proviso to 
Article 309
 and clause (5)
     of 
Article 148
 of the Constitution; (ii) that
     the pension is not an ex gratia payment but
     it    is     a    payment      for     the   past    service
     rendered; and (iii) it is a social welfare

     measure rendering socio-economic justice to
     those     who      in   the    hey-day           of       their    life
     ceaselessly        toiled      for     the       employer         on   an
     assurance that in their old age they would
     not be left in lurch. It must also be noticed
     that    the     quantum       of    pension          is    a    certain
     percentage          correlated             to        the        average
     emoluments drawn during last three years of
     service         reduced        to         10         months       under
     liberalised        pension         scheme.       Its      payment      is
     dependent       upon     an    additional             condition        of
     impeccable         behaviour         even        subsequent            to
     retirement, that is, since the cessation of
     the contract of service and that it can be
     reduced       or      withdrawn        as        a     disciplinary
     measure.



      10. 
In 
Sudhir Chandra Sarkar
(supra), it was

reiterated that pension is a right, the payment

of which does not depend upon the discretion of

the employer. The contextually relevant portion

of the judgment is extracted hereunder;


 
"18.     For     centuries          the       courts       swung     in
     favour    of    the     view       that    pension         is     either     a
     bounty or a gratuitous payment for loyal service
     rendered depending upon the sweet will or grace
     of the employer not claimable as a right and
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -16-



     therefore, no right to pension can be enforced
     through court. This view held the field and a
     suit     to    recover      pension         was     held    not
     maintainable. With the modern notions of social
     justice and social security, concept of pension
     underwent a radical change and it is now well-
     settled that pension is a right and payment of
     it does not depend upon the discretion of the
     employer, nor can it be denied at the sweet will
     or fancy of the employer. 
Deokinandan Prasad v.
     State of Bihar
 [(1971) 2 SCC 330 : AIR 1971 SC
     1409 : 1971 Supp SCR 634 : (
1971) 1 LLJ 557] ,
     State of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh
 [(1976) 2 SCC 1 :


 
1976 SCC (L&S) 172 : AIR 1976 SC 667 : (
1976) 3
     SCR    360]   and   D.S.   Nakara      v.   Union    of    India

     [(1983) 1 SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145 : (1983)
     2 SCR 165 : (1983) UPSC 263 : (1983) 1 LLJ
     104] . If pension which is the retiral benefit
     as a measure of social security can be recovered
     through civil suit, we see no justification in
     treating      gratuity     on      a   different      footing.


     Pension and gratuity in the matter of retiral
     benefits and for recovering the same must be put
     on par."



 
11. It is pertinent to note that in 
State of

Jharkhand and others v. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava

and another
 [(2013) 12 SCC 210], the Apex Court
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                       -17-



declared the right to receive pension as akin to

a right in property. The contextually relevant

portion of that judgment reads as under;


           "The    fact    remains        that       there   is   an
      imprimatur to the legal principle that the
      right to receive pension is recognised as a
      right in "property". 
Article 300-A
 of the
      Constitution of India reads as under:

           300-A.Persons         not     to     be   deprived     of
      property save by authority of law.--No person
      shall be deprived of his property save by
      authority of law.

           Once we proceed on that premise, the
      answer to the question posed by us in the
      beginning    of     this    judgment           becomes      too
      obvious. A person cannot be deprived of this
      pension without the authority of law, which
      is the constitutional mandate enshrined in
      
Article     300-A
    of     the         Constitution.        It
      follows that the attempt of the appellant to
      take away a part of pension or gratuity or
      even leave encashment without any statutory
      provision     and     under             the    umbrage      of
      administrative        instruction               cannot       be
      countenanced."



The    legal      position         being            as   above,         I   find

substantial        force     in        the      contention         that      the
 W.P.(C) No.29890/2018 & 41327/2018


                                     -18-



accumulated        surplus          ought     to   be    utilised        by

revising the pension periodically. In matters of

pension, there has to be a holistic approach and

not     constrictive            interpretation             of     certain

provisions.



       In   view    of    the        above    findings,         the    writ

petitions        are      disposed           of     permitting          the

petitioners        to    file        a   detailed       representation

highlighting        their      grievances.           Thereupon,         the

second         respondent                shall       consider           the

representation           and         pass     appropriate          orders

thereon       within          two        months.     For        effective

consideration            of      the         representation,            the

petitioners shall make available copy of the writ

petitions       along         with       certified      copy      of    the

judgment.
