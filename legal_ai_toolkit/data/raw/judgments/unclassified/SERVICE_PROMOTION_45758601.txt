                 Hon'ble Smt. Justice Rajani Dubey
                               CAV Order

1. Since the petitioners in the aforesaid petitions are working in the
     same office and filed the petitions with regard to their seniority and
     promotion, they are being heard and decided by this common
     order.



2.    In WPS No. 885 of 2015- By way of the instant petition, the
     petitioner- Prateek Khare is challenging the legality, validity and
     proprietary of the order dated 04.03.2015 (Annexure P/1) and
     30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) passed by the State Government,
     whereby the objection raised by the petitioner in respect of

     the petitioner- Prateek Khare is holding the post of joint Director
     and at present posted as Secretary, State Commission for
     protection of Child Rights. The petitioner was initially appointed on

  respondents No. 5 & 6 were graded by the Departmental
  Promotion Committee as Very-Good and according to Rule 7.9 of
  promotion Rules of 2003, the petitioner was placed at serial No.1
  and the respondents no 5 & 6 were placed at serial Nos. 2 & 3.
  The copy of the Departmental Promotion Committee proceedings
  is annexed as Annexure P/6. The General Administration
  Department in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to
  
Article 309
 read with 
Articles 16
 and 
335
 of the Constitution of
  India has made the rules known as Chhattisgarh Public Services
  (Promotion) Rules, 2003, Rule 7 of the said Rules deals with
  promotion on the basis of merit-cum-seniority.



4. The promotion order was issued on 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5)
  and the petitioner was placed at serial No. 1 i.e. in the same order
  of merit determined by the Departmental Promotion Committee.
  On 25.10.2007 (Annexure P/9), first time the provisional gradation
  list showing the position as on 01.04.2007 of Joint Directors
  Women & Child Welfare Department was published and the
  objections were invited. In the said gradation list, petitioner was
  placed at serial No.3 and respondents No. 5 & 6 were placed
  above the petitioner ignoring the order of merit determined by
  Departmental Promotion Committee on the basis of overall merit.
  On 03.11.2007, the petitioner made first representation for
  correction of his position. On 17.12.2009, second representation
  was made, on 21.12.2009, third representation was made, further
  on    30.12.2009   and    thereafter   on   22.11.2010    the   last

5. The State Government vide its order dated 30.05.2013 (Annexure
  P/2), rejected the representation without considering the grounds
  agitated by the petitioner and while rejecting the representation it
  was held that the provisions of General conditions of Service
  Rules, 1961 would not be applicable, because the promotions
  were made under the Promotion Rules of 2003. The petitioner
  again requested the authorities to review the order dated
  30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2). The review application has been
  rejected on 04.03.2015 and final gradation list was issued on
  07.03.2015 (Annexure P/14) and again the petitioner has been
  placed at serial No.3. The petitioner made a representation to the
  department and thereafter filed a petition before this Court which
  was registered as W.P.(S) No. 4075/2014 (Annexure P/15) and the
  same was disposed of on 21.11.2014 with certain direction.

  Committee for the post of Additional Director and with malafide
  intention after near about 7 years and the final gradation list has

                     of above mentioned entire matter.



6.    In WPS No. 5603 of 2017- The instant petition is filed by the
     petitioner-    Surendra Kumar Choubey against the promotion
     granted to respondent No.3 way back in the year 2006 on the post
     of Joint Director in Women & Child Development department.



7. Brief facts of the case as mentioned in WPS No. 5603/2017 are
     that the petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey was appointed on
     the post of District Women & Child Development Officer on
     03.09.1995. Thereafter, he was promoted on the post of Deputy
     Director on 25.04.1998. The State of Chhattisgarh in the year
     2005 considered the names of Deputy Directors for promotion to
     the post of Joint Director in Women and Child Welfare department.

     As per the gradation list issued on 01.04.2004 the petitioner was
     placed at serial number 3 from the top of the seniority list of
     District Programme Officer/Deputy Director. Smt. Archana Seth
     and Smt. C.S. Lal were over and above in the seniority list of the
     petitioner whereas Shri Prateek Khare was junior to the petitioner
     in the gradation list. The promotion was to be made under
     Chhattisgarh Women and Child Welfare (Gazetted) Service
     Recruitment Rules, 1990 read with Chhattisgarh Civil Services
     Promotion Rules, 2003. In the year 2005, total 3 posts were
     vacant against which the names of the petitioner and other Deputy
     Directors were to be considered. Out of 3 posts, 2 posts were
     meant for unreserved category and one post was meant for

  Scheduled Tribes candidate. DPC was convened on 21.11.2005 in
  which the name of petitioner was under the zone of consideration
  as he cleared the minimum standard required for to be considered
  on merits for the purposes of promotion. As per the annual
  confidential reports of the petitioner, he was graded as very good
  and his junior namely Prateek Khare was graded as outstanding
  and, therefore he was considered as preferably more meritorious
  than the candidature of the petitioner while granting promotion to
  the post of Joint Director. Thus, respondent No.3 was promoted to
  the post of Joint Director vide order dated 07.05.2006 (Annexure
  P/1) whereby the seniority of the petitioner was overlooked as Mr.
  Prateek Khare superseded the petitioner in the matter of granting
  promotion. The other seniors namely Smt. Archana Rana Seth
  and Smt. C.S. Lal sought information from the respondent
  department as to how the seniority is granted to Prateek Khare
  over and above them. They sought information under 
RTI Act
 as
  well as from other sources about the grading given to the private
  respondent in his annual confidential reports. The petitioner and
  other employees were thus superseded in promotion as well as
  seniority. But for a fairly longer period no information about Shri
  Khare or about the minutes of the Departmental Promotion
  committee meeting was ever given to the information seekers.
  Copies of Communications are annexed as Annexure P/2 & Copy
  of Gradation list is annexed as Annexure P/3. In the month of
  September 2017, the petitioner was given the copy of minutes of
  meeting held on 21.11.2005 wherein his name was under

  consideration for promotion to the post of Joint Director. Copy of
  minutes of meeting is annexed as Annexure P/4. It is clear from
  the minutes of the meeting that for promotion on the post of Joint
  Director, 3 posts were vacant and for which the names of 6 Deputy
  directors were under consideration. Out of 6, the names of Shri
  Dildar Singh Maravi and Smt. Preeti Khokar was not considered.
  The name of petitioner was under consideration and the average
  valuation was mentioned as very good but the committee refused

  to recommend the name of the petitioner because the requisite
  numbers of officers were already available. I


8. Shri Prateek Khare was given remark as outstanding and found
  suitable for promotion. But in the bottom note it is mentioned that
  for the year 2001 there are 2 different annual confidential reports
  for a single year. For 7 and a half months, the grade of respondent
  No. 3 was A+ and for next 4 and a half months, his grade was C. It
  is clear that the average of A+ and C will be B which is below the
  standard benchmark required as per rule 7 (4) of Chhattisgarh
  Civil Services Promotion Rules, 2003 required for consideration of
  promotion on merit-cum-seniority basis. Therefore, Shri Prateek
  Khare is out of the consideration zone on the date of DPC yet the
  DPC recommended the name of respondent no.3 for promotion
  quoting his grading as outstanding and also placing him over and
  above his seniors in the gradation list of Joint Director. Hence, this
  petition has been filed by the petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey
  for the following reliefs:-



                         10.1. That all the records pertaining to the
                         Departmental Promotion Committee meeting
                         held in year 2005 and the Annual Confidential
                         Reports       with   respect     to   Petitioner   and
                         Respondent no.3 for granting promotion to the
                         post of Joint Director, Woman and Child Welfare
                         department may be requisitioned for kind per
                         usual of this Hon'ble Court.



                         10.2 That the promotion order dated 27.05.2006
                         granting promotion to respondent no.3 to the
                         post of Joint Director, Woman and Child Welfare
                         Department may be set aside/quashed and
                         Respondent no.1 may be directed to conduct

                         the post of Joint Director Women and Child
                         Welfare Department along with all consequential

                       benefits.



                       10.3. That respondent no.1 may be directed to
                       conduct a full-fledged enquiry on the fraud
                       committed by the then members of Departmental
                       Promotion Committee and other responsible
                       persons due to which errorneous and illegal
                       promotion has been granted to respondent no.1.



                       10.4. That any other relief, which this Hon'ble
                       Court may deem fit and proper together with the
                       cost of the petition.



9. In WPS No. 885/2015, learned counsel for the petitioner submits
  that the impugned orders are illegal erroneous and contrary to law.
  While rejecting the objection of the petitioner, the Rules of 2003
  and the General Condition of Service Rules 1961 were taken into
  consideration. The impugned orders have been passed without
  application of mind and without considering the grounds raised in
  the representations/objections. The authorities while rejecting the
  representation have failed to appreciate Rules 7(9) & 7(12) of
  promotion Rules 2003 and Rules 12(1)(b) of General Conditions of
  Service Rules 1961. The State Government grossly erred in
  placing the petitioner at serial No.3 contrary to the order of merit
  determined by the Departmental Promotion Committee and the
  promotion order passed by the department. The respondent
  authorities erred in rejecting the objection of the petitioner in
  holding that the general condition of service rules 1961 would not
  be applicable and the promotion Rules of 2003 would be
  applicable, but even the rules of 2003 have not been considered.
  Rules of 1961 are general service rules applicable undoubtedly as
  mentioned in the opinion sought by the department from the
  General Administration Department. With malafide intention the
  representation and review application have been rejected and final
  gradation list has been issued, so that the undue advantage can
  be given to private respondents. The petitioner has been deprived
  from his seniority. The representation of the petitioner was rejected
 Neutral Citation
2024:CGHC:7146





                               10


  without any speaking order, even the review has been rejected
  erroneously upholding the order dated 30.05.2013. Therefore, the
  impugned orders are liable to be set aside.



10. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1, 2 & 4 strongly opposes
  the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the the petitioner has
  been appointed on the post of Assistant Director vide order dated
  18.05.1995 whereas respondents No. 5 and 6 have been
  appointed to the post of Assistant Director vide order dated
  29.06.1993. Thus, they are much seniors to the petitioner. The
  DPC held on 21.11.2005 has evaluated the overall performance of
  the employees, who were within the zone of consideration and
  accordingly they have been awarded the grading. The petitioner
  was found outstanding whereas the respondents No. 5 and 6 have
  been found very good and accordingly they have been promoted
  vide promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5). Grading of
  DPC and placing of employees in serial number in the promotion
  order cannot be made basis for seniority to the promoted post. In
  such a situation, the provisions contained in Rule 12(1)(c) of the
  Rules, 1961 will come into place. It is well settled principles of
  service law that where the promotions are made on the basis of
  merit-cum-seniority, the seniority of persons considered fit for
  promotion at the same time, shall be the same as the relative
  seniority in the lower grade from which they are promoted. From a
  bare perusal of the proceeding of the DPC dated 21.11.2005
  (Annexure P/6), it would be evident that if the promotions were
  made on the basis of the seniority subject to rejection of unfit and
  in such a case, in the relative seniority of Deputy Director, the
  petitioner was at serial No. 4 whereas respondents No. 5 and 6
  were at serial no. 1 and 2 respectively and therefore, after
  issuance of promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5),
  when the seniority list of Joint Director was published as on
  01.04.2007, the petitioner was placed at serial No. 3 whereas
  respondents No. 5 and 6 have been placed at serial Nos. 1 and 2
  respectively. The representation of the petitioner was duly

                                  11


   considered by the competent authority and as per promotion rules
   and service rules, representation was rejected by the competent
   authority. Therefore, the the petition is liable to be dismissed.



11.Learned counsel for respondents No. 5 & 6 opposes the prayer of
   the petitioner and submits that the petition filed by the petitioner is
   not maintainable, since none of the rights of the petitioner has
   been violated. The petitioner had filed the instant writ petition
   being aggrieved by the impugned order for the reason that
   because of the impugned orders the chances of promotion of the
   petitioner to the next higher post of Additional Director would be
   adversely affected. It is a settled principle of law that no employee
   has a right of promotion, the only right which an employee has a
   right to be considered for promotion. The writ jurisdiction cannot
   be invoked merely on the ground that the chances of promotion in
   future are likely to be affected. The grant of promotion to the
   respondents or to the petitioner on the next higher post of
   Additional Director is contingent of several factors and events. In
   the instant case, the petitioner and other eligible employees are
   yet to be considered for promotion to the next higher post of
   Additional Director at this stage none of the rights of the petitioner
   has been violated. Hence, the instant petition is pre-mature and is
   liable to be dismissed in limine.



12.In WPS No. 5603/2017, learned counsel for the petitioner submits
   that the impugned promotion order dated 07.05.2006 passed by
   respondent No.1 promoting respondent No.3 instead of petitioner
   is illegal, arbitrary and malafide. The respondent authorities were
   well aware about the contradictory entries made by the
   Department Promotion Committee with respect to granting of
   outstanding remark for respondent No.3, yet concealed the same
   for years together in order to deprive the other counterparts of
   respondent No.3 to illegally granted the benefit of promotion and
   seniority. The act on the part of respondent authorities amounts to
   fraud and malice in law in order to inflict injury upon the other
   employees and to favour respondent No.3. The petitioner was
 Neutral Citation
2024:CGHC:7146





                                   12


  entitled for promotion as he duly fulfilled the required criteria for
  promotion to the post of Joint Director on the unreserved post. But
  his junior that is respondent No.3, was considered over and above
  the petitioner by denoting his outstanding performance despite
  contradictory entry in his ACR's. The promotion enjoyed by
  respondent No.3 for all these years will not accrue any right in his
  favour as the promotion itself was granted on basis of concealing
  actual entries and mistaken fact which has to be cured at some
  point of time. As the promotion granted to respondent No.3, in
  place of the petitioner is on misinterpretation of the entries made
  in his ACR's, which was concealed for years together from the
  public at large therefore, the promotion has to be quashed from
  the date it was granted. It is the prime duty of the state to review
  and apply it's mind upon the recommendation made by the Public
  Service Commission in the matters of promotion. In the present
  case the clearing illegality and contradiction in the DPC minutes is
  writ large the state cannot shut it's eyes ratify as mute spectator
  only because it is recommendation of PSC. State cannot without
  applying its mind accept the recommendation of the Public Service
  Commission         howsoever     erroneous    it   may    be.   Therefore,
  impugned         order   dated   27.05.2006    granting    promotion    to
  respondent No.3 is liable to be set aside.



13. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1 & 2 strongly opposes the
  prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner sought for
  quashment of promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/1)
  after inordinate delay of 11 years, therefore, this petition is liable to
  be dismissed on this ground alone. In DPC meeting dated
  21.11.2005, the committee considered all aspects of promotion
  and recommended the name of officers for promotion and the
  respondents on the basis of recommendation, promoted the
  concerned officers and, therefore, this petition being without any
  substance is liable to be dismissed.



14.Learned counsel for respondent No.3- Prateek Khare vehemently
  opposes the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner
 Neutral Citation
2024:CGHC:7146





                                13


  has filed the instant petition after near about 12 years, therefore,
  the instant petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay
  and laches. No explanation has been offered by the petitioner in
  his writ petition except that he was served with the copies of the
  Departmental Promotion Committee of 2005 in the month of
  September 2017. It is clear that the said application under the RTI
  itself was filed on 20.09.2017 i.e. after near about 11 years from
  the date of the order of promotion.



15. The punishment of censure was imposed upon the petitioner and
  subsequently he made an appeal against the order of punishment
  and on 08.08.2005 (Annexure R.3/2), the said punishment was
  set-aside, thereafter the petitioner was granted the proforma
  promotion on the post of Deputy Director with effect from 1998
  subject to condition that he would be entitled for higher pay-scale
  only from the date of his joining on the post of Deputy Director. On
  06.07.2005 (Annexure R.3/3), the petitioner along with the other
  employees made a representation to the department which itself
  shows that the petitioner was aware in respect of the ACRs as well
  as in respect of the promotion of the answering respondent. The
  identical issue raised by the other employee namely Smt. Archana
  Rana i.e. W.P.(S) No. 1988/2017 has already been dismissed and
  Writ Appeal No. 239/2017 is pending under consideration.
  Annexure R.3/4 is the copy of the order dated 27.04.2017.
  Subsequently, the Departmental Promotion Committee held on
  21.11.2005 for consideration of the cases of Deputy Directors for
  promotion on the post of Joint Director. The petitioner along with
  the private respondents and other eligible Deputy Directors were
  considered for promotion on the post of Joint Director.



16. The Departmental Promotion Committee shall make relative/
  comparative assessment of the merit of the public servants on the
  basis of their service records and placed them in the categories as
  outstanding, very good, average and poor as the case may be.
  However, only those public servants who were graded as very
  good and above, will be included in the select list by placing the
 Neutral Citation
2024:CGHC:7146





                                14


   public servants graded as outstanding on the top followed by
   those graded as very good subject to availability of vacancies.
   Respondent No.3 was graded as outstanding, therefore, he was
   placed on top and one Archana Rana who was graded as Very
   Good was placed at Serial No.2 and C.S. Lal who belonged to the
   Scheduled Tribe was considered against the third reserve post of
   Scheduled Tribe. The petitioner though was graded as Very Good
   but since he was junior to Archana Rana therefore, he was placed
   at serial No. 3 in the category of unreserved. This fact is apparent
   on the face of the minutes of meeting of the Departmental
   Promotion Committee held on 21.11.2005. Therefore, this petition
   is liable to be dismissed.



17. Reliance has been placed on the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme
   Court in the matter of 
Union of India and another Vs. S.K. Goel
   and others
 reported in (
2007) 14 SCC 641, Shiba Shankar

18.Heard counsel for the parties and perused the material available
   on record.



19. As regards WPS No. 5603/2017 filed by the petitioner- Surendra
   Kumar Choubey, it is clear that this petition is against promotion
   order dated 27.05.2006 and respondents No. 1, 2 and 3 strongly
   objected that this petition has been filed after 12 years of the
   impugned order. It is clear from WPS No. 1988/2017 that this writ
   was filed by Smt. Archana Rana and Smt. C.S. Lal and in the said
      Neutral Citation

                                         15


        petition, this Court observed in paras 2, 3 & 5 as under:-



               "2. Since the petitioners were also promoted by the same order,
               as such they are not aggrieved by the entire order, however,
               according to the petitioners, respondent No.5 having been placed
               at serial No.1 in the order of promotion, he will have preference in
               consideration for promotion to the next higher post of Additional
               Director. It is put forth that at the time of consideration of the
               promotion in the year 2006, the ACRs of respondent No.5 were
               not good or not of such grade which would place him as an
               outstanding officer for placement at serial No.1 in the promotion
               order, therefore, he should not have been promoted.



               3. In para 7 of the writ petition, the petitioners would submit that
               there is no delay in filing the instant writ petition because they
               were pursuing the cause bonafidely and diligently firstly by filing
               application under RTI seeking copies of the DPC proceedings,
               which was declined up to the State Information Commission.
               After supply of the copy, the petitioners have been continuously
               pursuing their cause by filing repeated representations. The
               department has drawn proceedings after the GAD and PSC have
               issued directions to the department, but nothing has been
               communicated apart from the assurance.



               5. 
In the matter of 
K.R. Mudgal & Ors. Vs. R.P. Singh & Ors.
 1 and
               
Shiba Shankar Mohapatra & Ors. Vs. State of Orissa and Ors.
 2,
               the Supreme Court has held that challenge to the seniority or
               promotion should be made within a reasonable time i.e. within a
               period of three to four years because after reasonable time the
               employees get settled in their cadre and their rights are
               crystallized."




 
20. The writ appeal i.e. WA No. 239/2017 was dismissed as
        withdrawn vide order dated 10.02.2021, therefore, it is clear that
        two officers who were promoted with respondent No.3- Prateek
        Khare, filed writ petition against the same order which was
        dismissed on the ground of delay. The petitioner has filed the

  Neutral Citation
 2024:CGHC:7146





                                16


   instant petition about 12 years of this order. Thus, in the light of
   previous orders of this Court and principles of Hon'ble Supreme
   Court in the matters of 
K.R. Mudgal and others vs. R.P. Singh and
   others
 reported in (
1986) 4 SCC 531 & Shiba Shankar Mohapatra
   and others Vs. State of Orissa and others
 reported in (2010) 12
   SCC 471, this writ petition No. 5603/2017 suffers from
   unexplained delay and laches and, therefore it deserves to be and
   is hereby dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.




21. As regards WPS No. 885/2015, the petitioner has challenged the
   order dated 04.03.2015 (Annexure P/1) & 30.05.2013 (Annexure
   P/2) on the ground that DPC dated 21.11.2005, he was placed at
   serial No.1 in the seniority list at that time and now his seniority
   has been disturbed.



22. In this case, the petitioner relied on promotion rules, respondents
   also quoted Rule 12 (1)(c) of the Rules, 1961 in their return.
   Respondents No. 5 & 6 also submits that the petitioner was junior
   to respondents No. 5 & 6. Respondents No. 5 & 6 made several
   representations (Annexure R-5/6) to respondents with regard to
   their seniority and promotion. As the petitioner was junior to
   respondents No. 5 & 6 therefore, he was rightly placed below the
   respondents in the gradation list. The State Government before
   passing the order dated 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) had granted
   sufficient opportunity to the petitioner and after considering the
   entire records and representation of the petitioner, passed the
   order in accordance with law. The order dated 30.05.2013
   (Annexure P/2) was passed by the respondent authorities after
   hearing all the affected parties and considering the relevant
   statutory provisions as well as the records of the case. The review
   application filed by the petitioner did not disclose any new ground
   which warranted the State Government to review its order dated
   30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2).



23. It is clear that the Rule 2003 specially deals with the promotion.
   Annexure R-5/8 is the notification of Central Government dated
  Neutral Citation

                                          17


   08.02.2002 which provides that order /list of promotion so issued
   merely reflects the preference tendered in granting promotion to
   the employees and it can never affect the gradation list of the
   employees.



24. Rule 12(1)(c) of the Rules, 1961 provides as under:-



        "12. Seniority - XXX                   XXX         XXX

        (1)         (a)       XXX              XXX         XXX


                    (b)       XXX              XXX          XXX


        (c) Where promotions are made on the basis of the seniority
        subject to rejection of the unfit, the seniority of persons
        considered fit for promotion at the same time, shall be the same
        as the relative seniority in the lower grade from which they are
        promoted. Where, however, a person is considered as unfit for
        promotion and is superseded by a junior, such person shall not, if
        subsequently found suitable and promoted, take seniority in the
        Higher grade over the junior persons who had superseded him."



25. Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid Rule that where the
   promotion were made on the basis of the merit-cum-seniority, the
   seniority of person considered fit for promotion at the same time
   shall be the same as relative seniority in the lower grade from
   which they are promoted. Para 12 of the minutes of meeting of
   DPC dated 21.11.2005 (Annexure P/6) clearly shows the seniority
   of the petitioner and respondents No. 5 & 6 as on 01.01.2005 and
   the same is reproduced as under:-

        26. It is clear from representations of the petitioner and the orders of
           respondents that the competent authority duly considered the
           representation of the petitioner and passed impugned orders in
           accordance with rules and notifications of the State and Central
           Government. Therefore, this Court did not find any illegality or
           irregularity in the impugned orders passed by the respondent
           authorities. Thus, the writ petition i.e WPS No. 885/2015 being
           without any substance is liable to be and is hereby dismissed.



        27. The aforesaid petitions are dismissed.
