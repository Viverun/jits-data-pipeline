Hon'ble Mr. Justice R. Kantha Rao, Judicial Member

                           COMMON ORDER

        {As per Hon'ble Mr. B.V. Sudhakar, Administrative Member}



2.    The OAs are filed challenging the notification dated 26.7.2017 read with

the integrated seniority list issued vide lr dt. 18.7.2017 in the context of the

Tribunal order in OA 1263/2010 and those of the Hon'ble High Court in W.P
                                      6                     OA 636/2017 & batch



No. 9942/2014 and C.C No.166/2016 in W.P. No. 9942/2014. The relief sought

and the respondents being one and the same, a common order is issued.



3.    Applicants who belong to the UR category while working as Senior

Section Engineers in the respondents' organisation were considered for

promotion to the Group B post of Asst Exec. Engineer/Assistant Div. Engineer

(for brevity Asst. Engineers -AE), as they were in the zone of consideration in

respect of UR vacancies against 70% quota in pursuance of 2010 notification

to fill up 22 vacancies with the breakup of 12 UR, 8 SC and 2 ST vacancies

respectively. Applicants after qualifying in the written exam, viva voce and

medical tests with the aggregate qualifying mark were not empanelled in the

select panel dt. 3.12.2010, on the grounds that the UR vacancies were filled up

by SC/ST employees. Of the 12 UR vacancies, 6 were filled               by SC/ST

employees as per the select panel dt 3.12.2010 based on the principle of own

merit albeit they were juniors to the applicants. The promotion of junior SC/ST

employees being an eye sore was challenged in OA 1263/2010. Besides, after

enlisting 6 SC/ST candidates against UR vacancies, 2 SC and 1 ST employee

respectively were selected against SC/ST roster points, leaving 6 SC and 1 ST

vacancy unfilled for want of qualified candidates. The 6 SC/ST candidates who

were adjusted against UR vacancies were made private respondents in OA

1263/2010 which was allowed on 30.8.2013, by ordering that the applicants

being senior and qualified need to be considered. The orders of the Tribunal

were challenged in the Hon'ble High court of Judicature at Hyderabad in W.P.

No.9942/2014 and WP No. 15138/2014. Hon'ble High court dealt with the

above 2 W.Ps along with others in regard to the issue of reservation in

promotions at length by referring to the Hon'ble Supreme Court Judgments in

M.Nagaraj, U.P Power Corporation, K. Manorama and on 29.4.2015 upheld the
                                        7                      OA 636/2017 & batch



orders of the Tribunal to the extent of declaring the action of the respondents in

providing reservation in promotion without fulfilling the parameters laid down in

M.Nagaraj as incorrect. Hon'ble High court has also directed the respondents to

complete the exercise of gathering data, and forming its opinion on the

parameters laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Nagaraj within 6

months, leaving it open to the respondents in the interregnum period to make in-

charge arrangements purely as a temporary measure till an opinion is formed in

regard to reservation in promotion in consonance with Nagaraj judgment. As the

respondents did not rescind the promotion of private respondents despite

Hon'ble High Court orders contempt petition was filed vide Contempt Case

No.166 of 2016 in WP no 9942 of 2014. In the meanwhile respondents issued an

order dated 24.6.2015 indicating that the promotion of the private respondents

against UR vacancies in the panel dated 3.12.2010 has to be treated as purely

adhoc/in-charge basis till further orders. Hon'ble High court while disposing of

the contempt petition on 23.3.2016 observed that the permission granted to

make in-charge arrangements did not enable the respondents to cause adhoc

promotion or regularise the promotion made earlier and that even if promotions

were to be regularised the same shall be from a date after the collection of data

and not preceding it. The contempt was closed after the respondents issued a

corrigendum stating that the adhoc promotion given was treated as in-charge

arrangement and the orders of regularisation were withdrawn along with

tendering an unconditional apology. Applicants did file another CP bearing No.

020/170 of 2014 in OA 1263/2010 before the Tribunal, which was closed giving

liberty to the applicants to revive the same, if necessary, after the expiry of the

time granted to implement the order of the Hon'ble High Court in W.P No.9942

of 2014 dated 29.4.2015.

                                       8                      OA 636/2017 & batch




4.    The contentions of the applicants are that the Hon'ble High Court has

given 6 months time to continue the in-charge arrangements from the date of

receipt of the order dt 29.4.2015 in WP 9942/2014 but the in-charge

arrangements made on 24.6.2015 were continued beyond the said period

granting pay fixation benefits as per 7th 
CPC
, as if the original promotions given

by the respondents were undisturbed as AEs. Not only pay fixation but the

employees were upgraded to the next higher grade of senior scale based on the

roster point of SC/ST on the grounds that they were regularly working as AEs in

Group B cadre, which is against the office order dated 24.6.2015. Consequent to

issue of the office order dated 24.6.2015 Contempt Petition No.166 of 2016 was

closed and since the respondents have acted against the office order cited a

Miscellaneous Petition No.253 of 2017 was filed to recall the order dated

3.3.2016 in CP referred to. The same is under adjudication. The junior SC/ST

employees who were supposed to be working on in charge basis are being

continued on a regular basis and one of them by name Sri Thangaiyan has retired

on 31.7.2016 with retiral benefits as are allowed to         regularly promoted

employees in the said cadre. In addition, respondents issued an integrated

seniority list of Senior Section Engineers which is the feeder cadre to AEs, in

which the names of the 6 SC/ST employees were not shown implying that the

said employees were regularly promoted and not on in-charge basis as AEs in

utter disregard of the office order dt.24.6.2015 issued with the purported

intention of complying with the observations of the Hon'ble High Court in the

W.P no. 9942/2014 and the corresponding contempt petition 166/2016.

Applicants represented on 22.7.2017 requesting that the junior SC/ST employees

who were made AEs on in-charge basis be shown as juniors in the Integrated

Seniority list of the Sr section Engineer and that their names should replace the
                                       9                      OA 636/2017 & batch



SC/ST employees in the panel dated 3.12.2010. Further, the SC/ ST employees

have to appear for selection in case they have to be promoted on a regular basis.

Instead of acting on the representations of the applicants, respondents issued two

notifications on 26.7.2017, one proposing to hold a selection to fill up 26

vacancies of AEs against 70% quota with the communal break up of 7 SC, 1 ST

and 18 UR and the other notification was to cancel the notification dt 2.1.2013

by referring to WP 16280 of 2014 relating to OA 203/2013 filed by UR

employees challenging the notification dt. 2.1.2013 in regard to the issue of

reservation in promotions. The OA 203/2013 was allowed and the WP

16280/2014 was decided along with other WPs on 29.4.2015 by the Hon'ble

High court. Applicants further contend that the respondents have concealed the

fact, that the Hon'ble High Court in WPMP 39928/2016 through which some

UR employees impleaded themselves in WP 11724/2013 filed by some SC/ST

employees, consequent to their filing OA 392/2013 seeking extension of the

zone of consideration for promotion to AEs against 70% quota in notification dt

2.1.2013 being dismissed by the Tribunal, has ordered that the 8 vacancies listed

in the notification dt 2.1.2013 which was a subject matter of OA 203/2013,

should be treated as UR vacancies. Therefore, instead of considering the

applicants in OA 1263/2010 for the UR vacancies by revising the select panel dt

3.12.2010 showing them in the zone of consideration for AE promotion in the

notification issued on 26.7.2017 is blatantly illegal. More than being illegal it

would imply that the applicants in OA 1263/2010 would have to again appear for

selection. One more irregularity as claimed by the applicants          is that     the

respondents were supposed to show the 8 vacancies of 2.1.2013 notification as

UR but they have shown them as 7 SC and 1 ST vacancy in the impugned

notification dated 26.7.2017 against the orders of the Hon'ble High Court in WP
                                        10                             OA 636/2017 & batch



11724/2013 on 22.12.2016. The applicants find fault with the decision of the

respondents in showing them in the zone of consideration against notification dt.

26.7.2017 instead of deleting the names of the SC/ST employees from the select

panel dt 3.12.2010 and showing the SC/ST employees in the zone of

consideration, if eligible as per seniority. Respondents have not settled the issue

by including the names of the applicants in the panel dt 3.12.2010 even after 4

years of filing of the OA and 2 years since the Hon'ble High court decision.

Another aspect pointed out by the applicants is that the office order dated

24.6.2015 was not challenged by employees who were provided with in charge

arrangements and the common order dt 29.4.2015 which comes in the way of the

SC/ST employees enlisted against roster points of SC/ST was also not

challenged by Junior SC/ST employees listed at sl no 12 to 14 in the panel dt

3.12.2010. Therefore the two aforesaid orders are binding on the respondents.

Applicants cited the judgment dt 11.3.2016 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Suresh Chand Goutham v State of Uttar Pradesh reported in WP (c) No 690 of

2015, in support of their arguments. It was held in the cited judgment that no

mandamus can be given to frame a rule or regulation for the purpose of

reservation for SC/ST in the matter of promotion. As per the verdict of the

Hon'ble High Court in the Contempt petition, SC/ST employees who have been

given promotion in the panel dt 3.12.2010 have lost the promotion since it has to

be given prospectively after collecting the data required. Therefore they have to

apply for selection afresh. The action of the respondents has been discriminative

by extending benefit of promotion to ineligible employees and denying the same

to eligible employees. Admittedly, against the clear directions of the Hon'ble

High Court.

                                         11                             OA 636/2017 & batch



       In regard to integrated seniority list, applicants claim that it was prepared

based on consequential seniority and own merit, which is against Nagaraj

judgment and undertaking given by the learned Solicitor General to the Hon'ble

Supreme Court. Applicants quoted several Supreme Court judgments in support

of their assertions.





5.     Respondents in their reply take objection for making the Chairman of the

Railway Board as a party though no order of the Railway Board has been

challenged. Applicants are seeking a direction to promote them as AEs in Group

B cadre w.e.f. 3.12.2010 after 7 years from the date of panel under the guise of

notification dt 26.7.2017 and integrated seniority list dated 18.7.2017. Therefore

the OA is time barred. Further, the instant OA is not maintainable based on the

principle of res-judicata since the OA 1263/2010 wherein similar relief of

promotion as AEs on being allowed was contested in the Hon'ble High Court

and the same was decided in WP no 9942/2014 and CC no 166/2016. Similarly

CP 170/2014 in OA 170/2014 was also closed by the Tribunal. Therefore

nothing survives in the present OA to adjudicate. Respondents have cited the

Hon'ble Supreme Court observation in Shankar Das v U.O.I (1991) 3 SCC 47 in

support of their assertion that the applicants have no right to be appointed against

select list just because their names appear in the select list. 
One another

judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in union 
Territory of Chandigarh v Dilbagh

Singh and Ors
 (1993) 1 SCC 154 wherein it was held that a candidate who finds

a place in the select list may have no vested right to be appointed to any post, in

the absence of any specific rules entitling him to the same, he may still be

aggrieved of his non-appointment if the authority concerned acts arbitrarily or in

a malafide manner. Moreover, as per Para 205 of Railway Establishment Manual

Vol-1 the currency of a panel will be current for a period of 2 years from the date
                                         12                              OA 636/2017 & batch



of the approval of the competent authority or till a fresh panel on the basis of

next selection becomes available whichever is earlier. Hence the panel prepared

on 3.12.2010 is no longer valid and therefore applicants can make no claim to

include their names in this panel. Coming to details, based on 2010 notification

to fill up 22 vacancies of AEs, 7 SC, 1 ST and 4 UR candidates who were senior

and qualified were adjusted against 12 notified UR vacancies. Against 8 SC and

2 ST vacancies, 2 SC and 1 ST employee were empanelled leaving 6 SC and 1

ST vacancy unfilled which were carried forward to the next selection initiated

vide notification dated 2.1.2013. The 15 employees were empanelled and

promoted as AEs on 30.12.2010. However, some of the reserved community

employees were made as in-charge AEs as per Hon'ble High Court order and

subsequently regularised. The exercise commenced with the Tribunal allowing

OA 1263/2010 on 30.8.2013 directing to promote applicants there in based on

original seniority which was challenged in WP 9942/2014 in the Hon'ble High

Court.
 Writ petition referred to was decided directing respondents on 29.4.2015

to form an opinion based on Supreme Court directives in M. Nagaraj case,

within a period of 6 months and in the interregnum period make in charge

arrangements for administrative convenience. In accordance with the orders of

the Hon'ble High Court promotions ordered in favour of the private respondents

in OA 1263/2010 were treated as purely adhoc /in-charge basis till further orders

vide proceedings dated 24.6.2015. In the meanwhile, some of the applicants

moved the Tribunal for contempt in CP 170/2015 but since the Hon'ble High

Court has decided the matter in WP 9942/2014 & WP 39158/2013, it was closed

giving liberty to the applicant to revive the same, if necessary, after the expiry of

the time granted by the Hon'ble High Court in the said writ petitions. Chief

Personnel Officer of the respondents organisation complying with the Hon'ble
                                       13                             OA 636/2017 & batch



High Court Order has issued proceedings dt 9.12.2015 in regard to formation of

opinion as per M.Nagraj judgment for promoting SC/ST employees as AEs and

concluded that the reservation in promotion was in order. Consequent to this

development contempt in CC no 166 of 2016 was filed in Hon'ble High Court

which was closed on 23.3.2016 keeping in view the proceedings dated 24.6.2015

and 9.12.2015. Therefore orders of Hon'ble High Court being fully complied,

relief sought by the applicants to include them in panel dated 3.12.2010 is

infructuous. The 6 months time granted by the High Court in WP 9942/2014 was

for formation of opinion and not in regard to making in charge arrangements of

the SC/ST employees. 
Claim of the applicants that they will get the contempt

petition reopened is not possible since it is impermissible under law as per

observation of the Hon'ble Apex Court in 
Sudhir Vasudeva, Chairman CMD

ONGC & Ors v M. George Ravi Shekaran & Ors
 (2014) 3 SCC 373 wherein it

was held that once Tribunal disposes a contempt petition after recording its

satisfaction about compliance, it has become functus officio and therefore MA in

CP for issuing further or additional directions or orders, cannot be entertained.

In the absence of any orders of the Hon'ble High Court to revert the 6 SC/ST

employees (Private respondents) or restrict their in-charge arrangements up to 6

months in OA 1263/2010, they were continued as AEs and regularised on

18.7.2017.   Accordingly the pay and allowance of the promoted SC/ST

employees were regulated. Respondents also clarify that pay and allowance

would be one and the same for working as in- charge or on a regular basis. Also

including the name of the applicants in the zone of consideration against

notification dated 26.7.2017 is in order, since the applicants were not promoted

as AEs on 3.12.2010. The notification dated 2.1.2013 was cancelled in view of

the dismissal of WP 11724/2013 filed by SC/ST employees and to abide by the
                                        14                            OA 636/2017 & batch



decision in WP no 16280/2014 of the Hon'ble High Court vide common order

dated 29.4.2015.






      Respondents, in regard to integrated seniority list states that they have

followed the Railway Board instructions contained in RBE 46/2010.              The

relative seniority of employees coming from different streams will be determined

with reference to length of non-fortuitous service. SC/ST employees are entitled

to consequential seniority and accordingly Integrated seniority list dt. 18.7.2017

was prepared. They have quoted RBE (33/2002),         RBE      (29/2008),     RBE

(46/2010) in support of their contentions. The undertaking given by ld. Solicitor

General on 29.9.2016 was in regard to future promotions based on reservation

and therefore, there is no violation of RBE 117/2016. Railway Board, which is

the apex body to frame policy guidelines has not issued any instructions to

deviate from the existing instructions in regard to reservation in promotion and

consequential seniority. Relief sought are plural in nature.



6.    Heard Ld. counsel representing respondents, SC/ST employees in OA

964/2017 and the applicants.      We have gone through the reply statement,

rejoinder and the other documents plus the material papers submitted, in depth.



7.    I)     The issues are about reservation in promotions and release of

integrated seniority list. The OAs have originated consequent to the observations

of the Hon'ble High Court in Contempt Case No.1646 of 2015 & 166 of 2016

wherein it was held as under:





      ―As an exercise has been undertaken by the Railways, and in terms of said
      exercise they have now effected promotions, all questions, regarding the
      manner in which the data was gathered, whether such an exercise accords
      with the law declared by the Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj or not, and
      whether promotions made, after such exercise, in favour of the scheduled
      castes is valid or not, are again matters which can only be examined in
      independent proceedings, and not in proceedings under the Act.‖
                                       15                              OA 636/2017 & batch




      In the context of the Hon'ble High Court observation stated supra,

applicants being aggrieved that the directions in Nagaraj concerning reservations

in promotion have not been followed, approached the Tribunal through the

instant OAs seeking the relief of placing them in the select panel dated 3.12.2010

and quashing of the notification dated 27.7.2017 as well the integrated seniority

list issued on 18.7.2017.



      II)    Before, going into the issue in its virgin form, preliminary

objections raised by the respondents need to be looked into.



      Respondents claimed that the Chairman, Railway Board should not have

been made a party to the OA, since no Railway Board order has been challenged.

True, no railway Board order has been challenged but the OA is all about

challenging reservation in promotion which is a policy matter. No authority other

than the Railway Board is competent to formulate a policy for the respondents

organisation as per the submission of the respondents in OA Nos. 738 &

964/2017. Besides, respondents need to bear in mind that Railway Board has

issued RBE 117/2016 which covers the matter in question. Hence Railway Board

is a proper and necessary party to the OA. Therefore, objection raised is

overruled.





      The other preliminary objection is about the OA being time barred

because the panel issued on 3.12.2010 cannot be called into question after 7

years. Case details bring forth the fact that the OA 1263/2010 has been admitted

within the life span of 2 years of the select panel dated 3.12.2010, which in fact

constitutes the eye of the cyclone. The dispute on being adjudicated by the

Tribunal in OA 1263/2010, was dealt at length by Hon'ble High Court of

Judicature at Hyderabad, on being contested by the respondents in WP No.
                                         16                              OA 636/2017 & batch



9942/2010 & batch and in the contempt petition 166/ 2016. Aggrieved that the

orders of the Hon'ble High Court have not been complied with, the present OA

has been filed. Besides, a Miscellaneous Petition No.253 of 2017 in regard to

non-implementation of the orders of the High Court in W.Ps. cited supra, is

pending adjudication by the Hon'ble High Court. Therefore, litigation lingers.

Thus, the OA cannot be construed to be time barred. It is alive and kicking.



      A corollary to the above preliminary objection is that the filing of the

instant OA is against the principle of res judicata. Respondents affirm that the

issue has been settled as per orders of the Hon'ble High Court whereas

applicants counter the said submission by claiming that the very genesis of the

instant OA is non compliance of Hon'ble High Court Order. Therefore, there is

an inherent disagreement between the two, which has to be resolved by

examining as to which side the angel of justice showers her divine grace. Till a

conclusion is arrived at, it cannot be said that the principle of res judicata was

infringed.





      Respondents have also cited the Hon'ble Apex Court verdict in Shankar

Das v U.O.I (1991) 3 SCC 47        in support of their assertion that the applicants

have no right to be appointed against select list just because their names appear

in the select list. We agree with the contention of the respondents but it should

not be forgotten that they have a right to be considered. This right is indefeasible.


Also they have quoted the observation of Hon'ble Supreme Court observation in


Union Territory of Chandigarh v Dilbagh Singh and Ors
 (1993) 1 SCC 154 to

buttress their stand. However, a specific rule namely para 203.5 of IREM which

is statutory in nature has not been followed by the respondents and their action

has been alleged to be arbitrary by the applicants
, 
the said judgment
 is thus not

relevant to the present case.


                                        17                             OA 636/2017 & batch



      III)   Having responded to the preliminary objections, we would now

focus our attention to the nucleus of the issue namely reservation in promotions.

The issue has been prefaced with the submissions of the Ld. Counsel as under.



   a) Senior Counsel for the respondents :





Ld counsel has argued that from among the applicants in OAs 636,738 &

964/2017 excepting for Sri K.Srinivas Rao who cleared the exam, others have

either failed or did not appear in the exam held pursuant to the notification dated

26.7.2017 and thus have no locus standi to agitate for any promotion. However,

the exam referred to was set aside in OA 486/2018 and on being challenged,

Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in WP No.37990/2018

suspended the Tribunal order and a final decision is awaited. When an order is

stayed/suspended, it does not mean that the order is erased out of existence as

observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v.



Church of South India Trust Assn., (1992) 3 SCC 1. The order is in suspended

animation which is akin to being in coma till it is resurrected to life or put to

final rest depending on the view taken by the Hon'ble High Court in the matter.

It exists but inoperable. Besides, applicants being aggrieved that despite Hon'ble

High Court order being in their favour in WP 9942/2014 & batch, respondents

ignoring the same is a matter under scrutiny in the instant OA. Hence the

submission of the Sr. Respondent counsel is not in the realm of reason. Sr

Counsel further claims that as per the Hon'ble High Court order, requirements as

stipulated in Nagaraj judgement have been adhered to and promotions granted.

The Ld. Sr. Counsel argued that since orders of the High Court have been

complied there is nothing left in the issue to adjudicate excepting for some

academic interest. Learned counsel cited observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court

in 3 cases, wherein it was held that Courts should not engage themselves in
                                        18                                OA 636/2017 & batch



issues of academic interest. Is it or not, in the present case, would be an aspect

which will reveal itself as we progress covering the contours of the case. If

required, Ld Sr Counsel has also submitted that 6 posts can be kept vacant till the

issue is resolved so that the process of promotions can be carried on.



   b) Senior Counsel for the private respondents in OA 964/2017


Ld. senior counsel has submitted that grievances are of three types. Firstly,

where there are reasons, secondly where there are none and thirdly where

reasons exist but not projected. Instant case comes under the 3 rd category. The

letter dated 9.12.2015 has not been challenged in OAs 738/2017 and 964/2017.

There are no pleadings challenging the notification dated 18.7.2017. The

seniority list pertains to Group C and the private respondents promoted as AEs

belong to Group B and any challenge to Group C seniority list should not impact

the positions held by the private respondents. The SC/ST employees have been

promoted as AEs on own merit. The applicants have no case as the orders of the

Hon'ble High Court have been complied with in promoting the private

respondents as AEs. Looks simplistic on the face of it but in the issue on hand

there are many legal connotations which demand a proper and appropriate

response.   The letter dated 9.12.2015 was issued confirming that the Chief

Personnel Officer has formed an opinion as per the dictates of Nagaraj Judgment.

Reservation in promotion is a policy matter, as explained above, and therefore it

is for the Railway Board to formulate an opinion and not the CPO. Incidentally,

the decision of the CPO in arriving at an opinion is against the Railway Board

order 117/2016. Therefore, the letter dt 9.12.2015 does not require a challenge

since it is not in accordance with rules and law. Now let us come to the

integrated seniority list of 18.7.2017. Seniority list is issued so that it becomes

the basis for career planning of the employees. Hence the rule, that objections, if
                                        19                            OA 636/2017 & batch



any, are to be obtained from the employees and then the seniority list is to be

finalised. Applicants have serious reservations in respect of integrated seniority

list on many grounds. The important one being non adherence to the pre-

conditions laid in Nagraj and the OAs totally hinge on this aspect. Therefore,

issues revolving around reservation in promotion be it seniority list, promotions

etc are encompassed by the OAs filed. At this juncture it is to be mentioned that

the promotion of the private respondents i.e. 6 SC/ST employees is still under

adjudication. Therefore the presumption of the Ld. Sr. Counsel that since SC/ST

employees now belong to the elevated Group B grade and any pleading

forwarded to show them in the lower grade of Group C is irrational, in our view,

is not based on a logical premise.     The Courts are to unveil the mask of an

administrative decision to scrutinize as to whether such a decision would

withstand a sizzling legal scrutiny. We would touch upon this aspect from

different dimensions as we meander through the case in the paras that follow.



      c) Counsel for the applicants


Ld counsel for the applicants has submitted that there has been flagrant violation

of the orders of the Hon'ble High Court. Repeatedly respondents have been

taking decisions which go against the lawful claims of the applicants leading to

filing of a spate of OAs seeking justice. Action of the respondents is unlawful

and there has been hostile discrimination of the applicants.



iv)      Submissions of learned counsel and documents submitted would indicate

that the entire dispute is fixated around the decision to provide reservation in

promotions. Hon'ble High court, while dealing with the issue, in WP

39158/2013 & batch on 29.4.2015 has ordered as under :

                                         20                               OA 636/2017 & batch



      VIII. CONCLUSION:



      "As the Tribunal has merely followed the law laid down by the Supreme
      Court in M. Nagaraj, in allowing the O.As, the orders of the Tribunal, to the
      extent it declared the action of the Railways in providing reservation in
      promotion without fulfilling the parameters laid down in M. Nagaraj to be
      illegal, do not necessitate interference. The fact however remains that,
      despite the amendment to the Constitution by insertion of 
Articles 16(4-A)

      and (4-B) nearly fourteen years ago, the members of the Scheduled Castes
      and the Scheduled Tribes still face uncertainty on whether or not they are
      entitled for reservation in promotion, and to be extended the benefit of
      consequential seniority. This predicament, they find themselves in, is for no
      fault of theirs but is on account of the failure of the Union of India to gather
      data, and form its opinion, on the parameters laid down by the Supreme
      Court in M. Nagaraj. The prevailing uncertainty can only be put an end to if
      the petitioner-Railway is directed to undertake the aforesaid exercise, and
      take a decision, within a specified time frame.



      The Writ Petitions are, accordingly, disposed of directing the petitioner-
      Railways to undertake and complete the exercise of gathering data, and
      forming its opinion on the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in M.
      Nagaraj, with utmost expedition and, in any event, not later than six months
      from the date of receipt of a copy of this Order. As this stalemate cannot be
      permitted to effect railway administration, and the services it renders to the
      public at large, it is open to the petitioner-Railways to make in-charge
      arrangements in the interregnum, making it clear to those, who are given
      charge of the posts, that this arrangement is temporary and would continue
      only till the exercise of formation of opinion, on the need to provide
      reservation in promotion, is completed. The miscellaneous petitions pending,
      if any, shall also stand disposed of. No costs."



 
The most important observation is that the respondents have been directed

by the Hon'ble High Court to undertake and complete the exercise of gathering

data, and form its opinion on the parameters laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in 
M. Nagaraj Vs. Union of India
, 2006 (8) SCC 2012. It is thus to be

assessed as to whether the respondents have acted as directed by the Hon'ble

High Court. The parameters which are to be worked upon as set out in Nagaraj

judgment are extracted here under:






      "The impugned constitutional amendments by which 
Articles 16(4A)
 and
      
16(4B)
 have been inserted flow from 
Article 16(4).
 They do not alter the
      structure of 
Article 16(4).
 They retain the controlling factors or the
      compelling reasons, namely, backwardness and inadequacy of
      representation which enables the States to provide for reservation keeping
      in mind the overall efficiency of the State administration under Article

      335. These impugned amendments are confined only to SCs and STs. They
      do not obliterate any of the constitutional requirements, namely, ceiling-

                                        21                             OA 636/2017 & batch



      limit of 50% (quantitative limitation), the concept of creamy layer
      (qualitative exclusion), the sub-classification between OBC on one hand
      and SCs and STs on the other hand as held in Indra Sawhney, the concept
      of post-based Roster with in-built concept of replacement as held in R.K.
      Sabharwal.



      We reiterate that the ceiling-limit of 50%, the concept of creamy layer and
      the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of
      representation and overall administrative efficiency are all constitutional
      requirements without which the structure of equality of opportunity
      in 
Article 16
 would collapse.



      However, in this case, as stated, the main issue concerns the "extent of
      reservation". In this regard the concerned State will have to show in each
      case the existence of the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness,
      inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency before
      making provision for reservation. As stated above, the impugned provision
      is an enabling provision. The State is not bound to make reservation for
      SC/ST in matter of promotions. However if they wish to exercise their
      discretion and make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable
      data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation
      of that class in public employment in addition to compliance of Article

      335. It is made clear that even if the State has compelling reasons, as
      stated above, the State will have to see that its reservation provision does
      not lead to excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling-limit of 50% or
      obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely.

      Subject to above, we uphold the constitutional validity of the 
Constitution
      (Seventy-Seventh Amendment) Act, 1995
, the 
Constitution (Eighty-First
      Amendment) Act, 2000
, the 
Constitution (Eighty-Second Amendment) Act,
      2000
 and the 
Constitution (Eighty-Fifth Amendment) Act, 2001
.

      We have not examined the validity of individual enactments of appropriate
      States and that question will be gone into in individual writ petition by the
      appropriate bench in accordance with law 
laid down by
 us in the present
      case."



      Thus the Nagaraj judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court makes it clear that

the State must establish that there exists compelling reasons to provide

reservations in promotions. The reasons in brief are:





      i)     The data regarding inadequacy of their representations has to be

             collected and thereafter a decision need to be taken


      ii)    Overall efficiency of the State administration under Art 335 has to

             be borne in mind


      iii)   The concept of creamy layer has also to be dealt with.

                                        22                              OA 636/2017 & batch




      iv)    To collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the

             Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.





Further, to make things vivid on the issue of reservation in promotion, Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Manoram's Case, (2010) 10 SCC 323, has held that


             ― When a member belongs to SC/ST caste gets selected in the open
             competition field on the basis of his own merit, he will not be
             counted against the quota reserved for Scheduled castes, but will be
             treated as open candidate, will apply only in regard to recruitment
             by open competition and not to the promotion effected on the basis
             of seniority -cum-suitability.‖

Hon'ble Supreme Court has further reinforced the observations made in Nagraj

in 
B.K.Pavitra & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors
 on 9 February, 2017, in Civil

Appeal no. 2368 of 2011, which makes it imperative on part of the respondents

to act as per the conditions laid down therein for providing reservation as under.


      ―We are of the firm view that a fresh exercise in the light of the judgment
      of the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj is a categorical imperative. The
      stand that the constitutional amendments have facilitated the reservation in
      promotion with consequential seniority and have given the stamp of
      approval to the Act and the Rules cannot withstand close scrutiny
      inasmuch as the Constitution Bench has clearly opined that 
Articles 16(4-
      A)
 and 
16(4-B)
 are enabling provisions and the State can make provisions
      for the same on certain basis or foundation. The conditions precedent have
      not been satisfied. No exercise has been undertaken. What has been
      argued with vehemence is that it is not necessary as the concept of
      reservation in promotion was already in vogue. We are unable to accept
      the said submission, for when the provisions of the Constitution are treated
      valid with certain conditions or riders, it becomes incumbent on the part of
      the State to appreciate and apply the test so that its amendments can be
      tested and withstand the scrutiny on parameters laid down therein.


            It is clear from the above discussion that exercise for determining
      ‗inadequacy of representation', ‗backwardness' and ‗overall efficiency', is
      a must for exercise of power under 
Article 16(4A).
 Mere fact that there is
      no proportionate representation in promotional posts for the population of
      SCs and STs is not by itself enough to grant consequential seniority to
      promotes who are otherwise junior and thereby denying seniority to those
      who are given promotion later on account of reservation policy. It is for
      the State to place material on record that there was compelling necessity
      for exercise of such power and decision of the State was based on material
      including the study that overall efficiency is not compromised. In the
      present case, no such exercise has been undertaken. The High Court
                                       23                                OA 636/2017 & batch



      erroneously observed that it was for the petitioners to plead and prove that
      the overall efficiency was adversely affected by giving consequential
      seniority to junior persons who got promotion on account of reservation.
      Plea that persons promoted at the same time were allowed to retain their
      seniority in the lower cadre is untenable and ignores the fact that a senior
      person may be promoted later and not at same time on account of roster
      point reservation. Depriving him of his seniority affects his further
      chances of promotion. Further plea that seniority was not a fundamental
      right is equally without any merit in the present context. In absence of
      exercise under 
Article 16(4A)
, it is the ‗catch up' rule which is fully
      applies. It is not necessary to go into the question whether the concerned
      Corporation had adopted the rule of consequential seniority.

One another relevant observation of the Hon'ble Apex Court In S. Panneer

Selvam & Others v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors, 2015 (10) SCC 292, which has

a bearing on the instant case is reproduced for reference to take a view on the

dispute in the OA.





      The question before the Hon'ble Apex Court was whether in the absence

      of any policy decision by the State for giving consequential seniority to

      candidates promoted on the basis of reservation prior to a senior general

      category candidate, claim for consequential seniority could be accepted.

      Answering the question in the negative, it was held that in absence of

      provision for consequential seniority, ‗catch up' rule will be applicable

      and the roster point promotees cannot claim such consequential seniority.

      The senior general candidates will regain their seniority on being

      promoted. Observations relevant in this regard are as follows :



            ―34. If we look at the above comparative table of the service
            particulars of the appellants and the respondents, it is seen that the
            contesting respondents U. Palaniappan joined the service almost
            seven years after the appellants, his seniority is automatically
            accelerated at an unprecedented rate and as on 1-4-2004 his
            seniority rank as ADE is 150 and seniority of V. Appadurai is 120.
            The appellants who are qualified and senior than the contesting
            respondents are placed much below in rank in comparison to the
            person belonging to the reserved class promotes who were
            promoted following the rule of reservation. It is to be noted that the
            SC ST employees in the present case have been promoted
            temporarily under Rule 39(a) and Rule 10(a)(i) of the General Rules

                                         24                             OA 636/2017 & batch



              with the condition that their inclusion in the promotional order shall
              not confer on them any right whatsoever in the service.

              Determination of seniority is a vital aspect in the service career of
              an employee and his future promotion is dependent on this.
              Therefore, determination of seniority must be based on some
              principles which are just and fair. In the absence of any policy
              decision taken or rules framed by the State of Tamil Nadu regarding
              Tamil Nadu Highways Engineering Service, accelerated promotion
              given to the respondents following rule of reservation in terms of
              Rule 12 will not give them consequential accelerated seniority.

       xxxx



 
36. In the absence of any provision for consequential seniority in
              the rules, the ―catch-up rule‖ will be applicable and the roster-point
              reserved category promotes cannot count their seniority in the
              promoted category from the date of their promotion and the senior
              general candidates if later reach the promotional level, general
              candidates will regain their seniority. The Division Bench appears
              to have proceeded on an erroneous footing that 
Article 16(4-A)
 of
              the Constitution of India automatically gives the consequential
              seniority in addition to accelerated promotion to the roster-point
              promotes and the judgment of the Division Bench cannot be
              sustained.‖

The observation in regard to assessment of the backwardness of the sections of

the society belonging to       Schedule castes and Schedule Tribes          fell for

consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme court             in the context of the

constitution perse providing reservation to such sections. The issue was

adjudicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Jarnail Singh & Ors Vs. Lachhmi

Narain Gupta & Ors
, 2018 (10) SCC 396, as under :






 
―     21. Thus, we conclude that the judgment in 
Nagaraj
 (supra) does not
      need to be referred to a seven-Judge Bench.
 
However, the conclusion in
      
Nagaraj
 (supra) that the State has to collect quantifiable data showing
      backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, being
      contrary to the nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) is held to
      be invalid to this extent.‖

On application of the legal principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme court in

various judgments cited supra, to the decision of the respondents we can evaluate

the variance or congruence to decide the issue under dispute. As pointed out by

learned Sr counsel during the submissions, respondents need not collect
                                       25                              OA 636/2017 & batch



quantifiable data in regard to backwardness of the Scheduled castes and

Scheduled Tribes employees as per Jarnail Singh verdict.
 However, other

parameters, which continue to hold ground, have to be adhered to.



       V)   In this regard, we find that in assessing the adequacy of

representations of SC/ST employees, Chief Personnel officer of the respondents

organisation vide letter dated 18.7.2017 claims that the data has been collected

and that there is inadequacy of their representation in the cadre in question. In

statistical terms it is advanced in the said letter that in the cadre of AEs the

representation of SCs is 27.61 % and that of the STs is 10.47 %. Together, the

percentage of representation is less than 50%. Two vital factors which deserve

mention is that primarily reservation in promotion is a policy matter which has to

be decided by the Railway Board. A decision in this regard is not within the

competence of the Chief Personnel Officer of a Zone. Railways are made of a

number of Zones. Each zone cannot have a policy of its own. Therefore, the

Railway Board, which is the Apex body of the respondents organisation, lays

down the policy. This is common knowledge and need not be further emphasized

since learned counsel for the respondents profess day in and day out before the

bench that the policy laying body for the respondents is the Railway Board and

its orders reign supreme. Besides, issue disputed is an All India issue which

calls for an All India solution and not a zonal one from the Chief Personnel

Officer. Railway Board order 117/2016 does not, in essence, permit such

initiatives by the subordinate formations of the respondents organisation. The

CPO letter has one more dissonance of asserting that the combined

representation of SC and ST employees in the AE cadre is less than 50%

glossing over the fact that reservation provided for BCs, OBCs etc have also to

be reckoned in order to assess as to whether total reservation percentage is
                                        26                            OA 636/2017 & batch



within 50% as stated in Nagraj Judgment. Without the reservation percentage

provided to other communities being indicated, it is statistically inaccurate to

affirm that the total percentage of reservation was within the ceiling limit of

50%. In fact this Tribunal on 11.1.2019, while dealing with an identical issue in

OA 1162 /2013 and batch, involving the same respondents, continued its

consistent stand on the issue by directing them as under:



      ―Unless and until a decision at the level of Ministry of Railways and
      Railway Board is taken as regards the implementation of the reservation in
      promotions, the same shall not be effected at the lower levels.‖

The signal sent to the respondents was clear and loud and yet respondents'

misreading the signal is paving the way for protracted litigation.



      VI)    Now let us evaluate the second aspect of efficiency. Respondents in

the same letter referred to, have stated that the AE posts belong to safety

category and hence candidates are subjected to a written test, viva voce and

medical tests. Unless a candidate clears the tests, he would not be empanelled.



There is no relaxation for reserved candidates in regard to the marks to be

obtained. The 6 SC/ST employees were promoted as AEs only after passing tests

prescribed without any lowering of marks to be obtained. Therefore it has to be

construed that they are efficient and capable. Consequently, efficiency in

administration has not been compromised. There can be no two views about the

fact that the SC/ST employees have cleared the exams prescribed but the

grievance is that they are junior to the UR employees who have also cleared the

exams and are eligible to be promoted like the reserved community employees.

When the legitimate promotion of UR employees is denied by the respondents, it

would lead to frustration and demoralisation, which would in turn mar the

efficiency of the respondents organisation. The contra effect in terms of morale

and efficiency on others was not reckoned by the respondents. Observations of
                                        27                              OA 636/2017 & batch



the Full Bench of Hon'ble High Court of Bihar while dealing with the issue of

efficiency in the context of reservation in promotion in 
State of Bihar & Others

vs Sushil Kumar Singh & others
 presented hereunder clears the mist in regard to

understanding the factor of efficiency.






      ―From this what can be culled out is that the important factors that
      guide the reservations under Article-16(4A) are; (a) backwardness, (b)
      inadequacy of representation and (c) overall efficiency of the State
      administration under Article-335. It is also important to note that while
      providing reservation or making other provisions, the State must ensure
      that a) the facility so created does not lead to excessiveness so as to breach
      the ceiling limit of 50%, b) the creamy layer excluded and denied the
      benefit of reservation, and c) the facility is not extended indefinitely. In
      effect, 6 indicia were identified and stipulated.



      It is essential to bear in mind that the reservation provided for
      under Article-16(4) is substantially different from the one under Article-
      16(4A). The former is a facility that enables persons to enter the State
      service by relaxing the norms of selection or the parameters of merit
      which are stipulated for the posts, in general. Through that process, a
      person who is otherwise not eligible to be appointed, is enabled to enter
      service under the State. The target group for this is unemployed persons,
      of a certain categories. In contrast, Article-16(4A) deals with the situation
      where the target group is already enjoying the benefit of employment on
      the basis of reservation under Patna High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt.
      30-07-2015 Article-16(4), and the effort is only to push them to higher
      places in the hierarchy. In a way, it can be said that while Article-
      16(4) deals with the primary and basic aspect of protective discrimination,
      i.e. reservation, the one under Article-16(4A) is about the secondary
      aspect. Obviously, for this reason the Parliament as well as the
      constitutional courts have made subtle distinction and have chosen to
      stipulate different parameters for the two.



      For example, the benefit under Clause-16(4) is in respect of "services
      under the State" whereas the objective underlying Article-16(4A) is to
      ensure representation of the SC/ST in the "class or classes of posts in the
      service under the State". Similarly, the necessity to ensure that the
      efficiency in administration does not suffer, is applied with a bit of greater
      emphasis for the reservations under Article-16(4A) than the one
      under Article-16(4). These are only the broader aspects.

      The argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the situation
      obtaining at a particular time may not remain the same and after a few
      years it may not be possible to keep pace with changing scenario classwise
      or servicewise, cannot be accepted. The reason is that the facility
      under Article-16(4A) is not aimed at ensuring mere survival or livelihood.
      It results in pushing of a person most junior in the service to higher
      positions by stealing march over his seniors. That can be done only when
                                        28                               OA 636/2017 & batch



      the circumstances explained by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court are Patna
      High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt. 30-07-2015 found to be existing.

      The appellants cannot ignore the specific language employed in Clause-
      4(A) indication that the reservation under it shall be in a class or classes in
      a service, under the State, and the service as a whole as indicated in Clause
      (4) of Article-16.



      That the reservation under Article-16(4A) of the Constitution is with
      reference to class or classes of posts in the service under the State is
      evident not only from the text of the provision, but also the various
      judgments rendered on the subject.



      It is also essential to keep in mind that the makers of the Constitution
      sounded a note of caution inArticle-335 that the special measures taken for
      the benefit of persons belonging to SC/ST category must be such that the
      efficiency in the administration is not compromised. Induction at the entry
      level through reservation may not pose any serious problem to
      administrative efficiency. The reason is that once a person with basic
      qualifications is inducted into service he would be subject to some training
      and methods as are applicable to anyone. On contrast, the reservation in
      promotion would render the concept such as seniority, merit irrelevant and
      enable a person belonging to Patna High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt.
      30-07-2015 SC/ST category to get promotion out of turn, that too with the
      consequential seniority.



      An out of turn promotion may certainly make the person happy. However,
      the element of frustration or dissatisfaction in the person who is
      superseded cannot be ignored. The efficiency of administration which is
      adequately protected in Article-335 of the Constitution is likely to suffer a
      double dent on account of out of turn promotions. The first is that a
      relatively inexperienced person would occupy a higher position, and
      second is that an otherwise experienced and senior person is subjected to
      an element of frustration and he may not be able to execute with the same
      amount of interest as he used to do in the normal circumstances. It cannot
      be examined from the point of view of the beneficiary alone.

      The creamy layer is another vexed question vis-à-vis the reservations
      under Article-16(4A). It is true that in Indra Sawhney's case (supra), the
      Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the concept of creamy layer does not
      apply to the reservations in favour of persons belonging to SC/ST
      category. 
However, in 
Nagraj
's case (supra), their Lordships observed at
      more places than one, that the creamy layer must be excluded from the
      purview of reservation under Patna High Court LPA No.1066 of 2015 dt.
      30-07-2015. That provision, not only from the body of the judgment, but
      also from the last sentence of the judgment, this aspect is clear.‖



      Therefore, in the context of the observation of the full bench of the

Hon'ble High Court of Bihar, the respondents did make a perfunctory study of
                                         29                             OA 636/2017 & batch



the impact of reservations in promotions on efficiency and not in its entirety and

that too, by an incompetent authority. We need to remember that an organisation

is made of a group of people who form a team. Efficiency of the organisation

depends on team work. If some of the team members are discriminated even

though they are entitled for certain benefits, then, those discriminated would be

de-motivated and disenchanted leading to inefficiency. This requires a close

study and it is for the respondents to make an effort in this direction and that too

at the Apex level. Passing the exam could be one parameter to assess efficiency

but not necessarily the only parameter to decide efficiency. Therefore, even in

this regard the orders of the Honourable High Court of A.P have not been carried

out.





Besides, the aspect of creamy layer has not been delved upon by the respondents

in their reply statement, as this is an integral and intrinsic part of the Nagraj

Judgment.





       VII) The principle of promoting SC/ST employees based on own merit

is only in recruitment through open competition, but not for promotions effected

on the basis of seniority -cum-suitability, as enunciated in Manorama Case by

the Hon'ble Apex Court. In the instant case promotion was granted on the basis

of Seniority cum Suitability.   Therefore, UR employees who were qualified as

per 2010 notification being senior should have been considered as per law but

contravened by the respondents.





 
VIII) Another interesting aspect of the letter of the chief Personnel officer

dated 18.7.2017 is that the 6 SC/ST employees who were shown against the UR

vacancies in the select panel dt 3.12.2010 are now shown against SC/ST

vacancy. Any modification in the Group B promotion approved by the GM has
                                      30                             OA 636/2017 & batch



to be ratified by the Railway Board. Respondents did not produce any such

document ratifying their decision. Therefore, letter dated 18.7.2017 is invalid.

Respondents did attempt to seek post facto approval of their decision vide their

letter dated 3.4.2017, but till date Railway Board has not responded in writing.

Besides, the whole issue in OA 1263 was about promoting SC/ST employees

who were      junior to the applicants, against UR vacancy. Respondents by

attempting to adjust the 6 SC/ST employees against SC/ST vacancies vide letter

dated 18.7.2017 have conceded that the select panel dated 3.12.2010 is not in

order. Albeit, the letter did not have the stamp of approval of the Railway

Board, it also suffered from one another major inadequacy of not complying with

the orders of the Hon'ble High Court, wherein it was held that regular promotion

can be granted only by fulfilling the parameters specified in 
Nagaraj
 Case. Such

compliance which is a must, being absent, regular promotions ordered vide letter

dated 18.7.2017 are irregular. Promotions even to SC/ST vacancies without

addressing the core aspects of Nagraj judgment are illegal. In fact they

contravene the High Court orders to the extent that they are not in conformity

with Nagaraj judgment.






      IX) One another allied and intricate issue which has been thrown open

by the letter dated 18.7.2017 of the respondents is that the Hon'ble High Court

has ordered that after collecting the data, respondents need to form an opinion

and then issue orders of promotion with prospective effect. Respondents, instead

of doing so, have retrospectively regularised the     promotion of the private

respondents in OA 1263/2010 from 30.12.2010, which is not in resonance with

the directions of the Hon'ble High Court in CC 166 of 2016 as under:



      ―Even if, as is now contended before us by Sri L. Ravi Chander, learned
      Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Railways, the data gathered
      show the need to provide reservation, the Railways could not have

                                        31                              OA 636/2017 & batch



      regularised the promotions made earlier, and could only have effected
      promotions afresh after the data, gathered in terms of the judgment of the
      Supreme Court in M. Nagaraj, showed the need to provide reservation, for
      members of the scheduled castes, in promotion posts. ‖

After the contempt case CC 166/2016 was filed, the error being noticed,

respondents have     issued corrigenda to the earlier proceedings, and have

informed the employees concerned that the adhoc promotions given to them

earlier must be treated as an in-charge arrangement; and the earlier order,

regularising their services, was being withdrawn. To this extent respondents

have corrected the mistake of showing the promotion as in-charge and not as

regular. However, the order of the Hon'ble High Court of granting promotions

afresh from a date after the exercise of gathering the data was glossed over. In

short granting promotion to the private respondents in OA 1263/2010 vide order

dated 18.7.2017 by asserting that the promotion order issued through O.O no

326/2010 dt 30.12.2010 is in order and accordingly continuing the promotion on

regular basis from the date of issue, is flagrant violation of the orders of the

Hon'ble High Court in Contempt petition 1646 of 2015 & 166 of 2016.



      X)     Complication in the issue is further aggravated by the respondents

in cancelling the orders of promotion and issue of fresh orders of selection on

18.7.2017 since it leads to another legally valid question, as to whether the

respondents are empowered to issue such orders. Promotion to the post of AE is

on selection basis through a written exam, viva voce etc. If once a selection is

cancelled, then fresh orders could be given only after one were to go through

the selection process prescribed, lest it would be irregular. It is not explained in

the reply statement as to under what rule such orders were issued. However,

respondents, on their part approached the Railway Board vide letter dated

3.4.2017 by presenting the background of the case in terms of litigation in OA
                                        32                              OA 636/2017 & batch



1263/2010 and the Hon'ble High Court Orders thereon, for approval of the

following:





      ―Since Hon'ble CAT /Hyd has ordered against empanelling reserved
      employees under UR vacancies and Hon‗ble High Court, Hyderabad has
      confirmed the Hon'ble CAT's order, the next 7 UR employees are to be
      now included in the panel against UR vacancies and the 6 reserved
      employees (5 SC & 1 ST) who were earlier promoted against UR
      vacancies on own merit and were made as in charge arrangement are to be
      adjusted against SC/ST vacancies.



      As per extant instructions for modifications in any Group B panel should
      have the approval of Railway Board, since the panel has been approved by
      the General Manger. In case it is decided to include the names of 7 more
      employees in the panel dated 3.2.2010, then the revised panel would be as
      indicated in Annexure -12.‖

The communication gives an inkling that the respondents are veering round to

the point of view that the orders of the Tribunal and the Hon'ble High Court are

to be abided by. Nevertheless, approval of the Board has not been received in

writing, though the respondents claim that they have received oral permission to

act as indicated above, by submitting a letter dated 20.11.2018 from Dy CPO to

the learned standing counsel for the respondents. It is difficult to appreciate that

in matters of National policy having litigative significance, the Railway Board

would give oral permission. Even, if given, in certain emergency circumstances

they are backed by written orders on a later date. Public institutions are manned

by issue of formal orders and not by Informal ones, since the later go against the

basic tenets of organisational management, particularly so, when a humungous

organisation like the Railways is involved. Till date, respondents have failed to

produce any document to the effect that the Railway Board has approved the

promotion effected vide letter dated 18.7.2017. Hence, the order of promoting

the SC/ST employees needs a relook since it portends modification of Group B

promotions for which Railway Board approval is a must and only after

                                        33                             OA 636/2017 & batch



complying with the pre-conditions of Nagraj as ordered by the Hon'ble High

Court in W.P No.9942/2014 & batch.





 
XII) Having come half the distance, a recapitulation of the gist of the

case along with other associated legal battles fought not referred to so far would

help in keeping focus on the main issue. The factual matrix of the issue will

reveal that the applicants have been put to disadvantage all along for reasons best

known to the respondents. To begin with OA 1263 of 2010 was allowed with a

direction to fill up 7 UR vacancies with UR qualified senior employees instead

of SC/ST employees who were juniors to the applicants. When challenged in

Hon'ble High Court in W.P 9942/2014 and batch, respondents were given 6

months time to form an opinion keeping in view the directions contained in


Nagaraj
 case and decide the issue. Accordingly, respondents claim that they have

followed the orders of Nagraj and issued orders favouring SC/ST employees on

18.7.2017 but it was found to be in gross violation of Nagraj Judgment as

expounded in paras supra. Contempt petition 166 of 2016 wherein Hon'ble High

Court has faulted the decision of the respondents by observing that in-charge

arrangement, which was permitted, do not enable respondents to either effect

promotions on adhoc basis or grant promotions retrospectively. Erroneous orders

of the respondents issued earlier were cancelled and consequently contempt case

was closed. Nevertheless, in the process respondents have kept open the legal

issue as to whether, after cancelling the orders of promotion granted to the 6

SC/ST employees, are they competent to issue fresh orders of selection without

subjecting the candidates to go through the selection procedure of clearing the

exams etc without being backed by any rule and admittedly by an incompetent

authority. Thereafter, 2013 notification was issued to fill up 7 SC/ST and 1 UR

unfilled backlog vacancies of 2010. UR employees filed OA 203/2013 to set
                                        34                              OA 636/2017 & batch



aside the notification which was allowed and on being challenged in the High

Court in WP no 16280/2014, Hon'ble High Court has upheld Tribunal order.

Later, SC/ST employees filed OA 392/2013 for extending zone of consideration

which was dismissed. Tribunal order was challenged in W.P no 11724 of 2014 in

which UR employees got themselves impleaded and the Hon'ble High Court

upheld the decision of the Tribunal directing respondents to treat the 8 vacancies

as UR. Instead of complying with the orders of High Court respondents,

cancelled the notification of 2013 on 26.7.2017 and on the same day issued

fresh notification by showing 7 SC/ST vacancies indicated in 2013 as SC/ST

backlog vacancies instead of showing them as UR vacancies. Thereby, once

again infringing the orders of the Hon'ble High Court. However, the explanation

given by the respondents was that they implemented the relevant High Court

orders. When they did cancel, respondents ought to have shown the 8 vacancies

notified in 2013 as UR. Further, the notification of 2017 indicated 18 UR and 8

SC/ST vacancies. In the 8 SC/ST vacancies, 7 back log unfilled vacancies of

2010 which were notified in 2013 figure. They were ordered to be shown as UR

along with one more UR, totalling to 8 vacancies by the Hon'ble High Court, but

has not been adhered to. In compliance with the orders of the High Court in WP

11724/2014 the vacancies notified in 2017 ought to be 18 + 8 UR. It is not

explained in clear terms as to why the orders of the Hon'ble High Court have not

been followed. Cancellation of the 2013 notification would not mean that the

Hon'ble High Court order has been complied with. It is difficult to comprehend

such a decision when the orders are crystal clear in the matter. Applicants have

been fighting a legal battle to place them in the select panel dt. 3.12.2010 and the

respondents on their part not only denied the same but made it more injurious to

the cause of the applicants by showing them in the zone of consideration for
                                       35                             OA 636/2017 & batch



2017 notification. Aggrieved applicants filed the instant OAs challenging the

order of the respondents for not including their names in the select panel dt

3.12.2010 and issue of integrated seniority list dt 18.7.2017 showing them in the

zone of consideration and excluding the 6 junior SC/ST employees as if there

promotion to AE is regular.






        XIII) Besides, OA 964/2017 and OA 738 of 2017 were filed challenging

the integrated seniority list and the zone of consideration prepared based on the

said list, as the erstwhile junior SC/ST employees names have been placed above

the names of erstwhile senior UR employees in violation of Railway Board order

No 117 of 2016 and against law relating to reservation in promotion. Seniority is

the main foundation which decides the eligibility of employees to appear in

examination held for selection posts and for further career progression vertically

or horizontally. Instead of concentrating on measures to resolve the issues raised

in the OAs and the WPs respondents have been issuing a flood of notifications

inviting serious legal challenges.





        XIV) Against the backdrop of the above recapitulation with the

concurrent developments, response of the respondents and the submissions of the

counsel, if analysed, would enable us to take a fair view on the issue. The Ld.

Senior counsel for the respondents has vehemently argued that the issue on hand

is only of academic nature since the High Court orders on the subject have been

implemented lock, stock and barrel. 
In support of his submission Ld Counsel

cited the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Loknath Padhan vs

Bireender Kumar Sahu
 in 1974 AIR 505,1974 SCR (3) 114 wherein it was held

that:






        ―We are, therefore, of the view that, the Orissa Legislative Assembly
        being dissolved during the pendency of this appeal, it is now wholly
                                        36                             OA 636/2017 & batch



      academic to consider whether the respondent was disqualified under s.

      9A at the date of nomination and since that is the only ground on which
      election of the respondent is challenged, we think it would be futile to hear
      this appeal on merits. We accordingly dismiss the appeal with no orders as
      to costs all throughout.



The other citation is in regard to 
Ramdas Athawale vs Union of India and ors
 in

W.P (civil) no 86 of 2004, wherein Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:


      34. One more aspect of the matter. The petitioner in this writ petition
      under 
Article 32
 of the Constitution has challenged the validity of
      proceedings in the Lok Sabha commencing from 29th January, 2004 on
      the grounds stated hereinabove, with which we have dealt with in the
      preceding paragraphs. The petition has become anfractuous, since the Lok
      Sabha was dissolved and thereafter two elections have been held. The
      issue raised in the petition is purely a hypothetical question. There is no
      existing lis between the parties. It is settled practice that this Court does
      not decide matters which are only of academic interest on the facts of a
      particular case.



The third one is in 
Moti Ram vs Param Dev and Anr
 reported in 1993 AIR 1662,

1993 SCR (2) 250 wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as follows:


      A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the respondent to the
      appeal that in view of the dissolution of the assembly it was academic to
      decide whether or not the respondent was disqualified under section 9A.
      Upholding the said preliminary objection, this court has held that the court
      should not undertake to decide an issue unless it is a living issue between
      the parties and if an issue is purely academic, in that its decision one way
      or the other would have no impact on the position of the parties, it would
      be waste of public time and indeed not proper exercise of authority for the
      court to engage itself in deciding it.



As can be seen the judgments cited are not relevant to the instant case since the

issues therein are about challenging related events which occurred before the

dissolution of the Lok Sabha and assembly referred to and therefore no purpose

would be served when the bodies themselves have been dissolved. Hence they

are academic which the courts should not undertake. However, Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the same citation has held that the courts should take up live issues. The

case of the applicants is live, since the cause for promotion continues since the

filing of OA 1263/2010 and followed by a series of OAs and orders of
                                         37                               OA 636/2017 & batch



Honourable High Court in WPs 9942/2014 and batch culminating in the present

OAs. Therefore, the issues raised by the applicants are very much live and not

academic, calling for a genuine resolution. Besides, the learned Sr Respondent

Counsel has also submitted that one applicant passed, another one did not appear

in the exam and the rest of the applicants failed in the exam conducted in

pursuance of 2017 notification. Therefore, only the case of the applicant who has

passed the exam has to be adjudicated and not in regard to the others. At this

juncture, it is to be pointed out that this Tribunal in OA 636/2017 on 3.8.2017

has observed when the applicants sought interim relief as under:



       ―In view of the above, we are not inclined to interdict the Notification
       dated 26.7.2017 at this stage. However, any promotion in pursuance of
       Annex.A-1 Notification dated 26.7.2017 shall be subject to the result of
       the OA and that the participation of the applicants in the selection process
       in pursuance of the notification is without prejudice to their rights in the
       OA.‖

The Tribunal has observed that the applicants participating in the selection

process in pursuance of the notification of 2017 will not prejudice the reliefs

sought in the OA. Hence the presentation of the Ld. Sr. Standing Counsel

referred to, has no legs to stand since the climax has not been reached. The

applicants hope to persuade the respondents that their claim stems from justice in

as-is-where-in condition when it started, which, true to speak, is being kept alive

by oxygenating it with the intervention of the judicial forums in accordance with

law. Committing a wrong and perpetuating the same on the applicants years on is

unfair to say the least. Nevertheless, we are still at the interval stage and there is

long way to go. Applicants have filed Miscellaneous Petition no 253 of 2017 to

recall the order in CC 166 of 2016 which is to be adjudicated by the Hon'ble

High Court. The continuous cause of action arose because of the respondents

issuing letters dated 18.7.2017 & 26.7.2017 and hence their validity or otherwise

is still under judicial scrutiny.

                                          38                              OA 636/2017 & batch



      XV) As we continue our journey through the maze of alleys by which the

case traverses, we are confronted with the assertion of the respondents that as

per para 205 of IREM, the life of a select panel is only two years. If it be so, it is

not explained as to how the respondents could promote on 18.7.2017 the 6

SC/ST employees, private respondents in OA 1263/2010, as AEs based on the

select panel of 2010. Rules are to be followed uniformly but not selectively.


Forget not, that there is another part of the IREM which is extracted below:



      ― Para 205 - Currency of Panel.--The panel will be current for a period of
      2 years from the date of approval of the competent authority or till a fresh
      panel on the basis of next selection becomes available whichever is earlier.

      Where provisional panels are drawn the currency will count from the date
      of approval of the provisional panel. If the operation of an approved panel
      has been held in abeyance either wholly or partly as a result of injunction
      from the Court of Law the currency of the panel should be reckoned after
      excluding the period covered by the Court's directive. Before operating the
      panel after the vacation of the junction/after disposal of the case by the
      Court of Law, the personal approval of the General Manager should be
      taken.



The sum and substance of the para is that when the panel is under judicial study

it will continue to breathe life till a finality is arrived on the matter. In fact, OA

1263/2010 was filed before the expiry period of 2 years from the date of issue of

select panel on 3.12.2010 and the litigation on the issue is live to this date.



      XVI) To be precise the action of the respondents is against Hon'ble

Supreme Court observation on the issue and in utter disregard of the railway

Board order RBE 117/2016 , wherein it was instructed not to issue any orders of

promotion based on reservation. RBE 117 /2016 was issued based on an

undertaking given to the Hon'ble Apex Court by the Ld. Solicitor General of

India. Respondents disregarding their own instructions is strange and is violative

of the legal principle 
laid down by
 the Hon'ble Apex Court in a catena of

judgments dealing with the need to follow rules. In fact, Hon'ble Supreme Court
                                           39                              OA 636/2017 & batch



has taken a serious view of violation of instructions and rules as brought out here

under.





         The Hon'ble Supreme Court observation in T.Kannan and ors vs S.K.
         Nayyar     (1991) 1 SCC 544 held that ―Action in respect of matters
         covered by rules should be regulated by rules‖. Again in Seighal's case
         (1992) (1) supp 1 SCC 304 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has stated that
         ―Wanton or deliberate deviation in implementation of rules should be
         curbed and snubbed.‖ In another judgment reported in (2007) 7 SCJ 353
         the Hon'ble Apex court held ― the court cannot de hors rules‖

The Railway Board order RBE 117 of 2016 is reproduced hereunder in view of

the its intrinsic significance to the instant case.




―The aforesaid Contempt Petition (C) No. 314/2016 in SLP (C) No. 4831 of
2012 came up for hearing on 29.09.2016. In follow up of hearing of the above
mentioned contempt case, Shri Ranjit Kumar, the Learned Solicitor General of
India vide its letter No. SG/2/2016-262(I) dated 29.09.2016, has communicated
and advised M/o. Railways as under:-



                ―.. After hearing the matter for some time, the Court felt that the
         main matter is required to be decided and therefore, adjourned the
         Contempt Petition to be decided along with the main matters and fixed the
         date of hearing for 22.11.2016 as the first case. The court stated that if the
         Solicitor General wants to make a statement that no further promotions of
         reserved category persons to unreserved posts will be made relying on the
         circulars dated 10.08.2010/ 14.09.2010, then they would not pass any
         further interim order. I informed the court that the Government would not
         pass any further order of promotion relying upon either of these two
         circulars or on the basis thereof. I also conveyed to the Court that I will
         write a letter informing of about my statement to the Court to you and to
         the Secretary, DOP&T and the Chairman, Railway Board. That is why I
         am addressing this letter to you so that all the Departments are conveyed
         of the assurance given in the Court that in the matter of making any
         promotion of a reserved category officer/ employee the Department
         concerned would not rely upon or make the basis of such promotion to an
         unreserved post based on the circulars dated 10.08.2010 and 14.09.2010
         and that any violation thereof will bring about a definite contempt....‖

      (Circular dated 14.9.2010 as quoted by the Ld. SG be read as 01.09.2010
which is RBE 126/2010 dated 01.09.2010 issued based on DOP&T's OM dated
10.8.2010)

       In view of the above assurance, received from the Ld. Solicitor General of
India, it is advised that Railway Board's RBE No. 126/2010 dated 01.09.2010, is
held in abeyance with immediate effect till further advice, and all further

                                      40                             OA 636/2017 & batch



promotions of reserved category persons to unreserved posts will not be made by
ignoring Railway Board's RBE No. 126/2010 dated 01.09.2010 which in turn
was based upon the DOP&T OM dated 10.08.2010 & under reference No. (i) &

(ii) above. However, all promotions order henceforth shall be subject to
outcome of the main SLPs and the above mentioned contempt petition which are
still pending.



      The above may please be brought to the notice of all concerned for
information and strict compliance.‖



      The above undertaking was given by the ld. Solicitor General on

29.9.2016 and the respondents issued the letter purporting to promote the SC/ST

employees on 18.7.2017. Therefore, the promotion ordered is consequent to the

undertaking and hence, invalid.





 
XVII)             Incidentally, it is an issue on which other divisions of

the (SCR) South Central Railway Zone of the respondents organisation have

taken a decision by reverting the SC/ST employees who were promoted without

adhering to the norms of Nagraj and the undertaking given to the Hon'ble

Supreme Court by the Ld. Solicitor General. To be specific, Vijayawada division

coming under the jurisdiction of the SCR has issued orders vide letter dt

4.12.2015, withdrawing the regular promotion as per the directions of the

Hon'ble High Court. It is obviously beyond comprehension as to why

Secunderabad and Guntakal divisions under the same Zone failed to follow suit.

The respondents from 2 to 4 have a precedent to adopt. Not doing so is against

the observation of Hon'ble Supreme Court of having one policy for different

railway zones in 
Abid Hussain v. Union of India
, (1987) 1 SCC 532, which

reads as under:-






 
It is not disputed that the Air-conditioned Coach-In-Charges-
      Attendants are being paid overtime allowances for extra duty hours
      exceeding 96 hours in two weeks in the Western Railway, Central
      Railway and Eastern Railway. There is no justification for denying
                                        41                            OA 636/2017 & batch



      overtime allowances on the same basis to the Air-conditioned
      Coach-In-Charges-Attendants in the Northern Railway. We
      accordingly direct the Union of India and the Railway
      Administration to pay with effect from July 1, 1984 the overtime
      allowances to the Air-conditioned Coach-In-Charges-Attendants
      working in the Northern Railway on the same basis on which the
      Air-conditioned Coach-In-Charges-Attendants in the other three
      Railways
, 
referred to above
, are paid. All arrears of such
      allowances up to date shall be paid as early as possible and in any
      event not later than four months from today. The benefit of this
      order shall be extended to all such employees including those who
      have retired and those who have not joined as petitioners herein.




In 
G.C. Ghosh vs Union of India
 ( 1991) supp. 2 SCC 497, Hon'ble Supreme

court has further held that when one zonal railway has taken a stand, the other

zonal railway need to go by the same. Surprisingly, in the present case, different

divisions in the same zone have taken different stands, which go against the

directives of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to. Not only they have taken a

different stand but upgraded the 6 SC ST employees to a higher grade, though

they were supposed to be in-charges till the Nagaj exercise is completed and that

too, in administrative interests, thereby raising a question on the intent of the

order dated 24.6.2015.






XVIII)       Further, respondents have cancelled notification dated 2.1.2013 for

filling up of 8 AE vacancies, on 26.7.2017, as per Hon'ble High Court order in

WP 16280/2014 wherein fulfilling the parameters 
laid down in
 
Nagraj
's case is

necessary to provide reservation in promotion. On the same date coming up with

a fresh notification for filling up 26 posts of AE without complying with the

orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad of showing 8 posts

of 2013 notification as UR and without completing the exercise of Nagaraj in its

entirety as ordered by the Hon'ble High Court in W.P 9942/2014 and batch dated

29.4.2015, does not stand the test of reason.


                                        42                              OA 636/2017 & batch



XIX) An associate issue related to reservation in promotion is the publication of

integrated seniority list, by the respondents which has been challenged in OAs

738/2017 & 964/2017. After the Hon'ble High Court passed orders in WP No

11724 of 2013 on 22.12.2016, the earlier notification issued on 2.1.2013 for

selection to the post of AE has been cancelled on 26.7.2017. Simultaneously, on

the same day another notification was issued to fill up 26 posts of AEs, including

SC/ST vacancies was published. To take the exercise forward, integrated

seniority list was issued. Based on the integrated seniority list, the final

eligibility list was issued on 10.10.2017. The grievance of the applicants is that,

despite prevailing instructions and law : not permitting reservation in

promotions, consequential seniority and own merit for SC/ST employees;

respondents have issued integrated seniority list placing the SC/ST category

employees above the applicants in the OAs referred to based on the

consequential seniority granted to them by virtue of accelerated promotions

given earlier. On the basis of the said integrated seniority, eligibility list was

issued by placing SC/ST employees above the applicants without obtaining the

willingness/unwillingness of the employees coming within the zone of

consideration and also including the names of the employees who are going to

retire within 2 months. The final eligibility list has thus once again been wrongly

drawn up again with juniors to the applicants finding a place above them. The

patent illegality resorted to will enable the erstwhile juniors to the applicants to

get selected against UR vacancies, leaving the applicants who are seniors not

getting selected as it had happened in the past forcing the UR employees to

contest in OA 1263/2010 which was allowed and confirmed by the High Court

in WP 9942 & batch to the extent of directing the respondents to abide by the

parameters in Nagraj judgment. At this juncture, we recall the submission of the
                                           43                               OA 636/2017 & batch



Ld. Sr. Counsel for the private respondents that the grievances of the applicants

have not been projected, as is required, falls flat since the applicants, as

expounded above, have been periodically agitating stating their grievance in no

uncertain terms. It is also pertinent to add that executive instructions

communicated through Railway Board orders cited by the respondents cannot

overrule law laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in judgments cited. If the

Railway Board has not given any instructions on consequential seniority, it

would not mean that the respondents from 2 to 4 can act against law.

Constructive restrainment is the hallmark of administrative efficacy when

matters of administrative jurisdiction are involved with implicit legal

implications.




Continuing on the subject of integrated seniority list, it must be stated that

employees from different streams of the respondents organisation are eligible to

appear for selection as AE. Hence drawing up a common seniority is required

which is termed as integrated seniority list. In an integrated seniority list feeder

cadre employees from different streams like works and permanent way streams

to which the applicants belong to and from other streams like drawing, Bridges,

Track Machine, EWS, design etc are shown. Seniority has to be based on the

length of service as 
laid down in
 para 203.5 of the IREM vol-1 which reads as

under:





         ―Para 203.5 of IREM: Since employees from the different streams
         will be eligible to appear for the selection, their integrated seniority
         for purposes of the selection should be determined on the basis of
         total length of non-fortuitous service rendered in grade Rs. 6500-
         10500 (R.S.) and above. In other words the date of appointment to
         the grade Rs. 6500-10500(R.S.) on a non fortuitous basis will be
         the criterion. ‖

The UR employees though senior based on length service but they are shown as

junior to SC/ST employees because of accelerated promotions. By doing so,

                                         44                            OA 636/2017 & batch



respondents are disregarding their own instructions as 
laid down in
 Para 203.5 of

IREM which is statutory in nature.





XX) In addition, as cited in paras supra, Hon'ble Apex court observation in 
K.

Manorama
 case, that an SC employee getting selected in open competition on

own merit can be shown against UR vacancy but not in respect of promotion

effected on the basis of seniority cum suitability.
 The selection to AE is based on

seniority cum suitability and therefore Manorama case applies, which the

respondents failed to follow. The Hon'ble High Court of Rajasthan in WP no

2773 of 2012 has quashed Railway Board order RBE no 126/2010 wherein

SC/ST employees were ordered to be adjusted against UR vacancy on own merit

or reservation roster irrespective of the fact whether the promotion is made by

selection method or non selection method. The order of the Hon'ble High Court

of Rajasthan when challenged in SLP 219 of 2015 filed by the Railways, the

SLP was dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 12.1.2015. Therefore,

respondents have to comply with the said judgment without any iota of doubt,

which is in favour of the applicants.




An identical matter was adjudicated by         Hon'ble Principal Bench of this

Tribunal in OA no 221/2008 dated 2.12.2010, wherein, it was held as under:



 
― We have applied our mind to the pleadings and the contentions
      raised by the learned counsel representing the applicants on the
      issues as mentioned above, but are of the view that once, in brevity,
      it is the case of the applicants that when no compliance of pre-
      conditions are spelled out in 
M. Nagaraj
's case has been done,
      reservation in promotion with the accelerated seniority shall have to
      be worked out in the way and manner as per the law settled earlier
      on the issue. If that be so, we need to have to labour on the issues
      raised by the applicants, as shrewdly, if the position is already
      settled , the only relevant discussion and adjudication in this case
      can be and should be confined to non observation of the pre-
      conditions for making accelerated promotions as valid. We have
      already held above that the respondents have not worked out or
      even applied their mind to the pre-conditions as mentioned above


 
45                              OA 636/2017 & batch



         before giving effect to the provisions of Art 16(4A); for that reason,
         circular dated 29.2.2008 vide which the seniority of SC/ST railway
         servants promoted by virtue of rule of reservation /roster has to be
         regulated in terms of the Railway Boards letter dated 8.3.2002 and
         13.1.2005 has to be quashed. There is a specific prayer to quash
         instructions dated 8.3.2002 & 13.1.2005 as well, but there would be
         no need to do as the same have been discussed in the case of
         Railways itself in the matter of 
Virpal Singh Chauhan
 (supra), and
         commented upon. While setting aside instructions dated 29.2.2008,
         our directions would not give accelerated seniority to SC & ST
         employees till such time pre-conditions on which alone Aritcle 16
         (4 A) of the constitution is to operate, are complied with.‖


         Thus the SC/ST employees are not entitled for accelerated seniority till

such time the pre-conditions 
laid down in
 Nagraj judgement are strictly

followed.
 
We have observed in the aforesaid paras that the respondents have not

adhered with any of the parameters laid in 
M. Nagraj
 case. By keeping in view

the observation of the Hon'ble Principal Bench, this Tribunal in 1263/2010 has

held that the applicants therein shall be considered on the basis of their

performance in the written test and interview and on the basis of their original

seniority and not treating the private respondents as seniors to the applicants for

the purpose of promotion to the post of AE. The Tribunal order has been upheld

by the Hon'ble High Court of A.P in W.P 9942/2014 and batch. Hence issue of

the integrated seniority list goes against the very grain of the observation of this

Tribunal in OA 1263/2010 which was upheld by the Hon'ble High Court.


         XXI) Respondents did issue RBE No 117/2016 directing the subordinate

formation not to follow the orders issued in RBE 126/2010. Therefore, the issue

of the integrated seniority list is against the very essence of RBE 117/2016,

which was issued in compliance with the undertaking given to the Hon'ble Apex

Court.





         Till date the respondents have not framed a rule or any policy as to how to

go about in regard to reservation in promotions by fulfilling the pre-conditions
                                           46                               OA 636/2017 & batch



in Nagraj. In the absence of a rule or a policy from the Railway Board, the

policy formulator, issue of integrated seniority list is not as per law.



          XXII) Even the order of this Tribunal to follow Nagraj in OA 333 of 2013

which was upheld by the Hon'ble High Court of A.P in WP no 20809/2014,

was carried to the Hon'ble Supreme Court in CC no 3196 of 2015 but was

dismissed. Hence respondents adhering to preconditions of Nagraj has attained

finality and therefore issue of integrity seniority list which is not in tune with

the spirit of Nagraj shall have to go.





          Similar verdicts delivered by the Hon'ble Ernakulam and Mumbai

Benches of this Tribunal in OAs 98/2014 dated 15.11.2016 and 727/2013 &

batch dt. 9.1.2019 respectively, Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in WP No.

3490/2010 favour the cause of the applicants. The law in regard to reservation in

promotion has attained finality with the vivid observations of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in M. Nagraj, B.K.Pavitra, Manorama, U.P.Power Corporation

as has been discussed in paras supra. Hon'ble Jabalpur Bench of the Tribunal in

OA 143 of 2017 has directed the respondents therein to proceed with selection

without the rule of reservation or issue fresh notification.



                The respondents claim that the applicants are seeking plural reliefs.

We do not agree with the same since seniority decides promotion and any

infringement of the promotion which was legally due to the applicants would be

a continuous cause of action. Hence, the relief sought are consequential and not

plural.





          XXIII)             To sum up, respondents have acted against the orders

of the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in WP No. 9942/2010 and

batch, by granting promotion to the 6 SC/ST employee without satisfying the
                                         47                              OA 636/2017 & batch



preconditions 
laid down in
 Nagraj. Further orders of the Hon'ble High Court in

WP No.11724/2013 to show all the 8 vacancies as UR were not followed. 
The

orders of the Hon'ble High Court were crystal clear that even if preconditions of


M. Nagraj
 case were to be followed the SC/ST employees shall be promoted

prospectively and not retrospectively. However, respondents have chosen to

promote the SC/ST employees retrospectively from 2010 instead of 2017. Legal

principles 
laid down by
 the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.Nagraj, Pavitra,

Manorama, Palaniswamy and U.P. Power Corporation have not been adhered to.

Railway Board instructions contained in RBE 117/2016           have been violated.

This is a serious violation as the Ld. Solicitor General of India has given an

undertaking to the Hon'ble Supreme Court as adduced in RBE 117/2016 that

reservation in promotions will not be resorted to as per orders of the DOPT vide

letters dated 10.8.2010 and 1.9.2010. The later letter dt 1.9.2010 was circulated

by the Railway Board as RBE/126/2010. Learned Solicitor General has also

stated that any action taken on the basis of letters dated 10.8.2010/1.9.2010 will

be construed as contempt of the Supreme Court. Respondents, we are sure, are

aware of the consequences of going against the advice of the Ld. Solicitor

General. Para 203.5 of IREM has not been followed. IREM instructions are

statutory in nature and therefore violating such instructions is a matter of serious

concern.
 
Vijayawada division of SCR has reverted the SC/ST employees for not

fulfilling the preconditions of 
Nagraj
 case, where as Secunderabad and Guntakal

divisions of SCR have not reverted the SC/ST employees albeit they too have

not complied with the preconditions of Nagraj. In the process, the law 
laid down

by
 the Hon'ble Supreme Court that there shall be a uniform policy for Railways

was brazenly ignored. Respondents have disobeyed their own instructions which

the Hon'ble Supreme Court has not taken to kindly as per citations cited supra.

                                       48                             OA 636/2017 & batch



      XXIV)               Respondents, being a model employer, should not


discriminate employees. On one hand to favour a section of employees they

have violated law, rules and the orders of the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature

at Hyderabad on the subject and on the other hand applicants have been denied

the legitimate benefits which they are eligible by gross violation of rules and

law. Such action of the respondents fringes on hostile discrimination. Any

decision which is discriminatory has to be struck down, lest equals would be

made unequal's. Applicants in the instant case being more than equals to the 6

SC/ST employees by being senior to them were made juniors i.e. unequals by

taking a decision which is not supported by rules or law. Respondents have not

shown any valid principle to term their decision as rational. Our         view is

supported by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:





      27. 
In 
Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of
      India
(1979) 3 SCC 489 again this Court observed that a discriminatory
      action of the Government is liable to be struck down, unless it can be
      shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was
      based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational,
      unreasonable or discriminatory.




Therefore the discriminatory decision of the respondents in not promoting the

applicants has to be repudiated.




An addendum to the discriminative approach of the respondents was the

arbitrariness in taking a wrong decision. Hon'ble High Court has brought out

legal certainty in the issue by directing to abide by the Nagraj pre-conditions

before proceeding in the matter. Respondents having admitted that it is the

Railway Board which decides the policy and that they have not received any

instructions on the matter in question, the lower formation proceeding in the

matter was ill advised. By giving some margin to the respondents that the urge to

resolve the issue was the prompter, yet it was not explained as to how an
                                       49                             OA 636/2017 & batch



incompetent authority like the CPO can lay down the policy in the absence of

instructions from the Railway Board and that too, in a way deviating from the

orders of the Hon'ble High Court. The discernable principle that emerges from

the impugned orders referred to does not pass the test of reasonableness. More so

in the context of the facts and circumstances of the case. A mode and procedure

was prescribed by the Hon'lbe High Court which was apparently not adhered to.

State action has to be based on reason. It is beyond comprehension as to why

without fully engaging the Railway Board in the matter, local authorities have

proceeded without any authorial jurisdiction. Governance has to be by rule of

law and not as per the whims and fancies of those in power, however mighty

they may be. Hon'ble High Court has set the legal principles with many clear

instructions, perfect to the full stop and the coma. Yet not following them is a

matter of serious concern. Respondents gave many interpretations but the ones

which were expected to uphold the legal principles postulated by the Hon'ble

High Court are missing. Thus the reply statements were hollow bereft of the

substance required. 
There are certain general principles which govern exercise of

power in constitutional democracies. These principles are like reasonableness in

taking a decision, application of mind, non discrimination, consistency, fairness

and so on. The said principles form the bed rock of administration. Decisions

incongruent to the principles spoken of, would come under the domain of

arbitrariness. While making the above observations we are guided by the

interpretations      given    by     the      Hon'ble     Apex      Court         in


East Coast Railway & Anr. v. Mahadev Appa Rao & Ors
, and

K. Surekha v.Mahadev Appa Rao & Ors. decided on July 7, 2010, in CA No.

4964    of    2010     &     Civil   Appeal    Nos.     4965-4966    of      2010,

which is reproduced hereunder:


                              50                                 OA 636/2017 & batch




18. There is no precise statutory or other definition of the term
"arbitrary". 
In 
Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and Ors. v. State
of U.P. and Ors.
 (AIR 1991 SC 537), this Court explained that
the true import of the expression "arbitrariness" is more easily
visualized than precisely stated or defined and that whether or
not an act is arbitrary would be determined on the facts and
circumstances of a given case. This Court observed:






      "The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is
      more easily visualized than precisely stated or
      defined. The question, whether an impugned act is
      arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered on the
      facts and in the circumstances of a given case. An
      obvious test to apply is to see whether there is any
      discernible principle emerging from the impugned
      act and if so, does it satisfy the test of
      reasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for
      doing an act and there is no impediment in
      following that procedure, performance of the act
      otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose
      any discernible principle which is reasonable, may
      itself attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every State
      action must be informed by reason and it follows
      that an act uninformed by reason, is arbitrary. Rule
      of law contemplates governance by laws and not by
      humour, whims or caprices of the men to whom the
      governance is entrusted for the time being. It is trite
      that `be you ever so high, the laws are above you'.

      This is what men in power must remember,
      always."



19. Dealing with the principle governing exercise of official
power Prof. De Smith, Woolf & Jowell in their celebrated book
on "Judicial Review of Administrative Action" emphasized
how the decision-maker invested with the wide discretion is
expected to exercise that discretion in accordance with the
general principles governing exercise of power in a
constitutional democracy unless of course the statute under
which such power is exercisable indicates otherwise. One of
the most fundamental principles of rule of law recognized in all
democratic systems is that the power vested in any competent
authority shall not be exercised arbitrarily and that the power is
exercised that it does not lead to any unfair discrimination. The
following passage from the above is in this regard apposite:

                                        51                               OA 636/2017 & batch



                 "We have seen in a number of situations how the
                 scope of an official power cannot be interpreted in
                 isolation from general principles governing the
                 exercise of power in a constitutional democracy.

                 The courts presume that these principles apply to
                 the exercise of all powers and that even where the
                 decision-maker is invested with wide discretion,
                 that discretion is to be exercised in accordance
                 with those principles unless Parliament clearly
                 indicates otherwise. One such principle, the rule of
                 law, contains within it a number of requirements
                 such as the right of the individual to access to the
                 law and that power should not be arbitrarily
                 exercised. The rule of law above all rests upon the
                 principle of legal certainty, which will be
                 considered here, along with a principle which is
                 partly but not wholly contained within the rule of
                 law, namely, the principle of equality, or equal
                 treatment without unfair discrimination."




Any arbitrary decision infringing law has to be quashed since it is illegal. We

find the decisions of the respondents in not selecting the applicants in 2010 and

publishing the integrated seniority list in 2017 as arbitrary and irrational.

Therefore they for aforesaid reasons they get branded as illegal. Observations of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court when applied to the decisions of the respondents

they get marked as arbitrary without any iota of doubt.




When we delve deep into the issue from the aspect of equality we cannot resist

in observing that equality is a born enemy to arbitrariness. An arbitrary decision,

like the respondents decision, lacks constitutional logic thereby defying 
Article

14
 of the constitution. Non-arbitrariness pervades 
Article 14
 like a flower in full

bloom with the splendour of different hues of colour and irresistible fragrance.


Article 14
 dictates equal and fair treatment to the citizens. We find neither, in

the decisions of the respondents, despite the leading answers provided by the

Hon'ble High Court on the issue. There was a sweeping discretion invoked by

an authority other than the incompetent authority in taking the decision, thereby

decision taken decaying into un-explainable arbitrariness leading to an absence
                                        52                               OA 636/2017 & batch



of a fair procedure to be followed, which is the soul of 
Article 21.
 A body

without a soul is as good as dead wood. So too, the decisions of the respondents

on the issue in question, given the background of the case and legal position as

expounded by the higher judicial fora in the matter. We draw inspiration in

observing, as we did, from the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Royappa, Maneka Gandhi and Charles Shobraj cases as inscribed below



      3. 
In 
E.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.
(1974) 4 SCC 3 this Court observed as

      under: (SCC p. 38, para 85)


      ―85. ... From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to
      arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies;
      one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the
      whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is
      arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to
      political logic and constitutional law and is, therefore, violative of
      
Article 14
, and if it affects any matter relating to public
      employment, it is also violative of 
Article 16.
 
Articles 14
 and 
16

      strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and
      equality of treatment.‖


      24. 
In 
Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
(1978) 1 SCC 248 this
       Court observed as under: (SCC pp. 283-84, para 7)

      ―7. ... Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and
      dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and
      doctrinaire limits. ... 
Article 14
 strikes at arbitrariness in State action
      and ensures fairness and equality of treatment.
 
The principle of
      reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an
      essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades 
Article 14

      like a brooding omnipresence....‖

       
Charles Sobraj v. Supdt., Central Jail
, (1978) 4 SCC 104

      Fair procedure is the soul of 
Article 21
, reasonableness of the restriction
      is the essence of 
Article 19(5)
 and sweeping discretion degenerating into
      arbitrary discrimination is anathema for 
Article 14.






Going forward, albeit we do not like to use strong expressions, but facts

and circumstances of the case, compel us to state strongly with all the force

which English language can command,           that   respondents have repeatedly
                                         53                           OA 636/2017 & batch



wronged the applicants by denying promotion due to the them.        Allowing the

respondents to take advantage of the wrong done by them would tantamount to

perpetuating injustice rather than doing justice to the persons wronged. Hon'ble

Supreme Court observation in 
Somesh Tiwari v U.O.I & Ors
 in CA 7308 of

2008, given hereunder, is relevant to the instant case.


 
―27. This Court in 
Commissioner, Karnataka Housing Board v. C.
      Muddaiah
, [(2007) 7 SCC 689 ] laid down the law, thus :-




      "32. The matter can be looked at from another angle also. It is true that
      while granting a relief in favour of a party, the Court must consider the
      relevant provisions of law and issue appropriate directions keeping in
      view such provisions. There may, however, be cases where on the facts
      and in the circumstances, the Court may issue necessary directions in the
      larger interest of justice keeping in view the principles of justice, equity
      and good conscience. Take a case, where ex facie injustice has been meted
      out to an employee. In spite of the fact that he is entitled to certain
      benefits, they had not been given to him. His representations have been
      illegally and unjustifiably turned down. He finally approaches a Court of
      Law. The Court is convinced that gross injustice has been done to him and
      he was wrongfully, unfairly and with oblique motive deprived of those
      benefits. The Court, in the circumstances, directs the Authority to extend
      all benefits which he would have obtained had he not been illegally
      deprived of them. Is it open to the Authorities in such case to urge that as
      he has not worked (but held to be illegally deprived), he would not be
      granted the benefits? Upholding of such plea would amount to allowing a
      party to take undue advantage of his own wrong. It would perpetrate
      injustice rather than doing justice to the person wronged."



 
XXV) Respondents have ex facie done injustice to the applicants.

Representations did not evoke a just response. Facts do establish that the

respondents have unfairly denied the due promotion to the applicants. Taking

advantage of the wrong committed by the respondents in promoting the SC/ST

employees they are       perpetuating the wrong by issuing notification and

integrated seniority list in 2017 against the legal principles 
laid down by
 the

Hon'ble Supreme Court, Hon'ble High Courts, Hon'ble Principle Bench and
                                         54                              OA 636/2017 & batch



other Hon'ble benches of this Tribunal. Unless such actions are interdicted,

grave injustice would be done to the applicants.






       XXVI)         From the aforementioned facts, evidently, the action of the

respondents is against rules, discriminative, arbitrary and hence illegal.




a)     This Tribunal is of the considered view that the applicants should have

been placed in the select panel dated 3.12.2010 against 2010 notification.

However, since a stay is in operation in regard to the exam conducted with

reference to an interlinked issue in W.P Nos.40693/2018 & 37990/2018 filed in

the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad, the placement of the

applicants in the panel dated 03.12.2010 has to necessarily wait till the disposal

of the WPs and depending upon the final outcome of the writ petition. In the

event of their placement against the 2010 notification, as a logical corollary, they

would also be entitled to notional seniority from 3.12.2010 and allowed to draw

pay and allowances from the date of joining the promoted posts on notional basis

and their pay re-fixed from the date of their actual joining and arrears thereof

being paid.





 
Placement of the applicants with retrospective date shall apparently result

in the reversion of 6 SC/ST employees who got their promotion. In the case of

those who are still in service, that exercise has to be carried out and after putting

them to notice, reversion orders be passed and their pay be re-fixed. However,

excess payment be not recovered in view of the dictum of the Apex Court in the

case of 
State of Punjab vs Rafiq Masih
 (2015) 4 SCC 334. So is the case with

reference to revision of pension to those who have already retired in that there

cannot be any recovery of excess pension paid, and downward revision is also

subject to availability of any provisions in the Rules of Pension; otherwise not.


 
55                               OA 636/2017 & batch



The respondents ought to draw the integrated seniority list and process the

selection in regard to the notification dt.26.07.2017 by adhering to the

preconditions      
laid      down       in
 
Nagraj
       case      and       IREM

instructions on the subject, subsequent to the Railway Board laying down the

policy in regard to policy of reservation in promotions. Proper adherence to the

orders of the Hon'ble High Court on the subject is of paramount importance.

Interpretive logic when it goes against the essence of law, will not hold good, as

is seen in the instant case. Respondents may register the same.


(b)      While we were scribing the judgment, we had the opportunity

to go through the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court pronounced on

15.4.2019 dealing with the same subject in SLP (C) No. 30621/2011 &

batch which reads as under:





―Issue notice in the fresh matters.



Until further orders, status quo, as it exists today, shall be maintained.



List all the matters on 15.10.2019.‖



      Thus, the decision that shall be arrived at by the respondent being

contingent upon the final outcome of the cases presently under consideration of

the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in respect of stay of the examination

as stated above and of the Apex Court in respect of reservations in promotion in

respect of SC/ST category, they shall await the pronouncement of the verdict by
                                        56                            OA 636/2017 & batch



the Courts and consider the case of the applicants in tune with the final decision

by the Courts. Periodical intimation to the applicants at a regular interval of

three months be also given.



(c)   Since the wheels of administration cannot be retarded by keeping any

future vacancies unfilled the Hon'ble High Court has already directed to fill up

the future vacancies on ―in charge ‖ basis, and thus, the respondents shall abide

by the said directions of the High Court.





(d)     With the above directions the OAs are disposed of.             No order

as to costs. MAs shall stand disposed of.
