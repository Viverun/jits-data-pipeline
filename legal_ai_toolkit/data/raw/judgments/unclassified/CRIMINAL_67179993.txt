Present:    Mr. Mukesh Kher, Advocate,

            This is a petition under 
Section 482
 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure for quashing of FIR No.15 dated 17.1.2016 registered at Police

Station    DLF      Phase-I,    Gurgaon,       Haryana     and    all   the

consequent/subsequent proceedings qua the petitioner.


            The petitioner is a senior citizen and is a lawyer by

profession having more than 44 years standing at the bar.


            Deceased-Keshav was working as a domestic servant with

Shri Deepak Malhotra. He found that said deceased Keshav was cleaning

the car of its owner at about 1:00 p.m. on the ill-fated day. After cleaning

the car, he put it in reverse gear and after taking turn, the car hit the

flower pots, which were kept in front of the house of the petitioner and

those were broken.



              It is further alleged that thereafter, the owner of the house

known as Kher came out of the house and took out Keshav deceased from

the car and threaten him and gave him him blows and used abusive

language against him. The petitioner also demanded price of the broken

flower pots. It is further alleged that the petitioner caught hold of the

deceased from his hair who fell on the ground and all this was witnessed

by the above said Deepak Malhotra. He tried to pacify the petitioner but

the petitioner also used bad words qua him and also threatened Deepak

Malhotra .



              Thereafter, Keshav deceased went to his room and at about

3:00 p.m. it was found that he was hanging and committed suicide. On his

statement, FIR was registered.



              After completion of investigation, the challan was submitted

before the Area Magistrate .



              I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through

the record.



              Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the

petitioner and the deceased were known to each other; as per allegations

in the FIR, the deceased hit the car in the house of the petitioner, due to

which, it caused damage to the flower pots and the petitioner demanded

price of the broken flower pots. It was tortuous act of the deceased and

due to this reason, there was an altercation between the petitioner and the

informant. There is no proximate nexus between the act of the deceased

and commission of suicide and the petitioner has been falsely implicated

on behalf of his neighbour Deepak Malhotra.


            It has been further argued that in fact the deceased

committed suicide due to the conduct of his owner Shri Deepak Malhotra

but in order to save his skin, the informant has projected a false story and

got lodged the FIR against the petitioner from one Mr. Bishan Kumar

who is the relative of the deceased.



            It has been further argued that in fact on 17.1.2016, i.e., the

ill-fated day, the petitioner had gone to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib Ji, New

Delhi and distributed langer to the first batch and he saw one Nepali

domestic help in front of his house in his car, who was in the process of

driving back the car in front portion of the house of the petitioner, as a

result of which, four flower pots placed outside the house were totally

smudged and the petitioner reprimanded him and went inside his house.

Even the petitioner was not known about the incident.


            It has been further argued that there was absolutely neither

any intention nor mens rea with regard to reprimanding the deceased and

from a bare perusal of the material available on the record, no offence is

made out with regard to abetment to suicide and there is absolutely no

nexus between the acts of the petitioner and the suicide by the deceased.

According to him, prima facie, no case is made out against the petitioner

to face trial for offence under 
Section 306
 of Indian Penal Code. 
In

support of his contentions, he placed reliance on the judgments of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Madan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat &

anr
; 2010 (

               On the other hand, learned State counsel has vehemently

contended that the petitioner not only reprimanded the deceased but also

abused him, given blows and demanded the price of dismantled flower

pots and the acts, omission and commission of the petitioner amounts to

instigation.



               This Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the rival

contentions.



               The suicide is as old as civilization itself. It is self murder or

self destruction or self killing and it is done in many ways in which life

itself can be destroyed. The reasons for the same are also numberless.

Now-a-days, most of unfortunate deaths of persons occur due to the

trivial matters, such as road-rage incidents, undue anguish and even street

quarrels.



 
Section 306
 of the Indian penal code penalises abetment of

suicide. 
Section 306
 prescribes punishment for "abetment of suicide"


while 
section 309
 punishes attempt to commit suicide. Abetment of

attempt to commit suicide is outside the preview of 
section 306
 and it is

punishable only under 309 read with 
section 107
 of IPC. Thus even

where the punishment for attempt to commit suicide is not considered

desirable, its abetment is made a penal offence. 
Section 306
 of the Indian

Penal Code penalises abetment of suicide.

Section 306
 reads as : Abetment of suicide - If any person

commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term not

exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."


               For conviction under this section, the prosecution has to

prove that :



               1. The deceased committed suicide,


               2. The accused instigated or abetted for committing suicide,

               and


               3. Mens-Rea of the accused.



               ABETMENT is an offence as defined under 
section 107
 of

Indian Penal Code, 1860. Abetment in its literal sense means,

the instigation of a person to do (or not to do) an act in a certain way, or

aid given by some person to another either of his own accord or under the

provisions governing joint and constructive liability. Abetment involves a

mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in

doing of a thing.



               Abetment of suicide involves a mental process of instigating

a person or intentionally aiding a person in committing suicide. Without a

positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing

suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.



               The intention of the legislature is very much clear that in

order to convict a person under 
section 306
 IPC, there has to be a clear

mens-rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or a direct

act which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that

 CRM-M-8661-2016                                                           6



act must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position

that he committed suicide. No straight jacket formula can be laid down to

find out as to whether in a particular case there has been instigation,

which forced the person to commit suicide. In a particular case, there may

not be direct evidence in regard to instigation, which may have direct

relationship between 
section 306
 and 
Section 107
. Therefore, in such a

case, an inference has to be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be

determined whether circumstances had been such, which in fact had

created the situation that person committed suicide. In order to convict a

person under 
section 306
, IPC, there has to be a clear mens-rea to commit

the offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the

deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and this act must have been

intended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed

suicide.



            In the case in hand, it is undisputed that the petitioner had no

prior enmity either with the deceased (who was a domestic help with

Deepak Malhotra) or his master.



            On a bare perusal of the material available on the record, it

transpires that it was a street quarrel between the deceased and the

petitioner, which erupted due to the tortuous act of the deceased. The

deceased appeared to be a minor. Probably he was not having any driving

licence and it seems that he did not know driving. He drove the car in

reverse motion which hit some part of the house of the petitioner and

dismantled some flower pots belonging to the petitioner.

             It is alleged that the petitioner abused him, reprimanded him

and demanded price of the dismantled flower pots.


             If we go through the entire incident, then the main ingredient

of the offence of abetment i.e. mens rea is missing. A person aggrieved

by the tortuous act of the wrong-doer can claim and demand

compensation of the wrong done to his property. If he demands so and

the wrong door commits suicide, it does not amount to abetment to

suicide. Similarly, use of abusive language alone without any mens rea

does not amount to abetment to suicide.



 
In 
P. Sreenivasulu v. State of A.P.
; 2004 Criminal Law

Journal 2718, when there was a dying declaration of the deceased that the

accused abused her and she committed suicide,it has been observed in

para 14 as under : -




             "14. I am of the considered view that abuses cannot amount

             to abetment, unless something more is done in pursuance of

             the said act of abuses. I am also of the consider view that the

             present case does not fall under 
Section 306
, I.P.C. as there

             is no abetment to commit suicide. In fact no charge has been

             framed and the accused was not made aware of the offence

             for which he was tried. It is the duty of the Court to make the

             accused aware of the offence for which he is being tried, lest

             it may cause prejudice to the accused. If the Court below

             feels that the case had been made out under 
Section 306
,

             I.P.C. it ought to have framed a charge under 
Section 306
,

             proceeded with further trial, instead of giving punishment

             directly for the offence under 
Section 306
, I.P.C. More so,

             during the course of 313, Cr. P. C. examination the accused

             was not questioned regarding the alleged offence under

             
Section 306
, I.P.C. which caused prejudice to the accused. In

             this case P.Ws. 1 to 3 state that it is a stove accident. The

             dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate shows that

             because of the abuses of the accused, she committed suicide

             by pouring kerosene over herself and setting fire. In fact

             there is no abetment to commit suicide. I am of the

             considered opinion that uttering of abuses will not amount to

             provocation to commit suicide and it does not constitute

             abetment. It is contended that after the police have given the

             requisition to record dying declaration, the case was

             registered. Hence, there is every possibility of anti-dating

             F.I.R. In my opinion, no offence is made out under

             
Section 306
, I.P.C. and there is no need to advert to

             investigation aspect, as it loses much of its importance.

            The instigation is a part of abetment but instigation requires

the mental element of intention as well as mens rea.


            The term instigation under 
section 107
 IPC has been

explained in Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi,

2009(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 196 : (2009) 16 SCC 605: (2010) 3 SCC

(Crl.) 367) as follows:

      "16. Speaking for the three-Judge Bench in Ramesh Kumar case

      [2001(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 537 : (2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002 SCC

      (Cri) 1088], R.C. Lahoti, J. (as His Lordship then was) said that

      instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to

      do "an act". To satisfy the requirement of "instigation", though it is

      not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what

      constitutes "instigation" must necessarily and specifically be

      suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite

      the consequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the

      accused had, by his acts or omission or by a continued course of

      conduct, created such circumstances that the deceased was left with

      no other option except to commit suicide, in which case, an

      "instigation" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit of

      anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually

      follow, cannot be said to be instigation.



      17. Thus, to constitute "instigation", a person who instigates

      another has to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the doing of an

      act by the other by "goading" or "urging forward". The dictionary

      meaning of the word "goad" is "a thing that stimulates someone

      into action; provoke to action or reaction" (see Concise Oxford

      English Dictionary); "to keep irritating or annoying somebody until

      he reacts" (see Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edn.)."


            Words uttered in a fit of anger or omission without any

intention cannot be termed as instigation.

             the allegation of harassment without there being any positive

             action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the

             accused, which led or compelled the person to commit

             suicide. In order to bring a case within the purview of

 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in the

             commission of the said offence, the person who is said to

             active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to

             facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of

             abetment by the person charged with the said offence must

                  (Criminal) 186 : (1994) 1 SCC 73, this Court has

                  observed that the courts should be extremely careful

                  in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case

                  and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose

                  of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim

                  had in fact induced her to end the life by committing

                  suicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim

                  committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary

                  petulance, discord and differences in domestic life

                  quite common to the society to which the victim

                  belonged    and       such   petulance,   discord   and

                  differences were not expected to induce a similarly

                  circumstanced individual in a given society to commit

                  suicide, the conscience of the court should not be

                  satisfied for basing a finding that the accused charged

                  of abetting the offence of suicide should be found

                  guilty."

           have to be extremely careful in assessing the facts and

           to be hypersensitive to ordinary petulance, discord and

           differences in domestic life, quite common to the society to

           which he or she belonged and such factors were not expected

           to induce a similarly circumstanced individual to resort to

           such step, the accused charged with abetment could not be

           held guilty.

Haryana and others v. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Ors.
, 1992 AIR (SC) 604

has made the following observations:-




            "In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant

            provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the

            principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of

            decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power

            under 
Article 226
 or the inherent powers under 
Section 482


            of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above,

            we give the following categories of cases by way of

            illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to

            prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to

            secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to

            lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently

            channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and

            to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein

            such power should be exercised.



                         1. Whether the allegations made in the First

                         Information Report or the complaint, even if

                         they are taken at their face value and accepted

                         in their entirety do not prima facie constitute

                         any offence or make out a case against the

                         accused.



                         2. Where the allegations in the First Information

                         Report          and   other   materials,   if   any,

                         accompanying the F.I.R. do not disclose a

                        cognizable offence, justifying an investigation

                        by police officers under 
Section 156 (1)
 of the

                        Code except under an order of a Magistrate

                        within the purview of 
Section 155 (2)
 of the

                        Code.



                        3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made

                        in the FIR or complaint and the evidence

                        collected in support of the same do not disclose

                        the commission of any offence and make out a

                        case against the accused.



                        4. Whether, the allegations in the F.I.R. do not

                        constitute a cognizable offence but constitute

                        only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation

                        is permitted by a police officer without an order

                        of a Magistrate as contemplated under 
Section

                        155 (2)
 of the Code.



                        5. Where the allegations made in the F.I.R. or

                        complaint       are   so   absurd   and       inherently

                        improbable on the basis of which no prudent

                        person can ever reach a just conclusion that

                        there is sufficient ground for proceeding against

                        the accused.



                        6. Where there is an express legal bar engrafted

                        in any of the provisions of the Code or the

                        concerned       Act   (under     which    a    criminal

 CRM-M-8661-2016                                                            15



                          proceeding is instituted) to the institution and

                          continuance of the proceedings and/or where

                          there is a specific provision in the Code or the

                          concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for

                          the grievance of the aggrieved party.



                          7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly

                          attended with mala fide and/or where the

                          proceeding is maliciously instituted with an

                          ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the

                          accused and with a view to spite him due to

                          private and personal grudge."



            In the instant case, the element of instigation is completely

missing. The petitioner had neither an enmity with the deceased nor he

had any ill-will towards him. He was the lawful owner of the flower pots.

He reprimanded the deceased for the loss caused by the latter's act and in

case he demanded cost of the broken flower pots, it was his right and it

will never be taken as an instigation to commit suicide. Similarly, if he

had lost his tamper on seeing damage to his property and called names to

deceased, it will not amount to instigation. Thus, FIR as well as

subsequent proceedings arising out of the FIR qua the petitioner are

nothing but the abuse of the process of law and those are not tenable and

liable to be quashed.



            Consequently, by exercising the powers under 
Section 482
 of

the Code, this Court quashes FIR No.15 dated 17.1.2016 registered at

Police   Station   DLF    Phase-I,        Gurgaon,   Haryana   and   all   the
