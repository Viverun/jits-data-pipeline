                      CAV JUDGMENT
     (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH KUMAR VERMA)

      Date : 15-10-2025


                  Heard Dr. K.N. Singh, learned Additional Solicitor

     General of India assisted by Mr. Ram Tujabh Singh, learned

     counsel for the petitioners and Mr. Vishwa Mohan Kumar (In

     person) for the sole respondent.

                  2.       The present writ petition has been filed for

     challenging the order dated 04.01.2024 passed in OA No.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025
                                           2/14




       050/00505 of 2019 by which the learned Central Administrative

       Tribunal has been directed to the respondent's promotion to the

       post of Executive Engineer should be regularized w.e.f. 30.11.2010

       the date on which he was given the current duty charge of that post

       as he held that post continuously till regular promotion. Apart from

       the aforesaid, the learned Central Administrative Tribunal also

       directed the petitioners to issue order of promotion to the post of

       Executive Engineer w.e.f. 30.11.2010 with all consequential

       benefits within three months from the date of this order.

                    3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

       respondent herein was appointed as Assistant Engineer in the Civil

       Construction Wing of All India Radio on 19.12.1990 and was

       granted financial up-gradation to Grade Pay of Rs. 6600/- w.e.f.

       18.12.2002
 vide order dated 27.04.2005. Respondent was given

       current duty charge of the post of Executive Engineer w.e.f.

       30.11.2010. The grade pay for the post of Executive Engineer was

       Rs. 6600/-, so there was no financial enhancement in the pay scale

       for the current duty charge. The respondent was conferred second

       MACP with Grade Pay of Rs. 7600/- vide order dated 18.12.2020.


                    4.      The respondent was promoted after regular

       Departmental Proceeding Committee (DPC) to the post of

       Executive Engineer vide order dated 25.02.2020.
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           3/14


                    5. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

       respondent's case was before Central Administrative Tribunal

       (hereinafter referred as "CAT") that respondent was eligible for

       promotion to the post of Executive Engineer after completing eight

       (08) years regular service on the post of Assistant Engineer. For

       the promotion to the post of Superintending Engineer, the

       eligibility of five (05) years on the post of Executive Engineer.

       The respondent pleaded before the learned CAT that he was

       granted only one substantive promotion in the last 30 years of his

       service. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that from

       perusal of letter dated 30.11.2010 by which the respondent was

       officiating to the post of Executive Engineer (Current Duty

       Charge). The said appointment letter clearly indicates that such

       appointment will not entitle for any monetary benefit or claim to

       seniority. The private respondent was ultimately promoted to the

       post of Executive Engineer by order dated 25.02.2020 after the

       recommendation of DPC. The delay in process by the DPC for the

       appointment of Executive Engineer was due to a SLP No. 35912-

       35913 of 2010 was pending before the Hon'ble Apex Court with

       respect to seniority matter and the Hon'ble Apex Court had

       granted an interim order of status quo by order dated 17.01.2011.

       The said status quo was vacated by the Hon'ble Apex Court by
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           4/14





       order dated 19.08.2015. Thereafter, the matter was kept pending

       in the Hon'ble Apex Court and ultimately the same was disposed

       of by order dated 18.01.2017. After disposal of the aforesaid SLP,

       the seniority list was prepared by the authority concerned.

       Ultimately, the said seniority list was also subject to challenge

       before the Hon'ble Apex Court in M.A. No. 2220-2221 of 2018

       and the same was finally disposed of vide order dated 17.02.2020

       thereafter the respondent has been given to the promotion vide

       order dated 25.02.2020.             Learned counsel for the petitioners

       submits that from the aforesaid, it transpired that due to multiple

       litigation, the DPC could not take place for the period of last 10

       years. Learned Additional Solicitor General of India brought to our

       notice Office Memorandum dated 10th April, 1989 where the

       Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions Department

       of Personnel and Training had formulated a guidelines which

       would govern the promotion/appointment of such persons to the

       post in question. He has relied upon Para 6.4.4 and Para 17.10 and

       Para 17.11 which is reproduced hereinbelow :-


               "6.4.4 - While promotions will be made in the order of

               the consolidated select list, such promotions will have

               only prospective effect even in cases where the

               vacancies relate to earlier year(s).

 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           5/14





               17.10- The general principle is that promotion of

               officers included in the panel would be regular from the

               date of validity of the panel or the date of their actual

               promotion whichever is later.



               17.11- In cases where the recommendations for

               promotion are made by the DPC presided over by a

               Member of the UPSC and such recommendations do not

               require to be approved by the Commission, the date of

               Commission's letter forwarding fair copes of the minutes

               duly signed by the Chairman of the DPC or the date of

               the actual promotion of the officers, whichever is later,

               should be reckoned as the date of regular promotion of

               the officer. In cases where the Commission's approval is

               also required the date of UPSC's letter communicating

               its approval or the date of actual promotion of the

               officer whichever is later will be the relevant date. In all

               other cases the date on which promotion will be effective

               will be the date on which the officer was actually

               promoted or the date of the meeting of the DPC

               whichever is later. Where the meeting of the DPC

               extends over more than one day the last date on which

               the DPC extends over more than one day the last date
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           6/14





               on which the DPC met shall be recorded as the date of

               meeting of the DPC.



               Appointment to posts falling within the purview of ACC

               can, however, be treated as regular only from the date of

               approval of ACC or actual promotion whichever later

               except in particular cases where the ACC approves

               appointments from some other date".



 
6. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that from

       perusal of the aforesaid guidelines, it is made clear that no such

       appointment/promotion could have been made effect with a

       retrospective date, only a prospective promotion/appointment

       would have been made. Learned counsel for the petitioners further

       relied upon a judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

       
Government of West Bengal and Others Vs. Dr. Amal Satpathi and

       Others
, reported in (2024) SCC OnLine SC 3512, Paragraph

       Nos. 19 and 20 of 
the said judgment
 which is reproduced

       hereinbelow:




              "19. It is a well settled principle that promotion becomes
              effective from the date it is granted, rather than from the
              date a vacancy arises or the post is created. While the
              Courts have recognized the right to be considered for
              promotion as not only a statutory right but also a
              fundamental right, there is no fundamental right to the
              promotion itself. 
In this regard, we may gainfully refer to
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           7/14





              a recent decision of this Court in the case of 
Bihar State
              Electricity Board v. Dharamdeo Das
, wherein it was
              observed as follows:




                    "18. It is no longer res integra that a promotion
                    is effective from the date it is granted and not
                    from the date when a vacancy occurs on the
                    subject post or when the post itself is created. No
                    doubt, a right to be considered for promotion has
                    been treated by courts not just as a statutory
                    right but as a fundamental right, at the same
                    time, there is no fundamental right to promotion
                    itself. 
In this context, we may profitably cite a
                    recent decision in 
Ajay Kumar Shukla v. Arvind
                    Rai
 where, citing earlier precedents in 
Director,
                    Lift Irrigation Corporation Ltd. v. Pravat Kiran
                    Mohanty
 and 
Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab
, a
                    three-Judge Bench observed thus:


 
41. This Court, time and again, has laid emphasis
                    on right to be considered for promotion to be a
                    fundamental right, as was held by K. Ramaswamy,
                    J., in 
Director, Lift Irrigation Corpn. Ltd. v. Pravat
                    Kiran Mohanty
 in para 4 of the report which is
                    reproduced below:


                    '4.......       There      is     no    fundamental    right    to
                    promotion, but an employee has only right to be
                    considered for promotion, when it arises, in
                    accordance        with      relevant   rules.     From     this
                    perspective in our view the conclusion of the High
                    Court that the gradation list prepared by the
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           8/14





                    corporation is in violation of the right of
                    respondent-writ petitioner to equality enshrined
                    under 
Article 14
 read with 
Article 16
 of the
                    Constitution, and the respondent-writ petitioner
                    was unjustly denied of the same is obviously
                    unjustified.'

 
42. A Constitution Bench in 
Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab
,
              laying emphasis on 
Article 14
 and 
Article 16(1)
 of the
              Constitution of India held that if a person who satisfies
              the eligibility and the criteria for promotion but still is
              not considered for promotion, then there will be clear
              violation of his/her's fundamental right. Jagannadha
              Rao, J. speaking for himself and Anand, C.J.,
              Venkataswami, Pattanaik, Kurdukar, JJ., observed the
              same as follows in paras 22 and 27:


              'Articles 14 and 16(1) : is right to be considered for
              promotion a fundamental right

                    22. 
Article 14
 and 
Article 16(1)
 are closely
                    connected. They deal with individual rights of the
                    person. 
Article 14
 demands that the 'State shall
                    not deny to any person equality before the law or
                    the equal protection of the laws'. 
Article 16(1)

                    issues a positive command that:



                        'there shall be equality of opportunity for all
                        citizens in matters relating to employment or
                        appointment to any office under the State'.
                    It has been held repeatedly by this Court that
                    clause (1) of 
Article 16
 is a facet of 
Article 14
 and
                    that it takes its roots from 
Article 14.
 The said
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                           9/14





                    clause particularises the generality in 
Article 14

                    and identifies, in a constitutional sense "equality
                    of opportunity" in matters of employment and
                    appointment to any office under the State. The
                    word "employment" being wider, there is no
                    dispute that it takes within its fold, the aspect of
                    promotions to posts above the stage of initial level
                    of recruitment. 
Article 16 (1)
 provides to every
                    employee otherwise eligible for promotion or who
                    comes within the zone of consideration, a
                    fundamental        right      to    be   "considered"   for
                    promotion. Equal opportunity here means the
                    right to be "considered" for promotion. If a
                    person satisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but
                    is not considered for promotion, then there will be
                    a clear infraction of his fundamental right to be
                    "considered" for promotion, which is his personal
                    right. "Promotion" based on equal opportunity
                    and seniority attached to such promotion are
                    facets of fundamental right under 
Article 16(1).


                                   *               *                        *

                    27. 
In our opinion, the above view expressed in
                    
Ashok Kumar Gupta [Ashok Kumar Gupta v. State
                    of U.P.
, and followed in 
Jagdish Lal [Jagdish Lal
                    v. State of Haryana
, and other cases, if it is
                    intended to lay down that the right guaranteed to
                    employees for being "considered" for promotion
                    according to relevant rules of recruitment by
                    promotion (i.e. whether on the basis of seniority or
                    merit) is only a statutory right and not a
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                          10/14





                    fundamental        right,     we    cannot     accept    the
                    proposition.
 
We have already stated earlier that
                    the right to equal opportunity in the matter of
                    promotion in the sense of a right to be
                    "considered"         for      promotion   is    indeed    a
                    fundamental right guaranteed under 
Article 16(1)

                    and this has never been doubted in any other case
                    before 
Ashok Kumar Gupta [Ashok Kumar Gupta
                    v. State of U.P.
], right from 1950.'
              "20.
 
In 
State of Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath
, it was
              held that retrospective seniority cannot be given to an
              employee from a date when he was not even borne in the
              cadre, nor can seniority be given with retrospective effect
              as that might adversely affect others.
 
The same view was
              reiterated in 
Keshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of India
,
              where it was held that when a quota is provided for, then
              the seniority of the employee would be reckoned from the
              date when the vacancy arises in the quota and not from
              any anterior date of promotion or subsequent date of
              confirmation.
 
The said view was restated in 
Uttaranchal
              Forest Rangers' Assn. (Direct Recruit) v. State of U.P.
, in
              the following words:


 
'37. We are also of the view that no retrospective
                      promotion or seniority can be granted from a date
                      when an employee has not even been borne in the
                      cadre so as to adversely affect the direct recruits
                      appointed validly in the meantime, as decided by
                      this Court in 
Keshav Chandra Joshi v. Union of
                      India
 held that when promotion is outside the
                      quota, seniority would be reckoned from the date
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                          11/14





                      of the vacancy within the quota rendering the
                      previous      service       fortuitous.   The   previous
                      promotion would be regular only from the date of
                      the vacancy within the quota and seniority shall
                      be counted from that date and not from the date of
                      his earlier promotion or subsequent confirmation.
                      In order to do justice to the promotes, it would not
                      be proper to do injustice to the direct recruits......


                      38. This Court has consistently held that no
                      retrospective promotion can be granted nor can
                      any seniority be given on retrospective basis
                      from a date when an employee has not even
                      been borne in the cadre particularly when this
                      would adversely affect the direct recruits who
                      have been appointed validity in the meantime."

                                                          (emphasis supplied)

              20. In the instant case, it is evident that while respondent
              No. 1 was recommended for promotion before his
              retirement, he could not assume the duties of the Chief
              Scientific Officer. Rule 54(1)(a) of the West Bengal
              Service Rules, clearly stipulates that an employee must
              assume the responsibilities of a higher post to draw the
              corresponding pay, thus, preventing posthumous or
              retrospective promotions in the absence of an enabling
              provision".



                    7. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that it is

       not in dispute that the respondent was given the officiating charge

       (Current Duty Charge) of Executive Engineer, the said
 Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                          12/14





       appointment letter itself indicates that the respondent could not

       have made claim for any monetary benefit or seniority on the basis

       of the said appointment. The said appointment letter was issued in

       the year 2010 in favour of respondent and the respondent was

       never challenged the aforesaid letter and now he has not claimed

       the promotion on retrospective effect.



                    8. Mr. Vishwa Mohan Kumar, who has appeared in

       person submits that it is not in dispute that the respondent was not

       eligible for the promotion to the post in question. The petitioners

       have denied the promotion to the respondent solely on the ground

       that the status quo was maintained by the Hon'ble Apex Court on

       the sole ground that the petitioners could not hold DPC. Mr.

       Vishwa Mohan Kumar further submits that after the status quo

       order dated 17.01.2011 the petitioners conducted DPC and issued

       Promotion Order No. 7/2011-BA (E) dated 24.10.2011 and issued

       posting order to certain officials. Further submits that the status

       quo was modified by the Hon'ble Apex Court vide order dated

       19.08.2015 where the Hon'ble Apex Court held that "We modify

       the interim order and permit the Union of India to make the

       promotions to the post of Executive Engineer. However, we make

       it clear that the promotions will be subject to the outcome of this

       appeal". Apart from the aforesaid, the petitioners could have

                                          13/14





       conducted the DPC immediately after the modification of status

       quo order by the Hon'ble Apex Court on 19.08.2015.               
The

       indefinite 10 years long period of Current Duty Charge ratified in

       the regular promotion on 25.02.2020.             Further submits that

       respondent was neither a party in the said SLP nor his eligibility or

       his position in Direct Recruit slot was to get affected.         The

       appointment was made on Current Duty Charge according to Rule

       of FR 49, Current Duty Charge is a stop gap arrangement for a

       very short duration only. Mr. Vishwa Mohan Mumar also relied

       upon a decision in the case of 
K Madhavan and Another Vs. Union

       of India
, reported in (1987) 4 SCC 566 held that with a view to

       ensure that miscarriage of justice does not occur, promotion should

       be deemed to have taken effect retrospectively from the

       commencement of the so called ad hoc stop gap and current duty

       charge, provided the incumbent concerned fulfilled the essential

       criteria for consideration for promotion on the initial date.


 
9. We have heard both the parties at length and this

       Court has come to the conclusion that due to statue quo granted by

       the Hon'ble Apect Court in SLP No. 35912-35913 of 2010 the

       petitioners had not held the DPC for the promotion of the

       respondents in question and apart from the aforesaid in the recent

       judgment as mentioned aforesaid by the petitioners in the case of
              Patna High Court CWJC No.12586 of 2024 dt. 15-10-2025

                                                       14/14


Government of West Bengal and Others
 (supra) which suggests

                    that the promotion only becomes effective upon the assumption of

                    duties on the promotional post and not on the date of occurrence of

                    the vacancy or the date of recommendation.




                                  10.     As a result of the above discussion, the

                    judgment/order         dated      04.01.2024      passed   in   O.A.    No.

                    050/00505/2019 is hereby set aside.



                                  11. The writ petition is allowed. No order as to costs.


                                  12. Pending application (s), if any, shall stand disposed

                    of.





                                                                (Sudhir Singh, J)

                            I agree.
