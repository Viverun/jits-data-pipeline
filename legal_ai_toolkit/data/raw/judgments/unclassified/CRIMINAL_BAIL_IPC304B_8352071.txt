                                      pursuant to which apart from dowry articles given in the wedding
                                      ceremony, additionally, a sum of Rs 10 lakhs was handed over in

                                      6.          The complainant alleged that the deceased took her life
                                      due to the relentless demands for dowry and the harassment
                                      inflicted upon her by the applicant and his family members. The
                                      applicant is in judicial custody since 26.05.2023.

                                      various occasions to get the deceased back to her matrimonial
                                      home. He submits that it was the complainant who told the
                                      applicant that he will send the deceased back in two months,
                                      however, later on 05.05.2023 with the intervention of the

                                       marriage the applicant and his family members had demanded a
                                      Car in marriage from the family of the deceased.

                                      16.         He submits that the complainant had provided a audio
                                      recording with regards to the alleged demand of the car, between
                                      the Asif Ali (brother of the deceased) and Rafeeq / Mediator to
                                      the marriage.

                                      17.         I have heard learned counsel for the parties.

                                      the applicant only for a brief period of 5-6 days and the alleged
                                      incident took place in her paternal home. The applicant was
                                      arrested after he had surrendered before the investigating officer
                                      after the dismissal of his anticipatory bail application.

                                      respect to the Rs.10 lakhs being given at the time of vidayi is
                                      controverted since Javed one of the uncles of the applicant had
                                      provided a video which shows that the family of the deceased
                                      gave a sum of rupees two lakhs and eleven thousand only in cash
                                      at that time.

                                                      Explanation: For the purposes of this sub-section, "dowry"

                                                    shall have the same meaning as in 
section 2
 of the Dowry
                                                    Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).

                                                    (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with
                                                    imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven
                                                    years but which may extend to imprisonment for life."



                                      22.          The basic ingredient to attract presumption in terms of
                                      
Section 304B
 of the IPC is that the death should have occurred
                                      under circumstances which are not normal within seven years of
                                      her marriage and the victim was subjected to cruelty or
                                      harassment by her husband or any of her husband's relative in
                                      connection with any demand for dowry soon before the death.

                                      23.         It is not a case of the prosecution that the applicant or his
                                      family members have been alternatively charged for offences
                                      under Section 302 or 306 of the 
IPC
. In fact, the other co-accused
                                      persons are stated to have been kept in column 12 of the
                                      chargesheet. It is also not denied that deceased was not staying
                                      with the applicant at the relevant time. The death occurred at her
                                      parental home.

                                      24.         The presumption in law of a 'dowry death' is meant to act
                                      as a deterrent to the demand of dowry and to ensure that there is
                                      no victimization because of that. The allegations levelled will be
                                      tested in trial and at this stage considering the Application for
                                      Bail only the parameters enshrined in that regard are to be
                                      considered.

                                      25.         The applicant is in custody since 26.05.2023, the
                                      chargesheet has already been filed. The trial is at the stage of
                                      Prosecution evidence and is likely to take considerable period of
                                      time.



                                      BAIL APPLN. 4282/2023                                                                Page 5 of 7

                                       26.         The object of judicial custody is to secure the presence of
                                      the accused persons during the trial. The object is neither
                                      punitive nor preventive and the deprivation of liberty has been
                                      considered as a punishment. Delay in the commencement and
                                      conclusion of the trial is a factor to be taken into account and the
                                      accused cannot be kept in custody for an indefinite period if the
                                      trial is not likely to be concluded within a reasonable time. The
                                      presence of the accused can be secured at the time of trial by
                                      putting appropriate conditions.

                                      27.         Without commenting further on the merits of the case,
                                      keeping the facts and circumstances in mind and the fact that the
                                      trial is likely to take some time, I am satisfied that the applicant
                                      has made out a case for the grant of regular bail.

                                      28.         In view of the above, the applicant is directed to be
                                      released on bail on furnishing a bail bond for a sum of ₹25,000/-
                                      with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of learned
                                      Trial Court / Duty MM / Link MM on the following conditions:

                                                        a. The applicant shall not leave the country without
                                                              prior permission of the learned Trial Court;
                                                        b. The applicant shall cooperate in the trial and appear
                                                              before the learned Trial Court as and when directed;
                                                        c. The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make
                                                              any inducement, threat or promise to any person
                                                              acquainted with the facts of the present case;
                                                        d. The applicant shall not, in any manner, try to contact
                                                              any of the witnesses;

                                                        e. The applicant shall provide his mobile number to the
                                                              concerned Investigating Officer /SHO at the time of
                                                              his release and the mobile shall be kept in working
                                                              condition at all times;

                                      BAIL APPLN. 4282/2023                                                                Page 6 of 7

                                                         f. The applicant shall, in case of change of residential
                                                              address           and/or          mobile           number,   intimate   the
                                                              concerned Investigating Officer regarding the same.

                                      29.          In the event of there being any FIR/DD entry/ complaint
                                      lodged against the applicant, it would be open to the State to seek
                                      redressal by filing an appropriate application for cancellation of
                                      bail.

                                      present case are only for the purpose of considering the bail
                                      application and should not influence the outcome of the trial and
                                      also not be taken as an expression of opinion on the merits of the
                                      case.

                                      31.         The present application is allowed in the aforesaid terms.
