 JUDGMENT



                These two writ petitions give rise to identical questions

 raised on behalf of the petitioner Vidarbha Konkan Gramin Bank

 and hence both the writ petitions are being disposed of by this

 common judgment and order.





 2.                   The question that arises for consideration in these

 writ petitions is, as to whether the contesting respondents

                                   3 / 19               wp8272 & 8273.18.odt

 (respondent No.2 in both the writ petitions) are entitled to

 payment of gratuity under the provisions of 
Payment of Gratuity

 Act, 1972
 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act of 1972') or under

 the Vidarbha Gramin Bank, Officers and Employees Service

 Regulations, 2013, issued by the Board of Directors of the said

 Bank under 
section 30
 of the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976.

 While the petitioner Bank claims that the contesting respondents

 are entitled to payment of gratuity under the provisions of the Act

 of 1972 with an upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/-, the contesting

 respondents have claimed that they are entitled to gratuity under

 the said Regulations without any such ceiling. The contesting

 respondents further claim that even under the said Regulations,

 for calculating the amount of gratuity payable, dearness allowance

 and other allowances are required to be included in the expression

 "Pay" as defined in the said Regulations.





 3.                   The brief facts leading to filing of the present writ

 petitions by the petitioner Bank are that the contesting

 respondents retired as Senior Managers from the petitioner Bank

 on 31/05/2017. Respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018

 had completed 33 years before superannuation and respondent

 No.2 in Writ Petition No.8273/2018 had completed 29 years of

                                        4 / 19              wp8272 & 8273.18.odt

 service. The petitioner Bank calculated the amount of gratuity

 payable to the said respondents on the basis of the provisions of

 the Act, 1971 and also in accordance with the said Regulations.

 The petitioner Bank found that the amount of gratuity payable to

 the said respondents as per the Act of 1972 came to a higher

 figure of Rs.10,00,000/-              and therefore, the said amount was

 disbursed to the respondents upon their attaining the age of

 superannuation.





 4.                   The contesting respondents sent applications to the

 petitioner       Bank         after   having   received    the     amount         of

 Rs.10,00,000/- each towards gratuity, claiming that the cap or

 upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/- under the provisions of the Act of

 1972, was wrongly applied in their cases, because they were

 entitled to gratuity in terms of Regulation 72 of the said

 Regulations. The said Regulation specifically provided that an

 officer or an employee of the petitioner Bank shall be eligible for

 payment of gratuity either under the Act of 1972 or Regulations,

 whichever was higher. It was submitted that therefore, the

 petitioner Bank ought to have paid total amount of gratuity

 without applying the upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/-, as provided

 under the Act of 1972.

 5.                   As the petitioner Bank refused to accept the claims

 made by the said respondents, they filed applications under

 
section 7(4)
 of the Act of 1972, for direction to the petitioner bank

 to make payment of the balance amount due to them. In the case

 of respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018, demand of

 further amount of Rs.5,61,472.16, was made and in case of

 respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8273/2018, claim of further

 amount of Rs.3,37,261.78, was made before the Controlling

 Authority       under         the   Act   of   1972   i.e.    Assistant      Labour

 Commissioner.





 6.                   By orders passed on 28/03/2018, the Controlling

 Authority rejected the applications filed by the contesting

 respondents, holding that the petitioner Bank had correctly

 applied provisions of the Act of 1972, thereby disbursing an

 amount of Rs.10,00,000/- each, towards gratuity in favour of the

 said respondents. It was held that the said respondents were not

 eligible for the additional amount of gratuity claimed by them.



 7.                   Aggrieved by the said orders passed by the

 Controlling Authority, the contesting respondents filed appeals

 before the Appellate Authority                  i.e. Deputy       Chief Labour

 Commissioner.            By orders dated 04/10/2018, the Appellate

 Authority allowed the appeals filed by the contesting respondents

 and directed the petitioner bank to pay the additional amount of

 gratuity claimed by them alongwith interest @10% per annum for

 delayed period till the date of actual payment.                The petitioner

 bank filed instant writ petitions challenging the said orders passed

 by the Appellate Authority.





 8.                   Mr.      Anand   Jaiswal,   learned     senior      counsel

 appearing for the petitioner Bank in both the writ petitions

 submitted that the Appellate Authority failed to appreciate the real

 controversy in the present case. It was submitted that Regulation

 72 of the said Regulations clearly specified that an officer or

 employee would be entitled to gratuity as per the provisions of the

 Act of 1972 or the said Regulations, whichever is higher.

 According to the learned senior counsel, calculation of gratuity

 payable to the contesting respondents was undertaken by the

 petitioner Bank under both the Act of 1972, as well as the said

 Regulations.        It was submitted that the amount payable to the

 contesting respondents under the Regulations came to a figure

 which was less than the amount payable to them under the

 provisions of the Act of 1972. It was pointed out that as per the

 aforesaid Regulation 72 of the said Regulations, the gratuity

                                     7 / 19              wp8272 & 8273.18.odt

 payable to the respondents was to be calculated on their last pay

 drawn, which as per the definitions in the Regulations did not

 include the component of dearness allowance, while under the

 provisions of Act of 1972, the last drawn wage of the respondents

 included the last pay and dearness allowance.



 9.                   It was submitted that therefore, the petitioner bank

 had calculated the amount of gratuity payable to the contesting

 respondents under the Act of 1972 and in the case of respondent

 No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018, it came to Rs.15,61,472.16

 and      in    the    case    of   respondent   No.2    in    Writ      Petition

 No.8273/2018, it came to Rs.13,37,261.78. It was further

 submitted that since at the relevant time the amount of gratuity

 payable to an employee under 
section 4(3)
 of the Act of 1972,

 could not exceed Rs.10,00,000/-, the said amount was paid to the

 contesting respondents. On this basis, it was pointed out that the

 higher amount of gratuity payable to the contesting respondents

 was disbursed to them, because on a proper application of the

 Regulations, respondent No.2 in Writ Petition No.8272/2018, was

 entitled to gratuity amount of Rs.8,93,920/- and respondent No.2

 in Writ Petition No.8273/2018 was entitled to gratuity amount of

 Rs.7,61,740/-. On this basis, it was submitted that the appellate

 Court had committed a grave error in passing the impugned

 orders in favour of the contesting respondents.



 10.                  On the other hand, Mr. R. M. Tahaliyani, learned

 counsel appearing for respondent No.2 in both the writ petitions

 submitted that the petitioner Bank had wrongly calculated amount

 of gratuity payable to the said contesting respondents under the

 aforesaid Regulations by refusing to include the component of

 dearness allowance in the last pay drawn by the respondents. It

 was submitted that a perusal of the said Regulations would show

 that dearness allowance could not have been excluded by the

 petitioner bank, while calculating the amount of gratuity payable

 to the contesting respondents. It was submitted that inclusion of

 dearness allowance in "pay" as defined under 
Regulation 2(m)
 of

 the Regulations would show that the respondents were clearly

 entitled to the higher amounts which they had claimed and since

 there was no upper ceiling or cap to the amount payable under the

 Regulations, the Appellate Authority had correctly directed

 payment of the additional amounts to the respondents alongwith

 interest.





 
11.                  The learned counsel for the contesting respondents

 placed reliance on judgment of the learned Single Judge of the

 Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of 
All India Gramin

 Pensioners Organization Unit Rewa          vs. Madhyanchal Gramin

 Bank and another
 [ W. P. 9182/2017 with W. P. 2299/2017 and

 W. P. 2877/2018 decided on 06/09/2018 ] and Division Bench of

 the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of 
Madhyanchal

 Gramin Bank and another           vs.   All India Gramin Pensioners

 Organization Unit [W.A.1318/2018
 with W.A. Nos. 1316 and

 1317/2018 decided on 26/02/2019], wherein pari materia

 provisions to the said Regulations were considered and it was

 found by the High Court that the expression "pay" under the

 Regulations included dearness allowance. It was further held in

 
the said judgment
 that since there was no upper ceiling for the

 amount of gratuity payable to the employees of the Bank under

 Regulation 72, the higher amount payable was to be disbursed.


The learned counsel pointed out that Special Leave Petitions filed

 by the 
Madhyanchal Gramin Bank
 (supra) before the Hon'ble

 Supreme Court challenging the judgment of the Division Bench of

 the Madhya Pradesh High Court, were dismissed. It was further

 pointed out that a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court

 had also followed the said view taken by the Madhya Pradesh

 High Court and that therefore, the present writ petitions deserved

 to be dismissed.

 12.                  In rejoinder the learned senior counsel appearing

 for the petitioner bank submitted that the Madhya Pradesh High

 Court had erred in interpreting the Regulations, particularly

 Regulation (2) providing for definitions of the expressions "Pay",

 "Salary", and "Emoluments". It was submitted that Regulation 72

 was also not properly appreciated in 
the said judgment
 and that

 therefore, reliance placed on the same by the contesting

 respondents was misplaced. It was submitted that the Appellate

 Authority had committed a grave error and that therefore, the

 impugned order deserved to be set aside.





 13.                  There is no dispute amongst rival parties that

 higher amount of gratuity would be payable to the contesting

 respondents either under the Act of 1972 or the aforesaid

 Regulations. The real controversy between the parties in these

 writ petitions is, as to the basis of calculation of the amount of

 gratuity payable to the contesting respondents under the aforesaid

 Regulations. It is only because there is no upper ceiling or cap in

 the Regulations that the contesting respondents insist that they be

 paid gratuity under the said Regulations, by including dearness

 allowance as a component under the expression "Pay" under the

 said Regulations so that they are found to be entitled to receive

 entire amount without any cap or upper ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/-.

 The petitioner Bank has claimed that, on a proper reading of the

 Regulations, calculation of gratuity under its provisions has to be

 made by taking only the pay i.e. basic pay drawn by the contesting

 respondents including stagnation increments, without adding the

 component of dearness allowance. On such a calculation the

 amount of gratuity payable to the contesting respondents is much

 less and even less than Rs.10,00,000/-. As a result, the petitioner

 Bank has calculated gratuity amount under the Act, 1972, wherein

 "Wage" includes dearness allowance and then the cap or upper

 ceiling of Rs.10,00,000/- has been applied.



 14.                  In order to resolve the conflict between the parties,

 it is necessary to refer to the relevant portions of the aforesaid

 Regulations.

               amount at the rate of one half of a month's pay for
               each completed year of service beyond 30 years :

 16.                  The rival parties have not disputed the formulae of

 calculation under the Regulations as well as the Act of 1972 and

 the only area of dispute is with regard to inclusion or exclusion of

 dearness allowance while calculating amount of gratuity under the

 said Regulations.             A perusal of Regulation 72 shows that after

 stating the manner of calculating the amount of gratuity under

 Clause (3), there are 03 provisos appended to the said clause. The

 2nd and 3rd proviso are relevant for the present controversy. The

 2nd proviso states that in respect of an officer, the gratuity is

 payable based on last pay drawn while the 3 rd proviso states that

 in respect of an employee, for the purposes of calculation of

 gratuity, pay shall be the average of basic pay, dearness allowance

 and special allowance and officiating allowance. The expression

 "Pay" has been specifically defined under 
Regulation 2(m)
 quoted

 above.      It specifically states that "Pay" means basic pay including

 stagnation increments and any part of emoluments, which may

 specifically be classified as pay under the Regulations.                      It is

 significant that the expression "Salary" is specifically separately

 defined under 
Regulation 2(o)
 as aggregate of pay and dearness

 allowance, while the expression "Emoluments" is also separately

 defined under 
Regulation 2(i)
 as the aggregate of salary and

 allowances.            The    three   expressions    "Pay",      "Salary"      and

 "Emoluments" are distinctly and separately defined under the said

 Regulations.





 17.                  The 2nd proviso to Clause (3) of Regulation 72 uses

 the expression "last pay drawn". Since "Pay" as defined under

 
Regulation 2(m)
 does not include dearness allowance , the same

 cannot be read into the expression "Pay", as sought to be claimed

 by the contesting respondents.             Since the expression "Salary"

 under 
Regulation 2(o)
 includes pay and dearness allowance, if the

 contention raised on behalf of the contesting respondents is

 accepted, instead of the expression "Pay", the expression "Salary"

 will have to be read into 2 nd proviso to Clause (3) of Regulation


 72.     In this situation, the learned counsel appearing for the

 contesting respondents submitted that the words used in

 
Regulation 2(m)
 to the effect that " and any part of the emoluments

 which may specifically be classified as pay under these regulations "


 
would be rendered meaningless, if the contention raised on behalf

 of the petitioner Bank was to be accepted. It was submitted that

 the Madhya Pradesh High Court and Calcutta High Court in the

 aforementioned judgment concerning 
Madhyanchal Gramin Bank


 (supra) had therefore, read the definitions of "Pay" under

 
Regulation 2(m)
, "Salary" under 2(o) and "Emoluments" under

 2(i), as interwoven and interlinked to each other, to give a proper

 meaning to the said definitions, read with Regulation 72 of the

 said Regulations. It was submitted that dearness allowance was

 always part of pay and this was further clear from definition of

 wages as defined in 
section 2(s)
 of the Act of 1972. On this basis,

 it was submitted that the expression "Pay" used in the 2 nd proviso

 to Clause (3) of the Regulation 72, had to be read to mean that it

 included basic pay and dearness allowance.




 18.                  But, the said contentions raised on behalf of the

 contesting respondents cannot be accepted, because as noted

 above it would amount to reading something that is not

 specifically stated in the 2nd proviso to Clause (3) of the

 Regulation 72 of the Regulations. The words used in 
Regulation

 2(m)
 are to the effect that "Pay" would include any part of the

 emoluments which may specifically be classified as pay. These

 words do have meaning, because if the 3 rd proviso to Clause (3) of

 Regulation 72 of the Regulations is perused, it shows that when

 gratuity of an "employee" is to be calculated, as opposed to that of

 an "officer", "Pay" for the purposes of calculation of gratuity is to

 include basic pay, dearness allowance and officiating allowances.

 Thus, in the case of an employee, the said allowances have been

 specifically classified as pay and therefore, while calculating

 gratuity amount payable to an "employee" under the 3rd proviso,

 such allowances have to be included before calculating the

 quantum. This distinction in the 2nd and 3rd provisos to Regulation

 72(3) of the Regulations, in the light of definitions under

 
Regulation 2
, was not brought to the notice of the High Courts of

 Madhya Pradesh and Calcutta when it was held that calculation of

 gratuity in the case of officers under the said Regulations ought to

 be based on inclusion of dearness allowance in the expression

 "Pay".

19.                  As regards the dismissal of Special Leave Petition of

 the Madhyanchal Gramin Bank against judgment and order of the

 Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, it would not

 result in the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court being

 binding on this Court, because as per settled position of law there

 is no merger when a Special Leave Petition is dismissed and the

 Hon'ble Supreme Court refuses to grant leave by a speaking or

 non-speaking order. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated

 the said position of law in a recent judgment in the case of 
Khoday

 Distilleries Ltd. vs. Shri. Mahadeshwara Sahakara Sakkare Karkhane

 Ltd.
 (2019) 4 SCC 376. Therefore, dismissal of the Special Leave

 Petition against the judgment and order of the Division Bench of

 the Madhya Pradesh High Court would not detain this Court from

 considering the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner Bank

 on interpretation of the aforesaid Regulations.


 20.                  Thus, the petitioner Bank is justified in raising a

 grievance as regards the impugned orders passed by the Appellate

 Authority. In fact, the Appellate Authority did not discuss this

 main controversy between the parties at all and it proceeded on

 the basis that calculation of gratuity under the Act of 1972, as well

 as the Regulations resulted in the same quantum of amount and

 that since the Regulations did not have a cap or upper ceiling, the

 same would apply and not the Act of 1972.                          Therefore, the

 impugned orders passed by the Appellate Authority are rendered

 unsustainable.





 21.                  Once it is found that while calculating the amount

 of gratuity payable to the contesting respondents under the

 Regulations, only pay could be made the basis without adding

 dearness allowance, the quantum of gratuity payable to the

 contesting respondents comes to Rs.8,93,920/- in the case of

 respondent         No.2       in   Writ      Petition   No.     8272/2018          and

 Rs.7,61,740/- in the case of respondent No.2 in Writ Petition

 No.8273/2018, which is much less than the amount of

 Rs.10,00,000/- each disbursed by the petitioner Bank to the said

 contesting respondents.            Thus, the petitioner Bank applied the

 provisions of the Act of 1972, while calculating the amount of

 gratuity payable to the contesting respondents, because by

 applying the provisions of the said Act higher gratuity was payable

 to the contesting respondents, despite the cap or upper ceiling of

 Rs.10,00,000/-. This amount for disbursal of gratuity amount was

 correctly approved by the Controlling Authority, while rejecting

 the applications filed by the contesting respondents for claim of

 additional amount of gratuity. But, the Appellate Authority failed

 to appreciate the contentions of the petitioner Bank.



 22.                  In view of the above, the writ petitions are allowed.

 The impugned orders passed by the Appellate Authority are

 quashed and set aside and the orders passed by the Controlling

 Authority in the case of the contesting respondents are restored.

 Accordingly, the petitioner Bank is found not liable to pay any

 further amount towards gratuity to the contesting respondents as

 they admittedly received the amount of Rs.10,00,000/- from the

 petitioner Bank immediately upon their superannuation.



 23.                  Writ petitions are disposed of in above terms with

 no order as to costs.
