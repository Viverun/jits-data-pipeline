                                     respondent No.1 by way of a letter dated 29th September,
                                     2021.       However, it is the petitioner‟s case that the
                                     petitioner never received any communication from the
                                     respondent No.1 seeking to terminate the Collaboration
                                     Agreement and it was only during the hearing of the
                                     present petition, the petitioner came to know about the
                                     purported termination letter.



                                x.   In    the     interregnum    a     Second    Supplementary
                                     Collaboration Agreement dated 17.8.2020 was executed
                                     which is vehemently disputed by the petitioner as being a
                                     forged and fabricated document.



                               xi.   It is the petitioner‟s case that on 14.12.2022 on receipt of
                                     a phone call regarding the said property for being put for
                                     sale, the petitioner made enquiry on 15.12.2022, when it
                                     was     confronted    with   the   Second    Supplementary
                                     Collaboration Agreement. As per the petitioner, there
                                     was no such Second Supplementary Collaboration
                                     Agreement nor was there any authorization granted to the
                                     respondent No.2 to execute such agreement on behalf of
                                     the petitioner in respect of the said property. It is also the
                                     case of the petitioner that on 19.12.2022, it was further
                                     confronted with the deed of cancellation dated 29.9.2021

                                       cancelling the General Power of Attorney dated 3.6.2019
                                       issued by the respondent No.1 in terms of the
                                       Collaboration Agreement.



                                xii.   Therefore, the petitioner is before this Court seeking
                                       interim protection qua the Collaboration Property
                                       submitting to the effect that there is a serious and
                                       genuine apprehension that the respondent No.1 and 2
                                       would create third party rights in the Collaboration
                                       Property to defeat the rights of the petitioner.



                      SUBMISSIONS
                      On behalf of the Petitioner

                      3.     Mr.Rajiv Nayar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the
                      petitioner submitted that the respondent No.1 and the respondent No.2
                      have been acting in collusion and attempting to defeat the rights of the
                      petitioner in the Collaboration Property.         It is submitted that the
                      Collaboration Agreement dated 15th May, 2018 was an indeterminable
                      contract, therefore, created indefensible rights in favour of the petitioner.
                      However, the respondents have sought to terminate the contract by way
                      of entering into a Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement
                      despite the fact that, by way of the Collaboration Agreement, indefeasible
                      rights had been created in favour of the petitioner and the petitioner was
                      in physical possession of the Collaboration Property.

                      4.    It is further submitted that the petitioner has paid an amount of
                      Rs.4.21 Crores to the respondent No.1 and for its possession of the
                      Collaboration Property, the petitioner has fulfilled its obligations under

                      the Collaboration Agreement. Even otherwise, the petitioner has always
                      been ready and willing to perform its part under the Collaboration
                      Agreement and has been taking all necessary steps to obtain the required
                      licence. However, it is the respondent No.1 who in connivance with
                      respondent No.2 is attempting to come out of the Collaboration
                      Agreement by relying on false and fabricated documents. Therefore, the
                      petitioner having a strong prima facie case in its favour is entitled to the
                      relief of Specific Performance of the Collaboration Agreement and
                      preservation of the Collaboration Property being the subject matter of the
                      dispute between the parties.

                      5.     The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner further
                      submitted that the petitioner and even the respondent No. 1 were working
                      towards achieving the development of the Collaboration Property and
                      obtaining all statutory permissions, licenses and regulatory approvals
                      required thereof. Acting upon the said Collaboration Agreement, a license
                      for the development of the said land had been applied for on 16 th May,
                      2018 by the petitioner vide License No. CTP/12558/2018. However, the
                      petitioner came to know only on 14th December, 2022 that the respondent
                      No. 1 had put up the Collaboration Property for sale in the market.

                      6.    It is also argued on behalf of the petitioner that the Second
                      Supplementary Collaboration Agreement is a forged and fabricated
                      document created by the respondent Nos.1 and 2 as an excuse to wriggle
                      out of the binding Collaboration Agreement and defraud the petitioner. In
                      this regard it was contended that no such agreement was executed by the
                      petitioner nor any permission/authorization was granted by the petitioner
                      to the respondent No.2 to execute any such so called Second

                      Supplementary Collaboration Agreement in respect of the Collaboration
                      Property. Further, the clauses in the Second Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement are unconscionable and virtually efface the understanding,
                      rights and obligations under the original Collaboration Agreement dated
                      15th May, 2018.     It was argued that the said Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement seeks to change the very nature of the
                      Collaboration Agreement from an indeterminable to a determinable
                      contract.

                      7.    It was further submitted that the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement is supported by a false resolution dated 3rd June,
                      2019 which is also a fabricated document created by the respondents in
                      cahoots with each other, i.e., respondent Nos. 1 and 2.

                      8.    The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted
                      that on 15th December, 2022, the petitioner made an enquiry at the office
                      of the Sub-Registrar, District Sohna. The petitioner attempted to confront
                      the respondent No.2, however, no communication could be made with the
                      respondent No.1. It is further submitted that immediately upon coming to
                      know of the fraudulent acts of the respondent No. 2, the petitioner
                      removed the respondent No.2 as a partner on 20th December, 2022.

                      9.    The learned senior counsel submitted that Clause 1.3 of the
                      Collaboration Agreement specifically provided that the respondent No. 1
                      shall hand over the physical possession of the Collaboration Property to
                      the petitioner and the entire area to be developed and constructed on the
                      Collaboration Property shall exclusively belong to the petitioner for the
                      benefit of the petitioner. It is further stipulated that the respondent no. 1

                      Collaboration Property. As per the updated Clause 2 of the Collaboration
                      Agreement, the non-refundable earnest money to be paid by the petitioner
                      to the respondent no. 1, which was reduced to Rs. 4,21,62,656/-, was also
                      duly paid by the petitioner to the respondent no. 1. Yet the respondent, in
                      blatant violation of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, entered
                      into a Supplementary Agreement.

                      10.    It is submitted that the petitioner had filed the instant petition
                      seeking the reliefs as aforementioned, the reliefs qua the Collaboration
                      Property so as to restrain the respondents from creating any third party
                      interest in the said Property.

                      11.    It is submitted that the Second Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement changes the very edifice and nature of the Collaboration
                      Agreement dated 15th May 2018 by introduction of certain clauses which
                      are unconscionable and allow the respondent no. 1 to exit the
                      Collaboration Agreement while at the same time forfeiting a huge
                      consideration of more than Rs.4.21 Crores paid, without having invested
                      a single penny. The said Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement
                      also seeks to change the very nature of the Collaboration Agreement from
                      indeterminable to a determinable contract at the option of the respondent
                      no. 1, on events which are not within the control of the petitioner.

                      12.    The learned senior counsel submitted that it is ex-facie apparent
                      that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in collusion with each other have, with
                      ill intention, devised a stratagem to cheat and defraud the petitioner by,
                      on the one hand, executing a Collaboration Agreement with the petitioner
                      and taking a huge consideration of Rs.4.21 Crores and, on the other hand,

                      offering it for sale in the market. This action of the respondents is in the
                      teeth of the Collaboration Agreement which creates indefensible rights in
                      favour of the petitioner and is inherently a contract which is
                      indeterminable in nature.

                      13.    It is further submitted that the petitioner is entitled to specific
                      performance of the Collaboration Agreement dated 15th May 2018 since it
                      has performed all its obligations under the Agreement and has also paid a
                      consideration of Rs.4.21 Crores to the respondent No. 1. Moreover, the
                      Collaboration Property ought to be preserved in favour of the petitioner.

                      14.    Learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that
                      irreparable harm and injury would be caused to the petitioner inasmuch as
                      the Collaboration Property is a unique parcel of land and has huge
                      potential for development and the petitioner is already in physical
                      possession of the land and has taken various steps in order to obtain
                      licenses for the development of the Collaboration Property. The petitioner
                      has, for the last 4 years, spent a huge amount of time, money and efforts
                      in furtherance of the Collaboration Agreement including having paid a
                      sum of approximately Rs.4.21 Crores to the respondent No. 1. It is further
                      submitted that no prejudice whatsoever would be caused to the
                      respondents in the event the respondents are directed to maintain status
                      quo as to the right, title, interest, and possession of the Collaboration
                      Property pending Arbitration proceedings. It is further submitted that the
                      balance of convenience is also entirely in favour of the petitioner and
                      against the respondent No. 1 who has with open eyes executed the
                      Collaboration Agreement and already received a valuable consideration
                      for the same.

                      15.    The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner further
                      argued that under 
Section 10
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, (hereinafter
                      referred to as "
Specific Relief Act
") the respondent No.1 cannot run away
                      from the Collaboration Agreement through any device or artifice as the
                      grant-cum-relief of specific performance is mandatory, if the readiness
                      and willingness on the part of the petitioner is proved. It is further
                      submitted that in the present case the conduct of the petitioner has been
                      blemish free and the petitioner has expressed its readiness and willingness
                      at each stage of the transaction. Thus, the respondent No.1 cannot be
                      allowed to frustrate the Collaboration Agreement by alienating the
                      Collaboration Property     and reducing the petitioner‟s claim to only
                      damages.

                      16.    
In support of its contentions, reliance has been placed on behalf of
                      the petitioner on the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in 
B.
                      Santoshamma V. D. Sarala

                      maintainability of the petition on the grounds of concealment and
                      suppression of material facts.

                      19.    It is submitted that the petitioner has suppressed the fact that the
                      Collaboration Agreement stands terminated and the petitioner itself has
                      filed on record the Deed of Cancellation dated 29th September 2021 as
                      Annexure P-10 to the petition.

                      20.    It is submitted that the petitioner has wrongly stated that it has
                      fulfilled its obligations as per the Collaboration Agreement. It is further
                      submitted that as per Clause 2.14 of the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement dated 17th August 2020, the petitioner was to
                      obtain license of the project to be developed on the Collaboration
                      Property by 15th December 2020, however, the petitioner failed to do so.
                      It is further submitted that the petitioner even failed to obtain the required
                      license for the project for almost 40 months, i.e., till the termination of
                      the Collaboration Agreement and that even till the filing of the instant
                      petition, the said license was not obtained. It is further submitted that
                      since, the license was not obtained by the petitioner, the respondent no. 1
                      was left with no other option but to terminate the Collaboration
                      Agreement and the General Power of Attorney vide a Legal Notice dated
                      29th September 2021.

                      21.    It is also submitted that there were consistent defaults on the part
                      of the petitioner submitting to the effect that after execution of the
                      petitioner failed to pay towards the part payment of the security amount
                      as ITS cheque was dishonoured due to " Insufficient Funds" . It is further
                      submitted that the petitioner never had any financial capacity to perform
                      its commitments. It is further submitted that to help the petitioner and to

                      cure the default of Rs.1.465 Crores the respondent no.1 agreed to reduce
                      the development area and resultantly the First Supplement Collaboration
                      Agreement was executed. It is further submitted that on account of the
                      delays on the part of the petitioner, when the licence was not forth
                      coming, after waiting for two years the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement dated 17th August, 2020 was executed so as to
                      put a long stop date on obtaining the licence. It is further submitted that
                      when the long stop date also got crossed without the receipt of licence
                      and after further wait of nine months, the respondent No.1 had no choice
                      but to terminate the agreement which was in the knowledge of the
                      petitioner.

                      22.    It was argued that it is only when the DTCP, vide its order dated
                      16th March, 2021 finally returned the application of the petitioner for
                      grant of licence for the project, and when the respondent No.1 came to
                      know about it, the respondent No.1 terminated the Collaboration
                      Agreement and cancelled the General Power of Attorney vide notice
                      dated 29th September, 2021, whereafter the possession of the
                      Collaboration Property was to be restored in the name of the respondent
                      No.1 which fact was well within the knowledge of the petitioner and its
                      partners.

                      23.    It is further submitted on behalf of the respondent No.1 that
                      petitioner has been siting over the land of the respondent No.1 for more
                      than five years even without obtaining the required licence and that an
                      amount of Rs.4.21 Crores can never be a sufficient consideration for the
                      land now worth Rs.120 Crores.

                      24.   It is further submitted on behalf of the respondent that upon the
                      termination of the Collaboration Agreement the arbitration clause
                      provided for therein no longer remained in existence.          It is further
                      submitted that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate even a single
                      arbitral dispute giving rise to any cause of action for filing the instant
                      petition.

                      25.    It is further submitted that petitioner has falsely stated that the
                      respondent No.1 and the respondent No.2 conspired to deceive the
                      petitioner by creating a falsified Second Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent No.1 that the
                      respondent no.2 was the designated partner of the petitioner at the time of
                      execution of the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement.
                      Moreover, the petitioner has not disputed the veracity of the First
                      Supplementary Collaboration Agreement dated 3rd June, 2019 executed
                      by the petitioner through its designated partner, i.e., respondent No.2 with
                      the respondent No.1. The said agreement was signed by the respondent
                      No.2 based on the authority granted in his favour by the petitioner vide a
                      Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019.

                      26.    The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent No.1

                      No.2 by the petitioner vide Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 was

                      of the subsequent calendar does not even whisper anything of sort and
                      respondent No.2 continued to attend such meetings.

                      27.    It is submitted that as per Clause 2 of the Collaboration Agreement
                      dated 15th May, 2018, the petitioner was required to pay a non-refundable
                      security   deposit of Rs.5,96,50,000/- to the respondent No.1. However,
                      the petitioner failed to pay the entire amount of the security deposit and
                      on 20th April, 2019, cheque No. No.000049 dated 15th March, 2019 for
                      Rs.1,46,50,000/- drawn on HDFC Bank issued by the petitioner in favour
                      of the respondent No.1 for the part payment of the above said security
                      deposit was dishonoured due to "Insufficient Funds" . It is submitted that
                      this clearly establishes that the petitioner never had any financial capacity
                      to complete its part of obligations.

                      28.    It is further submitted that the petitioner in this petition has alleged
                      fraud and fabrication, however, the said issues cannot be decided by this
                      Court in the proceedings arising under the Act.

                      29.    The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent No.1
                      submitted that the petitioner by way of present petition is seeking to sit
                      tight on the Collaboration Property which exclusively belongs to the
                      respondent No. l, by distorting and misrepresenting the facts before this
                      Court and thus the respondent no. 1 is made to suffer hardship due to
                      failures and inactions of the petitioner. It is submitted that the
                      Collaboration Property is worth more than Rs.100 Crores and the
                      petitioner is trying to grab the property by paying a paltry security deposit
                      of Rs.4.21 Crores.

                      30.    It is further argued that in case as the present one in view of the

                      Relief Act, an injunction cannot be granted in favour of the petitioner. 
In
                      support of this contention, reliance has been placed on behalf of the
                      respondent No.1 upon the judgments in 
Rajasthan Breweries Limited V.
                      the Stroh Brewery Company
; 2000            SCC OnLine Del 481 and

                      31.    To buttress the argument that the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement is not a forged and fabricated document, it was
                      submitted by the respondent No.1 that respondent No.2 (who signed the
                      Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement on behalf of the
                      petitioner) was a designated partner of the petitioner at the time of
                      execution of the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement. The
                      respondent No.2 till the date of the execution of the Second
                      Supplementary Collaboration Agreement was the designated partner of
                      the petitioner. The authority granted in favour of the respondent No.2 by
                      the petitioner vide a Board Resolution dated 3rd June 2019 was not
                      withdrawn by the petitioner, no earlier than 2nd March, 2021 which was
                      done much after the execution of the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement. The respondent No.1 has vehemently disputed
                      that the Board Resolution dated 3rd June 2019 is forged and fabricated.

                      32.    Therefore, it is submitted that the instant petition being devoid of

                      deserves to be dismissed summarily on the sole ground of concealment
                      and suppression of material facts and various false and misleading
                      statements have been made by the petitioner in the present petition. It is
                      submitted that the petitioner was well aware of the termination of the
                      Collaboration Agreement.

                      34.    It is argued that the Second Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement is a validly executed agreement. So far as the Board
                      Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 is concerned, it is submitted that the
                      petitioner has not disputed or denied the issuance of authority or
                      questioned its validity or authenticity in favour of respondent No.2 in its
                      petition.   In fact, on the contrary, the petitioner has filed a set of
                      documents in support of its petition which contains and refers to the said
                      Board Resolution.

                      35.    It is submitted that as per the Minutes of the Meeting dated 2nd
                      March, 2021, the old Resolutions were terminated from 2nd March, 2021
                      onwards. Assuming without admitting that no authority was given in
                      favour of the respondent No.2 by the petitioner vide Resolution dated 3rd
                      June, 2019, then the First Supplementary Collaboration Agreement
                      should also not be a valid document. However, the petitioner has not
                      disputed or denied the existence of the First Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement.

                      36.    Ms.Dubey further submitted that it was also in the knowledge of
                      the petitioner that the Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 was a document
                      filed along with the First Supplementary Collaboration Agreement with
                      the Sub-Registrar‟s office in Gurgaon. It is only through the rejoinder to

                      for the first time questioned the said Board Resolution dated 3 rd June,
                      2019 filed by the petitioner itself and introduced new facts and
                      documents which the respondent No.2 vehemently denies.

                      37.    It is further submitted that the documents filed along with the
                      rejoinder by the petitioner are false, forged and fabricated and Resolution
                      dated 3rd June, 2019, sought to be challenged in the rejoinder, has been in
                      existence prior to the filing of the petition. It is submitted that nothing
                      precluded the petitioner to file the same with the petition. It is only after
                      the respondent No.2‟s reply that petitioner through its rejoinder sought to
                      challenge the purported Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 which was in
                      existence earlier.

                      38.   It is the case of the respondent No.2 that when the petitioner raised
                      a question as to the authenticity     of the document for the first time
                      through its rejoinder, the respondent No.2 approached the Sub-Registrar‟s
                      office to get a certified copy of the First Collaboration Agreement, the
                      respondent No.2 was shocked to discover that the petitioner in collusion
                      with the staff at the Sub-Registrar‟s office tried to replace the original
                      Resolution dated 3rd June, 2019 with the purported Resolution dated 3 rd
                      June, 2019. The respondent No.2 immediately complained to the
                      Tehsildar Sohna about the same who in turn got an FIR bearing 0065
                      dated 7th February, 2023 lodged with the Haryana Police, City Sohna
                      Police Station.

                      39.    It is further submitted that the copy of the Minutes of the Meeting
                      dated 27th June, 2019 and 29th June, 2019 are fabricated for they bear the
                      signatures of Mr.Deepak Kumar Agarwal alone despite the Minutes of

                      It is further submitted that a bare comparison of the Minutes of Meetings
                      filed along with petition with the purported Minutes of Meetings filed
                      with petition bear the signatures of all present in those meetings as
                      opposed to the purported Minutes of Meetings filed along with the
                      rejoinder would show that the Minutes of Meetings filed with the petition
                      bear the signatures of all present in those meetings as opposed to the
                      purported Minutes of Meetings filed with the rejoinder which bears the
                      signature of only Mr.Deepak Kumar Agarwal.

                      40.    It was also argued on behalf of the respondent No.2 that the
                      purported reports issued by the Forensics questioning the authenticity of
                      the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement cannot be relied on
                      for the same are procured from a private party.

                      41.    Therefore, it is submitted that the instant petition is nothing but an
                      abuse of process of law and warrants dismissal from this Court.

                      perused the record.



                      FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS



                      43.   In the instant case, the petitioner has invoked 
Section 10
 of the
                      Specific Relief Act, 1963 to submit that it was entitled to specific
                      performance of the contract, that is, the Collaboration Agreement dated
                      15th May 2018. For a proper adjudication of this claim raised by the
                      petitioner, it is pertinent to examine the provision and the bearing it may
                      have on the facts and circumstances of the instant case.

                      44.   
Section 10
 of the Specific Relief Act is reproduced hereunder:-

                            ENFORCED

                            10. Specific performance in respect of contracts.--The
                            specific performance of a contract shall be enforced by
                            the court subject to the provisions contained in sub-

                            section (2) of 
section 11
, 
section 14
 and 
section 16
."



                      45.   
Section 10
 of the Specific Relief Act, which provides for specific
                      performance of a contract, acts as an enabling provision which a party to
                      a contract may invoke to seek its enforcement with the intervention of the
                      courts. The provision is to be read with 
Sections 11(2)
, 
14
 and 
16
 of the
                      said Act which provide for situations in which specific performance of a
                      contract may not be invoked or is barred.

 
46.   The relief of specific performance is an equitable relief. As per the
                      amended Act, the courts no longer have discretionary powers under the
                      
Specific Relief Act
 while granting such a relief. The court may be
                      required to be satisfied on certain tests before granting the relief of
                      specific performance, however, upon fulfilment of the ingredients and
                      satisfaction of the court, a relief of specific performance may mandatorily
                      be granted. To this effect, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in

                                 followed the English position on equitable
                                 remedy of specific performance. In Common
                                 Law, the remedy of specific performance was
                                 unknown in the initial days and courts only
                                 granted damages for the value of goods if there
                                 was any breach of contract. Accordingly
                                 English courts, in the early years, granted
                                 monetary relief. In order to rectify the harsh
                                 stance of law, Courts of Equity in England
                                 started granting relief of specific performance if
                                 the Court of Equity found that granting
                                 damages would be inadequate or some special
                                 equitable rights of the plaintiff under a trust
                                 have been breached.



                                 45. In any case, grant of such relief, which
                                 emanated from equitable principles, remained
                                 discretionary. This principle is clearly
                                 explained by Swinfen Eady M.R., in Whiteley
                                 Ltd. v. Hilt [Whiteley Ltd. v. Hilt, (1918) 2 KB
                                 808 (CA)] , in the following manner : (KB p.

                                    "... the power vested in the Court to order
                                    the delivery up of a particular chattel is
                                    discretionary, and ought not to be
                                    exercised when the chattel is an ordinary
                                    article of commerce and of no special
                                    value or interest, and not alleged to be of
                                    any special value to the plaintiff, and
                                    where the damages would fully
                                    compensate."



                                 46. However, this was not the position under the

                                 adherence to the sanctity of contract is enforced

                                 48. We do not subscribe to the aforesaid
                                 reasoning provided by the High Court for the
                                 simple reason that after the 2018 Amendment,
                                 specific performance, which stood as a
                                 discretionary remedy, is not (sic now) codified
                                 as an enforceable right which is not dependent
                                 anymore on equitable principles expounded by
                                 Judges, rather it is founded on satisfaction of
                                 the requisite ingredients as provided under the
                                 
Specific Relief Act
. For determination of
                                 whether a substituted law is procedural or
                                 substantive, reference to the nature of the
                                 parent enactment may not be material. Instead,
                                 it is the nature of the amendments which
                                 determine whether they are in the realm of
                                 procedural or substantive law.



                                 51. In any case, the amendment carried out in
                                 2018 was enacted to further bolster adherence
                                 to the sanctity of contracts. This approach was
                                 radical and created new rights and obligations
                                 which did not exist prior to such an amendment.
                                 
Section 10
, after amendment, reads as under:

                                    "10. Specific performance in respect of
                                    contracts.--The specific performance of a

                                   52. This provision, which remained in the realm
                                   of the courts' discretion, was converted into a
                                   mandatory provision, prescribing a power the
                                   courts had to exercise when the ingredients
                                   were fulfilled. This was a significant step in the
                                   growth of commercial law as the sanctity of
                                   contracts was reinforced with parties having to
                                   comply with contracts and thereby reducing
                                   efficient breaches.



                                   53. Under the pre-amended 
Specific Relief Act
,
                                   one of the major considerations for grant of
                                   specific performance was the adequacy of
                                   damages under 
Section 14(1)(a)
. However, this
                                   consideration has now been completely done
                                   away with, in order to provide better
                                   compensation to the aggrieved party in the form
                                   of specific performance.



                                   54. Having come to the conclusion that the
                                   2018 Amendment was not a mere procedural
                                   enactment, rather it had substantive principles
                                   built into its working, this Court cannot hold
                                   that    such     amendments     would    apply
                                   retrospectively."



                      47.   However, the question before this Court is substantially different.
                      In the instant matter, the Collaboration Agreement between the parties
                      already stands terminated. The said termination has not been challenged
                      by either the petitioner or even the respondent No. 2 (former designated
                      partner of the petitioner). Therefore, the issue which remains is whether
                      the petitioner can seek specific performance of a contract which no
                      longer remains in existence. It is the petitioner‟s case that it was always

                      49.    It is trite law that continuous readiness and willingness on the part
                      of the petitioner is a condition precedent for the grant of relief of Specific
                      Performance. It is the bounden duty of the petitioner to prove its
                      readiness and willingness by way of adducing evidence. The crucial facet
                      has to be determined by considering all the circumstances including
                      availability of funds and mere statements or averment in the present

                      16(c)
 of the Specific Relief Act, a distinction can be drawn between
                      readiness and willingness to perform the contract. Both ingredients are
                      necessary to be established for the grant of relief of the specific
                      performance.

                      50.    While readiness means the capacity of the petitioner to perform
                      the contract, willingness relates to the conduct of the petitioner. It is not
                      disputed that under the Collaboration Agreement (amended by the First
                      Supplementary Agreement), the petitioner was required to get a licence
                      from DTCP in a timely manner which it failed to get even after 5 years.

                      51.    Though this Court knows that the contract did not stipulate a
                      particular time period within which this licence was to be obtained, it
                      ought to have been obtained within a reasonable time period. Thus, the

                      time period cannot be completely ignored. It is also not disputed that the
                      petitioner was unable to make payment towards the earnest money as was
                      initially agreed between the parties, which was one of the crucial factors
                      while executing the First Supplementary Agreement.           It is also not
                      disputed that one of the post dated cheques handed over at the time of the
                      Collaboration Agreement was dishonoured for "Insufficient Funds".

                      52.    In the present case, the petitioner through the Minutes of the
                      Meeting filed has itself admitted about the worsen condition of the LLP
                      and how the LLP has been observing serious financial crunch and losses
                      which is effecting its state of affairs and market status. I am, thus, of the
                      prima facie view that owing to failure to obtain the licence within
                      reasonable time period and its adversely affected and worsening financial
                      condition, the petitioner has failed to prove its readiness and willingness
                      to perform the essential terms of the Collaboration Agreement.

 
53.   The learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent
                      No.1 argued that the petitioner had only paid an amount of Rs.4.21
                      Crores as earnest money while the price of the land is about at INR 120
                      Crores. Having paid an amount insignificant in comparison to the value
                      of the property, the petitioner is not entitled to discretionary equitable
                      relief of specific performance. This Court finds weight in the argument as
                      was also observed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court in 
Saradamani

                                 deciding cases relating to specific performance.
                                 The steep increase in prices is a circumstance
                                 which makes it inequitable to grant the relief of
                                 specific performance where the purchaser does
                                 not take steps to complete the sale within the
                                 agreed period, and the vendor has not been
                                 responsible for any delay or non-performance.
                                 A purchaser can no longer take shelter under
                                 the principle that time is not of essence in
                                 performance of contracts relating to immovable
                                 property, to cover his delays, laches, breaches
                                 and "non-readiness". The precedents from an
                                 era, when high inflation was unknown, holding
                                 that time is not of the essence of the contract in
                                 regard to immovable properties, may no longer
                                 apply, not because the principle laid down
                                 therein is unsound or erroneous, but the
                                 circumstances that existed when the said
                                 principle was evolved, no longer exist. In these
                                 days of galloping increases in prices of
                                 immovable properties, to hold that a vendor
                                 who took an earnest money of say about 10% of
                                 the sale price and agreed for three months or
                                 four months as the period for performance, did
                                 not intend that time should be the essence, will
                                 be a cruel joke on him, and will result in
                                 injustice. Adding to the misery is the delay in
                                 disposal of cases relating to specific
                                 performance, as suits and appeals therefrom
                                 routinely take two to three decades to attain
                                 finality. As a result, an owner agreeing to sell a
                                 property for rupees one lakh and received
                                 rupees ten thousand as advance may be
                                 required to execute a sale deed a quarter
                                 century later by receiving the remaining rupees
                                 ninety thousand, when the property value has
                                 risen to a crore of rupees.

                                Therefore, it cannot be overlooked that, in fact, the Court is
                      obliged to take initial notice of the phenomenal rise in the price of real
                      estate.

                      54.       It has been contended on behalf of the petitioner that the
                      Collaboration Agreement dated 15th May, 2018 was not a determinable
                      contract. To address this argument it is pertinent to refer to 
Section 14
 of
                      the Act which deals with the contracts which are not specifically
                      enforceable by a Court and which reads as under:

                                      "14. Contracts not specifically enforceable.--
                                      The following contracts cannot be specifically
                                      enforced, namely:--

                                      (a) where a party to the contract has obtained
                                      substituted performance of contract in
                                      accordance with the provisions of 
section 20
;

                                      (b) a contract, the performance of which
                                      involves the performance of a continuous duty
                                      which the court cannot supervise;

                                      (c) a contract which is so dependent on the
                                      personal qualifications of the parties that the
                                      court cannot enforce specific performance of its
                                      material terms; and

                                      (d) a contract which is in its nature
                                      determinable."



                                Therefore,   upon   a   bare   reading   of   the   provision,      the
                      argument/contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is rejected.

                      55.       This also has bearing on injunctions which may be sought by the
                      parties, as 
Section 41(e)
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides that an
                      injunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of a contract, the
                      performance of which would not be specifically enforced. However,
                      merely, the fact that a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to

                      perform a certain act, coupled with a negative agreement expressed or
                      implied not to perform a certain act, the circumstance that the Court is
                      unable to compel a specific performance of affirmative agreement will
                      not be precluded for granting an injunction to perform the negative
                      agreement, provided that the party has not failed to perform the contract
                      so as for it is binding on him.

                      56.    The records show that the Second Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement was executed between the parties which gives a right to the
                      respondent No.1 to terminate the agreement, in case the licence is not
                      obtained by the particular days/date. It is an admitted fact that the
                      required licence was not obtained by the petitioner within the stipulated
                      time period and respondent No.1 had executed a deed of cancellation
                      dated 29th September, 2021 subsequently.

                      57.    It also cannot be ignored that respondent No.2 (a designated
                      partner of the petitioner at that time), who had been authorized to sign the
                      First Supplementary Collaboration Agreement, had executed the Second
                      Supplementary Collaboration Agreement. The Board Resolution on the
                      basis of which the Second Supplementary Collaboration Agreement was
                      signed, which the petitioner now disputes, was the document produced by
                      the petitioner itself through its petition without challenge to the said
                      Board Resolution.

                      58.    The contention of the petitioner that the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement as also the Board Resolution is a forged and
                      fabricated document is really a controversy between the petitioner and the
                      respondent No.2. Going by the doctrine of indoor management, as such,
                      respondent No.1, who is an outsider, is protected and has nothing to do

                      with the internal functioning of the petitioner. Further, this Court on the
                      contention of the petitioner that the clauses of the Second Supplementary
                      Collaboration Agreement are unconscionable and virtually efface the
                      understandings, rights and obligations of the petitioner under the original
                      Collaboration Agreement also does not find force for it is only reasonable
                      for any prudent mind to protect its right having waited for years for a
                      licence to see the light of the day.

                      59.    Having said that since both the parties have made contentions
                      regarding forgery and fabrication of the documents against each other,
                      without going into the controversy and contemplating on the same even
                      otherwise to complete ignore the Second Supplementary Collaboration
                      Agreement, it would not be out of place to state that the Collaboration
                      Agreement being a private corner of the transaction, from the very nature
                      of the agreement could be terminated. The Collaboration Agreement
                      executed between the parties is qua development agreement. This is a
                      commercial transaction between the private parties and hence the same by
                      its very nature is determinable, even if there is termination clause in the
                      Collaboration Agreement.

                                 understanding between the parties or for any
                                 other reason, the remedy of the appellants
                                 would be to seek compensation for wrongful
                                 termination but not a claim for specific
                                 performance of the agreements and for that
                                 view of the matter learned Single Judge was
                                 justified in coming to the conclusion that the
                                 appellant had sought for an injunction seeking
                                 to specifically enforce the agreement. Such an
                                 injunction is statutorily prohibited with respect
                                 of a contract, which is determinable in nature.
                                 The application being under the provisions of
                                 
Section 9(ii)(e)
 of the Arbitration and
                                 Conciliation Act, relief was not granted in view

Section 9
 of the Act shall not apply to
                                 the contract, which is otherwise determinable in

                      61.   It is also contended on behalf of the petitioner that intent of the
                      parties while signing the Collaboration Agreement was to create rights
                      over the said property in favour of the petitioner. It is submitted that in
                      pursuance of the agreement the possession was being handed over by the
                      respondent No.1 by executing a General Power of Attorney in favour of
                      the petitioner and hence, the petitioner is entitled to the specific
                      performance of the Agreement. However, this Court does not find force
                      in the arguments advanced. In the present case both respondent No.1 and
                      the petitioner claimed to be in the possession of the said property. Be that
                      as it may, Clause 3.1 of the Collaboration Agreement (as amended by the
                      First Supplementary Collaboration Agreement) provides as under:

                                    " Consideration & Area Allocation
                                   The SECOND PARTY hereby transfer all the
                                   development/ all other rights of the Scheduled
                                   Property along with physical possession thereof
                                   to the FIRST PARTY for carrying out the
                                   development and construction of residential
                                   plotted colony and/or any other project on the
                                   Scheduled Property, as may be decided by the
                                   FIRST PARTY, at its own cost and expenses by
                                   the FIRST PARTY, in consideration of payment
                                   of Non-Refundable Earnest Money and
                                   allocation of the plotted area to the SECOND
                                   PARTY as set out in this Agreement. The FIRST
                                   PARTY shall develop the Scheduled Property as

                                   discretion."

                      physical possession to the petitioner, two conditions had to be met.
                      Firstly, the payment of the non-refundable earnest money by the
                      petitioner and secondly, the allocation of plotted area to respondent No.1.
                      Clause 3.4 provides that the petitioner shall allot the said property area to
                      the respondent No.1 after issuance of a licence and other approvals of the
                      project which are necessary prior to the allotment of any plot in the
                      project. Thus, while the first condition was fulfilled by the petitioner, the
                      second condition was not fulfilled for lack of licence, thus, the question
                      of any transfer of rights or physical possession does not arise.

                      63.    The Collaboration Agreement being determinable in nature in
                      view of the above said discussion is not applicable in specific
                      performance in view of the statutory bar contained in 
Section 14 (d)
 of
                      the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Further, there is such no negative covenant
                      in the Collaboration Agreement to make out a case for an injunction.

                      64.    Thus, in terms of 
Section 14(d)
 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963,
                      no injunction can be granted to prevent breach of the contract, the
                      performance of which can not enforced. As noted above, the respondent
                      No.1 has already terminated the Collaboration Agreement vide its notice
                      dated 29th September, 2021, which is not questioned by the petitioner,
                      hence, the remaining relief which may be sought by the petitioner is to
                      seek damages, if any. Thus, where the petitioner is statutorily barred from
                      seeking specific performance of the Collaboration Agreement, the
                      petitioner cannot be held entitled to claim interim relief under 
Section 9

                      of the Act. 
In this regard, reference is made to the case of

Section 9
 does not envisage the restoration of the
                      contract which stands terminated.


                      65.    If the petitioner is aggrieved by the letter of termination of the
                      contract and is advised to challenge the validity thereof the petitioner can
                      always invoke the arbitration clause to claim damages, if any, suffered by
                      the petitioner. It is not open to this Court to restore the contract under
                      
Section 9
 which is meant only for the sole purpose of preserving and
                      maintaining the property in dispute and cannot be used to enforce the

 in a 
Section 9

                      of the Act petition held as under:-


                                   "8. There was considerable debate before us on
                                   the scope of 
Section 9
 of the Act. According to
                                   learned counsel for Adhunik Steels, 
Section 9
 of
                                   the Act stood independent of Section 94 and
                                   
Order 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure
 and
                                   the exercise of power thereunder was also not
                                   trammelled by anything contained in the
                                   
Specific Relief Act
. Learned counsel contended
                                   that by way of an interim measure, the court
                                   could pass an order for the preservation or
                                   custody of the subject-matter of the arbitration
                                   agreement irrespective of whether the order

                                 to breach the agreement or terminate the
                                 agreement and what would be its consequences,
                                 the court had not only the power but the duty to
                                 protect the right of Adhunik Steels conferred by
                                 the contract when approached under 
Section 9

                                 of the Act. Learned counsel emphasised that
                                 what was liable to be protected in an
                                 appropriate case was the subject-matter of the
                                 arbitration agreement. Learned counsel
                                 referred to The Law and Practice of
                                 Commercial Arbitration in England by Mustill
                                 and Boyd and relied on the following passage
                                 therefrom:



                                 "(b) Safeguarding the subject-matter of the
                                 dispute
                                 The existence of a dispute may put at risk the
                                 property which forms the subject of the
                                 reference, or the rights of a party in respect of
                                 that property. Thus, the dispute may prevent
                                 perishable goods from being put to their
                                 intended use, or may impede the proper
                                 exploitation of a profit-earning article, such as
                                 a ship. If the disposition of the property has to
                                 wait until after the award has resolved the
                                 dispute, unnecessary hardship may be caused to
                                 the parties. Again, there may be a risk that if the
                                 property is left in the custody or control of one
                                 of the parties, pending the hearing, he may
                                 abuse his position in such a way that even if the
                                 other party ultimately succeeds in the
                                 arbitration, he will not obtain the full benefit of
                                 the award. In cases such as this, the court (and
                                 in some instances the arbitrator) has power to
                                 intervene, for the purpose of maintaining the
                                 status quo until the award is made. The
                                 remedies available under the Act are as
                                 follows:

                                 (i) The grant of an interlocutory injunction.

                                 (ii) The appointment of a receiver.

                                 11. It is true that 
Section 9
 of the Act speaks of
                                 the court by way of an interim measure passing
                                 an order for protection, for the preservation,
                                 interim custody or sale of any goods, which are
                                 the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement
                                 and such interim measure of protection as may
                                 appear to the court to be just and convenient.
                                 The grant of an interim prohibitory injunction
                                 or an interim mandatory injunction are
                                 governed by well-known rules and it is difficult
                                 to imagine that the legislature while enacting
                                 
Section 9
 of the Act intended to make a
                                 provision which was dehors the accepted
                                 principles that governed the grant of an interim
                                 injunction. Same is the position regarding the
                                 appointment of a receiver since the section itself
                                 brings in the concept of "just and convenient"

                                 while speaking of passing any interim measure
                                 of protection. The concluding words of the

                                 interim measures under 
Section 9
 of the Act.



                                 16. Injunction is a form of specific relief. It is an
                                 order of a court requiring a party either to do a
                                 specific act or acts or to refrain from doing a
                                 specific act or acts either for a limited period or
                                 without limit of time. In relation to a breach of
                                 contract, the proper remedy against a defendant
                                 who acts in breach of his obligations under a
                                 contract, is either damages or specific relief.
                                 The two principal varieties of specific relief are,
                                 decree of specific performance and the
                                 injunction (See David Bean on Injunctions). 
The
                                 Specific Relief Act, 1963
 was intended to be "an
                                 Act to define and amend the law relating to
                                 certain kinds of specific reliefs". Specific relief
                                 is relief in specie. It is a remedy which aims at
                                 the exact fulfilment of an obligation. According
                                 to Dr. Banerjee in his Tagore Law Lectures on
                                 Specific Relief, the remedy for the non-
                                 performance of a duty are (1) compensatory, (2)
                                 specific. In the former, the court awards
                                 damages for breach of the obligation. In the
                                 latter, it directs the party in default to do or
                                 forbear from doing the very thing, which he is
                                 bound to do or forbear from doing. The law of
                                 specific relief is said to be, in its essence, a part
                                 of the law of procedure, for, specific relief is a
                                 form of judicial redress. Thus, the Specific
                                 Relief Act, 1963 purports to define and amend
                                 the law relating to certain kinds of specific
                                 reliefs obtainable in civil courts. It does not
                                 deal with the remedies connected with
                                 compensatory reliefs except as incidental and to
                                 a limited extent. The right to relief of

Part III of the

                                 or perpetual. 
Section 38

                                 perpetual injunctions are granted and 
Section
                                 39
 indicates when mandatory injunctions are
                                 granted. 
Section 40
 provides that damages may
                                 be awarded either in lieu of or in addition to
                                 injunctions.    
Section    41
     provides   for

                                 perform a negative covenant. Thus, the power
                                 to grant injunctions by way of specific relief is
                                 covered by the 
Specific Relief Act, 1963

In 
Nepa Ltd. v. Manoj Kumar Agrawal
 [AIR
                                 1999 MP 57] a learned Judge of the Madhya
                                 Pradesh High Court has suggested that when
                                 moved under 
Section 9
 of the Act for interim
                                 protection, the provisions of the 
Specific Relief
                                 Act
 cannot be made applicable since in taking
                                 interim measures under 
Section 9
 of the Act, the
                                 court does not decide on the merits of the case
                                 or the rights of parties and considers only the
                                 question of existence of an arbitration clause
                                 and the necessity of taking interim measures for
                                 issuing necessary directions or orders. When
                                 the grant of relief by way of injunction is, in
                                 general, governed by the

Specific Relief Act
 can be kept out of
                                 consideration. For, the grant of that interim
                                 injunction has necessarily to be based on the
                                 principles governing its grant emanating out of
                                 the relevant provisions of the 
Specific Relief Act

                                 and the law bearing on the subject. Under
                                 
Section 28
 of the Act of 1996, even the Arbitral
                                 Tribunal is enjoined to decide the dispute
                                 submitted to it, in accordance with the
                                 substantive law for the time being in force in
                                 India, if it is not an international commercial
                                 arbitration. So, it cannot certainly be inferred
                                 that 
Section 9
 keeps out the substantive law
                                 relating to interim reliefs.




                                 18. The approach that at the initial stage, only
                                 the existence of an arbitration clause need be
                                 considered is not justified. In Siskina (Cargo

                                 explained the position : (All ER p. 824f-g)
                                 "A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is
                                 not a cause of action. It cannot stand on its
                                 own. It is dependant on there being a pre-

                                 existing cause of action against the defendant
                                 arising out of an invasion, actual or threatened,
                                 by him of a legal or equitable right of the
                                 plaintiff for the enforcement of which the
                                 defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the
                                 court. The right to obtain an interlocutory
                                 injunction is merely ancillary and incidental to
                                 the pre-existing cause of action. It is granted to
                                 preserve the status quo pending the

                           He concluded : (All ER p. 825a-b)

                                 "To come within the sub-paragraph the

                                 21. It is true that the intention behind 
Section 9

                                 of the Act is the issuance of an order for
                                 preservation of the subject-matter of an
                                 arbitration agreement. According to learned
                                 counsel for Adhunik Steels, the subject-matter
                                 of the arbitration agreement in the case on
                                 hand, is the mining and lifting of ore by it from
                                 the mines leased to OMM Private Limited for a
                                 period of 10 years and its attempted abrupt
                                 termination by OMM Private Limited and the
                                 dispute before the arbitrator would be the effect
                                 of the agreement and the right of OMM Private
                                 Limited to terminate it prematurely in the
                                 circumstances of the case. So viewed, it was
                                 open to the court to pass an order by way of an
                                 interim measure of protection that the existing
                                 arrangement under the contract should be

                                 by the arbitrator. May be, there is some force in

                                 Steels. But, at the same time, whether an interim

                                 the classical rules for the grant of such an
                                 interim measure. Whether an interim mandatory
                                 injunction could be granted directing the
                                 continuance of the working of the contract, had
                                 to be considered in the light of the well-settled
                                 principles in that behalf. Similarly, whether the
                                 attempted termination could be restrained
                                 leaving the consequences thereof vague would
                                 also be a question that might have to be
                                 considered in the context of well-settled
                                 principles for the grant of an injunction.

                                 Therefore, on the whole, we feel that it would
                                 not be correct to say that the power under
                                 
Section 9
 of the Act is totally independent of the
                                 well-known principles governing the grant of an
                                 interim injunction that generally govern the
                                 courts in this connection. So viewed, we have
                                 necessarily to see whether the High Court was
                                 justified in refusing the interim injunction on
                                 the facts and in the circumstances of the case.



                                 24. But, in that context, we cannot brush aside
                                 the contention of the learned counsel for
                                 Adhunik Steels that if OMM Private Limited is
                                 permitted to enter into other agreements with
                                 others for the same purpose, it would be unjust
                                 when the stand of OMM Private Limited is that
                                 it was cancelling the agreement mainly because
                                 it was hit by Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession
                                 Rules, 1960. Going by the stand adopted by
                                 OMM Private Limited, it is clear that OMM
                                 Private Limited cannot enter into a similar
                                 transaction with any other entity since that
                                 would also entail the apprehended violation of

                                 Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960,
                                 as put forward by it. It therefore appears to be
                                 just and proper to direct OMM Private Limited
                                 not to enter into a contract for mining and
                                 lifting of minerals with any other entity until the
                                 conclusion of the arbitral proceedings.



                                 25. At the same time, we see no justification in
                                 preventing OMM Private Limited from carrying
                                 on the mining operations by itself. It has got a
                                 mining lease and subject to any award that may
                                 be passed by the arbitrator on the effect of the
                                 contract it had entered into with Adhunik Steels,
                                 it has the right to mine and lift the minerals
                                 therefrom. The carrying on of that activity by
                                 OMM Private Limited cannot prejudice
                                 Adhunik Steels, since ultimately Adhunik Steels,
                                 if it succeeds, would be entitled to get, if not the
                                 main relief, compensation for the termination of
                                 the contract on the principles well settled in that
                                 behalf. Therefore, it is not possible to accede to
                                 the contention of learned counsel for Adhunik
                                 Steels that in any event OMM Private Limited
                                 must be restrained from carrying on any mining
                                 operation in the mines concerned pending the
                                 arbitral proceedings.



                                 26. We think that we should refrain from
                                 discussing the various issues at great length
                                 since we feel that any discussion by us in that
                                 behalf could prejudice either of the parties
                                 before the arbitrator or the Arbitral Tribunal.
                                 We have therefore confined ourselves to making
                                 such general observations as are necessary in
                                 the context of the elaborate arguments raised
                                 before us by learned counsel.

                      subject was also considered by a Division Bench of this Court and the
                      following was observed:-

 
"19. Law on the scope of interference in a
                                  
Section 9
 petition is no longer res integra. The
                                  learned Single Judge has held that the prayer
                                  made by the Appellant in the 
Section 9
 petition
                                  cannot be granted as that would amount to
                                  extending the contract contrary to the decision
                                  dated 29.04.2022. It is well-settled that powers
                                  under 
Section 9
 can only be exercised for
                                  preservation of the subject matter of the dispute
                                  till the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal and
                                  cannot be extended to directing specific
                                  performanceof the contract itself. The learned

                                  the powers of the Court under 
Section 9
 of the
                                  Act.
 
For a ready reference,we may allude to
                                  para 40 of the judgment in

                                  follows:-

 2014 SCC
                                         OnLine Del 4441, this Court had held
                                         that while exercising jurisdiction under
                                         
Section 9
 of the A&C Act, the Court
                                         cannot ignore the underlying principles
                                         which govern the analogous powers
                                         conferred under Order XXXIX Rules 1 &

 and

                                         Not only is the court required to be
                                         satisfied that a valid arbitration
                                         agreement existed between the parties,
                                         but the powers under 
Section 9
 of the
                                         A&C Act could be exercised only for
                                         orders of an interim measure of
                                         protection in respect of the matters
                                         specified in

 to (e) of the
                                         A&C Act. In other words, the orders must

                                         which is the subject matter of the dispute,

69.    In the background, facts and circumstances of the instant case, it is
                      also deemed relevant to look into the matters wherein the closely related
                      issues were considered. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court while adjudicating a
                      similar issue in 
Yusuf Khan v. Prajita Developers (P) Ltd.
, (2018) 12
                      SCC 683 observed as under:-


                                  "4. The substance of the agreement is that the
                                  appellant agreed to "grant to the Developers
                                  the right to develop the said property" and the
                                  Developers agreed to develop the property on
                                  various terms and conditions specified under
                                  the agreement. It appears from the record that
                                  there is some single venture partnership
                                  agreement between the two companies
                                  (Developers). From the huge mass of
                                  documents filed in these appeals, it appears that
                                  there are two documents witnessing such
                                  partnership agreement. They are dated 16-6-
                                  2006 and 10-12-2008. The language and
                                  content of both the documents is substantially
                                  similar and an interesting fact which is required
                                  to be taken note of is that the 16-6-2006
                                  document refers to the agreement dated 23-6-
                                  2006. The complete details of the terms and

                                 15. On 8-10-2015, the appellant terminated the
                                 agreement and informed the same to Prajita by
                                 issuing a notice through his lawyer. Relevant
                                 part of the notice is as follows:



                                       "In view of the above, we hereby
                                       terminate the development agreement
                                       dated 23-6-2006. And we call upon you
                                       to remove yourself from the said
                                       property,    with    immediate  effect,
                                       otherwise, our client will be taking
                                       appropriate action against you.



                                       Our client reserves his right to claim
                                       damages for not carrying out the activity
                                       of the construction on the said property
                                       and/or completing the work of
                                       construction within the stipulated time
                                       and causing severe hardship to our
                                       client."



                                 18.1. The appellant granted to the Developers

                                 of the agreement dated 23-6-2006. In the

                                  circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion
                                  that permitting the continuance of the suit for
                                  specific performance of the agreement which is
                                  more than a decade old against a person from
                                  whom Prajita secured the development rights of
                                  the property in dispute which ultimately would
                                  enable Prajita to 25% of the monetary value of
                                  the development potential as against the right of
                                  the appellant who is entitled for 75% of the
                                  monetary value of the development potential
                                  would be unjust.



                                  23. The background of the facts and
                                  circumstances of the case whether Prajita
                                  would be entitled for any damages apart from
                                  receiving the abovementioned amount of Rs 20
                                  crores from the appellant is a matter which
                                  requires some examination. We therefore, deem
                                  it appropriate to refer the said question for
                                  resolution by arbitration between the appellant
                                  and Prajita. We, therefore, direct that the
                                  parties shall submit the abovementioned dispute
                                  for arbitration by Hon'ble Shri Justice P.
                                  Venkatarama Reddy, former Judge of this Court
                                  in accordance with law. The Registry is directed

                                 plaintiff. Even though the plaintiff sent a reply,
                                 dated 29.09.2006, she has not proved that on
                                 the date of sending reply she was having
                                 sufficient means to pay the balance sale
                                 consideration and the defendant has also stated
                                 that since the plaintiff has failed to clear the
                                 dues, the defendant made alternative
                                 arrangements with private financiers and
                                 cleared the dues to the bank and therefore, the

                                 within the time stipulated in the agreement
                                 dated 28.10.2005 and therefore, issue numbers
                                 1 to 5 are answered against the plaintiff.



                                 39. As already held that the plaintiff has not
                                 proved the readiness and willingness to perform
                                 her part of the contract, she is not entitled for
                                 the relief of specific performance and         the
                                 defendant sent a notice dated 24.06.2006
                                 and terminated the agreement dated 28.10.2005
                                 by sending the advance amount received by the
                                 defendant from the plaintiff. Though it is settled
                                 preposition that unilateral cancellation is not
                                 permissible, but after the expiry of the terms
                                 and conditions mentioned in the agreement, and
                                 further since the plaintiff did not make the
                                 payment to clear the bank dues, the defendant
                                 made private arrangements to clear the dues
                                 and therefore the purpose has been completed
                                 without the help of the plaintiff and hence, the
                                 defendant has cancelled the agreement. As per
                                 the agreement, the balance sale consideration
                                 would be paid at the time of execution of the
                                 sale deed. But the plaintiff very well know that
                                 the defendant received the possession notice

                                   from the bank and unless the defendant paid the
                                   bank dues and redeemed the property he cannot
                                   execute the sale deed. Therefore, the plaintiff
                                   has not proved that she made the payment to
                                   clear the bank dues, except she made
                                   payment of Rs. 13,30000 on several dataes. But
                                   the plaintiff has not proved that she along with
                                   the defendant approached the bank to settle the
                                   dues. Therefore, under the circumstances, the
                                   plaintiff is not entitled to get the declaration
                                   that the agreement dated 28.10.2005 has been
                                   duly rescinded and terminated by the defendant
                                   on 24.06.2006 and this issue is answered
                                   accordingly."



                      71.   Therefore, it is evident that where the Agreement already stood
                      terminated, without a challenge to the same, there remains no scope for
                      intervention of this Court, specifically under 
Section 9
 of the Arbitration
                      Act or 
Section 10
 of the Specific Relief Act.



                      CONCLUSION



                      72.   Keeping in view the facts, circumstances, contentions raised in the
                      pleadings, arguments advanced on behalf of the parties, as well as the
                      discussion in the foregoing paragraphs, this Court is of the considered
                      view that the petitioner is not entitled to the relief sought for.

                      73.   The Collaboration Agreement between the parties already stands
                      terminated, therefore, there is an impossibility for this Court to direct its
                      specific performance in a proceedings under 
Section 9
 of the Act.
                      Further, as decided by this Court as well as the Hon‟ble Supreme Court,

                      specific performance of a contract may not be granted in proceedings
                      under 
Section 9
 of the Act. Moreover, the petitioner has failed to show its
                      readiness and willingness to perform the Agreement.

                      74.   The contentions of the parties as regards the arbitrary breach of the
                      terms of the Collaboration Agreement on account of fraud are issues that
                      may be decided by the relevant Forum and shall not be adjudicated by
                      way of the instant proceedings.

                      75.   It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any opinion on
                      the merits of the case and all kinds of contentions of the parties are left
                      open for consideration by the competent Court or Forum.

                      76.    Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.

                      77.    Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.

                      78.    The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.
