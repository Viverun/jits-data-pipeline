            2021 wherein it recorded that in view of the statement made by the

            learned counsel for the Applicant (Respondent in the SLP) that they

            would not press for the execution of the Order dated 12 th March 2021

            till the next date, no interim orders were required to be passed in the

            matter.



            s)     On these facts, Mr.Rohan Savant, the learned counsel appearing

            on behalf of the Applicant, submitted that there is a valid arbitration

            agreement between the parties as contained in Clause (k) of the

            the present Application ought to be allowed and an Arbitrator be

            appointed in order to arbitrate upon all the disputes and differences

3.          The Respondents have filed an Affidavit in Reply dated 11 th September

2023 opposing the present Application. On the basis of this Affidavit in

Reply, Mr.Pankaj Sawant, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of

the Respondents, submitted that the disputes sought to be referred to

Arbitration by the present application are non-arbitrable as the same are

barred by the provisions of the 
SARFAESI Act
 and the Recovery of Debts due

to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 ("RDDB Act"). In this context,

Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that the present Application was expressly

barred under 
Section 34
 of the SARFAESI Act.                     He submitted that the

Applicant had already initiated proceedings under the 
SARFAESI Act
, which

provides a statutory remedy for secured creditors.                    Upon invoking the

remedies under the special statute, the Applicant cannot now resort to

private adjudication by making an artificial bifurcation of the loan amounts

to suit its convenience. Further, Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that, as per


Section 13(10)
 of the SARFAESI Act, a secured creditor must exhaust the

statutory remedies available under the 
SARFAESI Act
, and a secured creditor

can only initiate civil proceedings for any margin left recoverable after

exhausting the remedies under the 
SARFAESI Act
. Therefore, it was not

open for the Applicant to elect the remedies in any manner whatsoever.

4.          Mr.Pankaj Sawant also submitted that the present Application is

barred by RDDB Act.                     He submitted that 
Section 18
 of the Act confers

exclusive jurisdiction on the DRT for disputes involving debt recovery by the

financial institutions.             He submitted that the Applicant is a part of a

consortium and qualifies as a financial institution under the RDDB Act. As a

consortium member and a financial institution, the Applicant could have

filed an Application in the DRT under Sections 17 to 19 of the RDDB Act. 
In

support of his submissions, Mr.Pankaj Sawant relied upon the judgement of

the Division Bench of this Court in 
Naresh J. Doshi and Others vs. Reserve

Bank of India and Others1
.




5.          Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the cause of action in the

Summary Suit filed by the Applicant and in the present Application is the

same, and, by filing the Summary Suit, the Applicant had waived its right to

arbitration and the same is barred.



6.          In this context, Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that there is one loan

agreement, namely the Working Capital Demand Loan Agreement dated 29 th

November 2018, one loan account and only one demand notice was issued by

the Applicant. He submitted that the Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019

refers to the WCDL Agreement dated 29th November 2018 which is also the

subject matter of the Summary Suit and states that all securities provided

under the loan agreements would stand as security for the repayment of One

Time Temporary Limit Facility. Further, the Demand Notice is a composite

demand          issued      for     both    facilities   wherein   a     single     amount         of

Rs.37,61,45,284/- is claimed and One-Time Temporary Limit Facility is also

mentioned. He submitted that no bifurcation of the claim is made in the

Demand Notice, demonstrating that the claims are identical and inseparable.



7.          Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the conjoint reading of the

averments in the Summary Suit and the Application filed by the Applicant

under 
Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908, demonstrates

that it is the Applicant's express case that the cause of action for the

Summary Suit and the present Arbitration Application is the same.



8.          By initiating that Suit based on the same cause of action, the

Applicant has waived its right to arbitration. In this context, Mr.Pankaj

Sawant relied upon the judgement of this Court in Onyx Musicabsolute com

Pvt.Ltd. & 
Ors. vs. Yash Raj Films Pvt. Ltd. And Ors2
.

constitutes impermissible forum shopping and would lead to multiplicity of

proceedings, resulting in conflicting judgements from different forums on

the same set of facts, which is against public policy and judicial propriety. He

submitted that the Applicant, being part of the Consortium, cannot be

permitted to bypass statutory remedies while others are following them as

this creates an uneven playing field.



10.         In response to these submissions, Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that

none of the issues raised by the Respondents can be gone into by the Court

under 
Section 11
 of the Act as the scope of enquiry in an Application under


Section 11
 of the Act is expressly limited and narrow. He submitted that, in

an Application under 
Section 11
, the Court only deals with the examination of

the existence of the Arbitration Agreement. This examination is also done

only on prima facie basis. No other contentions or issues are considered by

the Court at this stage. He submitted that even the issue concerning the

validity of the arbitration agreement beyond formal validity, such as the

agreement being in writing, cannot be dealt with by the Court while

considering the Application under 
Section 11
 of the Act.

12.         Without prejudice to this submission, as regards the contention of the

Respondents with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute on account of

the fact that the Applicant had been notified as a financial institution under


Section 2(1) (m)(iv)
 of the SARFAESI Act, Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that,

merely because the Applicant had been notified as a financial institution

under the 
SARFAESI Act
, would not result in the claim being made by the

Applicant becoming non-arbitrable. This was in view of the provisions of the


SARFAESI Act
, and more particularly

 thereof.                                He

submitted that 
Section 37
 of the SARFAESI Act, in no uncertain terms,

provides that it is in addition to, and not in derogation of, other laws for the

by a financial institution even when the financial institution institutes or is

entitled institute proceedings under the 
SARFAESI Act
.



13.         Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that the issue of arbitrability and

simultaneous institution of proceedings under the Act and proceedings under

the 
SARFAESI Act
 by financial institutions have been dealt with by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of 
M.D.Frozen Foods Exports Pvt. Ltd.&

15.         Mr.Rohan Savant further submitted that the Respondents have also

sought to make reference to Transferred Original Application No.210 of

2023 filed under the provisions of the RDDB Act before the DRT, Mumbai

against the Respondents to contend that, in light of the said Application,

Arbitration Proceedings were not maintainable. Mr. Rohan Savant submitted

that this contention again is erroneous. The said Original Application has

been filed by Union Bank of India, Cosmos Co-operative Bank Limited, Axis

Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India. The claim raised in the Original

Application is in respect of the claim made by the said Banks.                          This is

apparent from the particulars of claim at Annexure U of the Original

Application. He further submitted that the Original Application specifically

mentioned that the Applicant was only a proforma party. He submitted that

the claims of the Applicant were not a part of the Original Application filed

before the DRT, Mumbai.



16.         Further, Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that it is undisputed that the

Applicant cannot take action under the RDDB Act.                      This is because the

Applicant, as a Non Banking Financial Institution, is not notified under the

RDDB Act. The notification under the 
SARFAESI Act
 does not entitle the

Applicant to file proceedings before the DRT under the RDDB Act.

17.          Mr Rohan Savant further submitted that the next contention raised

by the Respondents was that the Applicant had relinquished / waived the

Arbitration Clause contained in the Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019.



Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that it is settled law that issues of waiver and

acquiescence are issues on facts and such issues cannot be raised in an

Application under 
Section 11
 of the Act. Further, he submitted that the prior

filing of the Commercial Summary Suit would not, in any manner, entitle a

waiver or relinquishment                   of the Arbitration Clause in the present

Application. He submitted that this was because firstly, on facts, the claim

made in the said Commercial Summary Suit is distinct and separate from the

claim raised in the 
Section 11
 Application. He further submitted that, even in

law, merely because a party has filed a prior suit, would not disentitle such a

party from filing subsequent arbitration proceedings. In view of 
Section 8
 of

the Act, the Defendants in the Commercial Summary Suit are at liberty to file

an Application for reference of the dispute to Arbitration.                      Equally, the

Plaintiff was entitled to withdraw a Suit prior to the Defendants filing their

first statement on the substance of the dispute. 
In support of this submission,

Mr. Rohan Savant relied upon the judgement of this Court in 
Priya Rishi

Bhuta and Another vs. Vardhaman Engineers and Builders and Others
 10 .

18.          Mr. Rohan Savant further submitted that, even on facts, the case of

waiver         set up by the Respondents was completely misconceived and

erroneous. The claim made in the Commercial Summary Suit No.87 of 2022

against the Respondents pertained to a separate facility, i.e. the Working

Capital Demand Loan Facility for a sum of Rs.30 crores. The said Suit does

not include the claim which would be made by the Applicant in the

Arbitration proceedings before the Arbitrator, which solely relates to the

Sanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. He submitted that this is apparent

from a bare perusal of the Plaint. He further submitted that the contents of

the Plaint in the said Suit make it apparent that the claim made in the said

Suit is distinct and separate from the claim made in the present Arbitration

Application.



19.         In response to the submissions of Mr.Rohan Savant, Mr.Pankaj

Sawant, on behalf of the Respondents, submitted that this Court had the

jurisdiction to decide on the objection of non-arbitrability of claims at the

stage of hearing of the 
Section 11
 Application. 
In support of his submissions,

he relied upon the judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Vidya Drolia

M.Hemalata Devi and Others vs. B. Udayasri

General Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) was misplaced as the said judgments were

based on different facts.



20.         Mr. Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the Applicant's reliance on

the judgment of 
Tata Motors Finance Solutions Ltd.
 (Supra) was misplaced

as the said judgement was a judgement of a Single Judge of this Court and

did not take into consideration the judgement of the Division Bench of this

Court in 
Naresh J. Doshi and Others
 (Supra)12. He further submitted that,

even otherwise,the judgement was distinguishable as, in the facts of that case,

there was no pending suit or consortium, as in the present case, and it was

not clear whether SARFAESI action was adopted.
 
Further, Mr.Pankaj Sawant

also submitted that, similarly, the reliance by the Applicant on 
Indiabulls

Housing Finance Ltd.
 (Supra) was misplaced as the issue 
in that case
 was

entirely different and
, 
in that case
, the action under the 
SARFAESI Act
 was

challenged because of arbitration proceedings. He submitted that a

distinction must be drawn between cases where arbitration proceedings were

initiated first, followed by actions under the 
SARFAESI Act
 by the banks, and

cases where SARFAESI proceedings were initiated prior to arbitration. He

submitted that, whilst there was no bar under the 
Arbitration Act
 against the

application of the 
SARFAESI Act
 or any other statute, 
Section 34
 of the

SARFAESI Act expressly barred the initiation of other proceedings, including
12 (2021) SCC OnLine BOM 11655

those before any Court or Tribunal in respect of matters which DRT is

empowered to determine under the Act. Therefore, once proceedings under

the 
SARFAESI Act
 had been initiated, the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts and

Arbitral Tribunal is ousted and the dispute must be adjudicated exclusively

by the forum designated under the 
SARFAESI Act
.
 
Mr.Pankaj Sawant

further submitted that, whilst the Applicant relied on the judgement in the

case of 
M.D.Frozen Food Exports Pvt. Ltd. & Ors.
 (Supra) to argue that

SARFAESI proceedings can continue alongside arbitration, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, in 
Vidya Drolia and Others
 (Supra), clarified that 
M. D.

Frozen Food Exports Pvt. Ltd.
 (Supra) does not apply to the issue of non-




arbitrability under the 
SARFAESI Act
. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that

statutory remedies under SARFAESI are non-arbitrable and that continuing

arbitration alongside SARFAESI proceedings would undermine the specific

rights conferred under the 
SARFAESI Act
.



21.         Further, as far as the judgement in 
Priya Rishi Bhuta and Another


(Supra) relied upon by the Applicant was concerned, Mr. Pankaj Sawant

submitted that
, 
in that case
, the cause of action in the civil proceedings and

the arbitral proceedings were different, whilst, in the present case, the cause

of action and relief sought were inseparable and the same.

22.         I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and perused the

documents on record.



23.         The issue that needs consideration first is whether this Court, in an

Application under 
Section 11
 of the Act, can go into the objections raised by

the Respondents.



24.         To consider this issue, 
Section 11(6A)
 of the Act is relevant and reads

as under:



               "(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while
               considering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-

               section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court,
               confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement."



25.          It is pertinent to note that sub-
section 6(A)
 of 
Section 11
 was omitted

by 
Section 3(v)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019.



However, the same has not been notified, and, therefore, subsection 6(A) of


Section 11
 continues to remain in force.



26.         Further, to consider this issue, the judgements relied upon by the

parties, in the context of this issue, would have to be considered.                           The

judgments relied upon by the parties and the relevant paragraphs are set out

here under:



a)         Paragraph No.154 of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in


Vidya Drolia and Others
 (Supra) is relevant and is set out here under:




               "154. Discussion under the heading "Who Decides Arbitrability?" can be
               crystallised as under:



               154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. Ltd. on the scope of judicial review by
               the court while deciding an application under 
Sections 8
 or 11 of the 
Arbitration
               Act
, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with retrospective effect from 23-
               10-2015) and even post the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from
               9-8-2019), is no longer applicable.



               154.2. Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the court under 
Sections 8

               and 
11
 of the Arbitration Act is identical but extremely limited and restricted.



               154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the legislative mandate clear
               from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of 2019, and the principle of severability and
               competence-competence, is that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first
               authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. The court
               has been conferred power of "second look" on aspects of non-arbitrability post
               the award in terms of sub-clauses ( i), (ii) or (iv) of 
Section 34(2)(a)
 or sub-
               clause (i) of 
Section 34(2)(b)
 of the Arbitration Act.



               154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at 
Section 8
 or 11 stage
               when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration agreement is non-
               existent, invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature and facet
               of non-arbitrability would, to some extent, determine the level and nature of
               judicial scrutiny. The restricted and limited review is to check and protect
               parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably "non-
               arbitrable" and to cut off the deadwood. The court by default would refer the
               matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly arguable;
               when consideration in summary proceedings would be insufficient and
               inconclusive; when facts are contested; when the party opposing arbitration
               adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings. This is
               not the stage for the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as to
               usurp the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity
               and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism."

b)          Paragraph Nos.92 and 93 of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in 
Indian Oil Corporation Limited vs. NCC Limited
 13 are relevant and

are set out here under:




               "92. However, at the same time, we do not agree with the conclusion arrived at
               by the High Court that after the insertion of sub-section (6-A) in 
Section 11
 of
               the Arbitration Act, scope of inquiry by the Court in 
Section 11
 petition is
               confined only to ascertain as to whether or not a binding arbitration agreement
               exists qua the parties before it, which is relatable to the disputes at hand.



               93. We are of the opinion that though the Arbitral Tribunal may have
               jurisdiction and authority to decide the disputes including the question of
               jurisdiction and non-arbitrability, the same can also be considered by the Court
               at the stage of deciding 
Section 11
 application if the facts are very clear and
               glaring and in view of the specific clauses in the agreement binding between the
               parties, whether the dispute is non-arbitrable and/or it falls within the excepted
               clause. Even at the stage of deciding 
Section 11
 application, the Court may
               prima facie consider even the aspect with regard to "accord and satisfaction" of
               the claims."



c)         Paragraph Nos.15 to 17 and 44 to 51 of the judgement of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in

 (Supra) are relevant and are

set out here under:




               "15. Now before this Court, there is a long line of decisions, including the
               decision which had come up post amendment to sub-section (1) of 
Section 8

               and post insertion of sub-section (6-A) to 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act,
               1996, where it has been held that in spite of sub-section (1) to 
Section 8
 the

               agreement but whether the dispute is arbitrable or not.



 
16. All disputes are not capable of being referred to arbitration [ "Not all matters
               are capable of being referred to arbitration. As a matter of English law certain
               matters are reserved for the court alone and if a tribunal purports to deal with
               them the resulting award will be unenforceable. These include matters where

               to give." [Russel on Arbitration (22nd Edn.)]] . The nature of certain disputes
               may be such that they should never be sent near an arbitration table. To give an
               illustration, there would be certain types of criminal matters, matters involving
               public corruption, etc. This aspect has been well considered by this Court in
               
Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd.
 and it has been held as
               under : (SCC pp. 546-47, paras 35-36)


                   "35. The Arbitral Tribunals are private fora chosen voluntarily by the parties
                   to the dispute, to adjudicate their disputes in place of courts and tribunals
                   which are public fora constituted under the laws of the country. Every civil or
                   commercial dispute, either contractual or non-contractual, which can be
                   decided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved
                   by arbitration unless the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunals is excluded
                   either expressly or by necessary implication. Adjudication of certain
                   categories of proceedings are reserved by the legislature exclusively for
                   public fora as a matter of public policy. Certain other categories of cases,
                   though not expressly reserved for adjudication by public fora (courts and
                   tribunals), may by necessary implication stand excluded from the purview of
                   private fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is inarbitrable, the court
                   where a suit is pending, will refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, under
                   
Section 8
 of the Act, even if the parties might have agreed upon arbitration
                   as the forum for settlement of such disputes.


                   36. The well-recognised examples of non-arbitrable disputes are : ( i)
                   disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of
                   criminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial
                   separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody; ( iii) guardianship
                   matters; (iv) insolvency and winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters
                   (grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate); and

                   (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the
                   tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified
                   courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes."

               17. The exclusion of a dispute from arbitration may be express or implied,
               depending again upon the nature of the dispute, and a party to a dispute cannot
               be compelled to resort to arbitration merely for the reason that it has been
               provided in the contract, to which it is a signatory. The arbitrability of a dispute
               has to be examined when one of the parties seeks redressal under a welfare
               legislation, in spite of being a signatory to an arbitration agreement. "
The
               Consumer Protection Act
" is definitely a piece of welfare legislation with the
               primary purpose of protecting the interest of a consumer. Consumer disputes
               are assigned by the legislature to public fora, as a measure of public policy.
               Therefore, by necessary implication such disputes will fall in the category of
               non-arbitrable disputes, and these disputes should be kept away from a private
               fora such as "arbitration", unless both the parties willingly opt for arbitration
               over the remedy before public fora.

               44. What were then the factors which necessitated an amendment, inter alia, in
               
Sections 8
 and 
11
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and what was the purpose behind
               these amendments? This aspect again has been examined in detail in Emaar-3.
               Such amendments were recommended by the Law Commission in its 246th
               Report, para 33 of the 246th Report of the Law Commission stated as under:



                   "33. It is in this context, the Commission has recommended amendments to
                   
Sections 8
 and 
11
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The scope of
                   the judicial intervention is only restricted to situations where the
                   court/judicial authority finds that the arbitration agreement does not exist or
                   is null and void. Insofar as the nature of intervention is concerned, it is
                   recommended that in the event the court/judicial authority is prima facie
                   satisfied against the argument challenging the arbitration agreement, it shall
                   appoint the arbitrator and/or refer the parties to arbitration, as the case may
                   be. The amendment envisages that the judicial authority shall not refer the
                   parties to arbitration only if it finds that there does not exist an arbitration
                   agreement or that it is null and void. If the judicial authority is of the opinion
                   that prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, then it shall refer the
                   dispute to arbitration, and leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to
                   be finally determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. However, if the judicial
                   authority concludes that the agreement does not exist, then the conclusion
                   will be final and not prima facie."



               45. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and Conciliation
               (Amendment) Bill, 2015 reads as under:



               "2. 
The Act
 was enacted to provide for speedy disposal of cases relating to
               arbitration with least court intervention. With the passage of time, some
               difficulties in the applicability of the Act have been noticed. Interpretation of
               the provisions of the Act by courts in some cases have resulted in delay of
               disposal of arbitration proceedings and increase in interference of courts in
               arbitration matters, which tend to defeat the object of the Act.



                           *               *             *

                   6. (iv) to provide that while considering any application for appointment of
                   arbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme Court shall examine the existence
                   of a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues;"

                   Notes on the Clauses on amendment in 
Section 8
 read as follows:

                   "Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend

                                                                        carap168-23.doc


                   that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists. A proviso below sub-
                   section (2) is inserted to provide that where the original arbitration
                   agreement or certified copy thereof is not available with the party who apply
                   under sub-section (1), and is retained by the other party, such party shall file
                   a copy of the arbitration agreement along with application under sub-section
                   (1) praying to the court to call upon the other party to produce the original
                   arbitration agreement or its duly certified copy before the court."

                   On amendment to 
Section 11
 by inserting sub-section (6-A), the following
                   was stated:

                   "Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend 
Section 11
 of the principal Act to provide
                   that appointment of arbitrator shall be made by the Supreme Court or the
                   High Court, as the case may be, instead of the Chief Justice of India or the
                   Chief Justice of the High Court. Sub-section (6-A) is inserted to provide that
                   the Supreme Court or the High Court while considering application under
                   sub-sections (4) to (6) shall confine to the examination of an arbitration
                   agreement."



               46. The amendment which was made in 
Section 8
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996
               came up for consideration before this Court in Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh
               Enterprises [Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises, where in paras 28
               and 30, it was stated as under : (SCC pp. 697-98)
                   "28. 'Principally four amendments to 
Section 8(1)
 have been introduced by
                   the 2015 Amendments -- ( i) the relevant "party" that is entitled to apply
                   seeking reference to arbitration has been clarified/amplified to include
                   persons claiming "through or under" such a party to the arbitration
                   agreement; (ii) scope of examination by the judicial authority is restricted to
                   a finding whether "no valid arbitration agreement exists" and the nature of
                   examination by the judicial authority is clarified to be on a "prima facie"

                   basis; (iii) the cut-off date by which an application under 
Section 8
 is to be
                   presented has been defined to mean "the date of" submitting the first
                   statement on the substance of the dispute; and ( iv) the amendments are
                   expressed to apply notwithstanding any prior judicial precedent. The proviso
                   to 
Section 8(2)
 has been added to allow a party that does not possess the
                   original or certified copy of the arbitration agreement on account of it being
                   retained by the other party, to nevertheless apply under 
Section 8

                   reference, and call upon the other party to produce the same.' [Ref. : Justice

Sections 1
 to

30. The language of amendment to 
Section 8
 of the Act is clear that the
                   amendment to 
Section 8(1)
 of the Act would apply notwithstanding any
                   prayer, judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any other court.
                   The High Court laid emphasis upon the word '... unless it finds that prima
                   facie no valid agreement exists'. The High Court observed that there is no
                   arbitration agreement between Astonfield and Rishabh. After referring to

47. This Court ultimately held that the main purpose of bringing an amendment
               inter alia in 
Sections 8
 and 
11
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was to minimise the
               scope of judicial authority, which was to refuse reference to arbitration only on
               the ground when it prima facie finds that there was no valid arbitration
               agreement. The legislative intent for the amendment was confined to limiting
               judicial intervention, and once the Court finds that there is a valid arbitration
               agreement, it has no option but to refer the matter for arbitration. But this
               would not mean that where the matter itself is non-arbitrable, or is covered by a
               special legislation such as the 
Consumer Protection Act
, it still has to be
               referred for arbitration. In para 59 of Emaar-3, it was stated as under : (SCC pp.
               781-82)


                   "59. The amendment in 
Section 8
 cannot be given such expansive meaning
                   and intent so as to inundate entire regime of special legislations where such
                   disputes were held to be not arbitrable. Something which legislation never
                   intended cannot be accepted as side wind to override the settled law. The
                   submission of the petitioner that after the amendment the law as 
laid down
                   by
 this Court in 
National Seeds Corpn. [National Seeds Corpn. Ltd. v. M.
                   Madhusudhan Reddy
, (2012) 2 SCC 506 : (2012) 1 SCC (Civ) 908] is no more
                   a good law cannot be accepted. The words 'notwithstanding any judgment,
                   decree or order of the Supreme Court or any court' were meant only to those
                   precedents where it was laid down that the judicial authority while making
                   reference under 
Section 8
 shall be entitled to look into various facets of the
                   arbitration agreement, subject-matter of the arbitration whether the claim is
                   alive or dead, whether the arbitration agreement is null and void. The words
                   added in 
Section 8
 cannot be meant for any other meaning."




                   Emaar-3 though ends with a caveat, where it leaves the option with the party
                   who may have an option to choose between a public or private forum, may
                   consciously choose to go for private fora. This is what it says : (SCC p. 783,
                   para 63)

                                                                      carap168-23.doc


                   "63. We may, however, hasten to add that in the event a person entitled to
                   seek an additional special remedy provided under the statutes does not opt
                   for the additional/special remedy and he is a party to an arbitration
                   agreement, there is no inhibition in disputes being proceeded in arbitration.
                   It is only the case where specific/special remedies are provided for and which
                   are opted by an aggrieved person that judicial authority can refuse to
                   relegate the parties to the arbitration."

               48. Thus, in our considered opinion in the case at hand, the Telangana High
               Court had adopted the right approach in its two impugned orders, where it
               declined to interfere in the matter and appoint an arbitrator.



               49. True in Emaar-3 this Court had examined the scope of sub-section (1) to
               
Section 8
 and not of sub-section (6-A) to 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.
               All the same, the reasoning given in the above judgment would be equally
               applicable to 
Section 11
 application before the High Court. Both the provisions
               incorporated in 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 [i.e. sub-
               section (1) and sub-section (6-A) respectively], seemingly restrict the scope of
               the examination by the courts concerned, in their reference to arbitration, or
               appointment of arbitrator, as the case might be, and the language being
               common, "notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order" places a similar
               question before the two courts.



               50. More importantly, when the Principal Civil Court or a judicial authority
               such as consumer redressal forum can have powers to dismiss a 
Section 8

               application on the ground of arbitrability of a dispute, will such powers not be
               available with the High Courts? In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., it was decided
               by this Court that both 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 are
               complementary provisions. 
This position has been reiterated, in the post-
               amendment context, in 
Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. [Vidya Drolia
 v.
               Durga Trading Corpn.




               51. The application under 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for
               appointment of an arbitrator, was not maintainable in the present case, and
               consequently we uphold the impugned orders dated 19-5-2022 and 25-11-2022,
               which held this position. We refrain from saying anything further on the matter
               as the dispute is still sub judice before the State Consumer Forum (appellate
               authority). The appeals are hereby dismissed. No order as to costs."

               "24. Following the general rule and the principle 
laid down in
 Vidya Drolia, this
               Court has consistently been holding that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred
               first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability.
 
In
               
Pravin Electricals (P) Ltd. v. Galaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd.
 , Sanjiv Prakash v.


 
Seema Kukreja, and Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd.
, the parties were
               referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in each of these cases on the
               objection of non-arbitrability was found to be inconclusive.
 Following the
               exception to the general principle that the Court may not refer parties to
               arbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-
               arbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. (hereinafter "Nortel
               Networks") and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah &
               Sons, arbitration was refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably
               time-barred.



               Eye of the needle

               25. The abovereferred precedents crystallise the position of law that the pre-
               referral jurisdiction of the Courts under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Act is very narrow
               and inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the
               validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry as to the
               parties to the agreement and the applicant's privity to the said agreement.
               These are matters which require a thorough examination by the Referral Court.
               The secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect
               to the non-arbitrability of the dispute.



               26. As a general rule and a principle, the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first
               authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. As an
               exception to the rule, and rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject
               claims which are manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable. Explaining this
               position, flowing from the principles laid down in Vidya Drolia, this Court in a
               subsequent decision in Nortel Networks held : (Nortel Networks case, SCC p.
               764, para 45)

                   "45. ... 45.1. ... While exercising jurisdiction under 
Section 11
 as the judicial
                   forum, the Court may exercise the prima facie test to screen and knockdown
                   ex facie meritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of
                   the Courts would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the referral
                   stage. At the referral stage, the Court can interfere "only" when it is
                   "manifest" that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no
                   subsisting dispute."



               27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of a claim is only
               prima facie. Referral Courts must not undertake a full review of the contested
               facts; they must only be confined to a primary first review and let facts speak for
               themselves. This also requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion on
               arbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead
               to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is
               non-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if there is the slightest doubt, the rule is
               to refer the dispute to arbitration.

28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is necessary and
               compelling. It is intertwined with the duty of the Referral Court to protect the
               parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-
               arbitrable. It has been termed as a legitimate interference by Courts to refuse
               reference in order to prevent wastage of public and private resources . Further,
               as noted in Vidya Drolia, if this duty within the limited compass is not
               exercised, and the Court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine
               the effectiveness of both, arbitration and the Court. Therefore, this Court or a
               High Court, as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under 
Section 11(6)

               of the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to deliver a purported
               dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator , as explained
               in 
DLF Home Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd
."




e)         Paragraph Nos.150 to 169, 219, 220 and 222 of the judgement of the 7

            Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra) are

            relevant and are set out hereunder:



               "150. 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act deals with the appointment of arbitrators.
               It recognises the autonomy of the parties to agree upon a procedure for
               appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators. 
Section 11
 requires the intervention
               of the Court only when there is a deadlock or failure of the parties to follow the
               appointment procedure. In the process, 
Section 11
 is meant to give effect to the
               mutual intention of the parties to settle their disputes by arbitration in
               situations where the parties fail to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators. In an
               arbitration with three arbitrators, each party is required to appoint one
               arbitrator each, and subsequently the two arbitrators will appoint the third
               arbitrator. 
Section 11(6)
 confers powers on the Supreme Court and the High
               Court, as the case may be, on the failure of the parties to comply with the agreed
               arbitration procedure. 
Section 11(6)
 enlists three possible defects in the
               appointment procedure, namely : first, a party fails to act as required by the
               agreed procedure; second, the parties or the two appointed arbitrators fail to
               reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or third, a person,
               including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to them or
               under the agreed procedure.



               151. 
Section 11(6)
 has had a long and chequered history before this Court,
               particularly in respect of the nature of function of the Chief Justice or his
               designate in the appointment of an arbitrator. In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,
               a seven-Judge Bench of this Court held that the power exercised by the Chief
               Justice of India or a Chief Justice of the High Court under 
Section 11(6)
 is a
               judicial power. In the process, this Court analysed the scope of the powers and
               authority of the Referral Court under 
Section 11(6)
. Moreover, this Court noted
               that 
Sections 8
 and 
11
 are complementary in nature. Consequently, if the

               judicial authority acting under 
Section 8
 has to mandatorily decide the issue of
               jurisdiction before referring the parties to arbitration, the same standard of
               scrutiny was also held to be applicable to the reference under 
Section 11
. In
               conclusion, it was held that the Chief Justice or their designate at the referral
               stage under 
Section 11(6)
 had the right to determine all preliminary issues :

               (SCC pp. 663-664, para 74)
                   "47. ... (iv) The Chief Justice or the designated Judge will have the right to
                   decide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this
                   judgment. These will be his own jurisdiction to entertain the request, the
                   existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live
                   claim, the existence of the condition for the exercise of his power and on the
                   qualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief Justice or the
                   designated Judge would be entitled to seek the opinion of an institution in
                   the matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of 
Section 11(8)
 of
                   the Act if the need arises but the order appointing the arbitrator could only
                   be that of the Chief Justice or the designated Judge."



 
152. The extent of judicial interference at the referral stage was scrutinised by a
               Bench of two Judges of this Court in 
National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara
               Polyfab (P) Ltd. This
 Court held that when the intervention of the Court is
               sought under 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act, the following categories of issues
               will arise before the Referral Court:




               152.1. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to decide.

               These issues were : first, whether the party making the application has
               approached the appropriate High Court; and second, whether there is a valid
               arbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under 
Section 11

               of the Act, is a party to such an agreement;



               152.2. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate may choose to decide
               or leave them to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first,
               whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live claim; and second,
               whether the parties have concluded the contract/transaction by recording the
               satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final
               payment without objection; and

               152.3. The issues which the Chief Justice or their designate should leave
               exclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first, whether a claim
               made falls within the arbitration clause (as for example, a matter which is
               reserved for final decision of a departmental authority and excepted or excluded
               from arbitration); and second, merits or any claim involved in the arbitration.



               153. The decisions of this Court in Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab allowed for
               greater judicial interference at the pre-arbitral stage. In effect, the Referral
               Courts were encouraged to conduct mini trials instead of summarily dealing
               with the preliminary issues. This was also noted by the Law Commission of
               India, which observed that judicial intervention in the arbitral proceedings is a
               pervasive problem in India leading to significant delays in the arbitration
               process. The Law Commission recognised that one of the problems plaguing

                                                                       carap168-23.doc


               implementation of the 
Arbitration Act
 was that 
Section 11
 applications were
               kept pending for years by the Courts. To remedy the situation, the Law
               Commission proposed changing the then existing scheme of the power of
               appointment being vested in the "Chief Justice" to the "High Court" and the
               "Supreme Court". It also clarified that the power of appointment of arbitrators
               ought not to be regarded as a judicial act.



               154. Significantly, the Law Commission observed that there was a need to
               reduce judicial intervention at the pre-arbitral stage, that is, prior to the
               constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Accordingly, it proposed limiting the
               scope of the judicial intervention at the referral stage under 
Sections 8
 and 
11
 of
               the Arbitration Act "to situations where the Court/Judicial Authority finds that
               the arbitration agreement does not exist or is null and void". The Law
               Commission suggested insertion of sub-section (6-A) under 
Section 11
 which
               would read:"Any appointment by the High Court or the person or institution
               designated by it under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) shall
               not be made only if the High Court finds that the arbitration does not exist or is
               null and void." In light of the recommendations of the Law Commission,
               Parliament passed the 
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015

               ("the 2015 Amendment Act") to incorporate 
Section 11
(6-A).



               155. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act states
               that sub-section (6-A) is inserted in 
Section 11
 to provide that the Supreme
               Court or the High Court while considering application under sub-sections (4) to
               (6) "shall confine to the examination of an arbitration agreement". With the
               coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, the nature of preliminary
               examination at the referral stage under 
Section 11
 was confined to the existence
               of an arbitration agreement. It also incorporates a non obstante clause which
               covers "any judgment, decree or order of any court". By virtue of the non
               obstante clause, 
Section 11
(6-A) has set out a new position of law, which takes
               away the basis of the position 
laid down by
 the previous decisions of this Court
               in Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab. It is also important to note that Parliament
               did not incorporate the expression "or is null and void" as was suggested by the
               Law Commission. This indicates that Parliament intended to confine the
               jurisdiction of the Courts at the pre-arbitral stage to as minimum a level as
               possible.



               156. The effect and impact of the 2015 Amendment Act was subsequently
               clarified by this Court. 
In 
Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. Kurien
               Joseph, J.
 noted that the intention of the legislature in incorporating 
Section
               11
(6-A) was to limit the scope of the Referral Court's jurisdiction to only one
               aspect -- the existence of an arbitration agreement. To determine the existence
               of an arbitration agreement, the Court only needs to examine whether the
               underlying contract contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining
               to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. This
               
Court further held
 that 
Section 11
(6-A) incorporates the principle of minimal
               judicial intervention : (SCC p. 765, para 59)

                   Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab. This position continued
                   till the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all that the
                   Courts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists-nothing more,
                   nothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is essentially to minimise the
                   Court's intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator and this
                   intention as incorporated in 
Section 11
(6-A) ought to be respected."



               157. In 2017, the High-Level Committee to Review the Institutionalisation of
               Arbitration Mechanism in India submitted a report noting that while the 2015
               amendment facilitated the speedy disposal of 
Section 11
 applications, they failed
               to limit judicial interference in arbitral proceedings. Accordingly, the High-
               Level Committee recommended the amendment of 
Section 11
 to provide for
               appointment of arbitrators solely by arbitral institutions designated by the
               Supreme Court in case of international commercial arbitrations or the High
               Court in case of all other arbitrations. In view of the report of the High-Level
               Committee, Parliament enacted the 
Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)
               Act, 2019
 ("the 2019 Amendment Act") omitting 
Section 11
(6-A) so as to leave
               the appointment of arbitrators to arbitral institutions. 
Section 1(2)
 of the 2019
               Amendment Act provides that amended provisions shall come into force on
               such date as notified by the Central Government in the official gazette.
               However, 
Section 3
 of the 2019 Amendment Act which amended 
Section 11
 by
               omitting 
Section 11
(6-A) is yet to be notified. Till such time, 
Section 11
(6-A) will
               continue to operate.



               158. 
In 
Mayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman
 , a three-Judge
               Bench of this Court affirmed the reasoning in 
Duro Felguera [Duro Felguera,
               S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.
, (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] by
               observing that the examination under 
Section 11
(6-A) is "confined to the
               examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be
               understood in the narrow sense". Moreover, it held that the position of law
               prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, as set forth by the decisions of this Court in
               Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab, has been legislatively overruled. Thus, this
               Court gave effect to the intention of the legislature in minimising the role of the
               Courts at the pre-arbitral stage to the bare minimum.




               159. Thereafter, in Vidya Drolia , another three-Judge Bench of this Court,
               affirmed the ruling in Mayavati Trading that Patel Engg. has been legislatively
               overruled. In Vidya Drolia, one of the issues before this Court was whether the
               Court at the reference stage or the Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration
               proceedings would decide the question of non-arbitrability. This Court began its
               analysis by holding that an arbitration agreement has to satisfy the mandate of
               the 
Contract Act
, in addition to satisfying the requirements stipulated under
               
Section 7
 of the Arbitration Act to qualify as an agreement.



               160. In the course of the decision, one of the questions before this Court in
               Vidya Drolia was the interpretation of the word "existence" as appearing in
               
Section 11
. It was held that existence and validity are intertwined. Further, it
               was observed that an arbitration agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does
               not satisfy mandatory legal requirements. Therefore, this Court read the

                                                                      carap168-23.doc


               mandate of valid arbitration agreement contained in 
Section 8
 into the mandate
               of 
Section 11
, that is, "existence of an arbitration agreement".



               161. At the outset, Vidya Drolia noted that "
Section 11
 has undergone another
               amendment vide Act 33 of 2019 with effect from 9-8-2019." The purport of the
               omission of the said clause was further explained in the following terms : (SCC
               p. 115, para 145)
               "145. Omission of sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was with the specific
               object and purpose and is relatable to by substitution of sub-sections (12), (13)
               and (14) of 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide sub-
               section (3-A) stipulates that the High Court and this Court shall have the power
               to designate the arbitral institutions which have been so graded by the Council
               under Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral institution is not available,
               the High Court concerned shall maintain a panel of arbitrators for discharging
               the function and thereupon the High Court shall perform the duty of an arbitral
               institution for reference to the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, it would be wrong
               to accept that post omission of sub-section (6-A) of 
Section 11
 the ratio in Patel
               Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] would become
               applicable."



               162.Vidya Drolia proceeds on the presumption that 
Section 11
(6-A) was
               effectively omitted from the statute books by the 2019 Amendment Act. This is
               also reflected in the conclusion arrived at by the Court, as is evident from the
               following extract : (SCC p. 121, para 154)

                   "154. ... 154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. on the scope of judicial
                   review by the Court while deciding an application under 
Sections 8
 or 11 of
                   the 
Arbitration Act
, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with
                   retrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post the amendments vide
                   Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 9-8-2019), is no longer applicable."

                                                       (emphasis supplied)



               163. We are of the opinion that the above premise of the Court in Vidya Drolia is
               erroneous because the omission of 
Section 11
(6-A) has not been notified and,
               therefore, the said provision continues to remain in full force. Since 
Section
               11
(6-A) continues to remain in force, pending the notification of the Central
               Government, it is incumbent upon this Court to give true effect to the legislative
               intent.



               164. The 2015 Amendment Act has laid down different parameters for judicial
               review under 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
. Where 
Section 8
 requires the Referral
               Court to look into the prima facie existence of a valid arbitration agreement,
               
Section 11
 confines the Court's jurisdiction to the examination of the existence
               of an arbitration agreement. Although the object and purpose behind both
               
Sections 8
 and 
11
 is to compel parties to abide by their contractual
               understanding, the scope of power of the Referral Courts under the said
               provisions is intended to be different. The same is also evident from the fact
               that 
Section 37
 of the Arbitration Act allows an appeal from the order of an

               Arbitral Tribunal refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under 
Section 8
, but
               not from 
Section 11
. Thus, the 2015 Amendment Act has legislatively overruled
               the dictum of Patel Engg. where it was held that 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
 are
               complementary in nature. Accordingly, the two provisions cannot be read as
               laying down a similar standard.



               165. The legislature confined the scope of reference under 
Section 11
(6-A) to the
               examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The use of the term
               "examination" in itself connotes that the scope of the power is limited to a
               prima facie determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code,
               the requirement of "existence" of an arbitration agreement draws effect from
               
Section 7
 of the Arbitration Act. In Duro Felguera, this Court held that the
               Referral Courts only need to consider one aspect to determine the existence of
               an arbitration agreement -- whether the underlying contract contains an
               arbitration agreement which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes
               which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of
               examination under 
Section 11
(6-A) should be confined to the existence of an
               arbitration agreement on the basis of 
Section 7
. Similarly, the validity of an
               arbitration agreement, in view of 
Section 7
, should be restricted to the
               requirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement be in
               writing. This interpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-
               competence by leaving the issue of substantive existence and validity of an
               arbitration agreement to be decided by Arbitral Tribunal under 
Section 16
. We
               accordingly clarify the position of law laid down in Vidya Drolia in the context
               of 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act.



               166. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement generally lies
               on the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In jurisdictions such as India,
               which accept the doctrine of competence-competence, only prima facie proof of
               the existence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral
               Court. The Referral Court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial
               by allowing the parties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or
               validity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of the existence and
               validity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of evidence ought to be left to
               the Arbitral Tribunal. This position of law can also be gauged from the plain
               language of the statute.



 
167. 
Section 11
(6-A) uses the expression "examination of the existence of an
               arbitration agreement". The purport of using the word "examination" connotes
               that the legislature intends that the Referral Court has to inspect or scrutinise
               the dealings between the parties for the existence of an arbitration agreement.
               Moreover, the expression "examination" does not connote or imply a laborious
               or contested inquiry. On the other hand, 
Section 16
 provides that the Arbitral
               Tribunal can "rule" on its jurisdiction, including the existence and validity of an
               arbitration agreement. A "ruling" connotes adjudication of disputes after
               admitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the Referral
               Court is only required to examine the existence of arbitration agreements,
               whereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction, including the
               issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A
               similar view was adopted by this Court in 
Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh

               168. 
In 
Shin-Etsu [Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd.
, (2005) 7
               SCC 234] , this Court was called upon to determine the nature of adjudication
               contemplated by unamended 
Section 45
 of the Arbitration Act when the
               objection with regards to the arbitration agreement being "null and void,
               inoperative or incapable of being performed" is raised before a judicial
               authority. Writing for the majority, B.N. Srikrishna, J. held that Section 45 does
               not require the judicial authority to give a final determination. The Court
               observed that : (SCC p. 267, para 74)

                   "74. There are distinct advantages in veering to the view that Section 45 does
                   not require a final determinative finding by the Court. First, under the Rules
                   of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (as in force with
                   effect from 1-1-1998), as in the present case, invariably the Arbitral Tribunal
                   is vested with the power to rule upon its own jurisdiction. Even if the Court
                   takes the view that the arbitral agreement is not vitiated or that it is not
                   invalid, inoperative or unenforceable, based upon purely a prima facie view,
                   nothing prevents the arbitrator from trying the issue fully and rendering a
                   final decision thereupon. If the arbitrator finds the agreement valid, there is
                   no problem as the arbitration will proceed and the award will be made.
                   However, if the arbitrator finds the agreement invalid, inoperative or void,
                   this means that the party who wanted to proceed for arbitration was given an
                   opportunity of proceeding to arbitration, and the arbitrator after fully trying
                   the issue has found that there is no scope for arbitration. Since the
                   arbitrator's finding would not be an enforceable award, there is no need to
                   take recourse to the judicial intercession available under Section 48(1)( a) of
                   the Act."




               169. When the Referral Court renders a prima facie opinion, neither the Arbitral
               Tribunal, nor the Court enforcing the arbitral award will be bound by such a
               prima facie view. If a prima facie view as to the existence of an arbitration
               agreement is taken by the Referral Court, it still allows the Arbitral Tribunal to
               examine the issue in depth. Such a legal approach will help the Referral Court in
               weeding out prima facie non-existent arbitration agreements. It will also protect
               the jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunals to decide on issues
               pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement.



               219. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act are as
               follows:



                   "6. (iii) an application for appointment of an arbitrator shall be disposed of
                   by the High Court or Supreme Court, as the case may be, as expeditiously as
                   possible and an endeavour should be made to dispose of the matter within a
                   period of sixty days.

                   (iv) to provide that while considering any application for appointment of
                   arbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme Court shall examine the existence

                                                                      carap168-23.doc


                   of a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues."



               220. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High Court at the
               stage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall "examine the existence of a
               prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues". These other issues not
               only pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also include any
               other issues which are a consequence of unnecessary judicial interference in the
               arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the "other issues" also include
               examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by the Referral
               Court at the 
Section 8
 or 
Section 11
 stage. The process of examination,
               impounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument under the 
Stamp Act

               is not a time-bound process, and therefore does not align with the stated goal of
               the 
Arbitration Act
 to ensure expeditious and time-bound appointment of
               arbitrators. Therefore, even though the Law Commission of India Report or the
               Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act do not
               specifically refer to SMS Tea Estates, it nevertheless does not make any
               difference to the position of law as has been set out above.



               222. The scope of authority of an Arbitral Tribunal under 
Section 16
 is wide
               because it can deal with issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an
               arbitration agreement. In his dissenting opinion in N.N. Global (2), Roy, J.
               correctly observes that since "[s]ection 16 specifically deals with both existence
               and validity whereas 
Section 11
 only deals with existence, the former should be
               given more weight." This observation comports with the stated goal of the
               
Arbitration Act
 to minimise the supervisory role of Courts in the arbitral
               process. Post the 2015 Amendment Act the Referral Courts are only required to
               prima facie determine the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement. The
               basis for such prima facie determination lies in the fact that the Arbitral
               Tribunal will later have the competence to rule on the issue of existence and
               validity of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the separability presumption
               applies at the referral stage.



f)         Paragraph Nos.110 to 114, 117, 118, 122 to 125 of the judgement of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI General Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) are

relevant and are set out hereunder:



               "110. The scope of examination under 
Section 11
(6-A) is confined to the
               existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of 
Section 7
. The examination
               of validity of the arbitration agreement is also limited to the requirement of
               formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement should be in writing.

                                                                       carap168-23.doc



               111. The use of the term 'examination' under 
Section 11
(6-A) as distinguished
               from the use of the term 'rule' under 
Section 16
 implies that the scope of
               enquiry under 
section 11
(6-A) is limited to a prima facie scrutiny of the
               existence of the arbitration agreement, and does not include a contested or
               laborious enquiry, which is left for the arbitral tribunal to 'rule' under Section

               16. The prima facie view on existence of the arbitration agreement taken by the
               referral court does not bind either the arbitral tribunal or the court enforcing
               the arbitral award.



               112. The aforesaid approach serves a two-fold purpose - firstly, it allows the
               referral court to weed out non-existent arbitration agreements, and secondly, it
               protects the jurisdictional competence of the arbitral tribunal to rule on the
               issue of existence of the arbitration agreement in depth.



               113. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and
               Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it was observed in In Re : Interplay
               (supra) that the High Court and the Supreme Court at the stage of appointment
               of arbitrator shall examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement
               and not any other issues. The relevant observations are extracted hereinbelow:



                   "209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High Court at
                   the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall "examine the existence of
                   a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues". These other issues
                   not only pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also include
                   any other issues which are a consequence of unnecessary judicial
                   interference in the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the "other issues"

                   also include examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by
                   the referral court at the 
Section 8
 or 
Section 11
 stage. The process of
                   examination, impounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument under
                   the 
Stamp Act
 is not a timebound process, and therefore does not align with
                   the stated goal of the 
Arbitration Act
 to ensure expeditious and time-bound
                   appointment of arbitrators. [...]"

                                                                        (Emphasis supplied)

               114. In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re : Interplay (supra),
               it is clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of arbitrator is
               limited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the arbitration agreement, and
               nothing else. 
For this reason, we find it difficult to hold that the observations
               made in 
Vidya Drolia
 (supra) and adopted in 
NTPC v. SPML
 (supra) that the
               jurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the issue of "accord and
               satisfaction" under 
Section 11
 extends to weeding out ex-facie non-arbitrable
               and frivolous disputes would continue to apply despite the subsequent decision
               in In Re : Interplay (supra).

                                                                       carap168-23.doc


               of the powers under 
Section 11
, the referral court upholds and gives effect to the
               original understanding of the contracting parties that the specified disputes
               shall be resolved by arbitration. Mere appointment of the arbitral tribunal
               doesn't in any way mean that the referral court is diluting the sanctity of
               "accord and satisfaction" or is allowing the claimant to walk back on its
               contractual undertaking. On the contrary, it ensures that the principal of
               arbitral autonomy is upheld and the legislative intent of minimum judicial
               interference in arbitral proceedings is given full effect. Once the arbitral
               tribunal is constituted, it is always open for the defendant to raise the issue of
               "accord and satisfaction" before it, and only after such an objection is rejected
               by the arbitral tribunal, that the claims raised by the claimant can be
               adjudicated.



               118. Tests like the "eye of the needle" and "ex-facie meritless", although try to
               minimise the extent of judicial interference, yet they require the referral court
               to examine contested facts and appreciate prima facie evidence (however
               limited the scope of enquiry may be) and thus are not in conformity with the
               principles of modern arbitration which place arbitral autonomy and judicial
               non-interference on the highest pedestal.

               122. Once an arbitration agreement exists between parties, then the option of
               approaching the civil court becomes unavailable to them. In such a scenario, if
               the parties seek to raise a dispute, they necessarily have to do so before the
               arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal, in turn, can only be constituted as per
               the procedure agreed upon between the parties. However, if there is a failure of
               the agreed upon procedure, then the duty of appointing the arbitral tribunal
               falls upon the referral court under 
Section 11
 of the Act, 1996. If the referral
               court, at this stage, goes beyond the scope of enquiry as provided under the
               section and examines the issue of "accord and satisfaction", then it would
               amount to usurpation of the power which the parties had intended to be
               exercisable by the arbitral tribunal alone and not by the national courts. Such a
               scenario would impeach arbitral autonomy and would not fit well with the
               scheme of the Act, 1996.



               123. The power available to the referral courts has to be construed in the light of
               the fact that no right to appeal is available against any order passed by the
               referral court under 
Section 11
 for either appointing or refusing to appoint an
               arbitrator. Thus, by delving into the domain of the arbitral tribunal at the
               nascent stage of 
Section 11
, the referral courts also run the risk of leaving the
               claimant in a situation wherein it does not have any forum to approach for the
               adjudication of its claims, if it 
Section 11
 application is rejected.

               124. 
Section 11
 also envisages a time-bound and expeditious disposal of the
               application for appointment of arbitrator. One of the reasons for this is also the
               fact that unlike 
Section 8
, once an application under 
Section 11
 is filed,
               arbitration cannot commence until the arbitral tribunal is constituted by the
               referral court. This Court, on various occasions, has given directions to the High
               Courts for expeditious disposal of pending 
Section 11
 applications. It has also

               directed the litigating parties to refrain from filing bulky pleadings in matters
               pertaining to 
Section 11
. Seen thus, if the referral courts go into the details of
               issues pertaining to "accord and satisfaction" and the like, then it would become
               rather difficult to achieve the objective of expediency and simplification of
               pleadings.



27.         A perusal of these judgements shows that, prior to the judgement of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), the scope of interference by

the Court in proceedings under 
Section 11
 of the Act was slightly wider.



However, the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra)

has narrowed down the scope. In Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has held that the scope of examination under 
section 11 (6A)
 should be

confined to the existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of 
Section 7


of the Act. Similarly, the validity of an arbitration agreement, in view of


Section 7
 of the Act, should be restricted to the requirement of formal validity

such as the requirement that the agreement be in writing.                           The Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that this interpretation gives true effect to the

doctrine of competence - competence by leaving the issue of substantive

existence and validity of an arbitration agreement to be decided by the

Arbitral Tribunal under 
Section 16
 of the Act. 
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Interplay (Supra) accordingly clarified the position of law laid down in 
Vidya

Drolia and Others
 (Supra) in the context of 
Section 8
 and 
Section 11
 of the

Act in the aforesaid terms.
                 Further, in Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble

Supreme Court held that, in jurisdictions such as India, which accept the

doctrine of competence -                  competence,      only prima facie proof of the

existence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral

Court.       The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Referral Court is not the

appropriate forum to conduct a mini trial by allowing the parties to adduce

evidence in regard to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement.



The determination of the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement

on the basis of evidence ought to be left to the Arbitral Tribunal.



28.          Further, in Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that


Section 11 (6A)
 uses the expression "examination of the existence of an

arbitration agreement".                 The purpose of using the word "examination"



connotes that the legislature intended that the Referral Court had to inspect

or scrutinize the dealings between the parties for the existence of an

arbitration agreement. Moreover, the expression "examination" does not

connote or imply a laborious or contested inquiry.                      On the other hand,


Section 16
 provided that the Arbitral Tribunal can 'rule' on its jurisdiction,

including the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement. The Hon'ble

Supreme Court further held that a 'ruling' connotes adjudication of disputes

after admitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the

Referral Court was only required to examine the existence of arbitration

agreements, whereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction,

including the issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration

29.         The aforesaid position in law laid down by Interplay (Supra) has been

confirmed by the subsequent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI

General Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) referred to hereinabove.



30.         In my view, in the light of the aforesaid position in law laid down by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), the objections raised by the

Respondents cannot be gone into by this Court in the present Application

under 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act.



31.          The objections of the Respondents, namely (i) that the disputes

raised by the Applicant are not non-arbitrable as they are barred by the

provisions of the SARFAESI Act and the RDDB Act, (ii) that the Applicant

had waived its right to arbitration by filing a Summary Suit in this Court and


(iii) that allowing of this Application would lead to multiplicity of

proceedings, are not objections regarding the existence of an arbitration

agreement, on the basis of 
Section 7
 of the Act nor are they objections

regarding the validity of the arbitration agreement. In view of 
Section 7
 of the

Act, objections as to validity should be restricted to the requirements of

Therefore on the basis of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Interplay (Supra), I hold that the objections raised by the Respondents

cannot be gone into by this Court in this Application under 
Section 11
 of the

Act.



32.          As laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), in

an Application under 
Section 11
 of the Act, this Court has only to prima facie

determine whether an Arbitration Agreement exists as required by the

provisions of 
Section 7
 of the Act.                In the present case, there exists an

Arbitration Agreement between the parties as contained in clause (k) of the

Sanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. The correspondence between the

parties shows that disputes and differences have arisen between the parties.



The Applicant has invoked the arbitration agreement contained in the said

Sanction Letter dated 19th August 2019 by its Advocate's letter dated 6 April

2021. In these circumstances, I hold that an arbitration agreement exists

between the parties and an Arbitrator would have to be appointed in order to

arbitrate upon all disputes and differences arising between the parties under

the said Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019. Needless to add, that the

Respondents will be at liberty to raise the objections raised by them to the

present Application before the Arbitrator.
