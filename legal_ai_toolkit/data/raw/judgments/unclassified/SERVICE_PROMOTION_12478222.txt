                            entitled to the status of Choudhary in the pay scale of

                      10.   The petitioner has challenged the impugned award on the following
                      grounds:

                            "...(ii) That the respondent workman has filed its Statement
                            of claim before the Ld. Tribunal claiming that the workman
                            was initially on the post of Mali in Central Zone and later on
                            he was regularized /promoted on the same post, so he cannot
                            be regularized/ promoted on the post of Garden Chaudhary
                            and the claim filed by the respondent is misconceived and
                            liable to be rejected on the sole ground. It is submitted that
                            respondent is presently posted at Shahdra South Zone.



                            (iii) That it is submitted that the workman was not allotted
                            the work of Chaudhary on 1.1.1991. It is submitted that the

                             authority. No copy of any office order has been placed by the
                            workman to show that he was working on the said post of
                            Garden Chaudhary.



                            (iv) That the workman has never performed the duties of
                            Garden Chaudhary and no such type of office order was
                            ever issued by the competent authority. Therefore, the
                            question of pay scale of Garden Chaudhary does not arise.

                            Therefore, the claim filed by the respondent-workman should
                            have been rejected by Ld. Labour Court.



                            (v) That the recruitment rules for the post of Mali and
                            Garden Chaudhry are totally deferent. Garden Chaudhary is
                            not promotional post of Mali and moreover, qualifying the
                            trade test is mandatory for the promotion to the post of
                            Garden Chaudhary, the claim of the workman is totally
                            baseless.



                            (vi) That the workman cannot be designated as Garden
                            Chaudhary because of he never worked on the same post.
                            There is a process for promotion to the post of Garden
                            Chaudhary i.e there must be sanctioned post/vacant post of
                            the garden Chaudhary and claimant should pass the trade
                            test conducted by the department. It is submitted that the
                            claimant has never passed the trade test as such, his present
                            claim is misconceived and is contrary to the provisions of
                            notified....

                                                          ***

                            (vii) That the petitioner has appeared before the Ld.
                            Tribunal and contested the claim of the respondent by filing
                            the detailed written statement in opposition to the statement
                            of claim and contended that present dispute is not an
                            industrial dispute, but is an individual dispute. The
                            petitioner administration further contended that no demand
                            notice has been served upon the petitioner management and
                            as such, the present dispute is not an industrial dispute and
                            therefore, reference is bad in law and is liable to be rejected.

                             (v) That the respondent/workman has failed to adduce any
                            documentary evidence or oral evidence in support of his
                            contention that Respondent/workman had been performing
                            his duty of Garden Choudhary w.e.f. 01.01.1991. Respondent
                            has made merely an equivocal contentions, therefore, entire
                            contention of respondent is on the basis of the vague
                            contention. However, Petitioner administration has denied
                            that respondent workman has not discharged the duties of
                            Garden Choudhary. Therefore, question does not arise for
                            giving the pay scale of the Garden Chaudhary to the
                            respondent workman. It is further submitted that merely
                            inclusion of the name of the workman in the panel does not
                            entitle him for the pay scale of the post of Garden
                            Chaudhary.

                            A. Because Ld. Industrial Tribunal has failed to appreciate
                            the fact that the claim of the respondent is not maintainable
                            before the Ld. Tribunal below because Respondent was
                            seeking the status of the Garden Choudhary on the
                            retrospective effect.



                            B. Because impugned judgment passed by the Ld. Tribunal
                            in utter disregard with the admitted fact that respondent is
                            not entitled for the promotion to the post of Garden
                            Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.01.91 because the post of the Garden
                            Chaudhary is not the promotional post and same is required
                            to be filled up by way of conducting the trade test and only
                            those who have qualified the prescribed test for the post is
                            entitled to get promoted to the post of Garden Choudhary.
                            Therefore, in the absence of qualifying in any trade test
                            prescribed for the post, the workman cannot be entitled to
                            get the pay scale of the said post w.e.f. 1991. Therefore, the
                            impugned judgment of the Tribunal below is bad in law and
                            is liable to be quashed by this Hon'ble Court.

                            Garden Chaudhary are totally deferent. Garden Chaudhary
                            is not promotional post of Mali and moreover, qualifying the

                       14.   It is submitted that the learned Tribunal failed to appreciate that the
                      workman was not allotted the work of Garden Chaudhary on 1 st April,
                      1991 and he has been merely performing the work of Mali. It is further
                      submitted that no copy of any office order has been placed by the
                      workman on record to show that he was working on the said post.
                      Therefore, the aforesaid facts clearly aver that the workman has never
                      performed the duties of a Garden Chaudhary.

                      15.   It is submitted that the learned Tribunal erred in law by failing to
                      appreciate that the recruitment rules for the post of Mali and Garden
                      Chaudhary are totally different.

                      16.   It is submitted that the post of Garden Chaudhary is not a
                      promotional post of Mali and moreover, qualifying the trade test is
                      mandatory for the promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary, and thus,
                      the claim of the workman is baseless and misconceived.

                      17.   It is submitted that the respondent workman cannot be designated
                      as Garden Chaudhary because he never worked on the same post. There
                      is a process for promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary, i.e., there
                      must be sanctioned post/vacant post of Garden Chaudhary and the
                      workman should pass the trade test conducted by the department. It is
                      submitted that the workman has never passed the trade test, and hence his
                      claim is misconceived and wrongly adjudicated by the learned Tribunal.

                      18.   It is submitted that the respondent workman has failed to adduce
                      any documentary or oral evidence in support of his contention that the
                      respondent workman had been performing his duty of Garden Chaudhary
                      w.e.f. 1st April, 1991.

                      contentions, therefore, the same are vague due to lack of substantial
                      evidence. It is further submitted that mere inclusion of the name of the
                      workman in the panel does not entitle him to the pay scale for the post of
                      the Garden Chaudhary.

                      20.       It is submitted that the impugned award is not sustainable in the
                      eyes of law as the learned Tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that the
                      respondent was promoted to the promotional post, i.e., Garden Chaudhary
                      w.e.f. 29th July, 2005 upon qualifying the trade test as envisaged on the
                      post.

                      21.       It is further submitted that the finding that the respondent herein
                      has worked for the post in question w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 is merely on the
                      basis that no suggestion was put to the respondent in his cross
                      examination that he had not worked as Garden Choudhary w.e.f. 1st April,
                      1991.

                      22.       It is also submitted that the learned Tribunal has placed reliance
                      upon Ex. WW1/1 which is a list of names of the workman as per which it
                      has been stated that the respondent workman was appointed to work as
                      Garden Chaudhary. It is submitted that the said list cannot be relied upon
                      by the learned Tribunal as there is no other evidence to prove that the
                      workman was working at the said post as claimed.

 
23.       It is submitted that as per the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme in
                      
State of Orissa v. Pyari Mohan Misra (Dr

                      workman was allowed to officiate on the promoted post, in addition to his

                       Committee (hereinafter "DPC"), the same does not confer any right on
                      the workman to claim regular scale of pay in the said officiating post.


                      24.    It is further submitted that the onus to prove the above said fact is
                      upon the respondent workman that he has worked on the said post w.e.f.
                      1st April, 1991, however, the respondent has failed to discharge its onus
                      and failed to prove its contention by adducing either any documentary or
                      oral evidence. Therefore, in the absence of any material on record, the
                      learned Tribunal is not justified in holding that the respondent has worked
                      on the post in question w.e.f. 1st April, 1991.

                      25.    Therefore, in view of the foregoing submissions, it is prayed that
                      the instant petition may be allowed and the reliefs be granted as prayed
                      for.



                      (on behalf of the respondent workman)

                      26.    Per Contra, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
                      respondent workman vehemently opposed the instant petition submitting
                      to the effect that the same is liable to be dismissed being devoid of any
                      merits.

                      27.    It is submitted that the learned Tribunal rightly adjudicated the
                      workman‟s claim by granting him the pay scale of Garden Chaudhary
                      w.e.f. 1st April, 1991.

                      28.    It is submitted that the workman had produced a list of the names
                      of the workman marked as Ex. WW1/1 where his name appeared at serial
                      no. 42, thereby, showing that the workman was earlier working as Mali,
                      appointed on 1st April, 1989 and thereafter, he has been working as
                      Officiating Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991. It is further

                       submitted that the said list was issued by the petitioner department and
                      the same has not been denied, thus, rightly considered by the learned
                      Tribunal in favour of the workman.

 
29.       It is submitted that the legal issue raised in the instant writ petition
                      is covered by the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court passed in
                      the case of 
Municipal Corpn. of Delhi v. Sultan Singh2
. It is further
                      submitted that in 
the said judgment
, it was held by the Division Bench of
                      this Court that the claim of the workmen therein has always been that
                      they should be paid the difference in pay of a Mali/Chowkidar and the
                      Garden Chaudhary as they were made to work on the post of Garden
                      Chaudhary.

                      this Court was challenged before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court where the
                      same was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 9th April, 2012 in case

                      record.

                      34.   Therefore, in view of the foregoing submissions, it is submitted
                      that the instant petition may be dismissed being devoid of any merits.



                      ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

                      35.   The matter was heard at length with arguments advanced by the
                      learned counsel for the respective parties. This Court has perused the
                      entire material on record and has also duly considered the factual scenario
                      of the matter, judicial pronouncements relied upon by the parties and
                      pleadings presented by the learned counsel for the parties.

                      36.   It is the case of the petitioner department that the impugned award
                      is bad in law since the learned Tribunal erred in holding the respondent
                      workman entitled to the status of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1 st April, 1991
                      and therefore, entitled to the pay scale of the said post. It has been
                      contended on behalf of the petitioner department that the respondent
                      workman was appointed on the post of Mali w.e.f. 1st April, 1989 and
                      since then he has been working as a Mali in the petitioner department. It
                      has been submitted that the respondent workman cannot claim the status
                      of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 since he did not possess the
                      necessary qualification at the relevant time. The petitioner further
                      contends that other than not being qualified for promotion to the post of
                      Garden Chaudhary, the respondent workman did not even pass the trade
                      test for appointment to the said post. Moreover, the respondent workman
                      has failed to adduce any evidence to show that he was working as Garden
                      Chaudhary with the petitioner department. Therefore, the impugned
                      award is liable to be set aside being against the settled position of law.

37.       In rival contentions, the respondent workman has vehemently
                      opposed the instant petition contending to the effect that there is no
                      illegality in the impugned award and the present writ petition is without
                      any merits. It has been submitted that the present case is covered by
                      various decisions of this Court as well as the Hon‟ble Supreme Court qua
                      the similar facts and circumstances and the petitioner is merely
                      prolonging the issue unnecessarily. It has been contended that the
                      respondent workman has only been granted the pay scale of Garden
                      Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 till date, meant for Garden Chaudhary
                      for which period he was directed to perform the work of Garden
                      Chaudhary. The respondent contends that as per the judgment of the
                      Division Bench of this Court in 
Sultan Singh
 (Supra), appeal against
                      which was also dismissed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, the impugned
                      award has been rightly passed in favour of the workman.
 
Learned counsel
                      appearing on behalf of the respondent workman also 
placed reliance upon

                      the judgment dated 20th March, 2012 of the Coordinate Bench of this
                      Court in the matter of 
M.C.D. v. Jai Pal Singh4
 wherein a similar mater
                      was decided in favour of the workman therein and the petitioner
                      department therein was directed to pay the difference in the pay of Mali
                      and Garden Chaudhary from 1st April, 1991 till the time he had performed
                      the duties of Garden Chaudhary. In view of the foregoing submissions, it
                      is prayed that the instant petition may be dismissed.


                      38.       At this stage, this Court deems it appropriate to peruse and discuss
                      the finding of the learned Industrial Tribunal. The relevant paragraphs of
                      the impugned award are as under:

                            wherein it is stated that workman was employed as Mali
                            w.e.f. 01.04.1989 that he was allotted the work of Chaudhary
                            w.e.f 01.01.1991 by the order of Competent Officer of the
                            Horticulture Department. It is averred that workman has got
                            the payment in lower pay scale of Mali i.e. Rs.750-9401-
                            revised from time to time but he is denied the pay scale of
                            Rs.950-1500/- for his performing the duty of Chaudhary
                            w.e.f 01.01.1991. The Mali comes under the category of
                            unskilled worker while Chaudhary comes under the category
                            of skilled worker. It is further averred that Hon'ble High
                            Court of Delhi in CW no.5514/2001 has disapproved the
                            non- I payment vide order dated 2.5.2003 for the post of

                            Delhi. It is further averred that the Commission, MCD vide
                            order no.LWD/HQ/05/5 16 dated 29.07.2005 has accorded

                            and correspondence in respect of the workman working in
                            Horticulture Department of MCD and that the Managing
                            Committee of MCD General Mazdoor Union in the meeting
                            held on 05.06.2011 sponsored the cause of Sh. Siroman
                            Singh to raise the dispute for regularization as Chaudhary.



                            It has been prayed that the workman may kindly be granted
                            status of Garden Chaudhary in the pay scale of Rs.950-
                            1500/- w.e.f 01.01.1991.



                            3. The Management has filed the Written Statement to the
                            claim of the Workman thereby taking preliminary objections
                            that the present dispute is not an industrial dispute as it is
                            not espoused by the Union and the workman has also not

                            of the Management is that no demand notice has been served

                            Garden Chaudhary are totally different. Chaudhary is not

                            Chaudhary. It is further averred that the present workman
                            never worked on the post of Garden Chaudhary and to
                            become Chaudhary there must be sanctioned post. The

                            Chaudhary. The Management has denied the contents of the

                            that the claim of the claimant may kindly be dismissed.



                            4. On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were
                            framed on 18.07.2013:-

                            ISSUES

                            1. Whether present dispute is an Industrial Dispute as
                            defined in 
Section 2(k)
 of Industrial Dispute Act? OPW

                            2. Whether the present claim of the workmen has been
                            properly espoused by the Union? OPW

                            3. Whether any notice of demand was served upon

                            4. As per terms of reference.



                            5. In Workman Evidence, the workman Siroman Singh
                            examined himself as WW1. In his affidavit, WW1 has

                            the suggestion that he is not the President of the Union or
                            that no meeting was held on 11.04.2011.



                            7. The Management in its Evidence has examined one
                            witness MWl Mewa Ram who has reiterated that contents of

                            duty of Garden Chaudhary and that for the post of Garden

                            post and the test has to be qualified. He proved the copy of
                            service book of workman as Ex.WW1/1 (colly). In cross
                            examination, he has deposed that it is admitted that
                            workman has been promoted since 04.03.20 14. After seeing
                            EX.WW1/1, he replied that office file number is not
                            mentioned and that the Dy. Director (Hort.) has no power to
                            direct the Mali/Gardner to look after the work of
                            Chaudhary. He admitted that Ex.WW1/1 has already been

                            ISSUE NO.1

                            1. Whether present dispute is an Industrial Dispute as
                            defined in 
Section 2(k)
 of Industrial Dispute Act? OPW

                            9. The onus to prove this issue is on the Workman. 
Section
                            2(k)
 of ID Act provides as below:"industrial dispute" means
                            any dispute or difference between employers and employee
                            or between employers and workmen, or between workmen
                            and workmen, which is connected with the employment or
                            non-employment or the terms of employment or with the
                            conditions of labour, or any person"

 
In 
Municipal Employees Union Vs. The Secretary (Labour)
                            & Anrs
. 1999 LLR 1020, it has been held that
                            "It is clear that even a dispute between an employer and his
                            workmen which is connected with non-employment of any
                            person can be an industrial dispute. The beneficiary of the
                            claim need not be a workman of the employer at the time of
                            raising the dispute. A dispute can be raised by the workmen
                            of the employer even in respect of the non-employment of
                            any person, who is not hi workman at the material time".‟
                            I have also perused Schedule II & III of I.D Act which
                            contemplates: -

                            MCD General Majdoor Union as WW2 in this present case.
                            In his affidavit, filed by way of an evidence, he has produced
                            the copy of espousal sponsorship dated 11.04.2011 as
                            Ex.WW2/3, copy of Union registration certificate as

                            was being paid as per the scale of Mali. Thus, it is held that
                            the present dispute is an industrial dispute as defined in

                            favour of the workman.



                            ISSUE NO.2
                            Whether the present claim of the workmen has been properly
                            espoused by the Union? OPW

                            11. The onus to prove this issue is on the workman. The
                            workman has examined WW2 Sh. B.K. Prasad, President of
                            the Union who has proved the espousal letter issued by Sh.
                            Bhoop Singh, General Secretary of MCD General Mazdoor
                            Union(Regd). The copy of the said letter dated 11.04.2011 is
                            available on file as EX.WW2/3. In reference order, the name
                            of the Union specifically mentioned. In cross examination,
                            no question has been asked by the Ld.AR from WW1 that his
                            case has not been properly espoused. No question has also
                            been asked with regard to meeting of the union. Only
                            suggestion has been put to WW2 with regard to espousal
                            which will not affect the case of the workman. In view of this,
                            I am of the view that the cause of the workmen has been duly
                            espoused. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly in favour of the
                            workman.

                            Whether any notice of demand               was   served   upon

                            12. The onus to prove this issue is on the Workman.
                            However, perusal of the record shows that workman has
                            failed to prove that he sent any demand notice to the
                            management.

                             "A bare perusal of the definition would show that where
                            there is a dispute or difference between the parties
                            contemplated by the definition and the dispute or difference
                            is connected with the employment or non- employment or
                            terms of employment or with the condition of labour of any
                            person, there comes into existence an industrial dispute. 
The
                            Act
 nowhere contemplates that the dispute would come into
                            existence in any particular, specific or prescribed manner.
                            For coming into- existence of an industrial dispute a written
                            demand is not a sine qua non, unless of course in the case of
                            public utility service, because section forbids going on strike
                            without giving a strike notice".



                            14. Though, no demand notice has been served upon the
                            management, yet in view of above judgment, it will have no
                            material affect on the award as no such notice was required
                            to be given. Issue no.3 is decided accordingly.



                            ISSUE NO.4

                            4. As per terms of reference.

                            The terms of reference is - "Whether Sh Siroman Singh S/o
                            Sh. Inderpal Singh is entitled to the status of Chaudhary in

                            benefits and if so, to what relief is he entitled and what
                            directions are necessary in this respect?"



                            15. The Workman has deposed in his affidavit filed in his
                            evidence that he was working as acting Chaudhary w.e.f
                            01.01.91 and his name appears at sr.no.42 in Annexure W

                            to 43 were working as Officiating Chudharies with the

                            Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.1991. This list has been signed by
                            Dy. Director (Horticulture). This document has been issued
                            by Management. It has not been denied by the Management
                            that this document does not belong to then' or that it is a
                            false or procured document. In cross examination, WW1
                            Workman has deposed that he has been regularly promoted
                            to the post of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f 04.03.2014. He
                            qualified the trade test for the post of Garden Choudhary.
                            The document Ex.WW1/1 clearly indicate that the workman
                            started working as Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.199 1 though the
                            passed the required test later and promoted to the post of
                            Chaudhary.



                            16. The Management has also led the evidence to counter the
                            claim of the workman. But the plea of the management that
                            the workman never performed the work of chaudhary is
                            unbelievable since the the document EX.WW1/1 issued by
                            management clearly indicate that the workman used to
                            perform the duty of Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.1991. I have
                            perused the service book of the workman Ex.MW1/1 (colly.).
                            The said service book clearly show that the workman has
                            been getting the pay scale applicable to Mali while he has
                            been working as Chaudhary w.e.f .01.04.1991.



 
17. Workman has also deposed that the Management has
                            granted the pay scale to Sh. Jal Chand (co-worker) and

In 
M.C.D Vs. Sultan Singh & Ors. WP (C)
                            NO.7974/2010
, it is observed that 'considering the entire
                            facts and circumstances it is apparent that the claim of the
                            respondents have always been that they should be paid the
                            difference in pay of Mali/Chowkidar and the Garden
                            Chaudhary as they were made to work on the post of Garden
                            Chaudhary whereas the petitioner had first denied that they
                            worked as Garden Chaudharies, then took the plea that the
                            Assiatant Director (Horticulture) was not competent to ask
                            the respondents to work as Garden Chaudharies and that the
                            respondents cannot be appointed to the post of Garden
                            Chaudharies in accordance with the recruitment rules.


                            There is no doubt that respondents are not claiming
                            appointment to the post of Garden Chaudharies on account
                            of having worked on adhoc basis on the post of Garden
                            Chaudhary contrary to rules or that some of them not having
                            the requisite qualifications are entitled for relaxation. In the
                            entirety of facts & circumstances therefore, the learned
                            counsel for the petitioner has failed to make out any such
                            grounds which will impel this court to exercise its
                            jurisdiction under 
Article 226
 of the Constitution to set aside
                            the order of the Tribunal dated 291/1 Jan 2010 and 7th Oct.

                             The Management has been failed to produce any record that
                            the workman was appointed as officiating Chaudhary for
                            some time and that thereafter he stopped working as
                            Chaudhary. On the other hand, it has been admitted that the
                            workman has been promoted as Chaudhary w.e.f.

                            21. In view of the entire facts and circumstances of the case,
                            it is held that the workman is entitled for the pay scale of

                      39.   Upon perusal of the above extracted portion of the impugned
                      award, it is observed that the case before the learned Tribunal revolves
                      around a dispute raised by Sh. Siroman Singh, a workman, regarding his
                      entitlement to the pay scale and status of a Garden Chaudhary. The
                      workman‟s claim stated that he was employed as a Mali from 1st January,
                      1989 and was assigned the duties of a Garden Chaudhary from 1st April,
                      1991, by a competent officer in the Horticulture Department, i.e., Deputy
                      Director (Horticulture). Despite performing the duties of a Garden
                      Chaudhary, he continued to receive the lower pay scale of a Mali. The
                      pay scale for a Mali was Rs. 750/- -940/-, whereas a Garden Chaudhary,
                      categorized as a skilled worker, had a pay scale of Rs. 950/- -1500/-. The
                      workman had 
placed reliance upon
 a judgment of this Court and
                      subsequent Municipal Corporation of Delhi orders which disapproved the
                      non-payment for the post of Garden Chaudhary and directed the
                      petitioner department therein to make the payment of the difference of the
                      pay scale.

                       40.   The petitioner management contested the workman‟ claim, arguing
                      that the dispute did not qualify as an industrial dispute since it was not
                      properly espoused by a union and no demand notice was served upon it. It
                      was asserted that the workman was initially and regularly promoted as a
                      Mali, not a Garden Chaudhary, and had never performed the duties of a
                      Garden Chaudhary. Furthermore, the petitioner department emphasized
                      that Garden Chaudhary is not a promotional post from Mali; it requires
                      passing a test, and the workman in the instant case had never passed such
                      a test nor was there an office order for him to act as Garden Chaudhary.

                      41.   The issues framed for determination of the learned Tribunal
                      included whether the dispute qualifies as an industrial dispute under the
                      
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
, if the claim was properly espoused by the
                      union, and the effect of the absence of a demand notice, and as per the
                      terms of the reference. Evidence presented included testimonies from the
                      workman and a union representative, along with documentary evidence
                      supporting workman‟s claim that he performed Garden Chaudhary duties
                      from April, 1991.

                      42.   The learned Tribunal observed that the dispute raised before it
                      qualifies as an industrial dispute under 
Section 2(k)
 of the Industrial
                      Disputes Act, 1947 noting that the workman‟s union had properly
                      espoused the cause. Despite no formal demand notice being served, the
                      dispute was recognized as valid, following legal precedents of the
                      Hon‟ble Supreme Court, indicating that a written demand is not a
                      prerequisite for an industrial dispute's existence.

                      43.   The learned Tribunal noted that the examination of evidence
                      revealed the workman‟s name on a list of employees performing as

                       officiating Garden Chaudharies and the acknowledgment by the
                      management that the workman was promoted to Garden Chaudhary in the
                      year 2014 after passing the required trade test. The learned Tribunal noted
                      that although he was formally promoted later, the workman performed
                      the duties of Garden Chaudhary from 1991. Citing previous judgments of
                      the Hon‟ble Supreme Court as well as this Court, the learned Tribunal
                      underscored the principle that employees should be compensated for
                      higher responsibilities undertaken, even if formal promotions occur later.

                      44.   In conclusion, the learned Tribunal decided the claim in favor of
                      the workman, entitling him to the pay scale of Rs. 950/- -1500/- for
                      Garden Chaudhary, effective from 1st April, 1991, till date, including all
                      the consequential benefits. The reasoning behind the same was based on
                      the evidence that the workman performed the duties of a garden
                      Chaudhary from 1991, and the management's inability to refute the claim
                      effectively.

                      45.   Therefore, the question that arises for the consideration of this
                      Court are as follows:

                            Issue no. 1 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled
                            to the post of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991?
                            Issue no. 2 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled
                            to the pay scale attached to the post of Garden Chaudhary
                            for the period he has worked on the said post on officiating
                            status?

                      Issue no. 1 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled to the post of
                      Garden Chaudhary w.e.f 1st April, 1991?

                       46.       Before delving into the analysis of the instant issue, this Court
                      deems it imperative to state the settled position of law with respect to the
                      entitlement to a post without having been officially appointed to the said
                      post.

                      47.       In    addressing   whether   a   person   who   is   not   officially
                      appointed/promoted to a post can be entitled to the said post merely
                      because they were working in an officiating or ad hoc or acting or
                      temporary position or as a stop gap arrangement, it is crucial to apply
                      legal principles and precedents relevant to employment law and industrial
                      disputes.

                      48.       As per the settled position of law, appointment to a post has to be
                      made after following the due process of law. Appointment made to a post
                      without following the established recruitment process is contrary to the
                      constitutional mandate as well as the basic fundamental and legal rights.

                      49.       Recruitment rules and qualifications for a post are designed to
                      ensure that only those with the requisite skills and expertise occupy
                      positions of responsibility. Courts generally uphold the necessity of
                      complying with these rules to maintain organizational standards and
                      fairness.

In 
Shankarsan Dash vs. Union of India5
, the Hon‟ble Supreme
                      Court held that even if a candidate is selected for a post, they do not

                             "...10. The main contention on behalf of the appellant has
                            been, however, that the authorities in keeping the vacancies
                            arising later unfilled, acted arbitrarily. Mr Goswami
                            referred to several documents annexed to the special leave
                            petition and affidavits filed on behalf of the parties and
                            contended that although appointments of many candidates in
                            the other services were made in the later vacancies, the
                            vacancy in the Indian Police Service which subsequently
                            became available to the appellant was refused without any
                            just cause, resulting in illegal discrimination. This was
                            emphatically denied on behalf of the respondent. Since the
                            matter did not appear to be free from ambiguity on the basis
                            of the affidavits before us, we decided to examine the factual
                            aspects more thoroughly by examining the other available
                            materials on the records of the Union of India, and
                            accordingly the learned counsel for the respondent got the
                            relevant departmental files called. Two further affidavits
                            were also filed along with photostat copies of a large
                            number of documents, which we examined at some length
                            with the aid of the learned advocates for both sides. From
                            the materials produced before us it is fully established that
                            there has not been any arbitrariness whatsoever on the part
                            of the respondent in filling up the vacancies in question or
                            the other vacancies referred to by the learned counsel for the
                            appellant. The process of final selection had to be closed at
                            some stage as was actually done. A decision in this regard
                            was accordingly taken and the process for further allotment
                            to any vacancy arising later was closed. Mr Goswami relied
                            upon certain appointments actually made subsequent to this
                            stage and urged that by those dates the further vacancies in
                            the Indian Police Service had arisen to which the appellant
                            and the other successful candidates should have been
                            adjusted. We do not find any merit in this contention. It is
                            not material if in pursuance of a decision already taken
                            before closing the process of final selection, the formal
                            appointments were concluded later. What is relevant is to
                            see as to when the process of final selection was closed.

                                details in this connection available from the large number of
                                documents which we closely examined during the hearing at

                                rejecting the argument of the learned counsel in this regard
                                based on the factual aspect..."



                      51.       Moving further, this Court is of the view that officiating positions
                      are temporary arrangements and do not confer any right to the substantive
                      post. Also, the retrospective appointment or promotion to a post should
                      be given most sparingly and on sound reasoning and foundation.
                      Additionally, it is the DPC which is tasked with determining and
                      finalizing the process of promotion to a certain post and unless the
                      decision of the said DPC is proven to be arbitrary or mala fide, it cannot
                      be said that the same requires intervention of the Courts.

 
52.       Similar view was also taken by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in 
K.
                      Madhavan vs. Union of India6
, where the Hon‟ble Court observed that
                      officiating in a higher post does not entitle an employee to a permanent
                      promotion unless they meet the eligibility criteria and are appointed
                      through due process. The relevant paragraphs of the same read as under:


                                "...10. The 1975 Rules which are relevant for the purpose do
                                not explain what is meant by the expression "on a regular
                                basis". The expression has created some ambiguity in the
                                eligibility clause giving rise to this controversy. There can
                                be no doubt that when a person is appointed to a post
                                against a permanent vacancy on probation, his appointment
                                is on a regular basis, but when a person is appointed to a
                                post on a purely temporary or on an ad hoc basis, the
                                appointment is not on a regular basis. The expression "on a
                                regular basis" in the 1975 Rules cannot, in our opinion, be

                             interpreted to mean as on absorption in the CBI as SP. The
                            general principle is that in the absence of any specific
                            provision to the contrary, the length of service from the date
                            of appointment to a post should be taken into consideration
                            for the purpose of either seniority in that post or eligibility
                            for the higher post. As no explanation has been given in the
                            1975 Rules of the said expression, we do not think it
                            desirable to deviate from the established principle of
                            computing the length of service for the purpose of seniority
                            or eligibility for the higher post from the date of
                            appointment. In our view, therefore, the expression "on a
                            regular basis" would mean the appointment to the post on a
                            regular basis in contradistinction to appointment on ad hoc
                            or stopgap or purely temporary basis. Respondent 5, in our
                            opinion, satisfied the eligibility test of the 1975 Rules for
                            consideration for the post of DIG. But, it is not disputed by
                            the parties that the petitioners and Respondent 5 have, by the
                            lapse of time during the pendency of this litigation, become
                            eligible for appointment to the posts of DIG. Indeed, they are
                            holding the posts of DIG, may be on ad hoc basis, under the
                            interim orders of this Court and there is no chance of their
                            being reverted to the next lower post of SP. The question,
                            therefore, boils down to the seniority of the petitioners, vis-

                            à-vis Respondent 5 in the post of DIG. That again will
                            depend upon the decision on the question as to the seniority
                            of the petitioners and Respondent 5 in the post of SP.

                                                           ***

                            15. There can be no doubt that if the meeting of the DPC
                            scheduled to be held is arbitrarily or mala fide cancelled
                            without any reasonable justification therefor to the prejudice
                            of an employee and he is not considered for promotion to a
                            higher post, the government in a suitable case can do justice
                            to such an employee by granting him promotion or
                            appointing him to the higher post for which the DPC was to

                            become eligible for a certain post, but surely he cannot
                            claim appointment to such post as a matter of right..."



 
53.   During the course of arguments, the petitioner 
placed reliance upon

                      the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in 
Pyari Mohan Misra

                      (Supra) contending that even if the respondent workman, in addition to
                      his substantive post was allowed to officiate on the promoted post, de
                      hors of selection in DPC, the same does not confer any right on the
                      respondent to claim regular scale of pay in the said promoted post.
                      Relevant paragraphs of 
the said judgment
 are as follows:


                            "..4. Admittedly, there is no order communicated to the
                            respondent appointing him in a substantive capacity as
                            Director. The only order passed in his favour was of 22-7-
                            1972. That order clearly shows that he would continue
                            temporarily until further orders in terms of the order of
                            appointment made on ad hoc basis on 12-8-1971. In other
                            words, mere prolonged continuous ad hoc service does not
                            ripen into a regular service to claim permanent or
                            substantive status. He would remain to be on ad hoc basis
                            until further orders. Since the Government had taken policy
                            decision to appoint an IAS officer, he was rightly reverted to
                            the post of Joint Director. Accordingly, we hold that his
                            reversion is perfectly legal and valid. However, the stark
                            facts remain that he continued in the post of Director and
                            discharged his duties as Director from 12-8-1971. In these
                            circumstances, as a mark of good gesture but not as a
                            precedent, the appellants are directed to give him
                            pensionary benefits computing his pay as if he voluntarily
                            retired as a Director from 16-12-1977. All the proceedings
                            now stand concluded. The TA stands dismissed. The appeal
                            is disposed of accordingly. No costs..."

                       54.   Perusal of the above judgment states that mere prolonged
                      continuous ad hoc service does not entitle the employee to claim
                      appointment into a regular service or to claim permanent or substantive
                      status. This Court is also of the view that unless the circumstances speak
                      otherwise, mere working in a particular post on ad hoc does not vest any
                      right to be appointed permanently in the said post as the same would be
                      contrary to the recruitment rules and violative of various constitutional
                      mandates.

                      55.   In light of the facts of the instant case, it is observed that Ex.
                      WW1/1, which is the part of the Trial Court Record is a list of workers
                      working as Officiating Chaudharies, and in Ex. WW1/1, the respondent
                      workman‟s name appears to be at serial no. 42. Moreover, in paragraph
                      no. 15 of the impugned award, the workman has also duly admitted that
                      he was working as „acting Chaudhary‟ w.e.f. 1st April, 1991.

                      56.   Furthermore, as per the rules of recruitment of the petitioner
                      department, the respondent is not entitled for the promotion to the post
                      Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 because the said post is the
                      promotional post and the same is required to be filled by way of
                      conducting a „trade test‟ and only those who have qualified the prescribed
                      test for the post are entitled to get promoted to the post of Garden
                      Chaudhary.

                      57.   Although the respondent workman is seen to be working as a
                      Garden Chaudhary upon directions and order of the Deputy Director
                      (Horticulture), however, there is nothing on record to show that he was
                      promoted or appointed to the said post by following the established

                       recruitment rules of the petitioner department until his official promotion
                      on 4th March, 2014.

                      58.       While the workman performed the duties of a Garden Chaudhary
                      from the year 1991, this alone does not entitle him to the post. There must
                      be clear evidence that his performance met the standards required for the
                      post, thereby, confirming his promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary
                      after following the due process of law, i.e., trade test.

                      59.       The fact that the respondent workman passed the trade test in the
                      year 2014 is relevant, but it also indicates that prior to this, he did not
                      meet all the necessary qualifications for „regular promotion/appointment‟
                      to the post of Garden Chaudhary.

 
60.       The workman‟s entitlement to the post must be evaluated based on
                      the date he met all the requirements, not just when he began performing
                      the duties on officiating/ad hoc basis. Precedent like 
State of Karnataka
                      v. Umadevi
 (3)7 particularly states that regular appointments must follow
                      statutory rules. Therefore, the respondent workman‟s claim to the post
                      must be evaluated against these legal standards, which prioritize
                      adherence to established recruitment procedures.


                      61.       This Court is of the view that if the rules for the higher post require
                      certain qualifications or passing of specific tests, the employee must meet
                      these criteria. Sh. Siroman Singh, i.e., the workman herein passed the
                      required trade test only in the year 2014, which fulfilled this requirement
                      for formal promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary. As per the law,
                      promotions must be evaluated based on the fulfillment of all requirements
                      at the appropriate time and the respondent workman passed the trade test

                       in the year 2014, indicating he did not meet the necessary qualifications
                      for regular promotion to the post of Garden Chaudhary until that time.

                      62.   The contention of the petitioner department that the workman has
                      failed to discharge the onus of proof that he was performing duties of
                      Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 is untenable in the eyes of law as
                      the respondent workman had duly placed the list of workmen (which
                      includes his name at serial no. 42), duly issued by the Deputy Director
                      (Horticulture) and the said documentary evidence has been rightly taken
                      into consideration by the learned Industrial Tribunal.

                      63.   Based on the legal principles and judicial precedents, it is stated
                      that a person cannot be entitled to a post merely because they were
                      working in an officiating capacity, especially if they were not appointed
                      following the prescribed recruitment rules and necessary qualifications.

                      64.   The principles of equity and fairness must be balanced with the
                      statutory requirements to ensure that appointments are made transparently
                      and based on merit. Therefore, while the respondent workman‟s long
                      service and performance in the role of Garden Chaudhary might merit
                      consideration, his official appointment to the post must comply with the
                      requisite recruitment rules and qualifications.

                      65.   Summarily stated, the respondent workman is not entitled to the
                      post/status of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 since he was not
                      appointed on the said post as per the recruitment rules and further, cannot
                      be promoted to the said post until he passed the trade test.

                      66.   This Court is of the considered view that to determine whether the
                      respondent worked as a Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 until 4th
                      March, 2014, i.e., when he was promoted officially, after passing the

                      prerogative of the learned Industrial Tribunal and being a writ Court, this
                      Court is only tasked to decide whether the workman is entitled to the post
                      of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991, which has been decided in
                      negative in terms of the observations made in the foregoing paragraphs.

                      67.   It is held that the respondent workman was appointed as an
                      Officiating Garden Chaudhary and he performed the duties of the said
                      post under the orders of the Deputy Director (Horticulture) merely as an
                      Officiating Garden Chaudhary and not as a regular Garden Chaudhary
                      since he did not pass the trade test at the relevant time. The respondent
                      workman‟s was directed to perform the duties of the above said post and
                      the same was merely a temporary arrangement without vesting any right
                      in his favour to claim entitlement to the said post on regular basis.

                      68.   Accordingly issue no. 1 stands decided.

                      Issue no. 2 - Whether the respondent workman is entitled to the pay
                      scale attached to the post of Garden Chaudhary for the period he has
                      worked on the said post on officiating status?

                      69.   In order to decide the issue stated herein above, it is prudent for
                      this Court to ascertain the settled legal position behind the entitlement of
                      a person performing the duties of a higher post in an officiating capacity
                      qua pay scale of the said higher post.

                      70.   Here, the doctrine of quantum meruit comes into picture which
                      implies that a person should be paid for the work done if they have
                      performed duties typically associated with a higher post.

 
71.   The doctrine of quantum meruit was applied by the Hon‟ble
                      Supreme Court in the case of 
Selvaraj vs. Lt. Governor of Island, Port

, where it was held that the employee was entitled to the
                      emoluments available for the higher post during the time he actually
                      worked in that capacity, even though he was not officially promoted.
                      Relevant portion of 
the said judgment
 are as under:


                                "..3. It is not in dispute that the appellant looked after the
                                duties of Secretary (Scouts) from the date of the order and
                                his salary was to be drawn against the post of Secretary
                                (Scouts) under GFR 77. Still he was not paid the said salary
                                for the work done by him as Secretary (Scouts). It is of
                                course true that the appellant was not regularly promoted to
                                the said post. It is also true as stated in the counter-affidavit
                                of Deputy Resident Commissioner, Andaman & Nicobar
                                Administration that the appellant was regularly posted in the
                                pay scale of Rs 1200-2040 and he was asked to look after the
                                duties of Secretary (Scouts) as per the order aforesaid. It is
                                also true that had this arrangement not been done, he would
                                have to be transferred to the interior islands where the post
                                of PST was available, but the appellant was keen to stay in
                                Port Blair as averred in the said counter. However, in our
                                view, these averments in the counter will not change the real
                                position. Fact remains that the appellant has worked on the
                                higher post though temporarily and in an officiating
                                capacity pursuant to the aforesaid order and his salary was
                                to be drawn during that time against the post of Secretary
                                (Scouts). It is also not in dispute that the salary attached to
                                the post of Secretary (Scouts) was in the pay scale of 1640-
                                2900. Consequently, on the principle of quantum meruit the
                                respondents authorities should have paid the appellant as
                                per the emoluments available in the aforesaid higher pay
                                scale during the time he actually worked on the said post of
                                Secretary (Scouts) though in an officiating capacity and not
                                as a regular promotee. This limited relief is required to be
                                given to the appellant only on this ground.

                                 4. The decision of the Central Administrative Tribunal
                                rejecting the claim of the appellant to the aforesaid limited
                                extent is therefore required to be set aside. The appeals are
                                allowed to the limited extent that the respondents will be
                                called upon to make available to the appellant the difference
                                of salary in the time scale of 1640-2900 during the period
                                from 29-1-1992 to 19-9 1995 during which time the
                                appellant actually worked. It is made clear that the payment
                                of the aforesaid difference amount of salary shall not be
                                treated to amount to any promotion given to the appellant on
                                the said post. It is only on the ground that he had actually
                                worked, as such this relief is being given to him. The
                                difference of salary as aforesaid shall be paid over to the
                                appellant within eight weeks from today. No costs..."



 
72.       The aforementioned judgment was also followed by the Hon‟ble
                      Supreme Court in 
State of Punjab v. Dharam Pal9
 and the observations
                      made therein are as follows:


                                "...10. Certain Notes have been appended to the said Rule
                                but they are not relevant for adjudication of the present
                                controversy. On a close scrutiny, it is noticeable that the
                                said Rule postulates that the government employee
                                appointed to an officiating post shall not draw pay higher
                                than his substantive pay in respect of a permanent post
                                unless the post in which he is appointed to officiate is one
                                enumerated in the Schedule to the Rules and further the
                                officiating appointment involves assumption of duties and
                                responsibilities of greater importance than those attached to
                                the post. It is not in dispute that the posts of Superintendent
                                Grade II and Grade I are covered under the Schedule. Be it
                                mentioned, the extension of benefit is subject to the
                                provisions of Rules 4.22 and 4.24.

                                                               ***

                                13. On a careful scrutiny of the aforesaid prescription, it is
                                perceptible that the said Rule envisages a different situation

                             altogether. The present factual matrix is quite different. We
                            are inclined to so hold as the respondent herein was holding
                            higher posts and further he was performing the duties of
                            higher responsibility attached to the posts. Thus analysed,
                            we arrive at the conclusion that the Rules do not bolster the
                            proposition advanced by the learned counsel for the State.

 
14. Having analysed the Rule position, we may allude to the
                            authorities that have been commended to us. First, we shall
                            dwell upon the decision in 
Pritam Singh Dhaliwal [Pritam
                            Singh Dhaliwal v. State of Punjab
, 2004 SCC OnLine P&H
                            1428 : (2004) 4 RSJ 599] that has been relied upon by the
                            High Court in the impugned order.
 
In the said case, the
                            Division Bench of the High Court had 
placed reliance
                            upon
 
P. Grover v. State of Haryana [P. Grover
 v. State of
                            Haryana, (1983) 4 SCC 291 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 525 : AIR
                            1983 SC 1060] and Selvaraj v. Lt. Governor of Island, Port
                            Blair [Selvaraj v. Lt. Governor of Island, Port Blair, (1998)
                            4 SCC 291 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1127 : (1999) 2 SCT 286] and
                            earlier decisions of the High Court and analysing the Rule
                            position opined that the officer therein had been asked to
                            officiate as Deputy Director with effect from 14-3-1996 and
                            he had been continuously posted to equivalent posts such as
                            Additional Deputy Commissioner (D) and till his
                            superannuation the officiating charge was never withdrawn
                            and hence, his entitlement to claim higher pay scale for the
                            post for which he was asked to officiate and perform his
                            duties till his superannuation would not be negatived.


 
15. As the reasoning of the High Court is fundamentally
                            based on enunciation of law propounded by the Court in 
P.
                            Grover [P. Grover v. State of Haryana
, (1983) 4 SCC 291 :


 
1983 SCC (L&S) 525 : AIR 1983 SC 1060] , we think it apt
                            to appreciate the 
ratio 
laid down in
 the said case. A two-
                            Judge Bench of this Court was dealing with the fact situation
                            wherein keeping in view the policy decision, the appellant
                            therein was promoted as an acting District Education
                            Officer. The order of promotion contained a superadded
                            condition that she would draw her own pay scale which
                            apparently meant she would continue to draw her salary on

                             her pay scale prior to promotion. The claim was put forth by
                            the appellant that she was entitled to the pay of District
                            Education Officer and there was no justification for denying
                            the same to her. A writ petition was filed before the High
                            Court and the State filed the counter-affidavit contending,
                            inter alia, that she was promoted to the post of acting
                            District Education Officer as there was no Class I post and
                            hence, she was not entitled to be paid the salary of District
                            Education Officer. Appreciating the fact situation, the Court
                            held : (SCC p. 293, para 3)
                                  "3. ... We are unable to understand the reason given
                               in the counter-affidavit. She was promoted to the post
                               of District Education Officer, a Class I post, on an
                               acting basis. Our attention was not invited to any rule
                               which provides that promotion on an acting basis
                               would not entitle the officer promoted to the pay of the
                               post. In the absence of any rule justifying such refusal
                               to pay to an officer promoted to a higher post the
                               salary of such higher post (the validity of such a rule
                               would be doubtful if it existed), we must hold that Smt
                               Grover is entitled to be paid the salary of a District
                               Education Officer from the date she was promoted to
                               the post, that is, 19-7-1976, until she retired from
                               service on 31-8-1980."

                            , the Court was dealing with the entitlement of the appellant

                            had worked from 28-2-2001 till 31-5-2005. The employer
                            had denied certain benefits and the employee preferred a

Hari Om Sharma [Secy.-cum-Chief Engineer v. Hari
                            Om Sharma
, (1998) 5 SCC 87 : 1998 SCC (L&S) 1273] , the
                            respondent was promoted as a Junior Engineer I in 1990
                            and had been continuing on that post without being paid
                            salary for the said post and without being promoted on
                            regular basis. It was in this situation, he approached the
                            Central Administrative Tribunal which allowed the claim
                            petition with the direction that the respondent shall be paid
                            salary for the post of Junior Engineer I. That apart certain
                            other directions were also issued. The Court took note of the
                            fact that the respondent was promoted on a stop-gap
                            arrangement as Junior Engineer I and opined that this by
                            itself would not deny his claim of salary for the said post. In
                            that context, the Court held : (SCC p. 89, para 6)
                                   "6. ... If a person is put to officiate on a higher post
                               with greater responsibilities, he is normally entitled to
                               salary of that post. The Tribunal has noticed that the
                               respondent has been working on the post of Junior
                               Engineer I since 1990 and promotion for such a long
                               period of time cannot be treated to be a stop-gap
                               arrangement."

                            (L&S) 376] is concerned, we would like to observe that the
                            said case has to rest on its own facts. We may clearly state
                            that by an incorporation in the order or merely by giving an
                            undertaking in all circumstances would not debar an
                            employee to claim the benefits of the officiating position.
 
We
                            are disposed to think that the controversy is covered by the
                            
ratio 
laid down in

                            (L&S) 1273] and resultantly we hold that the view expressed
                            by the High Court is absolutely impeccable...."




                      73.   Perusal of the above extracts reveal that the Hon‟ble Supreme
                      Court has settled the issue regarding claim of a person for pay scale
                      attached to a position where he was working in an officiating capacity. 
In
                      the case of 
Dharam Pal
 (Supra), Dharam Pal was given the officiating
                      charge of higher posts (Superintendent Grade II and Superintendent
                      Grade I) while he was substantively holding the post of Senior Assistant.
                      The Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that Dharam Pal was entitled to the pay
                      scale of the higher post he was officiating because he was performing the
                      duties and responsibilities of the said post.


                      74.   It was observed that an employee performing duties of a higher
                      post in an officiating capacity should be paid the higher emoluments for
                      the duration they actually worked in that capacity, applying the principle
                      of quantum meruit. The Hon‟ble Court held that if an employee is
                      officiating in a higher post and is performing the duties and
                      responsibilities attached to that post, he is entitled to the pay scale of that
                      higher post.

                      75.   Furthermore, as per the principle of legitimate expectation, an
                      employee has a reasonable expectation of being treated in a certain way

                       by their employer, based on past practices or promises. If an employee
                      has been performing the duties of a higher post for an extended period,
                      they might have a legitimate expectation of being compensated
                      accordingly or being formally appointed to that post.

                      76.   This Court is of the view that the Courts are duty bound to consider
                      the principles of equity and fairness, particularly in employment disputes.
                      If an employee has been performing the duties of a higher post in good
                      faith and upon directions/orders of the concerned authority, it might be
                      deemed unfair for the employer to deny them the corresponding benefits.
                      However, there must be clear and convincing evidence that the employee
                      has been performing the specific duties of the higher post.

                      77.   Now delving into the facts of the matter in hand.

                      78.   The respondent workman claimed his entitlement to the pay scale
                      of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991, i.e., when he was
                      directed/ordered by the Deputy Director (Horticulture) to perform the
                      duties of Chaudhary by way of issuing a list where the workman‟s name
                      appeared at serial no. 42.

                      79.   It is relevant to note here that the above said list has not been
                      denied or disputed by the petitioner department before the learned
                      Industrial Tribunal as observed in paragraph no. 15 of the impugned
                      award. Relevant paragraph is reproduced herein below:

                            "...15. The Workman has deposed in his affidavit filed in his
                            evidence that he was working as acting Chaudhary w.e.f

                            which is Ex.W1/1. I have perused the said exhibited
                            document. It clearly shows that the employees from sr.no.1
                            to 43 were working as Officiating Chudharies with the
                            Management. The list clearly show that the persons were

                            The perusal of Ex.WW1/1 shows that the name of Workman
                            appears at sr.no.42 i.e. Siroman sb Inderpal, earlier working
                            as Mali, appointed on 01.04.1989, working as Officiating
                            Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.1991. This list has been signed by
                            Dy. Director (Horticulture). This document has been issued
                            by Management. It has not been denied by the Management
                            that this document does not belong to then' or that it is a
                            false or procured document. In cross examination, WW1
                            Workman has deposed that he has been regularly promoted
                            to the post of Garden Chaudhary w.e.f 04.03.2014. He
                            qualified the trade test for the post of Garden Choudhary.
                            The document Ex.WW1/1 clearly indicate that the workman
                            started working as Chaudhary w.e.f. 01.04.199 1 though the
                            passed the required test later and promoted to the post of
                            Chaudhary..."



                      80.   Perusal of the above reproduced extracts of the impugned award
                      reveals that the workman had deposed before the learned Tribunal that he
                      was working as acting Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991. Further,
                      it was observed by the learned Tribunal that the list (EX. WW1/1), which
                      was duly signed by the Deputy Director (Horticulture), exhibited by the
                      workman in his affidavit, explicitly states the name of the workman at
                      serial no. 42, who was earlier working as a Mali and later on working as
                      Officiating Chaudhary.

                      81.   It was also observed by the learned Tribunal that the document has

                      portion of the cross examination of petitioner department is reproduced
                      herein below:



                            "..XXXXXX by Sh. BK Prasad, Ld. AR for workman.
                            It is correct that workman Sh. Siroman Singh has been
                            promoted since 04.03.2014.

                            At this stage, Ld. AR for workman has drawn attention of the
                            witness on order Ex. WW 1/1 at serial no.42 of judicial file
                            and asked the following questions:-

                            alongwith the other workmen has been directed to look after
                            the work as Choudhary. What have you to say?
                            Ans. I have seen the order but it is not mentioned the office
                            file number nor the Dy. Director Horticulture has power to
                            direct the Mali/Gardener to look after the work of
                            Choudhary.

                            Q It is correct that this list Ex, WW 1/1 has already been got
                            verified by the Asst. Director Horticulture namely Sh.

                            on 17.06.09 as a Mali/Gardener on transfer from New
                            Delhi Central Zone Horticulture?

                            Ans. It is correct.

                            Q Is it correct that after joining by Siroman in your
                            department, he has been looking after work of Choudhary
                            since 17.06.09. What have you to say?

                            Ans It is correct.

                            It is correct that if the rules allow to give the money for the
                            period working as Choudhary by the workman Siromani
                            Singh till he is appearing in the examination conducted by
                            the department for promotion as Choudhary, then he is
                            eligible to get the said amount from the department..."



                      83.   It is observed by this Court that the document (Exhibit WW1/1)
                      signed by the Deputy Director (Horticulture) serves as official
                      acknowledgment that the respondent workman along with the others were
                      performing duties of Garden Chaudhary which is a higher post than that
                      of Mali (initial post). The lack of denial or contestation by the
                      management strengthens the credibility of this evidence.

                      84.   This Court is of the view that in terms of the aforesaid list, i.e., Ex.
                      WW1/1 it is proved that the workman was appointed to perform duties of
                      a Garden Chaudhary in officiating capacity by the Deputy Director
                      (Horticulture) of the petitioner department.

                      85.   Thus, in terms of the law discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, the
                      workman cannot be held to be not entitled to the pay scale attached to the
                      post of Garden Chaudhary. The said finding is based upon the fact that
                      the petitioner department has not produced any documentary or oral
                      evidence to deny or disprove that the workman did not perform the duties
                      of Officiating Garden Chaudhary after his name appeared in the list or
                      that he was not appointed on the said post w.e.f. 1 st April, 1991.

                       86.   It is important to note that the entitlement of the workman to the
                      pay scale of Garden Chaudhary is also based upon the fact that the
                      respondent was officially promoted to the above said post w.e.f. 4th
                      March, 2014 as well as the legal propositions discussed in the foregoing
                      paragraphs.

                      87.   Thus, various judicial decisions have established that the
                      employees are entitled to the pay scale of higher posts if they are
                      officiating in those posts and performing the associated duties, even if
                      they have not been formally appointed or promoted through the
                      established recruitment process. This ensures fairness and adherence to
                      the principle of „equal pay for equal work‟, recognizing the
                      responsibilities and work actually undertaken by the employee.

 
88.   At this stage, it is pertinent to discuss the judgment of the Division
                      Bench of this Court in 
Sultan Singh
 (Supra) against which SLP was filed
                      before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court by the petitioner department and the
                      same was dismissed as withdrawn. The relevant portion of the judgment
                      of the Division Bench of this Court is reproduced herein below for
                      reference:


 
"...12. The Tribunal heard the pleas and contentions of the

                            the respondents on the basis of the evidence that is the three
                            lists issued by different zones in respect of respondents
                            working as Garden Chaudharies and other functions and

                             of Delhi v. B.S. Jarial where the Division Bench had held
                            that when a person is told to discharge the function and
                            duties of a higher post till the same is filled up and he works
                            for years together as in that case the Deputy Superintendent
                            was made to work as Superintendent for more than 7 years,
                            it would be unjust to deny him wages in the said post. The
                            Tribunal categorically noted the plea of the respondents that
                            they are performing the higher duties for long years for want
                            of a regular promotion on officiating basis, and having
                            discharged the duties of higher post by resorting to what is
                            referred by the Tribunal as the „quantum of proportion rule‟,
                            held that they are entitled for emoluments of the higher post.
                            The mention of „quantum of proportion rule‟ appears to be a
                            typing error. What the Tribunal intended to say was
                            „quantum meruit rule‟.

                                                           ***

                            19. The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued the
                            matter on the premise that the respondents are claiming to
                            be appointed to the post of Garden Chaudharies without
                            having qualifications as contemplated under the recruitment
                            rules. No doubt on account of having worked as Garden
                            Chaudharies on ad hoc basis for a number of years, the
                            respondents may not be entitled to be appointed to the post
                            of Garden Chaudharies contraiy to the recruitment rules,
                            however, perusal of their petition which was filed in the
                            High Court which was later on transferred to the Central
                            Administrative Tribunal whose order is impugned by the
                            petitioner, reveals that what the respondents are demanding
                            is only that the petitioner should pay the difference of wages
                            of Malies/Chowkidars and that of Garden Chaudhary from
                            the date the respondents have been performing the duties
                            and responsibilities of Garden Chaudharies.

                                                           ***

                            22. Apparently the petitioner misconstrued the claim of the
                            respondents who were not seeking promotion to the post of
                            Garden Chaudharies but are only claiming difference in pay
                            of Mali/Chowkidar and Garden Chaudharies as they had
                            been performing the work of Garden Chaudharies after the

                             Deputy Director Horticulture directed them to perform the
                            said work which was also intimated to headquarter
                            Horticulture without any objection either from the
                            Horticulture department or any other competent authority at
                            any time. This is also not the plea of the petitioner that
                            Headquarter of Horticulture Department and alleged
                            competent authority was not aware of work of Garden
                            Chaudharies being taken from Malies/Chowkidars as
                            sufficient number of posts of Garden Chaudharies were not
                            filled and all the posts according to accepted norms were not
                            created.



                            23. While seeking the review of order dated 29th January,
                            2010 it was rather pleaded that the Mali/Chowkidars are not
                            entitled for difference in pay for performing the duties of
                            Garden Chaudharies pursuant to the directions of the
                            Assistant Director (Horticulture) as it was adjudicated in
                            Civil writ petition Nos. 7869/2002, 8679/2005, 13288-
                            91/2005 and 12025/2006. Before this Court the copies of
                            these orders have not been produced by the learned counsel
                            for the petitioner. This is, however, clear that the facts and
                            circumstances in those writ petitions were different as
                            apparently in those cases Assistant Director (Horticulture)
                            had asked the malies/chowkidars to perform the duties of
                            Garden Chaudharies in contradiction to the present case
                            where the Deputy Director (Horticulture) has asked the
                            respondents to perform the duties of Garden Chaudharies
                            and the details of these persons and the dates from which
                            they have been performing was duly intimated to the
                            Horticulture headquarter without any objection of any type
                            either by the Horticulture headquarter or from the petitioner
                            in any manner. If the Deputy Director and other officials had
                            been asking the malies/chowkidars to perform the duties of
                            Garden Chaudharies contrary to any directions or rules,
                            action should have been proposed or taken by the petitioner
                            against them. This is also apparent that the work of Garden
                            Chaudhary has been available as the post of Garden

                            Malies/Chowkidars have not been filled.



 
24. The Tribunal while dismissing the application for review
                            of the petitioner by order dated 7th October, 2010 has held
                            that the Deputy Director (Horticulture) is the competent
                            authority relying on the decision of the Apex Court in 
State
                            of West Bengal v. Kamal Sen Gupta
(2008) 2 SCC (L&S)


                            735.


 
25. The learned counsel for the petitioner has not produced
                            any guidelines, circulars to show that if the work is available
                            and the Garden Chaudharies are not appointed, then who is
                            competent to appoint Malies/Chowkidars on ad hoc basis as
                            Garden Chaudharies and to take from them the work of
                            Garden Chaudharies. If on account of exigencies of the work
                            the head of the department asks Malies/Chowkidars to do the
                            work of Garden Chaudharies which is now admitted by the
                            petitioner in the present writ petition impugning the order of
                            the Tribunal then why the difference of pay of
                            Mali/chowkidar and Garden Chaudhary be not be paid to
                            them, has not been satisfactorily explained by the petitioner.
                            Applying the principle of quantum meruit as was held by the
                            Supreme Court in case of 
Selvaraj
 (Supra) the petitioner has
                            to pay to the respondents emoluments available in the higher
                            pay scale during the time they actually worked on the post of
                            Garden Chaudhary in the facts and circumstances.

                            In Selvarai v. Lt. Government of Island, Port Blair, (1998) 4
                            SCC 291, the employee was not regularly promoted to the
                            post of Secretary (scouts) but he was regularly asked to look
                            after the duties of Secretary (scouts). Applying the principle
                            of quantum meruit it was held by the Supreme Court that the
                            authorities should have paid to the employee the emoluments
                            available in the higher pay scale during the time he actually
                            worked on the said post of Secretary (Scouts) though in an

                            the basis of stop-gap arrangement, he would not claim any
                            benefit pertaining to that post. It was held that the
                            Government in its capacity as a model employer cannot be
                            permitted to raise such an argument, and the undertaking
                            which is said to constitute an agreement between the parties
                            cannot be enforced at law. An agreement that if a person is
                            promoted to the higher post or put to officiate on that post
                            or, as in the instant case, a stop-gap arrangement is made to
                            place him on the higher post, he would not claim higher
                            salary or other attendant benefits would be contrary to law
                            and also against public policy. It would, therefore, be
                            unenforceable in view of 
Section 23
 of the Contract Act,
                            1872.
 In W.P(C) No. 5742/2010, decided on 25th August,
                            2010, GNCT of Delhi v. B.S. Jarial another Division Bench
                            had held that when a person is told to discharge the function
                            and duties of a higher post till the same is filled up and he
                            works for years together as in that case the Deputy
                            Superintendent was made to work as Superintendent for
                            more than 7 years, it would be unjust to deny him wages for
                            the said post. The Division Bench had held that if an
                            employee is directed to work on a higher post he has no
                            option but to work at higher post at the dictate of the
                            employer, as for his not so doing would attract penalty
                            proceedings against him. In Sh. Bhagwan Dassv. State of
                            Haryana, 1987 (3) SLJ 93 it was observed by the Supreme
                            Court that whether the appointment was for temporary
                            period or the scheme was temporary in nature is not relevant
                            and what is to be seen is that once it is established that the
                            nature of duties and functions discharged and the work done
                            in similar, the doctrine of equal pay for equal work would be
                            attracted. The employee in this case had been posted to
                            officiate as Sub Post Master in HSG-I at the post office and
                            he shouldered the higher responsibilities of the department
                            and, therefore, he became entitled for emoluments of the post
                            of HSG-I for those periods and he could not be denied those
                            emoluments.

                            terms of his employment having been changed during the
                            tenure of general dispute between the employer MCD and
                            the Chowkidar, Beldar, Bullockmen, Bhishties, Coolies,
                            Machinemen, Hedgemen, Garden Chaudhary etc. employed
                            with it. It was asserted by the workman that term of his
                            employment had been changed by his transfer from
                            Shahdara zone where he was working to the Headquarters
                            (Horticulture Department). In these circumstances the
                            reference was made „Whether the workman was entitled to
                            wage of Garden Chaudhary for the period 3rd December,
                            1988. The Tribunal had held that the workman though was
                            not entitled to the relief of regularization on the post of mali
                            with effect from 1st March, 1978, however, he was held
                            entitled to wages equal to regular malies with effect from 1st
                            March, 1978 till the date of his regularization up to 31st
                            March, 1998 without any increment. It was also held that the
                            workman shall be entitled to receive wages of regular
                            Garden Chaudharies in proper pay scale.
 
The learned Single
                            Judge relying on W.P(C) No. 4023/1997 titled 
Municipal
                            Corporation of Delhi v. Jaedish Chander
 where it was held
                            that proper procedure has to be followed for promotion to
                            the post of Garden Chaudhary had set aside the award
                            holding that the workman was entitled for emoluments as of
                            mali only as he was asked to work as Garden Chaudhary by
                            the Assistant Director who was not authorized to do so.
                            Apparently the case relied on by the petitioner is
                            distinguishable as the respondents are not claiming regular
                            appointment to the post of Garden Chaudhary. The
                            respondents are claiming difference in wages as they were

                             directed to perform the work of Garden Chaudharies by the
                            Deputy Director (Horticulture) and the details of
                            respondents who had been directed to work as Garden
                            Chaudharies and the tenure during which they worked as
                            Garden Chaudharies, were sent to the Horticulture
                            headquarter and Municipal Corporation of Delhi without
                            any objection or action on the part of petitioner. In the case
                            of respondents it is also apparent that the work of Garden
                            Chaudharies was available.
 
In the circumstances, on the
                            basis of ratio of 
Sh. Bhanwan Singh
 (Supra) it cannot be
                            held that the respondents are not entitled for difference in
                            wages.




                            27. In Mohd. Swaleh (Supra) it was held by the Supreme
                            Court that a Deputy Registrar of Central Administrative
                            Tribunal who was ordered by the Vice Chairman to
                            discharge the function of the Registrar would not be entitled
                            for emoluments of the Registrar as the Vice Chairman did
                            not have the power to appoint another Government servant,
                            permanently to the said post, as the appointing authority was
                            the President of India. It was held that in absence of any
                            delegation of power in respect of Group „A‟ post, Vice
                            Chairman was not empowered to make the appointment of
                            the Registrar. In contradistinction in case of respondents it
                            has been held that the Deputy Director could take the work
                            of Garden Chaudharies from the malies/chowkidars which is
                            Group "D" post workman and this fact was not objected to
                            either by the petitioner at any time nor by the Horticulture
                            headquarter. If the action of the Deputy Director or the
                            headquarter Horticulture was illegal then the petitioner
                            should have taken some action against some of the officials
                            or at least should have objected about taking the work of
                            Garden Chaudharies from malies and chowkidars for years
                            together. In the circumstances, apparently the ratio of the
                            cases relied on by the petitioner would not entitle it for any
                            relief to decline the difference in wages to the respondent
                            during the period they worked as Garden Chaudharies

                             which is left for determination by the petitioner after
                            consideration of evidence produced by the respondents.



                            28. Considering the entire facts and circumstances it is
                            apparent that the claim of the respondents have always been
                            that they should be paid the difference in pay of
                            Mali/Chowkidar and the Garden Chaudhary as they were
                            made to work on the post of Garden Chaudhary whereas the
                            petitioner had first denied that they worked as Garden
                            Chaudharies, then took the plea that the Assistant Director
                            (Horticulture) was not competent to ask the respondents to
                            work as Garden Chaudharies and that the respondents
                            cannot be appointed to the post of Garden Chaudharies in
                            accordance with the recruitment rules. There is no doubt
                            that respondents are not claiming appointment to the post of
                            Garden Chaudharies on account of having worked on ad-
                            hoc basis on the post of Garden Chaudhary contrary to rules
                            or that some of them not having the requisite qualifications
                            are entitled for relaxation.



                            29. In the entirety of facts and circumstances therefore, the
                            learned counsel for the petitioner has failed to make out any
                            such grounds which will impel this Court to exercise its
                            jurisdiction under 
Article 226
 of the Constitution to set aside
                            the orders of the Tribunal dated 29th January, 2010 and 7th
                            October, 2010 as no illegality or un-sustainability or
                            perversity in the orders of the Tribunal has been made out.



                            30. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed. Parties are left
                            to bear their own cost..."



                      89.   Upon perusal of the above stated judgment, it is observed that the
                      issue before the Division Bench of this Court was to decide regularization
                      and payment of arrears to certain employees of the MCD.

                      90.   Similar to the issues in the present case, the employees in question
                      before the Division Bench were initially appointed to positions like Mali

                       or Chowkidar within the MCD. Over time, due to operational needs or
                      administrative decisions, these employees were directed to perform duties
                      that were traditionally assigned to a higher position, such as Garden
                      Chaudhary. This resulted in them performing duties of a higher post
                      without receiving the corresponding pay scale.

                      91.   While deciding the issue, the Division Bench emphasized that the
                      mere fact of performing duties of a higher post does not automatically
                      entitle an employee to regularization. Regularization can only be granted
                      in accordance with the recruitment rules governing such appointments. It
                      must be based on the existence of sanctioned posts, recruitment rules, and
                      the fulfillment of other statutory requirements.

                      92.   The Division Bench also held that the employees who had been
                      directed to perform duties of a higher post, even if on an ad hoc or
                      temporary basis, are entitled to receive arrears for the period during
                      which they performed those duties. This decision was based on the
                      principle that if employees are asked to perform work of a higher grade,
                      they should receive remuneration commensurate with the duties
                      performed.

                      93.   The Division Bench applied the principle of „equal pay for equal
                      work‟ in the said case and held that the employees who were performing
                      duties equivalent to those of regular employees in higher posts should
                      receive pay and benefits equivalent to the pay scale of those higher posts.

 
94.   At this juncture, this Court deems is appropriate to refer to the
                      judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in 
State of U.P. v. Arvind

 wherein the Hon‟ble Court discussed the principle of
                      extending the benefit of a judgment in rem. Relevant paragraphs are as
                      under:


 
"...8. The moot question which requires determination is as
                                to whether in the given case, approach of the Tribunal and
                                the High Court was correct in extending the benefit of
                                earlier judgment of the Tribunal, which had attained finality
                                as it was affirmed till the Supreme Court. Whereas the
                                appellants contend that the respondents herein did not
                                approach the court in time and were fence-sitters and,
                                therefore, not entitled to the benefit of 
the said judgment
 by
                                approaching the judicial forum belatedly. They also plead
                                some distinguishing features on the basis of which it is
                                contended that the case of the respondents herein is not on a
                                par with the matter which was dealt with by the Tribunal in
                                which order dated 22-6-1987 was passed giving benefit to
                                those candidates who had approached the court at that time.
                                On the other hand, the respondents claim that their case is
                                identical to those who had filed the application before the
                                Tribunal inasmuch as appointments of the respondents were
                                also cancelled by the same order dated 22-6-1987 and,
                                therefore, there is no reason to deny the same treatment
                                which was meted out to the said persons, as denial thereof
                                would amount to invidious discrimination which is anathema
                                to the right of equality enshrined under 
Article 14
 of the
                                Constitution of India.




                                9. It is of interest to note that both the sides, in support of
                                their respective submissions, have referred to certain
                                judgments and the reading whereof would demonstrate that
                                in certain cases benefit of a particular judicial
                                pronouncement is extended to those who are identically
                                situated on the principle of equality. On the other hand,
                                there is a line of judgments denying such a benefit to the
                                second group which approaches the court afterwards, even

                             when the said second group is similarly situated as the
                            persons belonging to the first group. However, there is no
                            conflict between the two sets of cases. In order to find out the
                            principles laid down on the basis of which benefit of the
                            earlier judgment is extended to those coming subsequently
                            and the situations where such benefit is denied, we will have
                            to undertake a journey into these details and lay down clear
                            parameters.

                                                         ***
                            22.1. The normal rule is that when a particular set of
                            employees is given relief by the court, all other identically
                            situated persons need to be treated alike by extending that
                            benefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination and
                            would be violative of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution of India.
                            This principle needs to be applied in service matters more
                            emphatically as the service jurisprudence evolved by this
                            Court from time to time postulates that all similarly situated
                            persons should be treated similarly. Therefore, the normal
                            rule would be that merely because other similarly situated
                            persons did not approach the Court earlier, they are not to
                            be treated differently.



                            22.2. However, this principle is subject to well-recognised
                            exceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as
                            acquiescence. Those persons who did not challenge the
                            wrongful action in their cases and acquiesced into the same
                            and woke up after long delay only because of the reason that
                            their counterparts who had approached the court earlier in
                            time succeeded in their efforts, then such employees cannot
                            claim that the benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of
                            similarly situated persons be extended to them. They would
                            be treated as fence-sitters and laches and delays, and/or the
                            acquiescence, would be a valid ground to dismiss their
                            claim.



 
22.3. However, this exception may not apply in those cases
                            where the judgment pronounced by the court was judgment

                            situated persons. Such a situation can occur when the
                            subject-matter of the decision touches upon the policy
                            matters, like scheme of regularisation and the like (see 
K.C.
                            Sharma v. Union of India [K.C. Sharma
 v. Union of India,

                            benefit of 
the said judgment
 extended to them shall have to
                            satisfy that their petition does not suffer from either laches
                            and delays or acquiescence..."




                      95.   A bare reading of the above extracts states that the Hon‟ble
                      Supreme Court reiterated that a judgment in rem, which is a judgment
                      concerning the status of parties or determining the rights of the public or
                      a class of persons, applies to everyone who falls within its scope.
                      Therefore, the benefit of such a judgment extends to all similarly situated
                      individuals, even if they were not parties to the original case.

                      96.   The Hon‟ble Supreme Court further specifically emphasized that if
                      a judgment in rem grants benefits or rights to a particular class of
                      employees (such as ad hoc employees seeking regularization), those
                      benefits or rights should be extended to all similarly situated individuals
                      across the board. This principle ensures that the benefits of judicial
                      decisions are applied universally and fairly, promoting consistency and
                      equality before the law.

                       97.   
In essence, 
Anand Kumar Srivastava
 (Supra) emphasized that
                      judgments in rem have broad applicability and their benefits should not
                      be confined only to the parties involved in the specific case but should
                      extend to all who are similarly affected or situated.


                      98.    
In terms of the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in
                      
Sultan Singh
 (Supra), this Court vehemently deprecates the stand taken
                      by the petitioner department that the respondent workman was not
                      possessing requisite qualifications or has not qualified the trade test etc. It
                      is clarified that since the workman was discharging the duties of the post
                      of Garden Chaudhary, as such, the workman is entitled for the pay scale
                      of Garden Chaudhary and competent authority need not look into
                      anything else except the fact that the workman had worked as a
                      Chaudhary in an officiating capacity in so far as the question of grant of
                      pay against the said post is concerned.


 
99.   Therefore, extending the observations made by the Division Bench
                      of this Court in 
Sultan Singh
 (Supra) in terms of the judgment titled
                      
Anand Kumar Srivastava
 (Supra), this Court is of the considered view
                      that although the respondent workman is not entitled to the post of
                      Garden Chaudhary w.e.f. 1st April, 1991 in light of the observations made
                      in issue no. 1, however, he is duly entitled to the pay scale attached to the
                      said post for the period for which he performed the duties of Garden
                      Chaudhary in officiating/ad hoc position, as per the order (Ex. WW 1/1)
                      of the Deputy Director (Horticulture). The petitioner department is liable
                      to pay the workman in terms of the prescribed pay scale attached to the
                      post of Garden Chaudhary.


                      100. Accordingly, issue no. 2 stands decided.

                       CONCLUSION

                      101. Taking into account the limited scope of this Court‟s power under
                      
Article 226
 of the Constitution of India, this Court is of the considered
                      view that there is no prima facie error in the impugned award. There is
                      nothing on record to show that the learned Industrial Tribunal has
                      exceeded or usurped its jurisdiction, or acted illegally or in contravention
                      to any law.

                      102. Based on the considerations made in the preceding paragraphs, it is
                      held that an individual workman who has been working in an
                      officiating/ad hoc position and fulfilling the duties of a higher post, by
                      virtue of an order of the concerned department, is indeed entitled to the
                      pay scale associated with that post.

                      103. Upon reading the legal precedents, it is apparent that Courts have
                      upheld such claims based on principles of equity, fairness, and the
                      doctrine of quantum meruit. Therefore, the legal precedent and principles
                      support the entitlement to the corresponding pay scales under such
                      circumstances.

                      104. With regard to the facts of the instant case, it is observed by this
                      Court that the learned Tribunal has provided a detailed discussion in the
                      impugned award which is based on the testimony and evidence presented
                      before it. The findings in the impugned award show that the respondent
                      workman is entitled to the pay scale of Garden Chaudhary for the period
                      (w.e.f. 1st April, 1991) for which he performed the duties of Garden
                      Chaudhary as per the order of the Deputy Director (Horticulture).

                      105. It is held that the petitioner department has failed to make out a
                      case to show that the learned Tribunal has acted in an arbitrary manner or

                       in contravention to the law. The petitioner department had sufficient
                      opportunity to lead evidence and the same is apparent from the impugned
                      award. Taking note of the same, the learned Tribunal has rightly passed
                      the impugned award.

                      106. In light of the foregoing discussions of facts and law, the impugned
                      award dated 29th February, 2016 by the learned Presiding Officer,
                      Industrial Tribunal, Karkardooma Courts, New Delhi in case bearing ID
                      no. 25/13 (238/16) is upheld. In view of the same, the writ petition
                      bearing W.P (C) no. 2990/2017 stands dismissed along with the pending
                      applications, if any.

                      107. With regard to the instant batch, it is noted that the learned
                      Tribunal in the respective writ petitions has given similar findings based
                      upon similar observations wherein, based upon the evidence, examination
                      in chief as well as cross-examination, it was found that the workman‟s
                      name in the respective petition falls under a list which was issued by the
                      Deputy Director (Horticulture) wherein the workmen were directed to
                      work as Officiating/ad hoc Garden Chaudhary.

                      108. Considering the above observations, it is held that in the instant
                      batch of petitions, the petitioner department has failed to put forth any
                      propositions to make out a case in its favour.

                      109. In view of the foregoing paragraphs, this Court does not find any
                      merit in the instant batch of petitions and is of the view that there is no
                      illegality in the findings as recorded by the learned Tribunal. Therefore,
                      the impugned award in each of the connected petitions is upheld by this
                      Court.

                       110. It is made clear that the above said decision is particularly based on
                      the observations of the learned Tribunal wherein it was noted that the
                      workman‟s name falls within the list issued by the petitioner department.
                      In case, any of the workman in any of the writ petitions do not fall under
                      the list, the same would imply that the said workman was not
                      directed/authorized to perform the duties of the Garden Chaudhary and in
                      the said instance, the said workman would not be entitled to the pay scale
                      of Garden Chaudhary, as claimed by him.

                      111. Accordingly, the instant batch of petitions stand dismissed.

                      112. Pending applications, if any, also stand dismissed.

                      113.   In view of the abovesaid findings, the petitioner department is
                      directed to pay the dues as awarded by the learned Industrial Tribunal to
                      the respective workman within a period of three months.
