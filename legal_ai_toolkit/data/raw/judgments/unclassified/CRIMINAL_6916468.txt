                         shop of their house to purchase chocolates. As there was delay

                         of the deceased in returning home, at about 3.00 p.m., P.W.7

                         and others searched for the deceased but failed to trace her out.

                         Khairuddin in an unconscious state and immediately they shifted

                         her to Tendakuda Primary Health Centre, but the doctor advised

                         them to take the deceased to S.C.B. Medical College and

                         Hospital, Cuttack (hereafter 'S.C.B.M.C.H, Cuttack'). On being

                         asked, the doctor told them that somebody had throttled her

                         neck after committing rape on her. While being shifted to

                         S.C.B.M.C.H, Cuttack, on the way the deceased died and

                         her away by lifting her in arms while they were returning home

                         after purchasing chocolates. P.W.7 suspected that both the

                         appellants       after   committing   rape   on   the   deceased   had

                         strangulated her to death.

                         Defence Plea:

                         5.               The defence plea of the appellants is one of denial of

                         occurrence and of false implication. No witness was examined on

                         behalf of the defence nor any document was exhibited.

                         Findings of the Trial Court:

                         6.               The learned trial Court taking into account the

                         evidence of P.Ws.1, 2, 7, 15, 21 & 25 coupled with the inquest

                         report (Ext.1) and post mortem examination report (Ext.19)

                         finding came to hold that the prosecution has established that

                         the death of the deceased was a homicidal one. It was further

                         held that there are no eye witnesses to the occurrence and the

                         case is based on circumstantial evidence. The learned trial Court

                         jotted down the following six circumstances emerging from the

                         records, which are as follows:-

                                          (i)    The deceased was last seen with the
                                          appellants;

                                          (ii)   The appellants were seen taking liquor in
                                          the verandah of the house of one Manu Mian and
                                          gossiping among themselves on 21.08.2014 at
                                          about 12.00 p.m. to 12.30 p.m.;

                                          (iii) The     appellants   were   found   trembling,
                                          worried and nervous near the house of Sk.
                                          Khairuddin;



                                                                                      Page 23 of 106

                                          (iv) Leaving     the   village   Manu   Mahala   the
                                          appellant Sk. Asif Alli, accused Sk. Abid Alli and
                                          Sk. Abdul Karim Alli in a Hero Honda Activa
                                          scooty at about 6.00 p.m. on 21.08.2014;

                                          (v)   Detection of finger print of right index
                                          finger of appellant Sk. Asif Alli by State Finger
                                          Print Bureau from the Aska 40 bottle recovered
                                          from the spot;

                                          (vi) Conduct of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli and
                                          Sk. Abid Alli in absconding from the village.

                                          So far as the circumstance no.(i) is concerned, the

                         learned trial Court taking into account the evidence of P.W.17,

                         held that there is nothing to disbelieve in his evidence that

                         appellant Sk. Akil Alli gagged the mouth of the deceased and

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted her and they took her. It was further

                         held that after the appellants took the deceased as per the

                         evidence of P.W.17, nobody had seen the deceased till she was

                         recovered from the Taza of the abandoned house of Sk.

                         Khairuddin in a senseless and seriously injured condition and she

                         succumbed to her injuries prior to 8 p.m. and in absence of any

                         explanation from the appellants, it can safely be concluded that

                         they were the authors of the crime.

                                          So far as the circumstance no.(ii) is concerned, the

                         learned trial Court came to hold that the evidence of P.W.6 and


                                                                                      Page 24 of 106

                         P.W.23 that they had seen the accused persons taking liquor in

                         the varandah of the house of Manu Mian at about 12 p.m. or

                         12.30 p.m. might be a circumstance against the accused

                         persons, but it cannot be safely concluded that all the accused

                         persons were the authors of the crime and it is not sufficient to

                         connect accused Sk. Abid Alli that he was also involved in the

                         crime as possibility cannot be ruled out that he might have left

                         the company of appellants Sk. Asif Alli and Sk. Akil Alli after

                         taking liquor in the varandah of the house of Manu Mian.

                                          So far as the circumstance no.(iii) is concerned, the

                         learned trial Court held that the evidence of P.W.5 that he had

                         seen the appellants standing near the house of Sk. Khairuddin is

                         a circumstance to connect the appellants with the crime. Since

                         they were planning to lift the victim on the way of her return,

                         they might be worried and nervous.

                                          So far as the circumstance no.(iv) is concerned, the

                         learned trial Court held that mere evidence of P.W.1 that the

                         accused Sk. Abid Alli was seen going towards village Kolta in a

                         Hero Honda Activa scooty along with appellant Sk. Asif Alli and

                         Sk. Karim Alli is not sufficient to hold that accused Sk. Abid Alli is

                         also responsible for the crime along with the appellants and it




                                                                                   Page 25 of 106

                         cannot be safely concluded that the accused Sk. Abid Alli is also

                         involved in the crime.

                                          So far as the circumstance no.(v) is concerned, the

                         learned trial Court held that detection of right index finger print

                         of appellant Sk. Asif Alli on Aska 40 liquor bottle recovered from

                         the spot clearly proved his presence at the spot i.e. in the house

                         of Sk. Khairuddin and his involvement in the alleged crime

                         against the victim.

                                          So far as the circumstance no.(vi) is concerned, the

                         learned trial Court held that absconding of appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         from 21.08.2014 to 05.09.2014 is a strong circumstance against

                         him which completes the chain against him to hold that he is one

                         of the authors of crime along with appellant Sk. Akil Alli.

                         However, it was held that the absconding of Sk. Abid Alli from

                         21.08.2014 to 05.09.2014 cannot be regarded as a strong

                         circumstance against him in the absence of any other substantial

                         circumstance to complete the chain of circumstances to hold that

                         he was one of the authors of the crime.

                                          The learned trial Court held that the prosecution has

                         successfully established the circumstances against the appellants

                         and the chain of evidence is so complete as not to leave any

                         reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with their


                                                                                  Page 26 of 106

                         innocence and the facts so established against them are

                         consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the appellants and

                         in all human probability, they had committed the ghastly act and

                         responsible for the crime against the deceased. However, it was

                         held that the prosecution has failed to prove the chain of

                         circumstances against the accused Sk. Abid Alli to hold him as

                         one of the authors of the crime. Taking into account the evidence

                         of the doctor (P.W.25) and the post mortem report (Ext.19)

                         findings so also the chemical examination report (Ext.25) and

                         the ocular evidence of the witnesses (P.Ws.1, 2, 3, 4, 7 & 15)

                         and also the evidence of the doctor (P.W.21) who examined the

                         deceased first in a senseless condition, the learned trial Court

                         held that all the circumstances taken together made it clear that

                         the appellants had committed rape on the deceased who was

                         under twelve years of age and that the deceased was subjected

                         to gang rape. Accordingly, while acquitting the accused Sk. Abid

                         Alli of all the charges, found the appellants guilty under 
sections

                         302
/
376-A
/
376-D
 of the I.P.C. and 
section 6
 of POCSO Act.

                                          The learned trial Court after holding the appellants

                         guilty under various offences, on the very day also heard on the

                         question of sentence and came to hold that the appellants

                         ravished the deceased who was a minor girl aged about six years


                                                                                  Page 27 of 106

                         and the offences are serious and heinous in nature and against

                         the norms of a healthy society and it revealed a dirty and

                         perverted mind of human beings who had no control over their

                         carnal desires. The number of injuries found on the deceased

                         showed that she was mercilessly ravished and killed to satisfy

                         their carnal desire. Taking into account the criminal antecedents

                         of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli, it was held that after being released

                         on bail on 20.08.2014 in a case under 
section 307
 of I.P.C., he

                         committed the offences in the present case on 21.08.2014 and

                         thus there is no chance of his reformation. It was further held

                         that the appellants had taken away the deceased, who was a

                         minor girl aged about six years, with deliberate intention in order

                         to commit rape and murder and therefore, it comes within the

                         category of rarest of rare case warranting capital punishment to

                         meet the ends of justice.

                         Submission of parties:

                         7.               Sk. Zafarulla, learned counsel for the appellants

                         argued that out of six circumstances jotted down by the learned

                         trial Court, circumstances nos. (iv), (v) and (vi) are not

                         applicable for the appellant Sk. Akil Alli and circumstances nos.

                         evidence as adduced by P.W.17, it would be too risky to convict

                         the appellant Sk. Akil Alli under any of the offences charged.

                         According to him, the sole witness P.W.17 who deposed about

                         the last seen being a child witness, cannot be relied upon as he

                         has exaggerated his version by naming two accused persons for

                         the first time in Court which shows that he had been tutored to

                         speak such names. Though P.W.17 stated that he had disclosed

                         about the appellants taking away the deceased before his mother

                         but the prosecution did not choose to examine the mother of

                         P.W.17. Similarly P.W.17 stated that he had disclosed also

                         before his tuition Miss (P.W.26) but she has also not supported

                         the prosecution case, for which she has been declared hostile. He

                         placed reliance in the case of Bhagwan Singh & others -Vrs.-

                         State of M.P. reported in (2003) 3 Supreme Court Cases

                         21 wherein it is held that evidence of child is required to be

                         evaluated carefully because he is an easy prey to tutoring.

                                          The learned counsel further argued that the second

                         circumstance that the appellants were seen taking liquor on the

                         verandah of the house of one Manu Mian and gossiping among

                         themselves on the date of occurrence at about 12 p.m. to 12.30

                         p.m. along with accused Sk. Abid Alli (acquitted) and Sk. Abdul

                         Karim Alli (absconder) which was two hours before the time of


                                                                                Page 29 of 106

                         occurrence as deposed to by P.W.6 and P.W.23 cannot be itself a

                         clinching evidence, particularly when as per the evidence of

                         P.W.6, the accused persons used to take liquor in the verandah

                         of Manu Mian regularly.

                                          The learned counsel further argued that so far as the

                         third     circumstance     regarding   the   appellants   were   found

                         trembling, worried and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin

                         is concerned, the finding of the learned trial Court that both the

                         appellants were planning to lift the deceased on the way of her

                         return for which they might be looking worried and nervous is

                         totally a hypothetical finding, which cannot be construed as a

                         conclusive circumstance.

                                          It is argued that so far as the fourth circumstance is

                         concerned, the evidence of P.W.1 that he along with 40-50

                         persons were in the field of Akhandalmani when he found the

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli, accused Sk. Abid Alli (acquitted) and Sk.

                         Abdul Karim Alli (absconding) to be going towards village Kolta in

                         a red colour Activa is not supported by any other witnesses. The

                         evidence of P.W.1 indicates that after seeing the accused

                         persons going towards village Kolta, he came to know about the

                         missing of the deceased and also came to the house of Sk.

                         Khairuddin where the body of the deceased was detected lying in


                                                                                   Page 30 of 106

                         a naked condition with injuries and since he was the relative

                         brother of the father of the deceased so also the husband of the

                         informant, it was expected of him to disclose about what he had

                         seen before them at least after P.W.17 stated about the

                         appellants lifted away the deceased while she was returning

                         purchasing chocolates and therefore, it is very difficult to accept

                         the evidence of P.W.1 and utilise this circumstance against the

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli.

                                          The learned counsel argued that so far as the fifth

                         circumstance i.e. the detection of finger print of right index

                         finger of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli from Aska 40 bottle recovered

                         from the spot is concerned, the two seizure witnesses i.e., P.W.6

                         & P.W.24 have not specifically stated regarding the seizure of

                         Aska 40 bottle. Similarly, though the evidence of the I.O.

                         (P.W.27) is that there was collection of chance finger prints from

                         Aska 40 bottles by the Scientific Officer which were developed

                         with white powder and marked as Exts.A, B & B-1, but the

                         concerned Scientific Officer was not examined during trial. It is

                         argued that the finger print expert who prepared the report has

                         not been examined but the report has been simply marked as

                         Ext.26 by the I.O. (P.W.27). Even the Aska 40 bottles in which

                         three chance finger prints were detected and it was developed,


                                                                                 Page 31 of 106

                         were not produced in Court during trial to be marked as M.O. It

                         is further argued that as per the finger print examination report

                         marked as Ext.26, the chance prints marked as 'A & B-1' said to

                         have been detected on different Aska 40 bottles were found to

                         be partial, faint, smudged and devoid of required number of

                         clear ridge details for comparison and opinion and for such

                         reason, no definite opinion could be furnished in respect of

                         chance prints marked as 'A & B-1', however only chance print

                         marked as 'B' said to have been detected on Aska 40 liquor

                         bottle tallied with specimen print marked 'X' said to be the right

                         index finger print of appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal.

                         Learned counsel argued that the finding as per Ext.26 was not

                         put to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli in his accused statement to

                         afford him an opportunity to explain the same and therefore, it

                         must be completely excluded from consideration and cannot be

                         utilised against him as one of the circumstances.

                                          The learned counsel further argued that the sixth

                         circumstance i.e. the absconding of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         from the village cannot be said to be such a strong circumstance

                         which without the aid of other clinching circumstantial evidence

                         can form a chain so complete to arrive at the conclusion that he

                         is guilty of the offences charged and therefore, it is a fit case


                                                                               Page 32 of 106

                         where benefit of doubt should be extended in favour of the

                         appellants. He further argued relying on the decision of the

                         Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shankar Kisanrao Khade

                         -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in (2013) 55 Orissa

                         Criminal Reports (SC) 623 that in the event the appellants are

                         found guilty, in view of their age, family background and the

                         reports received from different authorities as per the orders of

                         this Court, the death sentence should be commuted to life

                         imprisonment.

                         8.               Mr.   Bibhu   Prasad     Tripathy,   learned     Additional

                         Government         Advocate,   on   the    other   hand   supported       the

                         impugned judgment and argued that the evidence of last seen as

                         deposed to by P.W.17 is very natural and convincing and even

                         though he is a child witness, but the learned trial Court after

                         putting some questions found that he was able to answer the

                         questions rationally and therefore, declared him to be a

                         competent witness. The evidence of P.W.17 having not been

                         shaken in the cross-examination and being corroborated by the

                         evidence of P.Ws.2, 3, 7 & 15 before whom he made disclosure

                         about the occurrence, the learned trial Court has rightly placed

                         reliance on such evidence. Reliance was placed on the decisions

                         of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Panchhi & others


                                                                                         Page 33 of 106

                         -Vrs.- State of U.P. reported in (1998) 7 Supreme Court

                         Cases 177 and State of Madhya Pradesh -Vrs.- Ramesh &

                         another reported in (2011) 4 Supreme Court Cases 786.

                         According to Mr. Tripathy, the last seen evidence adduced by

                         P.W.17 in the factual scenario is very relevant as the place of

                         lifting of the deceased by the appellants was very close to the

                         place from where her body was recovered in a naked condition

                         having injuries and the appellants have failed to explain what

                         they did with the deceased after taking her while she was

                         coming with P.W.17 and when they parted with the company of

                         the deceased. He placed reliance in the case of Ram Gopal

                         -Vrs.- State of Madhya Pradesh reported in (2023) 5

                         Supreme Court Cases 534. Reliance was also placed in the

                         decision         of   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case   of

                         Somasundaram @ Somu -Vrs.- State reported in (2020) 7

                         Supreme Court Cases 722.

                                           The learned counsel for the State further argued that

                         the evidence of the witnesses relating to taking of liquor by the

                         appellants and the other accused persons on the verandah of

                         Manu Mian prior to the occurrence and the trembling, worried

                         and nervous condition of the appellants near the spot house are

                         very clinching and such evidence has not been shattered in the


                                                                                       Page 34 of 106

                         cross-examination. He submitted that the detection of finger

                         print of Sk. Asif Alli from Aska 40 bottle which was seized from

                         the spot has been rightly utilised by the learned trial Court

                         against the said appellant and non-examination of finger print

                         expert and non-production of Aska 40 bottles for marking as

                         M.Os. cannot be a ground to discard such evidence. Reliance was

                         placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of

                         Shri Phool Kumar -Vrs.- Delhi Administration reported in

                         (1975) 1 Supreme Court Cases 797. It is argued that even if

                         no direct questions have been put to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         with regard to matching of one chance finger print from Aska 40

                         bottle recovered at spot marked as 'B' with his specimen finger

                         print marked as 'X', the same cannot be a ground not to utilise it

                         as an incriminating circumstance. Reliance was placed on the

                         decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Paramjit

                         Singh -Vrs.- State of Uttarakhand reported in A.I.R. 2011

                         S.C. 200 and Nar Singh -Vrs.- State of Haryana reported in

                         (2015) 1 Supreme Court Cases 496.

                                          It is argued that the learned trial Court has rightly

                         held the chain of circumstances to be complete pointing towards

                         the guilt of the appellants and therefore, the criminal appeals

                         preferred by the appellants being devoid of merits should be


                                                                                   Page 35 of 106

                         dismissed. He further argued that in view of the age of the

                         deceased, the manner in which she was lifted while coming with

                         her cousin brother (P.W.17) after purchasing chocolates in the

                         broad day light and subsequently found in a naked condition and

                         what had been done with her in a devilish manner as would be

                         evident from the post mortem report finding, the learned trial

                         Court was quite justified in imposing death sentence on the

                         appellants. He placed reliance in the cases of Ravi -Vrs.- State

                         of Maharashtra reported in (2019) 9 Supreme Court Cases

                         622,      Manoharan       -Vrs.-   State   reported   in   (2019)      7

                         Principle for appreciating the case based on circumstantial
                         evidence:

                         9.               There is no dispute that there is no direct evidence

                         as to who committed the rape and murder of the deceased and

                         how. The prosecution case hinges on circumstantial evidence. It

                         is well established rule of criminal justice that fouler the crime,

                         the higher should be the degree of proof. A moral opinion

                         howsoever strong or genuine cannot be a substitute for legal



                                                                                    Page 36 of 106

                         proof. When a case is based on circumstantial evidence, a very

                         careful, cautious and meticulous scrutinisation of the evidence is

                         necessary.

                                          In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarada -Vrs.-

                         State of Maharashtra reported in A.I.R. 1984 S.C. 1622, it

                         is held that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt

                         is to be drawn against an accused should be fully established.

                         The facts so established should be consistent with the hypothesis

                         of the guilt of the accused and they should not be explainable on

                         any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty. The

                         circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency.

                         They should exclude a brief possible hypothesis except the one

                         to be proved. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as

                         not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent

                         with the innocence of the accused and must show in all human

                         probabilities that the act must have been done by the accused.

                         These five golden principles for appreciation of a case based on

                         circumstantial evidence have been named as 'Panchsheel'. In the

                         case of Gambhir -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in

                         A.I.R. 1982 S.C. 1157, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that

                         the circumstantial evidence should not only be consistent with

                         the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his


                                                                              Page 37 of 106

                         innocence. In the case of Jaharlal Das -Vrs.- State of Orissa

                         reported in (1991) 4 Orissa Criminal Reports (SC) 278, the

                         Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it is to be borne in mind as a

                         caution that in cases depending largely upon circumstantial

                         evidence, there is always a danger that the conjecture or

                         suspicion may take the place of legal proof and such suspicion

                         howsoever strong cannot be allowed to take the place of proof.

                         The Court has to be watchful and ensure that conjectures and

                         suspicions do not take the place of legal proof. The Court must

                         satisfy itself that the various circumstances in the chain of

                         evidence should be established clearly and that the completed

                         chain must be such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the

                         innocence of the child.

                                          In the light of legal position about the circumstantial

                         evidence, it is to be examined whether the circumstantial

                         evidence in the instant case satisfies the requirements of law.

                                          The first three circumstances relied upon by the trial

                         Court is common to both the appellants to be discussed first,

                         which are as follows:-

                                          (i)   'Last seen' theory i.e. the appellants and
                                          the deceased were last seen together;




                                                                                    Page 38 of 106

                                          (ii)   Conduct    of    the     appellants       i.e.   the
                                          appellants    were     seen    taking   liquor     in   the
                                          verandah of the house of one Manu Mian and
                                          gossiping among themselves on 21.08.2014 at
                                          about 12.00 p.m. to 12.30 p.m.;

                                          (iii) The     appellants      were   found   trembling,
                                          worried and nervous near the house of Sk.
                                          Khairuddin;

                         First Circumstance : 'Last seen' theory i.e. the appellants

                         and the deceased were last seen together:

                         10.              On this circumstance, the relevant witness is P.W.17,

                         the cousin brother of the deceased. He was aged about seven

                         years when he deposed in Court on 04.02.2016. He stated that

                         the informant (P.W.7) was his aunt and the deceased was his

                         sister and on the date of occurrence, when he along with the

                         deceased was returning after purchasing some chocolates, on

                         the way appellant Sk. Asif Alli asked the deceased as to whose

                         daughter she was, to which the deceased replied that she was

                         the daughter of Taz and then Sk. Akil Alli gagged the mouth of

                         the deceased and the appellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted the deceased

                         and took her away. He further stated that the accused Abid (Sk.

                         Abid Alli) and Karim (Sk. Abdul Karim Alli) were along with the

                         appellants. He stated to have disclosed the fact to his mother,



                                                                                             Page 39 of 106

                         tuition Miss (P.W.26) so also to the informant (P.W.7) and to the

                         police.

                                          Admittedly, the mother of P.W.17 has not been

                         examined and the tuition Miss (P.W.26) has not supported the

                         prosecution case.

                                          Though P.W.17 implicated accused persons Abid and

                         Karim, but it has been confronted to him and proved through the

                         I.O. (P.W.27) that he has not stated in his statement recorded

                         under 
section 161
 of Cr.P.C. that the accused persons Abid and

                         Karim were present when the appellants lifted away the

                         deceased. He further stated to have been to the shop to

                         purchase chocolates with the deceased at about 2.00 p.m. and

                         that they were returning home at about 3.00 p.m. He stated not

                         to have met any known person when they had been to purchase

                         chocolates and were returning home. Thus the implication of

                         accused Abid (Sk. Abid Alli) and Karim (Sk. Abdul Karim Alli) was

                         made by P.W.17 for the first time in Court, which was more than

                         a year and five months after the occurrence.

                                          P.W.7 has stated that when they enquired from

                         P.W.17, he disclosed that while he along with the deceased was

                         returning from the shop after purchasing chocolates, appellant

                         Sk. Akil Alli called the deceased and gagged her mouth and


                                                                               Page 40 of 106

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted her and took her. Thus P.W.17 has

                         not implicated accused Abid and Karim to be in the company of

                         the appellants before P.W.7 and that is how in the first

                         information report (Ext.3) lodged by P.W.7, the names of

                         accused Abid and Karim did not find place. In the F.I.R., P.W.7

                         has mentioned that when she asked P.W.17, he disclosed that

                         while returning home, the appellants lifted away the deceased

                         gagging her mouth.

                                          P.W.2 has also stated that P.W.17 disclosed before

                         them that the appellant Sk. Akil Alli gagged the mouth of the

                         deceased and appellant Sk. Asif Alli lifted her away and thus,

                         P.W.17 has not implicated accused persons Abid and Karim

                         before P.W.2.

                                          Thus, it is apparent that P.W.17 has neither disclosed

                         before P.W.2 and P.W.7 about any role played by the accused

                         persons Abid and Karim nor he has stated before the I.O. in his

                         previous statement about their presence at the spot when the

                         deceased was lifted and taken away by the appellants and for

                         the first time, such a statement has been made by him during

                         trial.




                                                                                   Page 41 of 106

                         Whether P.W.17 was a competent witness to testify?

                         10.1.            P.W.17 is a child witness and aged about seven

                         years. Thus, in view of 
section 118
 of the Evidence Act, it is to

                         be seen whether he was a competent witness to testify.

                                          In the case of P. Ramesh -Vrs.- State reported in

                         (2019) 20 Supreme Court Cases 593, the Hon'ble Supreme

                         Court held that the trial Judge was required to determine as to

                         whether the child witness was in a fit and competent state of

                         mind to depose and was able to understand the purpose for

                         being present on the occasion. Prior to the recording of evidence

                         of a child witness, the trial Court must undertake the exercise of

                         posing relevant questions to determine the capacity of the child

                         witness to provide rational answers. This exercise would allow

                         the Court to determine whether the child has the intellectual and

                         cognitive skills to recollect and narrate the incidents of the crime.

                         
Section      118
    of   the   Evidence   Act,   1872   deals   with   the

                         competence of a person to testify before the Court. 
Section 4
 of

                         the Oaths Act, 1969 requires all witnesses to take oath or

                         affirmation, with an exception for child witnesses under the age

                         of twelve years. Therefore, if the Court is satisfied that the child

                         witness below the age of twelve years is a competent witness,

                         such a witness can be examined without oath or affirmation. It is


                                                                                     Page 42 of 106

                         further held that in order to determine the competency of a child

                         witness, the Judge has to form her or his opinion. The Judge is at

                         the liberty to test the capacity of a child witness and no precise

                         rule can be laid down regarding the degree of intelligence and

                         knowledge which will render the child a competent witness. The

                         competency of a child witness can be ascertained by questioning

                         her/him to find out the capability to understand the occurrence

                         witnessed and to speak the truth before the Court. In criminal

                         proceedings, a person of any age is competent to give evidence

                         if she/he is able to (i) understand questions put as a witness;

                         and (ii) give such answers to the questions that can be

                         understood. A child of tender age can be allowed to testify if

                         she/he has the intellectual capacity to understand questions and

                         give rational answers thereto. A child becomes incompetent only

                         in case the Court considers that the child was unable to

                         understand the questions and answer them in a coherent and

                         comprehensible manner. If the child understands the questions

                         put to her/him and gives rational answers to those questions, it

                         can be taken that she/he is a competent witness to be examined.

                                          Before recording the evidence of P.W.17, the learned

                         trial Judge put some formal questions to him like his name,

                         father's name, name of the school, what was the place where he


                                                                                  Page 43 of 106

                         had come and the purpose in coming to the Court. Since P.W.17

                         answered all the questions correctly, the learned trial Judge

                         noted down that the witness is able to answer the questions

                         rationally and therefore, he is a competent witness. However,

                         oath was not administered to him as he was seven years of age.

                                          No challenge has been made by the learned counsel

                         for the appellants regarding the competency of P.W.17 to

                         depose.

                                          The admissibility of evidence or acceptability of

                         evidence of a child witness is not solely dependent on his

                         competency. It is well settled that a child witness is prone to

                         tutoring and there is every possibility that under influence, such

                         witness might have been posed to give out a version by persons

                         who may have influence on him. Thus, the testimony of a child

                         witness should be evaluated more carefully and only be accepted

                         after greatest caution and circumspection.

                                          In the cross-examination, suggestion has been given

                         to P.W.17 that he was deposing falsehood being tutored by

                         P.W.7 and P.W.15 to which he denied. In the case of Ramesh

                         (supra), it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that deposition

                         of a child witness may require corroboration but in case his

                         deposition inspires the confidence of the Court and there is no


                                                                                 Page 44 of 106

                         embellishment or improvement therein, the Court may rely upon

                         his evidence. The evidence of a child witness must be evaluated

                         more carefully with greater circumspection because he is

                         susceptible to tutoring. Only in case there is evidence on record

                         to show that the child has been tutored, the Court can reject his

                         statement partly or fully. However, an inference as to whether

                         child has been tutored or not, can be drawn from the contents of

                         his deposition. In the case of Panchhi (supra), the Hon'ble

                         Supreme Court held that it is not the law that if a witness is a

                         child, his evidence shall be rejected, even if it is found reliable.

                         The law is that evidence of a child witness must be evaluated

                         more carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is

                         susceptible to be swayed by what others telling and thus a child

                         witness is an easy to prey to tutoring. Courts have laid down

                         that     evidence     of   a   child   witness   must   find   adequate

                         corroboration before it is relied on. It is more of a rule of

                         practical wisdom than law.

                                          The main plank of argument by the learned counsel

                         for the appellants is that there is every possibility of tutoring to

                         him and that is the reason why he implicated two accused

                         persons for the first time in Court i.e. accused Abid and Karim

                         even though he has not implicated them before police so also


                                                                                    Page 45 of 106

                         while making disclosure about the occurrence before P.W.2 and

                         the informant (P.W.7). The question that now crops up for

                         consideration as to whether the evidence of P.W.17 is to be

                         totally rejected as he has implicated two accused persons i.e.

                         Abid and Karim for the first time during trial. The maxim falsus in

                         uno falsus in omnibus i.e. false in one thing false in all is not a

                         sound rule to apply in the condition in our country. It means that

                         if any witness makes a statement which may be incorrect to

                         some extent, it does not inevitably follow that the other portion

                         of his statement, which is correct, has also to be disbelieved. It

                         is very difficult to find a witness whose evidence does not contain

                         a grain of untruth or at any rate exaggeration, embroideries or

                         embellishments. The Courts should make efforts to disengage

                         the truth from falsehood, and to shift the grain from the chaff

                         and where the truth and falsehood are so intermingled so as to

                         make it impossible to separate them, the evidence has to be

                         rejected in entirety. It is a misconception that a witness has to

                         be believed in toto or disbelieved in toto. The Court must

                         appraise the evidence to see as to what extent it is worthy of

                         acceptance and merely because in one respect, the Court

                         considers it insufficient to rely the testimony of a witness, it does

                         not necessarily follow as a matter of fact that it must be


                                                                                 Page 46 of 106

                         discarded in all respect as well. Therefore, implication of two

                         accused persons namely, Abid and Karim for the first time in

                         Court during trial by P.W.17 itself cannot be a ground to

                         disbelieve his evidence rather his evidence is required to be

                         carefully assessed and to see if there is any corroboration to his

                         evidence or not. The possibility of coming to his knowledge

                         regarding the involvement of accused persons namely, Abid and

                         Karim afterwards from other sources cannot be ruled out and

                         therefore, he might have been tempted to speak against them in

                         the witness-box. Bereft of implication of two accused Abid and

                         Karim, nothing has been brought out in the cross-examination to

                         discard his evidence, rather his evidence is very natural, clear,

                         cogent and trustworthy. P.W.7 has stated that the deceased had

                         gone to the shop to purchase chocolate along with P.W.17.

                         P.W.19 has stated that on the date of occurrence at about 2 p.m.

                         to 2.30 p.m. the deceased and P.W.17 had come to his

                         stationery shop for chocolate and took chocolate and went away.

                         The evidence of these two witnesses i.e. P.W.7 and P.W.19 lend

                         corroboration to the evidence of P.W.17 that the latter was with

                         the deceased at the time of occurrence. Thus the presence of

                         P.W.17 with the deceased, his conduct in disclosing before others




                                                                              Page 47 of 106

                         what happened with the deceased is relevant and admissible as

                         res gestae under 
section 6
 of Evidence Act.

                                          In the case of Anjan Kumar Sarma and others

                         -Vrs.- State of Assam reported in (2017) 14 Supreme

                         Court Cases 359, it is held that the circumstance of last seen

                         together cannot by itself form the basis of holding the accused

                         guilty of the offence. In a case where other links have been

                         satisfactorily made out and the circumstance pointed to the guilt

                         of the accused, the circumstance of last seen together and

                         absence of explanation would provide an additional link which

                         completes the chain and in the absence of proof of other

                         circumstances, the only circumstance of last seen together and

                         absence of satisfactory explanation cannot be made the basis of

                         conviction.

                                          In the case of Ram Gopal (supra), it is held that

                         once the theory of 'last seen together' was established by the

                         prosecution, the accused was expected to offer some explanation

                         as to when and under what circumstances he had parted the

                         company of the deceased. It is true that the burden to prove the

                         guilt of the accused is always on the prosecution, however, in

                         view of 
section 106
 of the Evidence Act, when any fact is within

                         the knowledge of any person, the burden on of proving that fact


                                                                               Page 48 of 106

                         is upon whom. Of course, 
section 106
 of the Evidence Act is

                         certainly not intended to relieve the prosecution of its duty to

                         prove the guilt of the accused, nonetheless, it is also equally

                         settled legal position that if the accused does not throw any light

                         upon the facts which are proved to be within the special

                         knowledge, in view of 
section 106
 of the Evidence Act, such

                         failure on the part of the accused may be used against the

                         accused as it may provide an additional link in the chain of

                         circumstances required to be proved against him. In the case

                         based on circumstantial evidence, furnishing or non-furnishing of

                         the explanation by the accused would be a crucial fact, when the

                         theory of last seen together as propounded by the prosecution

                         was proved against him. Though the last seen theory as

                         propounded by the prosecution in a case based on circumstantial

                         evidence may be a weak kind of evidence by itself to base

                         conviction solely on such theory, when the said theory is proved

                         coupled with other circumstances such as the time when the

                         deceased was last seen with the accused and the recovery of the

                         corpse being in very close proximity of time, the accused does

                         owe an explanation under 
section 106
 of the Evidence Act with

                         regard with the circumstances under which death might have

                         taken place. If the accused offers no explanation or furnishes a


                                                                               Page 49 of 106

                         wrong explanation, absconds, motive is established and some

                         other corroborative evidence in the form of recovery of weapon

                         etc.    forming     a   chain   of   circumstance   is   established,   the

                         conviction could be based on such evidence.

                                          In the case of Somasundaram @ Somu (supra),

                         where specific charges under 
sections 347
/
365
/
364
 of the I.P.C.

                         were framed, it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the

                         abduction followed by murder in appropriate cases can enable a

                         Court to presume that the abductor is the murderer. The

                         principle is that after abduction, the abductor would be in a

                         position to explain what happened to his victim and if he failed to

                         do so, it is only natural and logical that an irresistible inference

                         may be drawn that he has done away with the hapless victim.

                         
Section 106
 of the Evidence Act would come to the assistance of

                         the prosecution.

                                          In the case in hand, however, there is neither any

                         charge of abduction nor any charge of illegal confinement. In the

                         accused statement, the learned trial Court has put specific

                         questions to the appellants on the evidence of P.W.17 but except

                         stating that the same was false, nothing further has been stated

                         by the appellants.




                                                                                      Page 50 of 106

                                          Therefore, I am of the humble view that the learned

                         trial Court has rightly placed reliance on the evidence of P.W.17

                         and held that the last seen theory has been established by the

                         prosecution. The evidence of P.W.17 that the appellants and the

                         deceased were last seen together when both of them lifted away

                         the deceased while she was returning with him after purchasing

                         chocolates from the village shop can be used as one of the

                         incriminating circumstance against the appellants as has been

                         rightly done by the learned trial Court, but in my humble view,

                         such circumstance of last seen in itself cannot be held sufficient

                         to record the finding of guilt of the appellants.

                                          Thus the first circumstance i.e. last seen theory even

                         though proved by the prosecution has to be taken into account

                         along with the other circumstances to see whether the chain of

                         evidence has been established clearly and that it forms a

                         completed chain.

                         Second Circumstance: Conduct of the appellants in taking

                         liquor in the verandah of the house of one Manu Mian:

                         11.              The   second   circumstance   relied   upon   by   the

                         prosecution is that on 21.08.2014 at about 12.00 p.m. to 12.30

                         p.m., the appellants were seen taking liquor in the verandah of




                                                                                   Page 51 of 106

                         the house of one Manu Mian and gossiping among them which is

                         being deposed to by P.W.6 and P.W.23.

                                          P.W.6 has stated that on the occurrence day, while

                         he was coming to his village Krushnanandapur, he saw the

                         appellants and the accused persons namely, Sk. Abid and Sk.

                         Karim were taking liquor at about 12.30 noon on the varandah of

                         the house of Manu Mian and they were talking with each other.

                         In the cross-examination, he has stated that the accused

                         persons used to take liquor in the varandah of Manu Mian

                         regularly. P.W.23 has also stated to have seen the appellants

                         and the accused persons namely, Sk. Abid Alli and Sk. Karim Alli

                         taking liquor in the varandah of Manu Mian and gossiping among

                         them on the date of occurrence at about 12 noon.

                                          The time when the appellants and the two other

                         accused persons were seen taking liquor was much before the

                         time     when P.W.17 with the        deceased   came   to purchase

                         chocolates and after purchasing were returning home. P.W.17

                         has stated that he had been to the shop with the deceased to

                         purchase chocolate at about 2 p.m. and was returning at about 3

                         p.m. Similarly P.W.19 has stated that on the date of occurrence

                         at about 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m., the deceased and P.W.17 had

                         come to his stationery shop for purchasing chocolate. As

                                                                                Page 52 of 106

                         deposed to by P.W.6, the appellants and the accused persons

                         namely, Sk. Abid and Sk. Karim used to take liquor in the

                         varandah of Manu Mian regularly. Learned trial Court has held

                         that from this circumstance, it cannot be safely concluded that

                         all the accused persons were the authors of the crime. It was

                         further held that the possibility of accused Sk. Abid Alli leaving

                         the company of the appellants after taking liquor from the

                         varandah of the house of Manu Mian cannot be ruled out.

                                          Thus, the second circumstance i.e. the appellants

                         were seen taking liquor in the verandah of the house of one

                         Manu Mian and gossiping among themselves and the other two

                         accused persons were also with them, as proved by the

                         prosecution is not by itself sufficient to connect the appellants

                         with the crime. It is to be considered along with the other proved

                         circumstances to see whether the chain of evidence is so

                         complete as to unerringly point towards the guilt of the

                         appellants.

                         Third Circumstance : Appellants were found trembling,

                         worried and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin:

                         12.              The third circumstance i.e the appellants were found

                         trembling, worried and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin

                         is concerned, P.W.5 is the sole witness on this circumstance.

                                                                                  Page 53 of 106

                                          P.W.5 has stated that on the date of occurrence at

                         about 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. while he was returning from Masjid

                         after Namaz, he found the appellants near the house of Sk.

                         Khairuddin and they were found trembling, looking worried and

                         nervous and then he went to his house.

                                          The learned trial Court held that since the appellants

                         were planning to lift the victim on the way of her return, they

                         might be worried and nervous. It is nothing but a hypothetical

                         conclusion. There is nothing on record that the deceased and

                         P.W.17 had passed by that way by that time to purchase

                         chocolates from the stationery shop of P.W.19 and that the

                         appellants had seen them. According to P.W.17, he had been to

                         the shop with the deceased to purchase chocolate at about 2

                         p.m. and was returning at about 3 p.m.

                                          The conclusion arrived at should be sensible and

                         reasonable.        It   must   be   based   on   reasons   rather   than

                         imaginations and emotions. P.W.5 stated that he was a close

                         relative of the deceased and the deceased belonged to her

                         family. It is true that related witness is not necessarily a false

                         witness, but when P.W.5 was just passing by that way near the

                         house of Sk. Khairuddin after Namaj in Masjid and there is no

                         evidence how much time he observed both the appellants and


                                                                                    Page 54 of 106

                         found them trembling, looking worried and nervous, even if the

                         evidence of P.W.5 is accepted, it cannot be said with certainty

                         that it was before the lifting of the deceased as held by the

                         learned trial Court. Trembling, looking worried and nervousness

                         can be for a variety of reasons and it cannot be said with

                         certainty that it was only for the reasons assigned by the trial

                         Court. The body of the deceased was located on the Taza of the

                         house of Sk. Khairuddin at about 5.30 p.m. as stated by the

                         informant (P.W.7) and the appellants were found near the house

                         of Sk. Khairuddin at about 2 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. as stated by

                         P.W.5.

                                          Thus, the third circumstance as proved by the

                         prosecution, i.e the appellants were found trembling, worried

                         and nervous near the house of Sk. Khairuddin, in my humble

                         view is not so clinching by itself to arrive at the conclusion as

                         reached by the trial Court or sufficient to connect the appellants

                         with the crime and it is to be considered along with the other

                         proved circumstances.

                         Summed up : Circumstances against the appellant Sk. Akil

                         Alli:-

                         13.              The three circumstances which are appearing against

                         appellant Sk. Akil Alli as discussed above, I am of the humble


                                                                                 Page 55 of 106

                         view     that     though   through     the   evidence   of   P.W.17,      the

                         prosecution has         successfully   proved   that    on   the   date    of

                         occurrence in the afternoon, both the appellants lifted away the

                         deceased while she was returning after purchasing chocolates

                         and thus the appellants and the deceased were last seen

                         together, but such circumstance of last seen coupled with the

                         circumstance that the appellant Sk. Akil Alli was seen taking

                         liquor in the verandah of the house of Manu Mian with appellant

                         Sk. Asif Alli and the other two accused i.e. Sk. Abid Alli and Sk.

                         Abdul Karim Alli so also the circumstance that he along with the

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli was found trembling, worried and nervous

                         near the house of Sk. Khairuddin in the afternoon on the date of

                         occurrence do not form a complete chain to record the finding

                         that it is consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the

                         appellant Sk. Akil Alli and totally inconsistent with his innocence

                         and prove the charges against him beyond all reasonable doubt.

                         The circumstances proved raised an amount of suspicion, but

                         suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot be a substitute for proof of

                         the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

                                          There is no evidence against appellant Sk. Akil Alli

                         that he tried to flee or abscond from his village. He was

                         apprehended by local people and handed over to the I.O.


                                                                                       Page 56 of 106

                         (P.W.27) on the      night   of occurrence. The      appellant was

                         examined by the doctor (P.W.28) at C.H.C., Manijanga on police

                         requisition and he was found capable of committing sexual

                         intercourse and his pubic hair and sample semen were collected

                         by the doctor and kept in sealed vials and handed over to the

                         escorting constable, which in turn were seized by the I.O.

                         (P.W.27), who also seized the wearing apparels of the appellant

                         i.e. blue colour check lungi and one half vest on being produced

                         by him as per seizure list Ext.6. The forwarding report for

                         chemical examination, which was marked as Ext.24, would

                         indicate that the check lungi of the appellant Sk. Akil Alli was

                         marked as Ext.'P', his half vest was marked as Ext.'P-1', pubic

                         hair of the appellant was marked as Ext.'Q' and sample semen of

                         the appellant collected in a sealed bottle was marked as Ext.'Q-

                         1'. The nature of examination sought for so far as these four

                         exhibits, which relate to the appellant Sk. Akil Alli were (i)

                         whether Exts.'P' & 'P-1' contained any blood stain and if so,

                         whether it tallied with Exts.'B', 'E' & 'L' i.e. the wearing apparels

                         of the deceased; (ii) whether Exts.'P' and 'P-1' contained any

                         vaginal swab and if so, whether it tallied with Ext.'M-1' (vaginal

                         swab); (iii) whether any blood stain/seminal stain detected in

                         Ext.'A' i.e. the kantha seized from the spot and did it tally with


                                                                                 Page 57 of 106

                         Ext.'Q-1', (iv) whether the stains detected in Exts.'B' & 'L' i.e.

                         the wearing apparels of the deceased tallied with Ext.'Q-1' and

                         (v) whether Ext.'Q' tallied with any hair detected from Ext.'A'.

                         The chemical examination report (Ext.25) indicates that in

                         Exts.'P' & 'P-1', no blood, no semen and no vaginal secretion

                         stain were noticed and similarly in Ext.'Q', no blood and no

                         semen were noticed. So far as Ext.'Q-1' is concerned, it was

                         found to be deteriorated due to preservation in liquid state.

                         Admittedly, no finger print of the appellant Sk. Akil Alli was

                         found to be tallying with the chance finger prints detected on

                         Aska 40 liquor bottles found at the spot.

                                          Therefore, from the three proved circumstances, it is

                         difficult to sustain the conviction of the appellant Sk. Akil Alli

                         under 
sections 302
/
376-A
/
376-D
 of the I.P.C. and 
section 6
 of

                         the POCSO Act and accordingly, the same is hereby set aside

                         and the appellant is acquitted of all the charges.

                         14.              Before proceeding further to discuss about the

                         remaining three circumstances, which are against Sk. Asif Alli @

                         Md. Asif Iqbal, it would be apt to discuss whether prosecution

                         has proved that the deceased was subjected to rape and she met

                         with a homicidal death.




                                                                                   Page 58 of 106

                         Whether the deceased was subjected to rape and she met

                         with a homicidal death:

                         14.1.            The deceased was first detected on the Taza of the

                         house of Sk. Khairuddin by P.W.3 who found her in a naked

                         condition. P.W.2 stated to have noticed nail marks on the belly

                         and backside and knee of the victim and he also found blood

                         patches on the thigh. P.W.15 has stated that the victim was

                         recovered in a senseless and naked condition and she had

                                          and right side of neck.

                                          On dissection:

                                                   Left side lateral wall of vaginal canal found
                                          torn and lacerated and the margins were found
                                          contused. About 200 fluid blood found within
                                          pelvic cavity. Structures of the neck were found
                                          intact    without   any     extravasations      of blood.
                                          Stomach contained 300 grams partially digested
                                          food particles without emitting any characteristic
                                          odour, mucosa is healthy. All other organs were
                                          intact and pale.

                                          The doctor (P.W.25) has stated in his evidence that

                         external injuries nos.(ii) to (xiii) found on the dead body were

                         ante mortem in nature and might have been caused by hard and

                         blunt trauma or contact with hard and rough surface. He has

                         further      opined        that   external     injury   no.(i)     along     with

                         corresponding internal injuries were ante mortem in nature and

                         consistent with forceful thrusting and could have been caused

                         due to penetration of male organ. As per his opinion, death of

                         the deceased was due to shock and hemorrhage as a result of

                         injuries to genital track which were fatal in ordinary course of


                                                                                            Page 62 of 106

                         nature. According to him, age of injuries were of fresh duration

                         at the time of death, time since death was within 12 to 24 hours

                         prior to autopsy and the death was within 12 to 24 hours prior to

                         autopsy and the death was homicidal in nature. During cross-

                         examination, P.W.25 has clearly denied the suggestion put to

                         him by the learned defence counsel by saying that the injuries

                         on the vagina were not possible by fall on hard surface or by

                         inserting a wooden substance in the vagina.

                                          In view of the oral as well as medical evidence, I am

                         of the humble view that the deceased was subjected to rape and

                         on account of rape, external injuries were caused on different

                         parts of her body including injuries to genital track which were

                         fatal in ordinary course of nature and it also caused shock and

                         hemorrhage which resulted in her death and her death was

                         homicidal in nature. The learned counsel for the appellants has

                         not challenged this aspect though it is his contention that there

                         is insufficient evidence on record to hold the appellants liable for

                         such offences.

                         Remaining three circumstances:

                         15.              The remaining three circumstances which are against

                         the appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif Iqbal are to be discussed

                         now.


                                                                                   Page 63 of 106

                         Fourth Circumstance : Appellant Sk. Asif Alli was found

                         leaving village Manu Mahala on the date of occurrence:

                         16.              The fourth circumstance i.e. the appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         was found leaving village Manu Mahala in a Hero Honda Activa

                         scooty on the date of occurrence i.e. on 21.08.2014 at about 6

                         p.m. with the accused Sk. Abid Alli and Sk. Abdul Karim Alli, has

                         been deposed to by P.W.1 Sk. Wamik Alli who is the sole witness

                         on this circumstance. He has stated that on the date of

                         occurrence in the afternoon, while he along with others were in

                         the field of Akhandalmani, they found the appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         along with accused Sk. Abid Alli (acquitted) and Sk. Karim Alli

                         (absconding) were going towards village Kolta in a red colour

                         Activa. In the cross-examination, P.W.1 has stated that he went

                         to Akhandalmani field at about 4 p.m. and returned to his house

                         at about 5.20 p.m. He further stated that by the time of his

                         arrival at Akhandalmani field, around forty to fifty persons were

                         there. He further stated that he was examined by the police in

                         front of the house of the deceased on the night of occurrence.

                                          It is the contention of the learned counsel for the

                         appellants that even though there are many others present at

                         Akhandalmani field, only P.W.1 was examined to prove this

                         circumstance. Learned counsel for the State submitted that in


                                                                                     Page 64 of 106

                         the matter of appreciation of evidence of witnesses, it is not the

                         number of witnesses but quality of evidence that is important.

                                          Adverting to the contentions raised, law is well

                         settled that 
section 134
 of the Evidence Act does not provide for

                         any particular number of witnesses and it would be permissible

                         for the Court to record a finding regarding any particular aspect

                         of the prosecution case on the evidence of a solitary witness if

                         his evidence is found to be credible, reliable, in tune with the

                         case of the prosecution and inspires implicit confidence. It is not

                         the quantity but quality of evidence adduced by the witness that

                         matters for determining the guilt or innocence of the accused.

                         The testimony of a sole witness must be confidence-inspiring and

                         beyond suspicion, thus, leaving no doubt in the mind of the

                         Court.

                                          The evidence of P.W.1 who is related to the father of

                         the deceased as brother cannot be doubted on the ground of

                         relationship as related witnesses are not necessarily false

                         witnesses. Unless their evidence suffers from serious infirmity or

                         raises considerable doubt in the mind of the Court, it would not

                         be proper to discard their evidence straight away. Evidence of

                         P.W.1 has not been shattered or discredited by the defence in

                         spite of searching cross-examination. He disclosed before police


                                                                                   Page 65 of 106

                         what he had seen when he was examined on the night of

                         occurrence The leaving of village Manu Mahala by the appellant

                         Sk. Asif Alli along with the other two might not have been

                         noticed by others present in Akhandalmani field as they just

                         passed through that way. P.W.4 was present in Akhandalmani

                         field and he was playing football when he came to know about

                         the missing of the deceased but he has not stated about this

                         circumstance. Non-examination of other witnesses to prove the

                         same circumstance is immaterial.

                                          After carefully assessing the evidence of P.W.1, I find

                         him to be a reliable witness and through his evidence, the

                         prosecution has successfully proved the fourth circumstance.

                         Fifth Circumstance : Detection of finger print of appellant

                         Sk. Asif Alli by State Finger Print Bureau from the Aska 40

                         bottle found at the spot:

                         17.              The fifth circumstance relied upon by the prosecution

                         is that the right index finger print of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         was detected by the State Finger Print Bureau from the Aska 40

                         bottle recovered from the spot.

                                          P.W.27, the I.O. has stated that the scientific team

                         of S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh and staff of D.F.S.L., Jagatsinghpur

                         arrived at the spot on 22.08.2014 at 1.30 pm. and inspected the


                                                                                    Page 66 of 106

                         spot and as per seizure list Ext.2, three nos. of Aska 40 bottles

                         along with other articles were seized in presence of witnesses at

                         3.30 p.m. The seizure list Ext.2 though does not specifically

                         indicate seizure of Aska 40 bottles, but it indicates about seizure

                         of three nos. of glass bottles marked as Exts. 'J', 'J/1' and 'J/2'.

                         The I.O. (P.W.27) has further stated that during inspection of

                         spot by the Scientific Officer Chunuram Murmu, State F.S.L.,

                         Rasulgarh,       Bhubaneswar,   three   chance   finger   prints   were

                         detected from the bottles (Aska 40 bottles) by the Finger Print

                         Sub-Inspector, Jagatsinghpur and the chance finger prints were

                         developed with white powder and marked as Exts.'A', 'B' & 'B-1'.

                         Ext.2 also indicates in column no.2 regarding production of

                         different articles by Scientific Officer Chunuram Murmu, State

                         S.F.S.L., Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar before the I.O. and the I.O.

                         has also stated that on 22.08.2014 at about 3.30 p.m. he seized

                         the articles after those were handed over to him by the S.F.S.L.

                         Officer.

                                          P.Ws.6 & 24 are the witnesses to the seizure list

                         Ext.2. P.W.6 while proving his signature in seizure list Ext.2, has

                         stated about seizure of different articles as per the said seizure

                         list. P.W.24 has also stated about the seizure of articles by the

                         I.O. as per seizure list Ext.2 and he has also proved his signature


                                                                                   Page 67 of 106

                         thereon. Learned counsel for the appellants contended that

                         neither P.W.6 nor P.W.24 has specifically stated about the

                         seizure of three nos. of Aska 40 bottles under seizure list Ext.2.

                         Such a contention cannot be attached with any importance since

                         their evidence as seizure witnesses has not been shattered or

                         discredited by the defence rather it is getting corroboration from

                         the evidence of the I.O.

                                          It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellants

                         that during trial, the prosecution has not examined the Scientific

                         Officer Chunuram Murmu or any other officer who assisted him

                         during the spot inspection and detected and developed three

                         chance finger prints from the Aska 40 bottles. The liquor bottles

                         were not produced in Court during trial and the photo images of

                         chance prints marked as A, B and B-1 in a CD along with their

                         photo      enlargements     on    the   basis   of   which    Finger   Print

                         Examination Report (Ext.26) was prepared were also not

                         produced during trial and therefore, no importance is to be

                         attached to the findings recorded by the Director, State Finger

                         Print    Bureau,     Rasulgarh,   Bhubaneswar        in   Ext.26.   Learned

                         counsel for the State on the other hand argued that since spot

                         inspection by the scientific officials is not in dispute which is




                                                                                       Page 68 of 106

                         otherwise proved by oral as well as documentary evidence, non-

                         examination of such officials is immaterial.

                                          The evidence of the I.O. (P.W.27) indicates that on

                         05.09.2014, after he apprehended the appellant Sk. Asif Alli at

                         Bhubaneswar along with accused Sk. Abid Ali (acquitted), they

                         were sent to Medical Officer, C.H.C., Manijanga for necessary

                         medical examination and opinion. The escort party produced the

                         medical examination reports, biological exhibits collected from

                         the appellants in sealed vials which were seized and then the

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli and accused Sk. Abid Ali were arrested on

                         06.09.2014 and forwarded to Court on that very day, which

                         would be evident from the order sheet dated 06.09.2014. The

                         evidence of the I.O. and the case records further indicate that

                         the specimen finger prints of Sk. Asif Alli and other accused

                         persons were collected and the I.O. made requisition to S.P.,

                         Jagatsingpur through FPSI, DFSL, Jagatsinghpur to send the

                         chance finger prints collected from Aska 40 bottles which were

                         transferred to a CD along with specimen ten digit finger print

                         slips of the suspects including the appellant Sk. Asif Alli to the

                         Director, State Finger Print Bureau, Rasulgarh, Bhubaneswar for

                         necessary examination and opinion and accordingly, the same

                         were dispatched through FPSI, Jagatsinghpur and the report

                         (Ext.26)         goes   against   the   appellant   Sk.   Asif    Alli.   Non-

                         examination of Scientific Officer who detected and developed

                         chance finger prints and non-production of Aska 40 bottles in

                         Court during trial cannot be a ground to discard the evidenciary

                         value of Ext.26. No suggestion has been given by the defence to

                         the I.O. that there was no seizure of Aska 40 bottles from the

                         spot. Photo images of chance prints along with their photo

                         enlargements including CD and specimen finger prints are very

                         much available on record and those are part and parcel of

                         Ext.26, which indicates that the chance print marked as Ext.'B'

                         said to have been detected on Aska 40 liquor bottle tallied with

                         specimen print marked Ext.'X' said to be the right index finger

                         print of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli.

                                           In the case of Phool Kumar (supra) on which

                         reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the State, it is

                         held that the clinching evidence against the appellant was his

                         thumb impression on the kunda of the cash box. It was

                         conclusively proved to be his on the opinion of the expert. The

                         report of the expert was used as evidence by the prosecution

                         without examining him in Court. Neither the Court thought it fit

                         nor the prosecution or the accused filed any application to

                         summon and examine the expert as to the subject matter of his


                                                                                          Page 70 of 106

                         report. The Court was bound to summon the expert if the

                         accused          would   have   filed    any   such    application         for   his

                         examination. That not having been done, the grievance of the

                         appellant apropos the report of the expert being used without his

                         examination in Court had no substance.

                                           The examination of expert is crucial especially if

                         reliance is placed on the finger print report to suspect the guilt of

                         the accused. The I.O. has stated that the Scientific Officer, DFSL

                         finger print and team collected the finger prints of three accused

                         persons from the Sub-Jail, Jagatsinghpur after obtaining the

                         order of the Court. Specific questions have been put to the

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli in the accused statement relating to

                         detection of Aska 40 liquor bottles during spot visit, visit of

                         scientific       team    of   SFSL,     Rasulgarh     and   staff     of     DFSL,

                         Jagatsinghpur to the spot and seizure of three numbers of Aska

                         40 bottles as per seizure list, but the appellant simply answered

                         that he could not say. Ext.26 has been marked on admission. No

                         application was filed from the side of accused persons to

                         summon the Scientific Officer or expert for his examination.

                         Therefore, non-examination of the Scientific Officer or the expert

                         who prepared the report cannot be a ground not to give

                         importance to Ext.26. It is correct that inadvertently no direct


                                                                                             Page 71 of 106

                         question has been put to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli on the finding

                         of Ext.26 in the accused statement, but it has been held by the

                         Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Paramjeet Singh (supra)

                         that the provisions of 
section 313
 of Cr.P.C. make it obligatory

                         for the Court to question the accused on the evidence and

                         circumstances against him so as to offer him an opportunity to

                         explain the same, but, it would not be enough for the accused to

                         show that he has not been questioned or examined on a

                         particular circumstance, instead he must show that such non-

                         examination has actually and materially prejudiced him and has

                         resulted in the failure of justice. In other words, in the event of

                         an inadvertent omission on the part of the Court to question the

                         accused on any incriminating circumstance cannot ipso facto

                         vitiate the trial unless it is shown that some material prejudice

                         was caused to the accused by the omission of the Court.

                                          In the case of Nar Singh (supra), contention was

                         raised from the side of the appellant that since Ballistic Expert

                         opinion was not put to the appellant in his statement recorded

                         under 
section 313
 of Cr.P.C., it must be completely excluded

                         from consideration. The Hon'ble Court held that when the trial

                         Court is required to act in accordance with the mandatory

                         provisions of 
section 313
 of Cr.P.C., failure on the part of the


                                                                               Page 72 of 106

                         trial Court to comply with the mandate of the law, cannot

                         automatically enure to the benefit of the accused. Any omission

                         on the part of the Court to question the accused on any

                         incriminating circumstance would not ipso facto vitiate the trial,

                         unless some material prejudice is shown to have been caused to

                         the accused. It was further held that in so far as non-compliance

                         of mandatory provisions of 
section 313
 of Cr.P.C., it is an error

                         essentially committed by the learned Sessions Judge. Since

                         justice suffers in the hands of the Court, the same has to be

                         corrected or rectified in the appeal. The question whether a trial

                         is vitiated or not depends upon the degree of the error and the

                         accused must show that non-compliance of 
section 313
 of

                         Cr.P.C. has materially prejudiced him or is likely to cause

                         prejudice to him. Merely because of defective questioning under

                         
section 313
 of Cr.P.C., it cannot be inferred that any prejudice

                         had been caused to the accused, even assuming that some

                         incriminating circumstances in the prosecution case had been left

                         out. When prejudice to the accused is alleged, it has to be shown

                         that accused has suffered some disability or detriment in relation

                         to the safeguard given to him under 
section 313
 of Cr.P.C. Such

                         prejudice should also demonstrate that it has occasioned failure

                         of justice to the accused. The burden is upon the accused to


                                                                              Page 73 of 106

                         prove that prejudice has been caused to him or in the facts and

                         circumstances of the case, such prejudice may be implicit and

                         the Court may draw an inference of such prejudice. Facts of each

                         case have to be examined to determine whether actually any

                         prejudice has been caused to the appellant due to omission of

                         some incriminating circumstances being put to the accused.

                         Whenever a plea of non-compliance of 
section 313
 of Cr.P.C. is

                         raised, it is within the powers of the appellate Court to examine

                         and further examine the convict or the counsel appearing for the

                         accused and the said answers shall be taken into consideration

                         for deciding the matter. If the accused is unable to offer the

                         appellate        Court    any   reasonable    explanation      of   such

                         circumstance, the Court may assume that the accused has no

                         acceptable explanation to offer. In the facts and circumstances of

                         the case, if the appellate Court comes to the conclusion that no

                         prejudice was caused or no failure of justice was occasioned, the

                         appellate Court will hear and decide the matter upon merits.

                                          It is pertinent to note that live link was provided to

                         the jail where the appellants were lodged and they were

                         provided opportunity to see the entire hearing proceeding. One

                         learned State Counsel from the District Court also remained

                         present with them throughout the proceeding as per our


                                                                                     Page 74 of 106

                         direction        to   explain   them   the   argument   advanced   and

                         interactions between the Bench and the learned counsel for the

                         respective parties. During course of hearing, when we expressed

                         our willingness to provide an opportunity to the appellant Sk.

                         Asif Alli to explain the finding of Ext.26 against him by way of

                         recording additional accused statement under 
section 313
 of

                         Cr.P.C., if he so desires, the learned counsel for the appellants

                         after taking instruction was reluctant to avail such opportunity.

                                          In the case in hand, the defence has not disputed the

                         visit of scientific team to the spot, the seizure of Aska 40 liquor

                         bottles from the spot on being produced by the Scientific Officer,

                         the detection and development of chance finger prints from such

                         bottles, the collection of specimen ten digit finger prints of the

                         appellant Sk. Asif Alli from jail and its dispatch to State Finger

                         Print Bureau, Bhubaneswar for examination. In fact, the same

                         has been proved through oral as well as documentary evidence.

                         The learned counsel for the appellant has failed to show as to

                         what material prejudice was caused to the appellant by the

                         omission of the Court to put direct question on Ext.26.

                                          In view of the foregoing discussions, when chance

                         finger prints were detected and developed from the three Aska

                         40 liquor bottles found at the spot and one chance print marked


                                                                                   Page 75 of 106

                         'B' tallied with specimen right index finger print of the appellant

                         Sk. Asif Alli and there is no suspicious feature in it, the

                         prosecution can be said to have proved the fifth circumstance

                         against the appellant Sk. Asif Alli beyond all reasonable doubt. It

                         cannot be lost sight of the fact the Aska 40 liquor bottles were

                         found at the spot which was inside the bunker of the house of

                         Sk. Khairuddin where the wearing apparels of the deceased

                         which were identified by the informant (P.W.7) so also the dead

                         body of the deceased was found in a naked condition on the Taza

                         of the underground room which is a very clinching evidence

                         against the appellant Sk. Asif Alli.

                         Sixth Circumstance : Conduct of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         in absconding from the village after occurrence:

                         18.              The occurrence in question took place on 21.08.2014

                         in the afternoon and as already discussed under the heading of

                         fourth circumstance that the appellant Sk. Asif Alli was found

                         leaving the village Manu Mohalla in a Hero Honda Activa Scooty

                         with two co-accused persons on the same day at about 6.00

                         p.m. The Investigating Officer (P.W.27) has stated that on

                         22.08.2014, only appellant Sk. Akil Alli was apprehended by the

                         local people and was arrested by him in the occurrence night,

                         but when he searched for the other accused persons inside the


                                                                                 Page 76 of 106

                         village, they were found absent. The I.O. has further stated that

                         as per the direction of the S.P., Jagatsinghpur, a special team

                         was formed to apprehend the accused persons and raid was

                         conducted at different places. On 05.09.2014 at about 3.00

                         p.m., the appellant Sk. Asif Alli so also the co-accused Sk. Abid

                         Alli (acquitted) were apprehended at Bhubaneswar by the I.O.

                         and they were brought to Tirtol police station. Specific question

                         has been put to the appellant regarding his apprehension at

                         Bhubaneswar in the accused statement but he simply answered

                         he did not know.

                                          The evidence has come on record through the I.O.

                         that the appellant Sk. Asif Alli was an accused in a case of

                         murder in connection with Tirtol P.S. Case No.197 of 2011.

                         Another case under 
section 307
 of the I.P.C. was instituted

                         against him in connection with Tirtol P.S. Case No.89 of 2014 in

                         which he was forwarded to Court and released on bail on

                         20.08.2014 i.e. the previous day of the occurrence.

                                          The   conduct   of   the   appellant   Sk.   Asif   Alli   in

                         absconding away from his village on the date of occurrence till

                         he was apprehended by the I.O. was a circumstance duly proved

                         by the prosecution against him. No explanation has been

                         rendered by the appellant in regard to his absence from his


                                                                                       Page 77 of 106

                         village and he was not available to the police in spite of their

                         best efforts to trace him. Thus, the sixth circumstance relating to

                         the conduct of the appellant in absconding from his village has

                         been duly proved by the prosecution and this absconding of the

                         appellant along with other incriminating circumstances as proved

                         by the prosecution goes a great way to point his culpability.

                         Summed up : Circumstances against appellant Sk. Asif Alli

                         @ Md. Asif Iqbal:

                         19.              All the sixth circumstances which are appearing

                         against the appellant Sk. Asif Alli as discussed above, are of a

                         conclusive nature and have been fully established by the

                         prosecution. The facts established are consistent with the

                         hypothesis of guilt of the appellant and it is not explainable

                         under any of the hypothesis except that the appellant is guilty.

                         The chain of evidence is so complete that it does not leave any

                         reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with innocence

                         of the appellant rather when the circumstances are collectively

                         considered, the same lead only to the irresistible conclusion that

                         the appellant is the perpetrator of the crime in question.




                                                                               Page 78 of 106

                         Charges proved against appellant Sk. Asif Alli @ Md. Asif

                         Iqbal:

                         20.              In my humble view, the prosecution has established

                         the charge under 
section 302
 of the I.P.C. against the appellant

                         Sk. Asif Alli particularly in view of the oral evidence adduced by

                         the witnesses relating to the manner in which the body of the

                         deceased was found in the Taza of the house of Sk. Khairuddin,

                         the inquest report so also the post mortem report findings.

                                          The   prosecution   has   also   proved   through   the

                         evidence of the doctor (P.W.25) who conducted post mortem

                         examination and the oral evidence of the witnesses regarding the

                         manner in which the body of the deceased was found in a naked

                         condition with multiple injuries on different parts of the body

                         including genital area that the appellant has not only committed

                         an offence of rape on the deceased but in course of such

                         commission, he inflicted the injuries which resulted in the death

                         of the deceased and therefore, the learned trial Court has rightly

                         found the appellant guilty under 
section 376-A
 of the I.P.C.

                                          So far as the charge under 
section 376-D
 of the

                         I.P.C. which relates to commission of gang rape is concerned,

                         since one of the accused, who faced trial, namely, Sk. Abid Alli

                         has been acquitted by the learned trial Court and appellant Sk.


                                                                                    Page 79 of 106

                         Akil Alli has been acquitted by virtue of this judgment, it would

                         not be proper to convict the appellant under 
section 376-D
 of the

                         I.P.C.

                                          Coming to the charge under 
section 6
 of the POCSO

                         Act which deals with punishment for aggravated penetrative

                         sexual assault defined under 
section 5
 of the said Act, the

                         ingredients of the offence can be satisfied if someone, inter alia,

                         commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve

                         years. 'Penetrative sexual assault' has been defined under

                         
section 3
 of the said Act and in view of the evidence of the

                         doctor (P.W.25), I am of the view that the necessary ingredients

                         are satisfied. So far as the age of the deceased is concerned, the

                         evidence of P.W.14, the Principal of Kalinga Public School,

                         Krishnanandapur where the deceased was prosecuting her

                         studies as a student of L.K.G. indicates that her date of birth was

                         16.03.2008 as per the school admission register which was

                         seized by the police during investigation and left in the zima of

                         P.W.14. The original birth certificate of the deceased was seized

                         by the I.O. as per seizure list Ext.10 on 09.09.2014 on being

                         produced by the uncle of the deceased and it also reflects the

                         date of birth of the deceased to be 16.03.2008. Since the

                         occurrence        in   question   took   place   on   21.08.2014,    the


                                                                                    Page 80 of 106

                         prosecution has proved that the deceased was a child below

                         twelve years. The learned counsel for the appellant has not

                         challenged the evidence relating to the age of the deceased.

                         Therefore, the prosecution has successfully established the

                         charge under 
section 6
 of the POCSO Act against the appellant

                         Sk. Asif Alli.

                         21.              In view of the foregoing discussion, I am of the view

                         that the prosecution has failed to establish the charge under

                         
section 376-D
 of the I.P.C. against the appellant Sk. Asif Alli and

                         accordingly, he is acquitted of such charge, however he is found

                         guilty under 
sections 302
/
376-A
 of the I.P.C. and 
section 6
 of the

                         POCSO Act.

                         Sentence:

                         22.              The   learned   trial   Court   has   awarded     life

                         imprisonment for the offence under 
section 376-A
 of the I.P.C.,

                         which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural

                         life. This section gives a discretion to the Court to impose

                         punishment with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall

                         not be less than twenty years, but which may extend to

                         imprisonment for life, which shall mean for imprisonment for the

                         remainder of that person's natural life, and with fine or with

                         death. In view of the age of the deceased at the time of


                                                                                  Page 81 of 106

                         occurrence and the manner in which rape has been committed

                         which ultimately caused the death of the deceased, I am of the

                         view that the sentence awarded by the learned trial Court for

                         such offence is perfectly justified and no interference is called for

                         with the same.

                                          The learned trial Court has rightly not imposed any

                         sentence for the conviction of the appellant Sk. Asif Alli for the

                         charge under 
section 6
 of the POCSO Act in view of 
section 42
 of

                         the said Act.

                         23.              So far as the the offence under 
section 302
 of the

                         I.P.C. is concerned, the learned trial Court has awarded death

                         sentence to the appellant Sk. Asif Alli and ordered that he be

                         hanged by neck till he is dead.

                                          The only question that now remains to be decided is

                         whether this case falls in the category of rarest of rare case,

                         justifying capital punishment. The learned Hon'ble Supreme

                         Court in several judgments has awarded capital punishment,

                         where rape and murder have been committed on a minor girl,

                         after striking a balance between the aggravating and mitigating

                         circumstances. Several other factors like the young age of the

                         accused, the possibility of reformation, lack of intention to




                                                                                 Page 82 of 106

                         murder consequent to rape etc. have also gone into judicial

                         mind.

                                          It seems that on the date of pronouncement of order

                         of conviction i.e. on 29.11.2022, hearing on the question of

                         sentence was made and death sentence was awarded. The

                         learned trial Court after noting down the principles rendered by

                         the Hon'ble Supreme Court in different cases relating to

                         awarding of death sentence, has been pleased to hold that the

                         deceased was a minor victim aged about six years and the

                         offences are serious and heinous in nature and against the

                         norms of a healthy society. The act reveals a dirty and perverted

                         mind of human being who has no control over his carnal desires.

                         The number of injuries found on the deceased show that she was

                         mercilessly ravished and killed to satisfy the carnal desires. The

                         learned      trial   Court   also   took   into   account   the   criminal

                         background of the appellant as he was involved previously not

                         only in a case under 
section 302
 of the I.P.C. but also in another

                         case under 
section 307
 of the I.P.C. and was released on bail on

                         20.08.2014 and committed the offence in the present case on

                         the very next day. The learned trial Court held that there was no

                         chance of reformation of the appellant in the near future. The

                         deceased was well known to the appellant as he was a co-


                                                                                      Page 83 of 106

                         villager and the deceased was taken away with deliberate

                         intention in an ill mind in order to commit rape and murder,

                         which comes within the category of rarest of rare case

                         warranting capital punishment to meet the ends of justice. The

                         learned trial Court further held that imposition of capital

                         punishment on the appellant would be an example for other

                         wrongdoers of similar nature in the society, which is necessitated

                         in order to protect and safeguard the female children's interest in

                         the country and accordingly, imposed death sentence on the

                         appellant.

                                          During course of argument, on 30.04.2024 learned

                         counsel for the appellants argued that passing of death sentence

                         on the date of conviction by the learned trial Court was not

                         justified. The learned counsel for the State brought to the notice

                         of the Court the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered

                         in the case of Sundar @ Sundarrajan -Vrs.- State by

                         Inspector of Police reported in 2023 LiveLaw (SC) 217.

                         After going through the ratio laid down in the said decision, we

                         deemed it proper to call for a report to the Superintendent of

                         Circle Jail, Choudwar, Cuttack regarding (i) conduct of the

                         appellants in jail; (ii) information on appellants' involvement in

                         any other case; (iii) details of the appellants acquiring education


                                                                               Page 84 of 106

                         in jail and (iv) details of appellants' medical records. On

                         02.05.2024, after considering the submission of the learned

                         counsel for the appellants so also the learned counsel for the

                         State, this Court took suo motu cognizance of the fact regarding

                         the procedure followed by the trial Court at the time of hearing

                         on sentence. Taking into account various decisions of the Hon'ble

                         Supreme Court on the point, we were of the view that there was

                         no proper and meaningful hearing on the question of sentence

                         which was necessary in order to do complete justice. We also

                         held that no opportunity was afforded to the appellants to submit

                         any material in support of mitigating circumstances during

                         course of hearing on the question of sentence. After observing

                         that hearing on the question of sentence has to be real and

                         effective and not a mere formality and that if a meaningful

                         hearing was not taken up by a Court while considering the

                         sentence imposed and inflicted upon the convict, it would cause

                         serious prejudice to him, we afforded an opportunity to the

                         appellants inviting from them such data to be furnished in the

                         shape of affidavits and also directed the Jail Authority to do the

                         needful in that regard. We directed the Senior Superintendent,

                         Circle Jail, Cuttack at Choudwar to collect all the information on

                         the past life of the convicts, psychological conditions and their


                                                                              Page 85 of 106

                         conduct post- conviction obtaining reports accordingly by taking

                         service and necessary assistance from the Probation Officer and

                         such other officers including a Psychologist or Jail Doctor or any

                         Medical Officer attending the prison.

                                          In pursuance of such order, the mother of the

                         appellant filed an affidavit dated 09.05.2024 indicating therein

                         that at the time of occurrence, his son was working in an auto

                         garage as a colour mistri and the entire family depended on the

                         income of the appellant, who was a young boy aged about

                         twenty five years at the time of occurrence and though he has

                         got previous criminal antecedents but he has no previous

                         conviction. It is further stated in the affidavit that during

                         incarceration,      her   son   had   reformed   and   he    should    be

                         rehabilitated to the extent that he could live in the society.

                                          As per the order dated 02.05.2024, the learned

                         Additional Government Advocate also produced the social reports

                         of both the appellants submitted by the Regional Probation

                         Officer, Cuttack, Psychological condition reports of both the

                         appellants submitted by Psychiatrist, Circle Jail, Cuttack at

                         Choudwar and present conduct and behaviour inside the Circle

                         Jail, Cuttack at Choudwar from Senior Superintendent, Circle

                         report dated 08.05.2024 has stated that he met the mother of

                         the appellant Sk. Asif Alli, who was aged about sixty three years

                         and ascertained from her that the appellant was the eldest son of

                         the family and was working as a labourer in a private shop

                         (radium work), Mumbai for his livelihood to maintain the family.

                         The family of the appellant has got no landed property and the

                         mother of the appellant was suffering from eye sight problem

                         and psychological imbalance after the death of her husband. The

                         two sisters of the appellant are unmarried and stated that their

                         marriage proposal could not be settled due to non-acceptance of

                         their family in the society. It is observed that the family have no

                         means to face the situation in the village and the family is

                         struggling for the livelihood as there is no earning member in the

                         family and they are remaining in fear psychosis and the mother

                         of the appellant is behaving irrationally with unsettled mind. So

                         far as education background of the appellant is concerned, he

                         passed matriculation in third division in the year 2010 and the

                         school leaving certificate reflects good in character/conduct

                         during his school days and he had no adverse report as per the

                         school report. The appellant was a good cricket and football

                         player and after matriculation, he discontinued his higher studies

                         due to financial problems as reported by his family members. So


                                                                               Page 87 of 106

                         far as social life and past life of the appellant is concerned, it

                         appears that prior to the offence in question, the appellant was

                         involved in seven cases, out of which in three cases, he has been

                         acquitted.       The   villagers   and   village   committee   members

                         expressed their displeasure against the appellant for his criminal

                         act and they were very disgusted, aggravated and grudged

                         towards the appellant and therefore, the life of the appellant is in

                         danger in his village. The villagers are not providing any support

                         to the family of the appellant for which the family members are

                         suffering a lot. The Senior Superintendent, Circle Jail, Cuttack at

                         Choudwar has submitted a report wherein it is mentioned that

                         the conduct and behaviour of the appellant inside prison at

                         present is normal, his behaviour and attitude towards other co-

                         prisoners as well as the staff is cordial. He is maintaining every

                         discipline of jail administration and there is no adverse report

                         against him during his entire period of confinement in prison. No

                         prison offence was committed by the appellant inside the jail

                         during the period of his imprisonment. The Psychiatrist, Circle

                         Jail, Cuttack at Choudwar has given a report relating to the

                         psychological condition of the appellant wherein it is mentioned

                         that the appellant is doing his daily routine activities properly,

                         offering prayer to God many times in a day and coping with the


                                                                                    Page 88 of 106

                         co-inmates well and regarding the sentence, the appellant is

                         ready to accept his punishment as he has surrendered before the

                         God. On mental status examination, mild degree of anxiety was

                         noticed and no other mental abnormality was detected and on

                         surrendering before the God, the appellant was able to keep the

                         mental state in balance. The Senior Superintendent, Circle Jail,

                         Cuttack at Choudwar has also reported that the conduct of the

                         appellant inside the jail is normal and he has not acquired any

                         further education in jail after his admission to jail.

                                          The learned counsel for the appellants placed reliance

                         in the case of Shankar Kisanrao Khade (supra), wherein

                         Hon'ble Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan (as His Lordship then was)

                         held as follows:

                                          "28......In my considered view that the tests that
                                          we   have   to   apply,   while   awarding     death
                                          sentence, are "crime test", "criminal test" and
                                          the R-R Test and not "balancing test". To award
                                          death sentence, the "crime test" has to be fully
                                          satisfied, that is 100% and "criminal test" 0%,
                                          that is no mitigating circumstance favouring the
                                          accused. If there is any circumstance favouring
                                          the accused, like lack of intention to commit the
                                          crime, possibility of reformation, young age of
                                          the accused, not a menace to the society no
                                          previous track record etc., the "criminal test"


                                                                                       Page 89 of 106

                                          may favour the accused to avoid the capital
                                          punishment. Even, if both the tests are satisfied
                                          that is the aggravating circumstances to the
                                          fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances
                                          favouring the accused, still we have to apply
                                          finally the Rarest of Rare Case test (R-R lest). R-
                                          R Test depends upon the perception of the
                                          society that is "society centric" and not "Judge
                                          centric" that is, whether the society will approve
                                          the awarding of death sentence to certain types
                                          of crimes or not. While applying that test, the
                                          Court has to look into variety of factors like
                                          society's abhorrence, extreme indignation and
                                          antipathy to certain types of crimes like sexual
                                          assault and murder of minor girls intellectually
                                          challenged, suffering from physical disability, old
                                          and infirm women with those disabilities etc.
                                          Examples    are    only       illustrative   and   not
                                          exhaustive. Courts award death sentence since
                                          situation demands so, due to constitutional
                                          compulsion, reflected by the will of the people
                                          and not the will of the Judges.

                                          38.   Therefore,   the    mere    pendency    of   few
                                          criminal cases as such is not an aggravating
                                          circumstance to be taken note of while awarding
                                          death sentence unless the accused is found
                                          guilty and convicted in those cases. High Court
                                          was, therefore, in error in holding that those are


                                                                                        Page 90 of 106

                                          relevant factors to be considered in awarding
                                          appropriate sentence."

                                          In the said case, even though the victim was a minor

                         girl aged about 11 years, intellectually challenged and the

                         accused repeatedly raped the girl for few days, ultimately

                         strangulated       her   to   death   and   the   Hon'ble   Justice    K.S.

                         Radhakrishnan held that both 'crime test' and 'criminal test' are

                         independently satisfied against the accused, but considering the

                         entire facts and circumstances of the case, the death sentence

                         awarded to the accused was converted to rigorous imprisonment

                         for life. Hon'ble Justice Madan B. Lokur (as His Lordship then

                         was) also agreed with such view.

                                          Now the decisions cited by the learned counsel for

                         the State on death penalty are to be discussed. In the case of

                         Ravi (supra), Hon'ble Justice Surya Kant speaking for himself

                         and for Justice R.F. Nariman (as His Lordship then was) held as

                         follows:-

                                          "62. In the light of above discussion, we are of
                                          the considered opinion that sentencing in this
                                          case has to be judged keeping in view the
                                          parameters originating from Bachan Singh and
                                          Machhi Singh cases and which have since been
                                          strengthened,    explained,      distinguished   or
                                          followed in a catena of subsequent decisions,


                                                                                     Page 91 of 106

                                          some of which have been cited above. Having
                                          said that, it may be seen that the victim was
                                          barely a two-year old baby whom the appellant
                                          kidnapped and apparently kept on assaulting
                                          over 4-5 hours till she breathed her last. The
                                          appellant who had no control over his carnal
                                          desires surpassed all natural, social and legal
                                          limits just to satiate his sexual hunger. He
                                          ruthlessly finished a life which was yet to bloom.
                                          The appellant instead of showing fatherly love,
                                          affection and protection to the child against the
                                          evils of the society, rather made her the victim
                                          of lust. It is a case where trust has been
                                          betrayed and social values are impaired. The
                                          unnatural sex     with a   two-year old toddler
                                          exhibits a dirty and perverted mind, showcasing
                                          a horrifying tale of brutality. The appellant
                                          meticulously executed his nefarious design by
                                          locking one door of his house from the outside
                                          and bolting the other one from the inside so as
                                          to deceive people into believing that nobody was
                                          inside. The appellant was thus in his full senses
                                          while he indulged in this senseless act. The
                                          appellant   has   not   shown   any   remorse   or
                                          repentance for the gory crime, rather he opted
                                          to remain silent in his 313 
Cr.P.C
. statement. His
                                          deliberate, well-designed silence with a standard
                                          defence of 'false' accusation reveals his lack of
                                          kindness or compassion and leads to believe


                                                                                    Page 92 of 106

                                          that he can never be reformed. That being so,
                                          this Court cannot write of the capital punishment
                                          so long as it is inscribed in the statute book."

                                          Hon'ble Justice R. Subhash Reddy (as His Lordship

                         then was) dissented on the question of sentence and held as

                         follows:-

                                          "76. In this case, learned counsel for the
                                          appellant has contended that the trial Court as
                                          well as the High Court, fell in error in confining
                                          nature and brutality of crime alone, to award the
                                          sentence of death. It is submitted that nature of
                                          crime alone is not sufficient to impose the
                                          sentence of death, unless State proves by
                                          leading cogent evidence that the convict is
                                          beyond reform and rehabilitation. It is submitted
                                          that the socio-economic conditions of the convict
                                          and the circumstances under which crime is
                                          committed are equally relevant for the purpose
                                          of considering whether a death penalty is to be
                                          imposed or not. It is submitted that as the case
                                          on hand, rests on circumstantial evidence, same
                                          is   also    the       ground    not    to    impose     capital
                                          punishment, of death.

                                          98. I am clear in my mind that in this case on
                                          hand,       the    mitigating        circumstances      of   the

                                          circumstances, to modify the death sentence to
                                          that of life imprisonment. Even as per the case
                                          of     prosecution,     the   appellant    was     under
                                          influence of liquor at the time of committing the
                                          offence, and there is no evidence on record from
                                          the side of prosecution, to show that there is no
                                          possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of
                                          the Appellant. Further, age of the appellant was
                                          25 years at the relevant time and conviction is
                                          solely based on circumstantial evidence. Taking
                                          all such aspects into consideration, the death
                                          penalty imposed on the appellant is to be
                                          modified to that of life imprisonment, for the
                                          offence under 
section 302
 Indian Penal Code."
                                          In the case of Manoharan (supra), Hon'ble Justice

                         R.F. Nariman (as His Lordship then was) speaking for himself

                         and for Justice Surya Kant held as follows:-

                                          "34. In the circumstances, we have no doubt
                                          that    the   trial   Court   and   High   Court    have
                                          correctly     applied   and    balanced    aggravating
                                          circumstances with mitigating circumstances to
                                          find that the crime committed was cold-blooded
                                          and involves the rape of a minor girl and murder
                                          of two children in the most heinous fashion
                                          possible. No remorse has been shown by the
                                          appellant at all and given the nature of the crime
                                          as stated in paragraph 84 of the High Court's
                                          judgment it is unlikely that the appellant, if set


                                                                                           Page 94 of 106

                                          free, would not be capable of committing such a
                                          crime yet again. The fact that the appellant
                                          made a confessional statement would not, on
                                          the facts of this case, mean that he showed
                                          remorse for committing such a heinous crime.
                                          He did not stand by this confessional statement,
                                          but falsely retracted only those parts of the
                                          statement which implicated him of both the rape
                                          of the young girl and the murder of both her and
                                          her little brother. Consequently, we confirm the
                                          death sentence and dismiss the appeals."

                                          Hon'ble Justice Sanjiv Khanna dissented on the

                         question of sentence and held as follows:-

                                          "44. The expression 'rarest of rare' literally
                                          means rarest even in the rare, i.e. a rarest case
                                          of an extreme nature. The expression and the
                                          choice of words, means that punishment by
                                          death is an extremely narrow and confined rare
                                          exception. The normal, if not an unexceptional
                                          rule, is punishment for life, which rule can be
                                          trimmed and upended only when the award of
                                          sentence for life is unquestionably foreclosed.
                                          Thus,   capital   punishment   is   awarded    and
                                          invoked only if the facts and material produced
                                          by   the   prosecution   disdainfully   and   fully
                                          establish that the option of imprisonment for life
                                          will not suffice and is wholly disproportionate




                                                                                     Page 95 of 106

                                          and therefore the case belongs to the 'rarest of
                                          rare' category.
                                          xx           xx           xx              xx         xx
                                          55. When we come to the facts of the present
                                          case, one has to but agree that the offence or
                                          the crime was brutal, ruthless and cruel as two
                                          innocent children aged 7 to 10 lost their lives,
                                          and there is substantial medical and other
                                          evidence to show that the young girl was
                                          mercilessly sexually abused and raped by the
                                          Appellant and Mohanakrishnan (since deceased).
                                          Thereafter     the    children     were    administered
                                          poison and thrown into a canal to die. The pain
                                          and trauma suffered by the small children who
                                          were not at fault and the agony of the parents
                                          and grandmother are immense, incalculable and
                                          would remain forever. The punishment must be
                                          severe. Yet to award death penalty we must
                                          examine and answer the second question, i.e.
                                          balance out the aggravating circumstances by
                                          giving weightage to the mitigating circumstances
                                          and   decide       whether       punishment     of   life
                                          imprisonment is foreclosed. Then and then alone
                                          the case would fall under the 'rarest of rare'
                                          category. While doing so, we should account for
                                          the majority dictum in V. Sriharan (supra) that
                                          where life imprisonment is considered to be
                                          disproportionate or inadequate, then the Court
                                          may   direct      sentence   for   life   imprisonment,


                                                                                          Page 96 of 106

                                          without any right to remission i.e. imprisonment
                                          for the entire course of life with no recourse to
                                          remission, subject to the power that may be
                                          exercised under 
Articles 72
 and 
161
 of the
                                          Constitution.
                                          xx           xx           xx         xx          xx
                                          73. The appellant's partial retraction has been
                                          rightly disbelieved for good reasons, including
                                          the statement of the appellant under 
Section
                                          313
 Cr.P.C. in the Court accepting and admitting
                                          that   his   confession    was   recorded   by   the
                                          Magistrate. The retraction by itself, I would
                                          observe, should not be treated as absence of
                                          remorse or repentance, albeit an afterthought or
                                          on advice propelled by fear that the appellant in
                                          view of his admission may face the gallows, and
                                          that   the   earlier    confession   made   seeking
                                          forgiveness would be the cause of his death. A
                                          thought of doubt and attempt to retract had
                                          surfaced on account of belief that the sense of
                                          remorse, repentance and forgiveness would not
                                          be appreciated and given due regard, cannot be
                                          ruled out. Benefit in this regard must go to the
                                          Appellant.

                                          74. The other mitigating factors in favour of the
                                          appellant are his young age, he was 23 years of
                                          age at the time of occurrence and he belongs to
                                          a poor family. He has aged parents and is a
                                          first-time   offender     as     recorded   in   the


                                                                                      Page 97 of 106

                                          judgment/order of the trial court. Further, the
                                          appellant Manoharan was not initially involved in
                                          the abduction and kidnapping of the children. He
                                          was not the mastermind. Mohanakrishnan (since
                                          deceased) had thought, conceived and had
                                          single-handedly executed the plan to abduct the
                                          children. The appellant did join him thereafter
                                          and was with Mohanakrishnan (since deceased).
                                          Subsequently the devil in Mohanakrishnan (since
                                          deceased) took over and he sexually assaulted
                                          and raped the small girl, while the appellant
                                          kept quiet. Later the appellant too sexually
                                          assaulted     and   committed   rape.    Thereupon,
                                          poison was administered to the children before
                                          throwing them into the canal. The offence
                                          committed was heinous and deplorable.

                                          75.......In view of the aforesaid discussion and on
                                          balancing       aggravating      and      mitigating
                                          circumstances, in my opinion, the present case
                                          does not fall under the category of 'rarest of
                                          rare' case i.e. there is no alternative but to
                                          impose death sentence. It would fall within the
                                          special category of cases, where the appellant
                                          should be directed to suffer sentence for life i.e.
                                          till    his         natural     death,      without
                                          remission/commutation under 
sections 432
 and
                                          
433
 Code of Criminal Procedure. To this extent, I
                                          would allow the appeal."

                                          In the case of Laxman Naik (supra), the Hon'ble

                         Supreme Court held that the extreme penalty can be inflicted

                         only in gravest cases of the extreme culpability and in making

                         choice of the sentence, in addition to the circumstances of the

                         offender also. Having regard to these principles with regard to

                         the imposition of the extreme penalty, it may be noticed that

                         there are absolutely no mitigating circumstances in the case. The

                         appellant seems to have acted in a beastly manner as after

                         satisfying his lust, he thought that the victim might expose him

                         for the commission of the offence of forcible rape on her to the

                         family members and other, the appellant with a view to screen

                         the evidence of his crime also put an end to the life of innocent

                         girl who had seen only seven summers. The evidence on record

                         is indicative of the fact as to how diabolically the appellant had

                         conceived of his plan and brutally executed it and such a

                         calculated, cold blooded and brutal murder of a girl of a very

                         tender age after committing rape on her would undoubtedly fall

                         in the category of rarest of the rare case attracting no

                         punishment other than the capital punishment.

                                          In the case of Dhananjoy Chatterjee (supra), the

                         Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the object of sentencing should

                         be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the victim


                                                                               Page 99 of 106

                         of crime as also the society has the satisfaction that justice has

                         been done to it. In imposing sentences, in the absence of specific

                         legislation, Judges must consider variety of factors and after

                         considering all those factors and taking an overall view of the

                         situation, impose sentence which they consider to be an

                         appropriate one. Aggravating factors cannot be ignored and

                         similarly mitigating circumstances have also to be taken into

                         consideration. It is further held that the measure of punishment

                         in a given case must depend upon the atrocity of the crime; the

                         conduct of the criminal and the defenceless and unprotected

                         state of the victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the

                         manner in which the courts respond to the society's cry for

                         justice against the criminals. Justice demands that courts should

                         impose punishment fitting to the crime so that the courts reflect

                         public abhorrence of the crime. The courts must not only keep in

                         view the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of

                         crime and the society at large while considering imposition of

                         appropriate punishment.

                                          In the case of Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan

                         Bariyar -Vrs.- State of Maharashtra reported in (2009) 6

                         Supreme Court Cases 498, it is held that life imprisonment




                                                                               Page 100 of 106

                         can be said to be completely futile, only when the sentencing

                         aim of reformation can be said to be unachievable.

                                          Keeping in view the ratio laid down in the decisions

                         discussed above, it is borne out of record that the offence was

                         committed against a girl child aged about six years in a most

                         horrendous, devilish and barbaric manner, but the case is based

                         on circumstantial evidence and there is no material on record

                         that the crime was committed in a pre-planned manner. It

                         seems that both the appellants noticed the deceased in the

                         company of his cousin brother (P.W.17) while they were

                         returning after purchasing chocolates and then the deceased was

                         lifted away and she was subjected to rape during course of which

                         she sustained injuries on different parts of her body and her

                         death was due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of injuries

                         to genital track which were fatal in ordinary course of nature. No

                         harm has been caused to P.W.17 while lifting away the deceased

                         even though the appellants must have been aware that P.W.17 is

                         likely to disclose about their misdeeds before the family

                         members and others. The post mortem report (Ext.19) does not

                         indicate any specific method was applied by the culprit for

                         committing the death of the deceased. Though the appellant has

                         got criminal antecedents but he has not been found guilty in


                                                                                 Page 101 of 106

                         those cases rather he has been acquitted in three cases as would

                         be evident from the social report submitted by Regional

                         Probation Officer, Cuttack. Therefore, the mere pendency of

                         criminal cases cannot be considered as relevant factors for

                         awarding death sentence in view of the ratio laid down by the

                         Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Shankar Kisanrao Khade

                         (supra). The date of birth of the appellant as per the report

                         submitted by Regional Probation Officer, Cuttack is 13.03.1989

                         and therefore, he was aged about 26 years as on the date of

                         occurrence. He is a family man and having old mother aged

                         about 63 years and two unmarried sisters and he was the sole

                         bread earner of his family and working as a colour mistri in

                         Mumbai and the financial condition of the family is not good. His

                         character and conduct was good in school and he has passed

                         matriculation in the year 2010. He could not continue his higher

                         studies due to financial problems in the family. He was a good

                         cricket and football player during his teen age. Even though he is

                         in judicial custody for about ten years, but the reports submitted

                         by Jail Superintendent and the Psychiatrist indicate that his

                         conduct and behaviour inside prison is normal, his behaviour

                         towards co-prisoners as well as staff is cordial and he is

                         maintaining every discipline of the jail administration. Neither


                                                                             Page 102 of 106

                         there is any adverse report against him during the entire period

                         of confinement nor he has committed any prison offence. He is

                         offering prayer to God many times in a day and he is ready to

                         accept the punishment as he has surrendered before God.

                                          The punishment should not be disproportionately

                         great is a corollary of just deserts and it is dictated by the same

                         principle that does not allow punishment of the innocent, for any

                         punishment in excess of what is deserved for the criminal

                         conduct is punishment without guilt. There is no cogent evidence

                         that     the     appellant   is   beyond   reform   and   rehabilitation.

                         Considering the entire facts and circumstances, the aggravating

                         circumstances and mitigating circumstances, it cannot be said

                         that capital punishment is the only option for the appellant and

                         that the option of imprisonment for life will not suffice and is

                         wholly disproportionate.

                                          In view of the foregoing discussions, I am inclined to

                         commute the death sentence awarded to the appellant for the

                         offence under 
section 302
 of the I.P.C. to life imprisonment,

                         which shall mean the remainder of his natural death, without

                         remission/commutation under 
sections 432
 and 
433
 Code of

                         Criminal Procedure.

                         Victim Compensation:

                         24.              The learned trial Court has awarded compensation of

                         Rs.1,50,000/- (rupees one lakh fifty thousand) to be paid to the

                         parents of the deceased. The State Government of Odisha in

                         exercise of powers conferred by the provisions of 
section 357-A


                         of Cr.P.C. has formulated the Odisha Victim Compensation

                         Scheme,          2017.   Schedule-II   of   the   scheme    deals    with

                         compensation scheme for woman victims or survivors of sexual

                         assault or other crimes. In case of death (loss of life), the

                         minimum limit of compensation is Rs. 5 Lakh and the upper limit

                         of compensation is Rs.10 Lakh. In the factual scenario and

                         particularly taking into account the age of the deceased, the

                         maximum compensation amount i.e. Rs. 10,000,00/- (rupees ten

                         lakh) as provided under Schedule-II is awarded which is to be

                         paid to the father and mother of the deceased. If any

                         compensation amount has already been disbursed to the parents

                         of the deceased as per the order of the learned trial Court, the

                         same shall be adjusted and District Legal Services Authority,

                         Jagatsinghpur shall take immediate steps to pay the balance

                         amount of compensation within four weeks from today.




                                                                                    Page 104 of 106
