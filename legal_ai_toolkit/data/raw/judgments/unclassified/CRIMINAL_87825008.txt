                  CORAM:
                      JUSTICE SAVITRI RATHO

                                            ORDER

                                           30.08.2024
Order No.                             (Through hybrid mode)

   02.

             1.     This application under 
Section 439
 of Cr.P.C. has been filed by

             the petitioner in connection with Malkangiri P.S. Case No.488 of 2023

             corresponding to Special G.R. Case No.187 of 2023, pending in the

             Court of the learned Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Malkangiri for

             commission of offences punishable under 
Sections 20 (b) (ii) (C)
/
25

             (1) (a)
/
27 (a)
 and 
29
 of the N.D.P.S. Act.



             2.     This case had been listed before me as BLAPL No.10835 of

             2023 filed by the co-accused, Ananta Hantal had been dismissed by me

             on 06.10.2023.



             3.     The prayer for bail of the petitioner has been rejected vide order

             dated 29.05.2024 by the learned Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge,

             Malkangiri.



             4.     While rejecting the prayer for bail, the learned trial Court has

             observed that involvement of the petitioner in Kalimela P.S. Case



                                                                          Page 1 of 4

 No.121 dated 21.05.2023 prima facie shows that he is a habitual

offender and that two more persons are yet to be arrested and to be

brought on record.



5.     The prosecution allegation in brief is that on 07.09.2023 at about

9.10 a.m. while the S.I. of Police, Malkangiri P.S. alongwith his staff

were performing day patrolling duty in Padmagiri and Pandripani area,

they received reliable information that four to five persons had

assembled below one Mahua tree near Telimetla Chowk about 02

K.Ms distance from Padmagiri Chowk and were in possession of

contraband ganja which they were about to transport to Chhatisgarh.

The police party reached the spot and apprehended four persons,

namely, Kamal Lochan Kope, Shyam Sundar Pangi, Ananta Hantal and

Rama Kope while three persons escaped from the spot. 150 Kgs of

ganja were seized from the possession of four accused persons and on

being asked they stated that the present petitioner-Debendra @ Deba

Khilla is the supplier of said ganja and three persons who fled from the

spot were Abhi Sagaria, Mitu Hantal and Durjya Sanabasi. They

further stated that they were about to transport the ganja to

Chhatisgarh. On search, 05 sacks containing 30 Kgs. each of ganja was

recovered from their possession. As they could not produce any

authority for possession of ganja, the ganja was seized and they were

arrested.

 6.     Mr.Abhas Mohanty, learned counsel for the petitioner submits

that the petitioner is in custody since 30.03.2024 and other than the

confession of the co-accused, there is no other material to implicate the

petitioner with the said crime. He further submits that the petitioner has

one criminal antecedent under 
Section 20 (b) (ii) (C)
 of the NDPS Act

vide Kalimela P.S. Case No.121 of 2023 and he has filed BLAPL

No.4005 of 2024 in this Court which is pending. His further

submission is that since the petitioner is a local man, there is no chance

of his absconding if he is released on bail. He finally submits that in

view of the fact that there has been no recovery of ganja from his

possession, it cannot be said that he is the guilty of the said offence or

that he is not likely to commit such offence for which 
Section 37
 of the

NDPS Act will not be a bar for releasing him on bail.


7.     Mr.S.S.Mohapatra, learned Addl. Standing Counsel opposes the

prayer for bail stating that although in the case diary the I.O. has

mentioned that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent but it is

apparent from the rejection order that the petitioner is involved in

Kalimela P.S. Case No.121 of 2023 under the 
NDPS Act
. He further

submits that in view of the quantity of ganja seized and as he has one

criminal antecedent of similar nature, 
Section 37
 of the NDPS Act will

be attracted in this case for which the petitioner should not be released

on bail.





                                                              Page 3 of 4


                            8.     Strangely the I.O. has not mentioned the criminal antecedent of

                           the petitioner in the case diary but the counsel for the petitioner has

                           fairly mentioned the antecedent of the petitioner in paragraph-13 of the

                           bail application - that the petitioner is involved in Kalimela P.S. Case

                           No.121 of 2023 where the basis of his implication is the statement of

                           the co-accused.



                           9.     
In view of the nature of allegations against the petitioner, nature

                           of his criminal antecedent, the provision of 
Section 37
 of the NDPS

                           Act and the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Union of

                           India v. Ajay Kumar Singh
 : 2023 SCC Online SC 346, I am not

                           inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage.


                           10.    The prayer for bail is accordingly rejected.


                           11.    It is open for the petitioner to move for bail afresh in case there

                           is undue delay in completion of the trial.



                           12.    Copy of this order be sent to the Superintendent of Police,

                           Malkangiri that he can take action as deemed fit against the person

                           concerned for giving incorrect particulars about the criminal

                           antecedents of the petitioner.


                                                                          (Savitri Ratho)
