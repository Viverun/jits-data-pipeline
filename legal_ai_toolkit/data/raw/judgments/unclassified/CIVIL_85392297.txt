                                      JUDGMENT



                  This is a Petition filed by the Petitioner under 
Section

            34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 for setting

                                  3

                                               A.S. No.25003/2023


aside the Arbitral Award dated 06.07.2023 passed by the

learned Sole Arbitrator.





       2.   The plaintiff Mr.H.L.Nagaraj had invoked the

Arbitration Agreement and preferred certain Claims against

"M/s.Siddhshekha Developers LLP" the defendant No.1.



       3. The Brief facts leading to the case are as follows:-



       The plaintiff (owner) seeks a direction to the defendnat

No.1    (developer)   to   pay   to   the   plaintiff   a   sum   of

Rs.47,46,17,454/- as compensation and in the alternative to

direct the defendant No.1 to hand over to the plaintiff 39,551

sq ft of Super-Built-Up area in the schedule property. This

prayer is based mainly on the ground of inordinate delay on

the part of the developer in completing the project in

question.





       The project is construction of a multi-storied residential

complex in property bearing No.98, Bull Temple Road,

Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, measuring 27,475 sq ft (schedule

                                4

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


property).   In this regard, the plaintiff and the defendant

No.1 entered into a registered Development Agreement on

22.10.2012 ('DA' for short).   As per the terms of the said

agreement, the defendant No.1 was authorized to enter upon

the schedule property for the construction of development

and both the parties agreed to share the built-up area in the

ratio 50:50. On the same date of the agreement, a power of

attorney (POA) was also executed by the plaintiff in favour of

the   defendant    No.1.    Yet    another    agreement    viz.,

supplementary agreement (SA) was also executed on the

same day and it was agreed that the defendant No.1 would

pay Rs.10 crores non-refundable deposit and Rs.15 crores

refundable deposit to the claimant.





      It is the case of the plaintiff that the defendant No.1

attributed the delay in commencing the construction work, to

the loan taken by the plaintiff and the schedule property is

subject matter of proceedings before the Debt Recovery

Tribunal, Bengaluru (DRT). The defendant No.1 failed to pay

                               5

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


the amount as agreed, to the plaintiff, to enable the plaintiff

to settle the amounts due to IDBI Bank. The defendant No.1

had no funds to pay to the plaintiff the refundable and non-

refundable deposits and to start the construction work. As

and when the amounts were paid to the plaintiff by the

defendant No.1, the plaintiff in turn cleared the entire loan

amounts of IDBI Bank and obtained original title deeds of

the schedule property and handed over the same to the

defendant No.1.





     It is the case of the plaintiff that there was no order of

any nature to prevent the defendant No.1 from obtaining

necessary sanctions and permissions for putting up the

construction and it is the defendant No.1 who had

introduced Sri.Shailesh Kumar.S.Haran the partner of the

defendant No.1 and Sri.Pratik Mehta, the partner of

M/s.Unishire Builtech LLP (for short 'Unishire') as its

business associates and friends and agreed to develop the

schedule property. Later on, it was only the defendant No.1

                                6

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


who came forward to develop the project. It is the plaintiff's

stand that the above mentioned Shailesh Kumar in collusion

with Pratik Mehta instigated the latter to file a frivolous suit

on behalf of M/s.Unishire with an intent to delay the project

and to buy the time. When the plaintiff came to know of it,

the case was withdrawn voluntarily by M/s.Unishire.



      It is then stated in para-11 of the suit that on account

of certain differences between the parties a suit was filed

earlier before the present Arbitrator and a compromise was

entered into before the said Arbitrator and thereafter the

parties entered into a Sharing Agreement with respect to the

shares in terms of the Development Agreement. It is clearly

stated in the Sharing Agreement that the terms of the

Development Agreement are intact and shall not be deemed

to a waiver of any of the rights of the parties on account of

signing the Sharing Agreement dated 1.7.2017.



      The averments at para-13 of the suit are in connection

with the delay on the part of the defendant No.1 in

                                7

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


completing the project and the terms of the Development

Agreement being violated and further many of the works still

remaining to be completed.      The said works are tiles not

being laid in the flats, development works not complete in

common area, plastering and painting work not done inside

the flats, electrical fittings not installed in flats and common

areas, no sanitary fittings being installed in the flats and in

the common area, no water connection provided to the flats

and drainage pipes not being connected to the BWSSB

pipes. Apart from this, the plaintiff has also mentioned that

the work was to be completed within 30 months from

22.10.2012 with additional grace period of 6 months with

damages and there was no virtual completion of the owners

share of the flats and even as on the date of the suit, the

construction has not been completed in terms of the

Development Agreement.





      It is the further case of the plaintiff that in collusion

with the BBMP authorities, the defendant No.1 has obtained

                              8

                                          A.S. No.25003/2023


Occupancy Certificate (OC) on 5.12.2020.        The plaintiff

preferred Writ Petition before the Hon'ble High Court of

Karnataka challenging the OC and the court observed that

the OC is contrary to the established Bye-laws and following

this and other observations, the plaintiff withdrew the writ

petition. The defendant No.1 called upon the plaintiff to pay

a sum of Rs.11,12,90,253/-.      This claim is frivolous one

because the question of refund will arise only if the

defendant No.1 completes the project in virtual manner and

obtains a certificate from the Architect. No such certificate

from the Architect has been obtained.





     The next averment in the suit is with respect to the

RERA 2016 and according to the plaintiff if there is delay by

the developer in completing the project within the time

agreed, the developer will have to compensate the plaintiff

as per RERA Rules. The plaintiff did insist on the payment

of damages by the defendant No.1 not only for the delay in

                                 9

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


completion of the project but also for not achieving the

maximum FAR.





      It is contended at para 18 that the defendant No.1 is

liable to pay crores of rupees to the plaintiff and on coming

to know that the defendant No.1 is interfering with the

marketing of the flats allotted to the plaintiff, a suit was

filed
 u/S 9 (1) (I) (d)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,

1996 in AA 2533/2021 before the City Civil Court.          Both

parties have filed joint memo, undertaking not to alienate 9

flats fallen to the share of each.





      Nextly, it is contended that on account of the delay in

the project, the defendant No.1 failed to achieve the

maximum FAR and instead of achieving 4.8 FAR the

defendant No.1 achieved only 4.19 FAR. The reduction in

the FAR has led to loss of 8,379 sq ft to the plaintiff which in

terms of amount, works out to Rs.10,04,48,000/-.            The

plaintiff brought this to the notice of the defendant No.1 vide

legal notice dated 23.6.2021 and called upon the defendant

                                    10

                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


No.1 to pay to the plaintiff Rs.40,60,66,400/- and to hand

over 33,839 sq ft of super built up area in the schedule

property.





      On the basis of the afore stand taken and contending

that RERA is applicable to the project in question, on account

of the delay on the part of the defendant No.1 in completing

the   project,   the   plaintiff   has   sought   for   a   sum   of

Rs.47,46,17,454/- at para 24 of the suit giving the details of

the said amount.        It is then contended at para 26 that

though the plaintiff offered to pay Rs.7,50,00,000/- to the

defendant No.1 by way of demand draft, the defendant No.1

failed to receive the same and on account of the delay on the

part of the defendant No.1, the plaintiff could not clear his

liability to the builder of a shopping complex at Dubai. The

plaintiff also suffered opportunity in Dubai and the financial

loss is Rs.42 crores on account of the plaintiff having to

surrender the commercial complex purchased.

                                11


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


      Stating that, the plaintiff on the assurance of the

defendant No.1 that the construction work would be

completed before May 2021, executed a sale deed on

25.1.2021 in respect of Flat NO.1102 to Smt.Rajul Devi and

on account of the delay in completion of the construction

work by the defendant No.1, the plaintiff is paying damages

around Rs.4,16,000/- every month to the said purchaser as

per RERA Rules. The defendant No.1 is trying to alienate

the remaining flats fallen to its share and stating all these

factors from para 26 onwards, the plaintiff has prayed for

the reliefs as mentioned in the very 1st para of this suit.



      4. Being aggrieved by the said Arbitral Award, the

Petitioner has challenged the same on several grounds,

which will be discussed later in the body of the Judgment.



      5. The defendant No.1 has filed a detailed Statement

of Objections/Written Statement on 25.10.2023 and he

prayed to dismiss the said application. The defendant No.2

                                 12

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


not appeared before the court, hence he placed exparte and

the defendant No.1 prayed to dismiss the said application.



      6. I have heard the arguments of the Advocate for the

plaintiff   Sri.S.K.M.Mithun,   and   the   arguments   of   the

Advocate for the defendant No. 1 Sri.Kamalachari. The

Advocate for the plaintiff has filed Written Arguments on

29.07.2024. The Advocate for the defendant No.1 has filed

written arguments on 29.07.2024.





      7.    Based on the above contentions of both parties,

following Points arise for my consideration:-



             1. Whether there are grounds to
                set aside the Impugned Award
                under 
Section 34
 of the
                Arbitration   &   Conciliation
                Act?



             2. What order?



      8. My findings on the above points are as follows:-



             Point No.1:- In the Negative,

             Point No.2:- As per the final Order,
                          for the following:-

                                  13


                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


                             REASONS



        9.    Point No.1:    The plaintiff has preferred a claim

petition      before   the   Learned   Arbitrator   for   claiming

Rs.47,46,17,454/- against the defendant and in the

alternative direct the defendant to hand over to the plaintiff

39,551 sq.ft., of super built up area in the schedule property

mainly on the ground that inordinate delay on the part of the

developer in completing the project in question.



        10.     The learned Arbitrator has rejected the claim

petition and allowed the counter claim of the defendant in

part.





        11. The plaintiff has challenged the said Impugned

Award in this proceeding. The Hon'ble High Court in the

Judgment dated 17.04.2021 in Com. A.P.No.25/2021 (Union

of India vs. M/s Warsaw Engineers), has laid down certain

guidelines/principles about the writing of Judgments in a

Petition filed under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

                               14

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



Conciliation Act
. Keeping in my mind the said guidelines, I

now propose to examine each and every ground urged by

the Petitioner specifically with reference to the submissions

made by both Advocates.





      12.     The First ground is that the Tribunal erred in

holding that there is no delay on the part of the defendant

No.1 in construction in spite of coming to conclusion in para-

69 of the Award that there is roughly 4 years delay in

obtaining sanctioned plan.





      12.a.     The learned advocate for the petitioner has

argued that impugned award is contrary to 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act.        Since, most of the

contentions put forth by the petitioner have been rejected

without any reason. This is the violative of public policy on

this delay point alone award is liable to be set aside.



      12.b.     I have perused award passed by the sole

arbitrator in award para No.63 to 75 the Hon'ble Arbitrator

                              15

                                          A.S. No.25003/2023


discussed delay aspect looking to the terms of the Ex.P.1

and Ex.P.3 and other document and based on evidence and

based on facts and circumstances of the case and came to

the conclusion that there is no delay on the part of the

defendant No.1 in construction of the building.



     12.c. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



 
12.d. In the present case the learned Arbitrator has

given cogent reasons and made detailed discussions in the

para-67 of the Award and as per Ex.P.1 clause-4 (1) (a) clear

that the developer/respondent to obtain sanction plan within

6 months from the date of joint development agreement; i.e.,

22.10.2012. Further the Award stated that if the delay is

due to any act or clog on the title of the owner/petitioner

same is to be excluded. Further, he has framed 17 Issues

and P.W.1 and R.W.1 examined and Ex.P.1 to 29 and Ex.R.1

                                16

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


to R.88 (a) documents are got marked and made discussions

Issue wise and has given finding on each Issue by

discussing the same in detail. At any stretch of imagination,

it can be considered that it is not a reasoned order as

contended by the Petitioner. Further, in this aspect, it is to be

noted that in the decision reported in A.I.R. - 1988 - S.C. -

1340 (
Indian Oil Corporation vs. Indian Carbon Ltd
), it is

held as follows:-






"It is one thing to say that reasons should be stated and

another thing to state that a detailed judgment is to be given

in support of an award. Even if it be held it is obligatory to

state the reason, it is not obligatory to give a detailed

judgment".





 
12.e. A similar view was also taken by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the decision reported in A.I.R. - 1989 -

S.C. - 973 (
Gujarat Water Supply vs. Unique Erectors
).


                              17


                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



 
12.f. Similar views were expressed by Full Bench (5

Hon'ble Judges Bench) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

decision reported in A.I.R. - 1991 - S.C. - 2089 (
Goa, Daman

& Diu Housing Board vs. Ramakant V.P. Darvotkar
),

wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-


"There is however nothing to show that the awards have

been improperly procured. There is no allegation, far less,

any finding, that the Arbitrator was biased or unfair or he

has not heard both the parties or he has not fairly

considered the submission of the parties in making the

award in question. In our opinion, it is evident from the four

awards made by the Arbitrator, that the Arbitrator has

considered the submission of the parties in making the

award in question. In our opinion, it is evident from the four

awards made by the Arbitrator, that the Arbitrator has

considered all the relevant issues raised by the parties in

the Arbitrator proceedings and came to his finding after

giving cogent reasons. The above award cannot under any

                                18

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


circumstances be considered to be made by the Arbitrator

without recording any reasons for the same. Therefore, in

such circumstances, it is not proper to hold that the

Arbitrator has misconducted himself or the proceedings in

the matter of giving the awards".





      12.g. In another decision reported in 2014 (9) - S.C.C.


- 212 (
Anand Brothers Private Limited vs. Union of India and

Others
), at Para No. 12 has considered and decided the

phrase 'finding' and in Para No. 13 defined the phrase

"conclusion" and further regarding the finding and speaking

order the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para No. 14 has held as

under:-






"It is trite that a finding can be both; a finding of fact or a

finding of law........This is the rule also in the case of finding

of fact where too the process of reasoning must be disclosed

in order that it is accepted as a finding in the sense the

expression is used in Clause 70".

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



     12.h. By considering the ratio of the above-mentioned

decisions, in the present case, the learned Arbitrator has

given cogent reasons and made detailed discussions in the

Impugned Award. Therefore, in view of the ratio of the

aforesaid decisions, it has to be examined by perusing of the

Impugned Award wherein the learned Arbitrator dealt with

each and every claim separately and recorded the reasoning

for allowing or disallowing the claim. Hence, as per the ratio

of the above decisions, the said contentions of the Petitioner

cannot be accepted. The award cannot be set aside on the

said ground.   Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Subsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.



     13. The Second ground is that the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact the defendant No.1 had been given

                               20

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


irrevocable authorization to enter 'A' schedule property vide

Ex.P.1 for the purpose of construction.





      13.a.   The learned advocate for the petitioner has

argued that the impugned award is in contravention to the

Ex.P.1. Award being contrary to the Ex.P.1, same is to be

interfered with this ground, same is illegal opposed to public

policy.





      13.b.   On perusal of Ex.P.1 the terms between the

parties, it cannot be held that the learned Arbitrator is

completely ignored the term of Ex.P.1 and traversed beyond

all the terms of the contract while interpreting the same.



      13.c. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



      13.d.   The learned Advocate for the defendant No.1

has argued that the defendant No.1 has completed the

                               21

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


works as per agreements and claimed the amount in

accordance with agreed terms, that there is no evidence on

record to show that the plaintiff has raised any objection

with regard to the work completed by the defendant No.1.



     13.e.     The learned Advocate for the plaintiff by

referring to the Cross-examination of DW.1 has argued that

the DW.1 has admitted that there is no obstacle to enter into

the premises and there is authorization to enter the suit

schedule 'A' property.





     13.f.   Therefore an award warrants interference by

the court u/S 34 of the Aribtration and Conciliation Act only

when it contravenes a substantive provision of law or patent

illegal or shocks the conscious of the court and that plausible

or reasonable view taken by the Arbitrator even if same is

based on insufficient evidence is not substituted by the

court. Hence, this ground is not available for the petitioner

under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of

the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge

                               22

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.



      13.g. The scheme of the Act, when seen as a whole,

is to minimise the interference by the courts during the

arbitration proceedings. That is why 
Section 5
 specifically

prohibits any judicial authority to intervene in the arbitration

proceedings, notwithstanding anything contained in the

other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by


Part I of the Act
 except to the extent provided for in the Act.

The aforesaid scheme is also evident from 
Sections 13
 and


16
 of the Act, which provide that issues relating to challenge

to the arbitral tribunal on grounds of justifiable doubt,

competence (qualification), and jurisdiction of the tribunal

cannot be agitated midway when the arbitral proceedings

are on, and such challenges should await the making of the

award by the tribunal."





 
13.h. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision reported

in (2018) 9 - S.C.C. 49 (
Emkay Global Financial Services

                               23

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


Ltd. vs. Girdhar Sondhi
) has held that an application under


Section 34
 of the Act for setting aside an arbitral award will

not ordinarily require anything beyond the record that was

before the arbitrator. I, have carefully perused the arbitral

record and it is observed that as per 
Section 19(2)
 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, no procedure between the

parties was agreed to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in

conducting its proceedings. It is further observed that the

learned Arbitrator rightfully exercised the power vested in

him under the mandate of 
Section 19(3)
 and 
19(4)
 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Hence, the arbitral award is

neither against the fundamental policy of India nor in

contravention of law. Thus, the challenge by the respondent

calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this count is

rejected.






      14. The Third ground is that in para-69 of the award

has erred in coming to the conclusion the possession of the

                               24

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


schedule 'A' property was handed over to the defendant

No.1 vide Ex.P.4.





     14.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that the possession of the schedule 'A' property has handed

over to the defendant No.1 vide Ex.P.4. Without any base

tribunal came to wrong conclusion. It is to be noted that in

para-69 of the award the suit came to be disposed on

16.10.2015.    Thus, challenge to the title of the owner is

removed only in the year 2015 and possession of the

schedule property was handed over to the developer by the

owner as per agreement dated 20.7.2013 as per Ex.P.4. So,

Arbitrator rightly given finding on that aspect.    Therefore,

there are no grounds to accept the said contention. Herein

this ground is not available for the petitioner. Hence, this

ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

                              25

                                          A.S. No.25003/2023


for the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is

rejected.





      15. The Fourth ground is that the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the law 
laid down in
 AIR 2000 SC 2633 and

2008 (6) SCC 745.        When the terms of the registered

document cannot be altered by way of unregistered

document.





      15.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that registered document cannot be altered by way of

unregistered document.





      15.b. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of

the plaintiff is bound to all terms and conditions of the

agreements and cannot subsequently choose the defence

that subsequent agreement is unregistered the terms of the

agreement which is/are favourable or suits them to

circumvent his legal obligation arising out of the agreement.

The plaintiff understood the disputed involved in the

                                  26

                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


arbitration proceedings filed pleadings produced oral as well

as documentary evidence fully participated in the arbitration

proceedings     without   any    objection   in   the   arbitration

proceedings, now he raised objection challenged the plaintiff

is   estopped   from   raising    such   a   contention   in   this

proceeding.





 
15.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     16.     The Fifth ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that Mr.Pratik Mehta is the partner of the

defendant No.1.





     16.a.     The learned advocate for the petitioner has

argued that tribunal failed to appreciate fact that Mr.Pratik

Mehta is the partner of the defendant No.1.



     16.b. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



 
16.c.    This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.    Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

                               28

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      17.    The Sixth Ground is the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that if there was any issue from

                               29

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


M/s.Unishire the defendant No.1 would not have entered

into Ex.P.1 and parted amount to the plaintiff.



     17.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that if there was

any issue from M/s.Unishire the defendant No.1 would not

have entered into Ex.P.1 and parted amount to the plaintiff.



 
17.b.   This ground is in the nature of ground to be

urged in the appeal. In order to answer this ground I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1 & 3, which is not permissible

under law. The position in law is well settled that this court

while exercising power
 u/s 34
 of the Act does not sit as a

court of appeal.   The nature of proceeding is summary in

nature.   is summary in nature as held in the decision

reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -

S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
).

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under

Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the

                               30

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.






        18. The Seventh ground is that the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the evidence of P.W.1 wherein the plaintiff has

categorically stated in the suit of the M/s.Unishire is a

collusive suit instigated by the defendant No.1 to buy time

for construction and it is not challenged by the defendant

No.1.





        18.a. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



        18.b.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.    
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

                                31

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings.





      18.c. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



 
18.d.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

                              32

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     19. The Eighth ground is that the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that suit of M/s.Unishire vide Ex.R.7

never an impediment for the defendant No.1 to obtain plan

sanctioned and start construction.





     19.a. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



     19.b.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

                                33

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings.





      19.c. In this regard the Hon'ble Arbitrator in para-69

of the Award observed that, the schedule property was the

subject matter of the suit and the suit came to be disposed

off only in 2015.    Therefore, challenged to the title of the

owner was removed only in the year 2015 and perusal of

the Ex.P.1 Joint Development Agreement Page-21 and 22

and r/w clause-b of joint development agreement Ex.P.1

page-33.





      19.d. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

                               34

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.



 
19.e.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                               35

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     20.     The Ninth ground is that the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that during the pendency of O.S.

No.27119/2012 the defendant No.1 had started excavation

made payment to IDBI Bank and made payment to the

plaintiff, hence finding of the defendant No.2 the O.S.

No.27119/2012 will be clog as per clause-4 (i) (a) of Ex.P.1

is in conflict with most basic notions of morality and justice

as per 
Sec.34 (2) (b) (ii)
 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act

and hence award has to be set aside.





     20.a.    The learned counsel for the petitioner argued

that tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that during the

pendency of O.S. No.27119/2012 the defendant No.1 has

started the excavation made payment to the IDBI Bank and

made payment to the plaintiff.     Hence, award is violative of

Section 34 of the Aribtration and Conciliation Act.

                              36


                                          A.S. No.25003/2023



     20.b.   Here in this case, clause-4 (i) (a) of Ex.P.1 in

page No.11, which reads thus:





"The Developer/Respondent shall get the requisite plans,

drawings, designs etc., for construction of multi storied

complex prepared as per the building Byelaws, Rules and

Regulations that shall be in force from time to time and

obtain due sanction of the plan/s, license from BBMP and

or any other competent local authority within six months

from this date. If the delay is due to any act of omission or

comm ission on the part of the Owner/Petitioner or for the

reason of clog on the title of the Owner/Petitioner, the same

shall be excluded for this purpose.   The Owner/Petitioner

shall co-operate fully in this regard by signing all forms,

applications, bonds, affidavits and or any other papers as

may be sought for/required by the Developer/Respondent

and or any authority."

                               37


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



      20.c.    And perusal of the para-71 of the Award

observe that clause-1 of Ex.P.3 the mode and timeline in

which the loans are to be cleared by the owner/petitioner.



 
20.d.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                              38

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      21. The Tenth ground is that the Tribunal in para-70

of the Award has erred in coming to conclusion that

possession of the suit schedule 'A' property was handed

over to defendant No.1 vide Ex.P.4 and excluding period till

Ex.P.4 is contrary to the terms of Ex.P.1. Further contrary to

the law laid and reasoning given in Award is contrary to the

basic law and as such is in contravention with fundamental

policy of Indian Law and is in conflict with most basic

notions of justice.





      21.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that the tribunal in para-70 of the award has erred in

coming to conclusion that possession of the suit 'A' property

was handed over to the defendant No.1 vide Ex.P.4 and

reasoning to contrary to the law.

                                39


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



      21.b.    Perusal of the records and according to JDA,

total period for completion of project within 30 months + 6

additional months, from date of issuance of commencement

certificate.     Commencement        Certificate   issued    on

19.01.2017. Period of completion as per JDA: 18.01.2020.

Completion      Certificate:   10.10.2019.           Therefore,

Developer/Respondent has completed the project well before

18.01.2020.      With reference to the clauses of Ex.P.1,

documents marked in evidence, the question of delay in the

construction on part of the developer does not arise.



 
21.c.    This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.    
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      22. The Eleventh Ground is that the Tribunal failed to

notice that Ex.R.41 is not issued by the building Architect

and Tribunal failed to notice that as per terms of the Ex.P.1

clause-2 (a) (i) (iii) the building Architect has to issue the

completion certificate not by any third party Architect.



 
22.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

                               41

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      23. The Twelveth Ground is that the Tribunal at para-

70 of the Award erred in coming to conclusion that the

building is complete as on 18.01.2020 in spite of plaintiff

producing Ex.P.6, P.29 photographs and Ex.P.23 and P.24

which clearly discloses the construction in the building is

                                42

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


still in process and the building was not facilitated with

water connection and power connection and said documents

are not in dispute. The Tribunal coming to the conclusion

that the building was completed by 18.01.2020 is totally in

conflict with basic notion of justice.





 
23.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal. 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996

does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

                              43

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     24. The Thirteenth Ground is that the Tribunal erred

in not appreciating the fact that as on the date of Ex.P.1 the

loan amount outstanding payable to IDBI Bank is only

Rs.12.3 Crores and loan account of the plaintiff was

regularized and same is evident Ex.P.20 the Tribunal in

para-79 of the Award has wrongly come to the conclusion

that the loan amount is Rs.22 Crores.





     24.a.     The learned advocate for the petitioner has

argued that arbitrator not looked Ex.P.1 & 2 and made

wrong award.





     24.b. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

                               44


 
A.S. No.25003/2023


evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      25. The Fourteenth Ground is that the Tribunal has

failed to appreciate the fact that JDA was entered into clear

loan of IDBI Bank, Sheriff Constructions loan and to meet

other financial commitments of the plaintiff, the defendant

                               45

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


No.2 coming to conclusion that plaintiff has to pay

Rs.1,06,00,000/- towards interest is illegal.



      25.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the tribunal has not appreciated the fact that JDA was

entered into clear loan of IDBI Bank, Shariff Constructions

loan and to meet other financial commitments of the plaintiff.

But, the Arbitrator held that plaintiff has to pay interest is

illegal one.





      25.b. In Award para No.72, it is held that Ex.R.3 has

not been disputed by the owner/petitioner.      From Ex.R.2

and R.3, it is clearly established that developer/respondent

has paid the monies to IDBI and also Sheriff Constructions.

Payments were made through DD and/or RTGS, hence,

excess of Rs.1.06 crores was paid towards interst.         In

Award Para No.73, it is held that owner/petitioner has not

placed any proof or evidence of having paid Rs.7.5 crores

within one year from the date of the last instalment to IDBI

                               46

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


and another amount of Rs.7.5 crores within 6 weeks from

the developer/respondent obtaining completion certificate.



 
25.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                                   47

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      26.     The Fifteenth Ground is that the Tribunal has

erred in not appreciating the fact that it was the defendant

No.1 insisted the plaintiff to seek the time from the IDBI

Bank to repay the loan and now holding the plaintiff to pay

the interest amount is illegal.





      26.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 14th ground above.           For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.





      27. The Sixteenth Ground is that the plaintiff out of

the Rs.8 Crore paid under Ex.P.1 has repaid the M/s.Sheriff

                               48

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


Construction loan upon the instructions of defendant No.1,

hence finding of the defendant No.2 the Rs.8 Crores should

have been paid to the IDBI Bank is incorrect.



      27.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that the plaintiff out of the Rs.8 Crore paid under Ex.P.1 has

repaid   the   M/s.Sheriff    Construction    loan   upon   the

instructions of defendant No.1, hence finding of the

defendant No.2 the Rs.8 Crores should have been paid to

the IDBI Bank is incorrect.





 
27.b. As per Ex.P.1 the plaintiff out of Rs.8 crore paid

under Ex.P.1 has repaid M/s.Shariff Construction loan upon

the instruction of the defendant No.1. This fact is ignored by

the arbitrator. With this background if this ground is read

this ground is in the nature of and tenor of appeal. In order

to answer this ground I have to make reappreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

                               49

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     28.    The Seventeenth Ground is that the Tribunal

erred in para-72 of the Award that the respondent has paid

interest, because the respondent wanted time to repay the

loan of IDBI Bank. Hence, holding that plaintiff is liable to

pay interest is illegal and is in conflict with most basic

notions of morality and justice as per 
Sec.34 (2) (b) (ii)
 of

Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

                                 50


                                              A.S. No.25003/2023



      28.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 14th ground above.          For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.





      29.     The Eighteenth Ground is that the Tribunal in

spite of knowing that flats are handed over to the plaintiff in

the month of August and October 2022 and holding that

there is no delay on part of defendant No.1 is absolutely is

in conflict with most basic notion of morality and justice as

per 
Sec.34 (2) (b) (ii)
 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act.



      29.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot

accept the said contention of the petitioner.        Hence, this

ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)

                               51

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.





      30. The Twentieth Ground is that the Tribunal in para

74 of the Award has stated the factors which lead to delay

on the part of the developer is contrary to records and

evidence and is in conflict with the basic notions of morality

and justice as per 
Sec.34 (2) (b) (ii)
 of Arbitration and

Conciliation Act.





      30.a. In Arbitral award in para No.74 it is observed

that the other factors that leads to the inference that there is

no delay on part of the developer/respondent are writ

petition filed by the neighbours to the schedule property and

the consequent writ appeal filed, which was dismissed only

in 2018.

                                52


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



      30.b.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot

accept the said contention of the petitioner.        Hence, this

ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)

and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.





      31.     The Twenty-First Ground is that the Tribunal

erred in not understanding the fact that the plaintiff entered

into JDA with an intent to clear IDBI loan, Sheriff

Constructions loan and other personal loans and also save

his properties in Dubai and holding that para 75 of the

Award the time is not essence of the agreement is in conflict

with the most basic notions of morality and justice as per


Sec.34 (2)(b)(ii)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.



      31.a.    The learned counsel for the petitioner argued

that the tribunal in para-75 of the award wrongly held that

                                53

                                               A.S. No.25003/2023


time is not the essence of the agreement and it is against the

principle of law.





       31.b. It is observed that time is not the essence of the

contract and I have perused clause (4) (i) (c) of JDA. It states

that   the   developer/respondent      shall     commence    the

construction immediately after obtaining the building plans

duly approved in terms of this agreement and complete the

construction within 30 months from the date of obtaining

commencement certificate from the planning authority,

subject to delay that might be caused by unforeseen

incidents like litigation, scarcity of materials, or acts of God.

However, the owner/petitioner does hereby agree to provide

an     additional    period    of    six    months      to   the

developer/respondent to complete the project, which the

developer/respondent may need due to any unforeseen

factors/developments.     Completion of construction in this

regard means virtual completion. Virtual completion means

the owner/petitioner share of flats shall be in habitable

                               54

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


condition. In the event of delay on the part of the developer/

respondent to complete the construction as above, the

developer/respondent will be liable to pay a sum of Rs.15/-

per sq.ft., of saleable super built up area falling to the share

of the owner/petitioner. However, if the delay is beyond 12

months from the stipulated period the owner/petitioner shall

be liberty to take over the project and complete the project at

the cost of the owner/petitioner deductible from the

developer/respondent's share of construction." Insertion of

penalty clauses and additional period of 6 months are all

indicative of the fact that the time is not the essence of the

agreement between the parties. Hon'ble supreme Court, in

the case of Chandrani v/s Kamalrani (1993) 1 SCC 519 held

that the stipulation of the time is the essence of the contract

will have to be read along with other terms of the contract.

If clauses provide an extension of time under certain

contengencies or if there are clauses for payment of fines or

penalty for every day or week, such clauses would render

the provision relating to time being of the essence,

                               55

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


ineffective. Therefore, the developer/respondent cannot be

held responsible for the delay in the completion of the

project.





 
31.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.    
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                               56

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      32. The Twenty-Second Ground is that the Tribunal in

para 74 of the award has stated the factors which lead to

delay in on the part of the developer is contrary to records

and evidence and is in conflict with the most basic notions of

morality and justice as per 
Sec.34 (2)(b)(ii)
 of Arbitration and

Conciliation Act.





      32.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot

accept the said contention of the petitioner.      Hence, this

ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)

and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.

                                57


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



      33.     The Twenty-Third Ground is that the Tribunal

erred in not understanding the fact that the plaintiff entered

into JDA with an intent to clear IDBI loan, Sheriff

Constructions loan and other personal loans and also save

his properties in Dubai and holding that para-75 of the

award the time is not essence of the agreement is in conflict

with the most basic notions of morality and justice as per


Sec.34 (2)(b)(ii)
 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act.



      33.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 21st ground above.         For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      34.     The Twenty-forth Ground is that the Tribunal

erred in not appreciating the fact that as per Clause 4 (a)

                               58

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


and 4 (c) of Ex.P.1, wherein it is categorically stated that the

defendant No.1 has to obtain sanction plan within 6 months

from 22.10.2012 and immediately after obtaining plan

sanction should complete the construction within 30 months

and completion should be in habitable manner and virtual

completion as per the terms of Ex.P.1, by this it is very

evident and clear that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 had

agreed that the time is the essence of the agreement, the

tribunal holding that by unforeseen factors, by unforeseen

incidents and agreement providing extension clauses and

payment of fine or penalty for everyday or week would

absolve the responsibility of the defendant No.1 from the

terms of the Ex.P.1 is in conflict within terms of JDA and

also is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality and

justice as per 
Section 34 (2) (b) (iii)
 of Arbitration and

Conciliation Act.





      34.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 21st ground above.        For the same reasons I

                                59

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      35.     The Twenty-fifth Ground is that the Tribunal

erred in not appreciating the fact that in the sharing

agreement itself which is marked as Ex.P.5 at para 10 it is

clearly stated that Ex.P.5 shall not be a waiver of any rights

of the plaintiff.





      35.a.     The learned advocate for the petitioner has

drawn my attention about Ex.P.5 and has argued that the

tribunal is not appreciating the fact in this case.



 
35.b. On perusal of Ex.P.5 along with submission of

the advocate for the petitioner is concerned.         In order to

interfere this ground I have to make reappreciation of the

                               60

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


evidence admitted before the learned Arbitrator. 
Section 34


of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower

the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence

produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge

if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.

The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not

permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the

findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over

his findings. The nature of proceedings under 
Section 34
 of

the Act is summary in nature as held in the decision

reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -

S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
).

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under

Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.


                               61


                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



      36.     The Twenty-Sixth Ground is that the Tribunal

erred in not appreciating the fact vide Ex.R.33 Joint Memo

filed by the both the plaintiff and defendant No.1, it is

categorically agreed that the plaintiff can seek damages for

the delayed performance against defendant No.1.            The

tribunal still holding that time is not essence of Ex.P.1 and

holding there is no delay is in conflict with the most basic

notions of morality and justice.





      36.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 21st ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      37. The Twenty-Seventh Ground is that the Tribunal

failed to appreciate the fact that the defendant No.1 would

                                62

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


not have cleared IDBI Loan amount and would not have

made further payments to plaintiff if there was any clog over

the title of the schedule 'A' property.





 
37.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                               63

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


 
38.     The Twenty-Eighth Ground is that the Tribunal

has failed to appreciate the fact that the law 
laid down by


the Hon'ble Apex Court in 1993 (1) SCC 519 is not applicable

to facts of this case.






      38.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 21st ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      39.     The Twenty-Ninth Ground is that the Tribunal

failed to appreciate the fact that the plaintiff had issued

demand draft bearing No.504388 dated 27.02.2019 and

                              64

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


vide Ex.P.21 email, wherein the plaintiff had stated that he

would transfer more and proved that they had 7.5 crores

bank balance.





      39.a. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be

urged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have

to reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and

evidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.

Under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of

the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.





      40. The Thirtieth Ground is that the Tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that the defendant No.1 who took the DD

mentioned above subsequently with a malafide intention

with ulterior motives to claim super built up area of

defendant No.1 returned the demand draft.

                               65


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



 
40.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


                               66


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



      41. The thirtifirst ground is that the findings of the

trial court at para No.73 of the award that the plaintiff failed

to prove that he tried to return Rs.7.5 Crores is in conflict

with the most basic notions of morality and justice.



      41.a. The learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that

tribunal in para-73 of the award contrary to the law and

findings are against the principle of 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act.





 
41.b. There is no positive evidence produced by the

petitioner to show that petitioner has arranged funds of

Rs.7.5 crore. So, from the argument of the petitioner and

from the argument of the respondent and from the material

available on record, it requires reappreciation of evidence.

But, 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996

does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

                               67

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     42. The Thirtisecond ground is that the Tribunal erred

in not appreciating the fact that none of the factors stated in

the para No.74 of the award the plaintiff can be held

responsible and further no pleadings and evidence or

document produced by the defendant No.1 stating plaintiff

intervened in the construction.

                               68


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



      42.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that tribunal patently erred and not appreciating pleading

and evidence before the tribunal and has completely ignored

the oral and documentary evidence.





 
42.b.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal. 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996

does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

                               69

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      43. The Thirtithird ground is that the Tribunal erred in

not appreciating the fact that when the defendant No.1

expressed its difficulty in completion of the project plaintiff

brought M/s.Star Bazar and introduced defendant No.1 and

the plaintiff suggested to do commercial property, but the

defendant No.1 refused to do it.





 
43.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal. 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996

does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     44. The Thirtifourth ground is that the Tribunal erred

in not appreciating the fact that the plaintiff thought was

very co-operative and the plaintiff never intervened in any

aspects of construction and tribunal coming to conclusion at

para 75 of the award the delay is caused due to conduct of

the plaintiff is in conflict with the most basic notions of

morality and justice.





     44.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

                               71


 
A.S. No.25003/2023


evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      45. The Thirtififth ground is that the Tribunal in para

No.77 of the award has come to conclusion that the plaintiff

based on Ex.P.5 sharing agreement is claiming he is an

                                 72

                                         A.S. No.25003/2023


allottee is baseless findings and contrary to provisions of


RERA Act
.





      45.a.   The learned counsel for the petitioner argued

that tribunal in para-77 of the award come to the conclusion

based on Ex.P.5 sharing agreement is claiming he is an

allottee is baseless finding.





      45.b.    I have perused the Karnataka Real Estate

Regulatory Authority has clarified and confirmed that,

keeping in mind the objectives of the 
RERA Act, 2016
 the

Land Owners are considered as "Promoter" for the said Act.



      45.c.   I have perused award No.78 it clearly stated

that the JDA at Ex.P.1 reveals that, it was an agreement

between the owner of the schedule property and the

developer and the Sharing Agreement. Ex.P.5 only speaks

of what flats or units had fallen to the share of the owner

and what had fallen to the share of the developer. Merely

because the word 'allotee' in the Schedule 'B' and 'C' is

                               73

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


used in the Sharing Agreement Ex.P.5, it does not lead to the

conclusion that the owner is an allottee coming within the

definition of the RERA. At best, the owner can be brought

within the ambit of a promoter, but he cannot be called as

'allottee' under the RERA.





     45.d.    I have perused award No.79 & 80 it clearly

stated that once it is held that the owner/petitioner is not an

allotee, the question of applicability of 
Section 18
 does not

arise. RERA is a 
Special Act
 and it bars the jurisdiction of

other Courts with regard to adjudication of a mater falling

within the RERA. The Tribunal, cannot adjudicate upon the

matter, which falls within the purview of the authority under

RERA. The jurisdiction of an arbitrator is confined to four

corners of the reference and in the absence of any specific

provision in the arbitration agreement.





     45.e. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

                                74


 
A.S. No.25003/2023


evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


 
46. The Thirtisixth ground is that the Tribunal erred in

not applying the law 
laid down in
 AIR 2021 SC 70 where in

allottees where sanctioned damages more than what is

stipulated in the agreement.


                               75


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



 
46.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


                                   76


                                                 A.S. No.25003/2023



     47.     The Thirtiseventh ground is that the defendant

No.1 who is a promoter as per Ex.P.1 under clause 1 (b) has

agreed to transfer 50% super built up area to plaintiff which

is in accordance with the definition of allottee under 
Section

2 (d)
 of RERA Act.         The definition of allottee categorically

states that if the promoter agrees to transfer flat or plot in

any mode of transfer other than lease the person who is

getting his share is an allottee the same is canvassed by the

plaintiff before the trial court and also filed written

arguments mentioning the same, the tribunal without even

looking    into   written    arguments     and     also   arguments

advanced and holding that vide Ex.P.5 the plaintiff will not

become     allottee   is    perverse    findings    and   it   is   in

contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law and

is in conflict with the most basic notions of justice and the

same is a ground for setting aside the Award under 
Section

34 (b) (ii)
 - Explanation 1 (ii) & (iii) of the 
Arbitration and

Conciliation Act
 of 1996.

                                77


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



      47.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.         For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      48.     The Thirtieighth ground is that the Tribunal

completely misunderstood the law laid down under the


RERA Act
 and has wrongly come to conclusion in para No.78

of the award that the plaintiff is not an allottee.



      48.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.         For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

                               78

                                          A.S. No.25003/2023


for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      49. The Thirtininth ground is that the Tribunal at para

No.79 of the award, erred in coming to conclusion that the

tribunal has no right to adjudicate the matter which falls

within the purview of RERA is a perverse findings and it is

in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law.



      49.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that the arbitrator erred in coming to the conclusion that

Tribunal has no right to adjudicate the matter which falls

within the purview of RERA.





      49.b. The Arbitrator referred the Hon'ble Apex Court

judgment principle 
laid down in
 it and held that question of

the Arbitration considering 
Section 18
 of the RERA in the

award of any claim being found in the developer against

Ex.P.1. Therefore, cannot arise. Therefore, 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the

                               79

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence

produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge

if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.

The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not

permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the

findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over

his findings. 
The nature of proceedings under 
Section 34
 of

the Act is summary in nature as held in the decision

reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -

S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
).

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under

Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.






      50. The Fortieth ground is that the Tribunal erred in

applying the principles of 2007 (4) SCC 697 & 2007 (4) SCC

697 to the facts of this case, the tribunal is bound by

                               80

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


applying law down under RERA provisions, the tribunal has

to follow fundamental policy of Indian law.



      50.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      51. The Fortifirst ground is that the Tribunal erred in

not applying the law 
laid down in
 MANU/DE/1647/2022

wherein it is categorically held that the arbitrator can apply

the provisions of RERA rules for determining damages.



      51.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

                               81

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      52. The Fortisecond ground is that the Tribunal erred

in not appreciating the fact that the 
RERA Act
 came into

force on 01.05.2016 and all projects which are yet to be

completed the statute mandated that the promoters should

obtain registration from RERA and provisions of RERA would

be applicable till the completion or occupancy certificate is

obtained.





      52.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

                              82

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      53. The Fortithird ground is that the Tribunal erred in

coming to conclusion that as on the execution of JDA the

RERA act was not in force and giving a finding in para

No.80 of the award that the considering 
Section 18
 of RERA

in the absence of such clause in Ex.P.1 is perverse finding

and the reasoning given that 
section 18
 of RERA act is not

applicable is in contravention with the fundamental policy of

Indian law and is in conflict with the most basic notions of

justice and the same is a ground for setting aside the Award

under 
Section 34 (b) (ii)
 - Explanation 1 (ii) & (iii) of the


Arbitration and Conciliation Act
 of 1996.



      53.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.       For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

                                83

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



Conciliation Act
. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      54. The Fortifourth ground us that the Tribunal failed

to appreciate the fact that the rights of the allottee is

unfettered and as per the 
RERA Act
 the allottee is entitled to

compensation without prejudice to any other remedy, hence

the tribunal holding that plaintiff is not an allottee and is not

entitled to damages is perverse finding.





      54.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.         For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.

                               84


                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



      55. The Fortififth ground is that the conclusion of the

tribunal at para No.80 that the tribunal is not competent to

adjudicate the matter coming within ambit of 
section 18
 of

RERA Act is a perverse finding when relief granted under


Section 18
 is in addition to any other reliefs available to the

allottee further under section 88 of RERA does not bar any

other jurisdiction.





      55.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      56. The Fortiseventh ground is that the tribunal even

after coming to conclusion in para No.81 & 82 of the award

that the maximum FAR the defendant No.1 was supposed to

                                85

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


achieve is 4.8 FAR and admittedly what is achieved as per

Ex.P.7 is 4.256 & tribunal still holding that there is no fault

of defendant No.1 in achieving the maximum FAR is in

conflict with the most basic notions of justice.



      56.a.   The learned counsel for the petitioner argued

that tribunal holding that there is no fault of defendant No.1

in achieving the maximum FAR is contrary to law and it is

hit by 
Sec.34
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.



      56.b. I have perused Clause 4 (b) of the JDA dated

22.10.2012, the respondent achieved maximum of FAR

legally permissible. FAR calculated at the time of "As Built

Plan"; i.e., Ex.R.75, Page No.265-271 was 4.627 as against

the sanctioned 4.48 FAR in the modified sanction plan.

However, as per the Occupancy Certificate dated 5.12.2020,

the FAR is calculated as 4.256. This change in FAR is due

to the Notification bearing No.UDD 255 MNJ 2018 dated

19.6.2019, amending the Zoning Regulation of Bengaluru of

the Revised Master Plan-2015. Therefore, the reduction in

                               86

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


FAR as alleged by the Claimant is owing to the subsequent

amendment in the zoning regulations and not through the

fault of the respondent, as alleged.         In view of the

dimensions of the schedule property, the respondent could

not have put up any additional construction/floors in the

schedule property, as the same would then require higher

setback and higher percentage of open area, which would in

turn reduce the area available for putting up construction.



     56.c.      I have perused award No.80 & 81 it clearly

stated   that    the   owner/developer,   during   his   cross-

examination has stated that the buildable area for FAR 4.8

is 27,475 x 4.8 = 1,31,880 sq.ft., and what is declared by

the BBMP works out to 116768.75 sq.ft., and the difference

is 15,115.25. The witness has admitted to Qn.51 saying

that the FAR achievable depends upon the setback,

coverage, height. He has also admitted in answer to the

said question that in the year 2016, there were certain

changes in the TDR and as a result there is reduced FAR.

                               87


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


Though the witness has stated that there was delay in

obtaining plan sanction, he has not disputed the fact of the

FAR getting reduced.      In the light of the pleadings and

evidence of P.W.1 and R.W.1 and the documents referred,

the respondent cannot be found at fault on account of the

various circumstances referred to by him as mentioned

above, that the FAR that was achieved was only 4.256 and

4.8 could not be achieved.





 
56.d. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

                              88

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


     57.     The Fortieighth ground is that the tribunal has

failed to look into evidence of R.W.1 in his cross-examination

w.r.to question No.120 he admits that he has not taken any

action in obtaining maximum FAR and still holding no fault

can be found in the approach of defendant No.1 in securing

the maximum FAR is wholly perverse findings.



     57.a.      I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 47th ground above.       For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

                                89

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



Conciliation Act
. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      58. The Fortininth ground is that the tribunal without

looking into Ex.P.6 & Ex.P.29 photographs, Ex.P.23 and

Ex.P.24 and also without considering the fact that as per the

order sheet of A.C. No.134/2022 which is clearly indicating

the defendant No.1 handing over 10 flats in August and

October 2022, tribunal still holding that there is no delay in

completion of construction by the defendant No.1 is in

conflict with the most basic notions of justice.



      58.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that tribunal without looking to the Ex.P.6, Ex.P.24 and

Ex.P.29 held that there is no delay in completion of the

construction by the defendant No.1 and it is hit by 
Sec.34
 of

the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.

                                90


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



 
58.b. If this ground is read and the above argument

of the petitioner is considered, it is about to appreciate of the

tribunal records about Ex.P.6, P.24 and P.29 and hence this

ground is in the nature of tenor of appeal.         In order to

interfere this ground I have to make reappreciate under

evidence adduced before the learned arbitrator. 
Section 34


of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower

the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence

produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge

if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.

The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not

permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the

findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over

his findings. The nature of proceedings under 
Section 34
 of

the Act is summary in nature as held in the decision

reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -

S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
).

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under

Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the

                               91

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



Arbitration & Conciliation Act
. Thus, the challenge by the

Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.






      59.     The Fiftieth ground is that the tribunal by not

considering the law 
laid down by
 Hon'ble Supreme Court in

AIR 2022 SC 1824 & AIR 2021 SC 70 in regard to

application of 
section 18
 of RERA Act for determining the

damages and not considering the claim of the plaintiff for a

sum of Rs.52,40,69,454/- is in contravention with the

fundamental policy of Indian law and is in conflict with the

most basic notions of justice and the same is a ground for

setting aside the Award under 
Section 34 (b) (ii)
 -

Explanation 1 (ii) & (iii) of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation

Act
 of 1996.





      59.a.     I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 35th ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

                                92

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      60. The Fiftifirst ground is that the tribunal even after

coming to conclusion there is roughly delay of 4 years in

obtaining plan sanction by defendant No.1 and still holding

in para No.85 of the award stating the plaintiff is not

entitled to Rs.15 per square feet till the completion of

construction according to clause 4 (i) (e) of Ex.P.1 is in

conflict with the most basic notions of justice.



      60.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot

accept the said contention of the petitioner.      Hence, this

ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)

and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

                               93

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      61. The Fiftisecond ground is that the tribunal erred

in para No.86 of the award that the plaintiff has not

produced sufficient evidence to prove for having lost 42

crores in Dubai, in spite of plaintiff producing Ex.P.17 which

is an income tax returns of the plaintiff for the year 2016-17

wherein it clearly discloses that plaintiff had lost 42 crores

in that financial year.





      61.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that tribunal erred in para-86 of the award that the plaintiff

has not produced sufficient evidence to prove for having lost

Rs.42 crore in Dubai in spite of plaintiff producing Ex.P.17

which is income tax returns of the plaintiff for the year 2016-


17.   Hence, it is hit by 
Sec.34
 of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act.

                               94


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



 
61.b. The claimant not produced positive evidence

before the court to establish the fact that claiming sufficient

loss of Rs.42 crore in Dubai. There is absolutely no evidence

placed by the petitioner before the tribunal. This ground is in

the nature and tenor of an appeal.          
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the

Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence

produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge

if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.

The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not

permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the

findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over

his findings. The nature of proceedings under 
Section 34
 of

the Act is summary in nature as held in the decision

reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -

S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
).

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under

Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the

                               95

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.






      62. The Fiftithird ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that the evidence of plaintiff in para

No.59 is not challenged in cross-examination and tribunal

still holding the plaintiff failed to prove loss in Dubai to an

extent of 42 crores is perverse finding.





      62.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 52nd ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      63. The Fiftifourth ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that as per clause 16 of Ex.P.1 wherein

                                96

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


the defendant No.1 had agreed to obtain sanction plan

within 6 months and execute sharing agreement within 15

days and would also do marketing for the sale of flats

which are allotted to the plaintiff and would get sufficient

funds to solve financial crisis in Dubai is not considered by

the tribunal and holding that the plaintiff has failed to prove

the loss of Rs.42 crores and stating no evidence is in correct.



      63.a.    I have discussed about this aspect while

answering 52nd ground above.        For the same reasons I

cannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,

this ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section

(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling

for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is

rejected.





      64. The Fiftififth ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that GST was introduced on 01.07.2017

the   defendant   No.1   was    supposed    to   complete   the

                                  97

                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


construction in all aspects as per the terms mentioned Ex.P.1

was 22.04.2016, because of negligence of the defendant

No.1 GST of 18% got applicable instead of 4% VAT and

findings of the tribunal at para No.91 holding that the

plaintiff is still liable to pay GST is in conflict with the most

basic notions of justice.





      64.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued

that tribunal failed to appreciate the GST was introduced on

1.7.2017. The defendant No.1 was supposed to complete

the construction in all aspects as per the terms of Ex.P.1

was 22.4.2016 and tribunal VAT charges and GST charges

imposed contrary to the law and hence it is hit by 
Section 34


of Arbitration and Conciliation Act.





 
64.b. To give finding on this ground it is appreciate

the document Ex.P.1 and evidence on both sides. But, as

per 
Sec.34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does

not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the

evidence   produced     before    the   Arbitral   Tribunal   and

                               98

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are

correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held

that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      65. The Fiftisixth ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that Rs.15,00,00,000/- is interest free

security deposit amount and the tribunal awarding interest

on the said amount and directing the plaintiff to return with

                               99

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


interest @ 12% P.A. is conflict with terms of Ex.P.1 and P.3

and also in conflict with the most basic notions of justice.



 
65.a.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                               100

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      66.     The Fiftiseventh ground is that the trial court

failed to appreciate the fact that the defendant No.1 as per

the terms of clause 2 (iii) Ex.P.1, the defendant No.1 should

have given the certificate of completion to plaintiff to seek

refund of the amounts, admittedly the defendant is not given

the certificate and further it is admitted in cross of R.W.1

that he has not handed over the certificate to plaintiff hence

the findings of the tribunal to refund the amount is in conflict

with the most basic notions of justice.





 
66.a.    This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.     
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

                              101

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      67.     The Fiftieighth ground is that the tribunal

directing the plaintiff to pay interest amount, electricity

charges & maintenance charges before handing over

possession of flats is in conflict with the most basic notions

of justice.





 
67.a. To answer this ground again it is necessary to

appreciate Ex.R.52 and Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.5 and oral and

documentary evidence. But, this ground is in the nature and

                               102

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


tenor of an appeal.       
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-

appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the

Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the

Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts

have repeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to

examine the correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as

if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of

proceedings under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in

nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.

Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi

Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not

available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-

section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation

Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling for the

setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      68. The Fiftininth ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the fact that nowhere in the Ex.P.1 the plaintiff

                               103

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


has agreed to pay club house charges and tribunal direc ting

plaintiff to pay sum of Rs.85 lakhs is perverse finding,

further club house charges are paid by the purchasers of the

flat, hence order of the tribunal to pay sum of Rs.85 lakhs is

in conflict with the most basic notions of justice.



 
68.a.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

                              104

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      69. The Sixtieth ground is that the tribunal erred in

not appreciating the fact that by virtue of 
Section 16 (2)
 of

Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 the respondent

could not have taken a contention regarding the jurisdiction

of the tribunal.





      69.a.   The learned counsel for the petitioner argued

that tribunal erred not appreciating the fact that by virtue of


Sec.16 (2)
 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1966, the

respondent could not have taken contention regarding the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal, hence it is hit by 
Sec.34
 of the

Arbitration and Conciliation Act.





 
69.b. A plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have

jurisdiction shall be raised not later than submission of the

                               105

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


defence.   However, a party shall not be precluded from

raising such a plea, merely because that he has appointed

or participated in the appointment of the Arbitrator.      This

ground is in the nature and tenor of an appeal. 
Section 34


of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower

the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence

produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge

if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.

The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not

permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the

findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over

his findings. The nature of proceedings under 
Section 34
 of

the Act is summary in nature as held in the decision

reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -

S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
).

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under

Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the

                               106

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on

this ground is rejected.






      70. The Sixtifirst ground is that the tribunal failed to

appreciate the law 
laid down in
 AIR 2016 SC 3488.



 
70.a.   This ground is in the nature and tenor of an

appeal.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

                              107

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      71. The Sixtisecond ground is that the tribunal failed

to consider the citations and written arguments filed by the

plaintiff.





      71.a. This is also general ground and same will be

discussed along with other grounds urged by the petitioner.



      72. The Sixtithird ground is that the award passed by

the tribunal without looking into the documents furnished

and written arguments filed is perverse order and it is liable

to be set aside.





      72.a. This is also general ground and same will be

discussed along with other grounds urged by the petitioner.



      73. The Sixtifourth ground is that the award passed

by the defendant No.2/tribunal is not a speaking award.

                               108


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



      73.a. This is also general ground and same will be

discussed along with other grounds urged by the petitioner.



 
74.   
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,

1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal

are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly

held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the

correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were

sitting in appeal over his findings. In fact, this ground is in

the nature and tenor of appeal. The nature of proceedings

under 
Section 34
 of the Act is summary in nature as held in

the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244

= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( 
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.

Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of


Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the

                                109

                                             A.S. No.25003/2023


challenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of

arbitral award on this ground is rejected.


      75. The scope of this court is limited with regard to


Section 34
 of the Act. The position of law stands crystallized

today, that findings, of fact as well as of law, of the

arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal are ordinarily not amenable to

interference under 
Section 34
 of the Act. The scope of

interference is only where the finding of the Tribunal is

either contrary to the terms of the contract between the

parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that interference, by this court,

is absolutely necessary. The arbitrator is the final arbiter on

facts as well as in law, and even errors, factual or legal,

which stop short of perversity, do not merit interference

under 
Section 34
 of the Act. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi

in the decision reported in 2015 - S.C.C. OnLine - Del -

13192 (P.C.L. Suncon (JV) vs. NHAI), in Paragraph No. 24

has held as follows :-

                                110


                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


"24. As a postscript, this Court believes that it is imperative

to   sound    a   word    of   caution.   Notwithstanding   the

considerable jurisprudence advising the Courts to remain

circumspect in denying the enforcement of arbitral awards,

interference with the awards challenged in the petitions

before them has become a matter of routine, imperceptibly

but surely erasing the distinction between arbitral tribunals

and courts. 
Section 34
 jurisdiction calls for judicial restraint

and an awareness that the process is removed from

appellate review. Arbitration as a form of alternate dispute

resolution, running parallel to the judicial system, attempts

to avoid the prolix and lengthy process of the courts and

presupposes parties consciously agreeing to submit a

potential dispute to arbitration with the object of actively

avoiding a confrontation in the precincts of the judicial

system. If a court is allowed to review the decision of the

arbitral tribunal on the law or on the merits, the speed and,

above all, the efficacy of the arbitral process is lost."

                               111


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023



 
76.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision

reported in (2006) 11 - S.C.C. - 181 ( 
McDermott

International Inc. vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Ors
 .), has

held as follows :-






"52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role

of courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure

fairness.   Intervention of the court is envisaged in few

circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the

arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot

correct errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award

leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is

desired. So, scheme of the provision aims at keeping the

supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can

be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious

decision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for

arbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered

by it."

                             112


                                         A.S. No.25003/2023



     77.   Thus, it is observed and held that the arbitral

award is not marred by any patent illegality, as there is no

contravention of the substantive law of India, which would

result in the death knell of an arbitral award. It is also

observed that there is no patent illegality in the arbitral

award, which must go to the root of the matter. The arbitral

award is also a well reasoned and a speaking award. The

arbitral award is also held to not be in contravention of


Section 28(3)
 of the Act, which pertains to the terms of the

contract, trade usages applicable to the nature of contract

and substance of dispute.





     78. 
The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act,

2015
 made major changes to 
Section 34
. The changes were

suggested by the 246th Report of the Law Commission of

India on Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,

1996 of August 2014 and the Supplementary to the 246th

Report of the Law Commission of India on Amendments to

the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 of February 2015.

                               113


                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


These changes were aimed at restricting Courts from

interfering with arbitral awards on the ground of "public

policy." Accordingly, the amendment added "Explanation 2"


to 
Section 34(2)
 as well as Section 2A.




Explanation 2 of 
Section 34(2)
 states -




"For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a

contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian Law

shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute."



      79.   Because of this amendment, Courts would no

longer be able to interfere with the award passed by the

arbitrator. The explanation makes it especially clear that in

no way would a Court be entailed to review the award on

merits of the dispute. However, after amendment to


Arbitration and Conciliation Act
, Section 2A also curtails the

scope of interpretation of "patently illegal" as propounded in


the said decision
 reported in 2003 (5) - S.C.C. - 705 (ONGC

vs. Saw Pipes Limited). Section 2A states :-

                                114


                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


"An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than

international commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside

by the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiate by

patent illegality appearing on the face of the award:


Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the

ground   of   an   erroneous    application    of   law   or   by

reappreciation of evidence."



     80. Thus, Courts can no longer reappraise evidence or

set aside awards merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has

made errors when dealing with the same.





     81. Hence, the scope of interference is only where the

finding of the Tribunal is either contrary to the terms of the

contract between the parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that

interference, by this court, is absolutely necessary. The

Arbitrator is the final arbiter on facts as well as in law, and

even errors, factual or legal, which stops short of perversity,

does not merit interference under 
Section 34
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. Courts can no longer

                              115

                                          A.S. No.25003/2023


reappraise evidence or set aside awards merely because the

Arbitral Tribunal has made errors when dealing with the

same.





      82. 
In the decision reported in ( 2017) 13 - SCALE -

91 (SC) (
Venture Global Engineering LLC and Ors vs. Tech

Mahindra Ltd. and Ors
), the Hon'ble Supreme court has held

as follows:-






"The Award of an Arbitral Tribunal can be set aside only on

the grounds specified in 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act and on no other ground. The Court cannot

act as an Appellate Court to examine the legality of Award,

nor it can examine the merits of claim by entering in factual

arena like an Appellate Court."





 
83.      A similar view is also taken in the decision

reported in (2017) 14 - SCALE - 240 (SC) ( 
Sutlej

Construction vs. The Union Territory of Chandigarh
).


                              116


                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



 
84.    The learned Advocate for the respondent has

relied on a decision reported in 2019 (15) - S.C.C. - 131

(
Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National

Highways Authority of India Ltd.
), wherein the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has once again reiterated the law related to

the examination by a Court of an Award under 
Section 34
 of

the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and has held as

under:-






"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression public

policy of India, whether contained in 
Section 34
 or in 
Section

48
, would now mean the fundamental policy of Indian law

as explained in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders

(supra), i.e., the fundamental policy of Indian law would be

relegated   to   the   "Renusagar"   understanding    of   this

expression. This would necessarily mean that the Western

Geco (supra) expansion has been done away with. In short,

Western Geco (supra), as explained in paragraphs 28 and

29 of Associate Builders (supra), would no longer obtain, as

                              117

                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


under the guise of interfering with an award on the ground

that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the

Court's intervention would be on the merits of the award,

which cannot be permitted post amendment. However, in so

far as principles of natural justice are concerned, as

contained in 
Sections 18
 and 
34(2) (a) (iii)
 of the 1996 Act,

these continue to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is

contained in paragraph 30 of Associate Builders (supra).



     85.    It is important to notice that the ground for

interference in so far as it concerns "interest of India" has

since been deleted, and therefore, no longer obtains.

Equally, the ground for interference on the basis that the

award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be

understood as a conflict with the "most basic notions of

morality or justice". This again would be in line with

paragraphs 36 to 39 of Associate Builders (supra), as it is

only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the

court that can be set aside on this ground.

                                118


                                             A.S. No.25003/2023



        86. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now

constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is

contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as

understood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders

(supra), or secondly, that such award is against basic

notions of justice or morality as understood in paragraphs

36 to 39 of Associate Builders (supra).       Explanation 2 to


Section 34(2)(b)(ii)
 and Explanation 2 to 
Section 48(2)(b)(ii)


was added by the Amendment Act only so that Western

Geco (supra), as understood in Associate Builders (supra),

and paragraphs 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away

with.





        87.   Insofar as domestic awards made in India are

concerned, an additional ground is now available under

subsection (2A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to


Section 34
.Here, there must be patent illegality appearing on

the face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes

to the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere

                              119

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


erroneous application of the law. In short, what is not

subsumed within the fundamental policy of Indian law,

namely, the contravention of a statute not linked to public

policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the back

door when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground

of patent illegality.





      88. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation

of evidence, which is what an appellate court is permitted to

do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality

appearing on the face of the award.





      89.     To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of Associate

Builders (supra), namely, a mere contravention of the

substantive law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground

available to set aside an arbitral award. Paragraph 42.2 of

Associate Builders (supra), however, would remain, for if an

arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes


Section 31(3)
 of the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to

a patent illegality on the face of the award.

                              120


                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



     90. The change made in 
Section 28(3)
 by the

Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paragraphs

42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders (supra), namely, that the

construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an

arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the

contract in a manner that no fair minded or reasonable

person would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even

a possible view to take.    Also, if the arbitrator wanders

outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to

him, he commits an error of jurisdiction. This ground of

challenge will now fall within the new ground added under


Section 34(2A)
.





     91. What is important to note is that a decision which

is perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31 and 32 of

Associate Builders (supra), while no longer being aground

for challenge under public policy of India, would certainly

amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the

award. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an

                              121

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision

would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground

of patent illegality.   Additionally, a finding based on

documents taken behind the back of the parties by the

arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no

evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on

evidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have

to be characterized as perverse."





     92. 
In the decision reported in 2019 (16) - SCALE -

823 (
Hindustan Construction Company Limited & Anr. vs.

Union of India & Ors.
) , the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as

under:-






"49. Further, this Court has repeatedly held that an

application under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is a

summary proceeding not in the nature of a regular suit - 
see

Canara Nidhi Ltd. v. M. Shashikala
 2019 SCC Online SC

1244 at paragraph 20.
 
As a result, a court reviewing an

arbitral award under 
Section 34
 does not sit in appeal over

                               122

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


the award, and if the view taken by the arbitrator is

possible, no interference is called for - 
see Associated

Construction v. Pawanhans Helicopters Limited
. (2008)16

SCC 128 at paragraph 17.






 
93.   Also, as has been held in the recent decision


Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. NHAI


2019 SCC Online SC 677, after the 2015 Amendment Act,

this Court cannot interfere with an arbitral award on

merits."






 
94.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision

reported in 2020 - SCC Online - S.C. - 466 ( 
Patel

Engineering Ltd. vs. North Eastern Power Corporation Ltd
)

has once again exposited the 'patent illegality' ground,

appearing in 
Section 34 (2A)
 of the Arbitration and

Conciliation Act, 1996.
 
The most significant part of this

judgment is the recognition and reaffirmation given to the

test of patent illegality, as set out in Paragraph (42.3) of the

above-mentioned decision reported in 2015 (3) - S.C.C. - 49

                               123

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


(
Associate Builders vs. DDA
) and which was reiterated in

Paragraph (40) of the decision reported in 2019 (15) - S.C.C.


- 131 (
Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs.

National     Highways    Authority    of   India   Ltd.
).   The

aforementioned test of 'patent illegality' lays down that any

contravention of 
Section 28 (3)
 of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act, 1996 is deemed to be a sub-head of patent

illegality. According to it, an Arbitral Tribunal must decide in

accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an

Arbitrator construes a term of the contract in such a way

that it could be said to be something that no fair minded or

reasonable person could do, the same will render the award

'patently illegal'.






      95. By keeping in mind about the said legal aspects, I

am of the opinion that the Arbitral Award is not marred by

any patent illegality, as there is no contravention of the

substantive law of India, which would result in the death

knell of an Arbitral Award. It is also observed that there is

                              124

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


no patent illegality in the Arbitral Award, which must go to

the root of the matter. The Arbitral Award is also a well

reasoned and a speaking award. The Arbitral Award is also

held to not be in contravention of 
Section 28(3)
 of the

Arbitration & Conciliation Act, which pertains to the terms of

the contract, trade usages applicable to the nature of

contract and substance of dispute.





     96. On a parting note, I would like to add, that the

challenge to the various clauses of contract by the Petitioner

under the present petition is not tenable. It is accordingly,

held that the Arbitral Award is neither against the

fundamental policy of India nor in contravention of law.

Therefore, I find no perversity in the Arbitral Award and the

same is upheld.





     97.    Having given my careful consideration to the

submissions urged and the complete case record in the

preceding paragraphs of this judgment, I am of the view that

is not a fit and proper case for exercise the jurisdiction of

                                 125

                                              A.S. No.25003/2023


this court under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration & Conciliation

Act and interfere with the Arbitral Award and the same is

upheld.





      98. In my humble opinion, it cannot be said, in the

present matter, that finding recorded by the Learned

Arbitrator is based on no evidence or it has ignored vital

evidence before arriving at the decision. A bare perusal of

the award passed by the Learned Arbitrator shows that

evidence of both the parties have been considered in detail

and the Learned Arbitrator has taken into account each and

every submissions advanced by the parties before him,

including appreciation of evidence in proper manner before

arriving at the decision to pass the impugned award and as

such, the judgment cited by the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioner, is of little assistance to him.



 
99.    For the said aspect, I wish to refer a recent

decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2021) 3 -

S.C.C. - 308 (Anglo American Metallurgical Coal Pty. 
Ltd. vs.

                              126

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


MMTC Limited
), wherein it has laid down the parameters of

judicial review and Courts have been permitted to interfere

only if there is a ground of patent illegality or violation of

fundamental policy of Indian law and if a possible view is

based on oral and documentary evidence led in the case,

which cannot be characterized as being either perverse or

being based on no evidence and as such, no interference is

permissible. The relevant portion of the judgment is

reproduced hereunder:-






"48. Given the parameters of judicial review 
laid down in


Associate Builders, it is obvious that neither the ground of

fundamental policy of Indian law, nor the ground of patent

illegality, have been made out in the facts of this case, given

the fact that the majority award is certainly a possible view

based on the oral and documentary evidence led in the case,

which cannot be characterized as being either perverse or

being based on no evidence."


                              127


                                           A.S. No.25003/2023



 
100.    The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has

relied on a recent Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in


Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited vs. Delhi Metro

Rai
 l Corporation Limited in Civi l Appea l No . 5627 / 2021 (

arising out of SLP (C) No . 4115 / 2019 ) decided on

09.09.2021. In 
the said judgment
, the Arbitral Award which

was challenged before the Hon'ble High Court under 
Section

34
 was dismissed and in appeal under 
Section 37
. The

Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court has allowed the appeal

and set aside the award. In this judgment, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has set aside the order of the Division Bench.

In the said Judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para 24

has held as under:-






"24. This court has in several other judgments interpreted


Section 34
 of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be

shown by courts while examining the validity of the arbitral

awards. The limited grounds available to courts for

annulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally

                              128

                                           A.S. No.25003/2023


trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the

well-established principles for interference to the facts of

each case that come up before the courts. There is a

disturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards,

after dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases

to come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention

and thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either

perversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds

available for annulment of the award. This approach would

lead to corrosion of the objection of the 1996 Act and the

endeavours made to preserve this court, which is minimal

judicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart,

several judicial pronouncements of this court would become

a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorizing

them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the

contours of the said expressions."





     101.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court at Para 35 of the

said Judgment has held that as the arbitrator is the sole

                               129

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


judge of the quality as well as the quantity of the evidence,

the task of being a judge on the evidence before the Tribunal

does not fall upon the court in exercise of its jurisdiction

under 
Section 34
. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has also held

in Para 39 of the said Judgment that construction of the

contract is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and merely

because another view is possible, the court cannot interfere

with such construction and substitute its own view.



      102.   On going through these Judgments, it makes

further clear that Arbitrator is sole judge of the quality and

quantity of the evidence and construction of contract is

within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the court cannot

lightly interfere with the award passed by the learned

Arbitrator. On considering the facts of the present case, as

held in this Judgment there are no grounds to set aside the

award of the learned Arbitrator under 
Section 34
 of the Act.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this Judgment has even held

that patent illegality which do not go to the root of the matter

                               130

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


and every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal

could not fall within the expression patent illegality.



 
103.    Relying upon the law laid in the decision

reported in 2015 (5) - S.C.C. - 698 (
Navodaya Mass

Entertainment Limited vs. J.M. Combines
), it can be said

that not only the reasoning of Arbitral Tribunal are logical,

but all the material and evidence were taken note of by

Arbitral Tribunal and this Court cannot substitute own

evaluation of conclusion of law or fact to come to the

conclusion other than that of Arbitral Tribunal. Cogent

grounds, sufficient reasons have been assigned by Arbitral

Tribunal in reaching the just conclusion and no error of law

or misconduct is apparent on the face of the record. This

Court cannot re-appraise the evidence and it is not open to

this Court to sit in the appeal over the conclusion/findings of

facts arrived at by Arbitral Tribunal. Re-appraisal of the

matter cannot be done by this Court. No error is apparent in

respect of the Impugned Award. I do not find any

                              131

                                            A.S. No.25003/2023


contradiction in the observations and findings given by

Arbitral Tribunal. The Impugned Award does not suffer from

vice of irrationality and perversity. The conclusion of the

Arbitral Tribunal is based on a possible view of the matter,

so the Court is not expected to interfere with the award.

Even impugned award passed by Arbitral Tribunal cannot

be set aside on the ground that it was erroneous. The award

is not against any public policy nor against the terms of

contract of the parties. No ground for interference is made

out. None of the grounds raised by the petitioner attract


Section 34
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Therefore,

I answer this Point in Negative.






      104. Point No. 2: Therefore, I proceed to pass the

following:-
