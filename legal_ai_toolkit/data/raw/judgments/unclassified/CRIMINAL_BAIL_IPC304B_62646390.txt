                             ORDER



      Accused No.3 in Crime No.82/2013 registered by the

Chickballapura police station, Chickballapura, for the offences

punishable under 
Sections 498A

IPC
 and


Sections 3
 and 
4
 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 is before

this Court seeking regular bail.



      2.    Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.



      3.    On the complaint of Shobha W/o Manjunath, on

23.06.2023 FIR in Crime No.82/2023 was registered by the

Chickballapura Police Station, Chickballapura against one Lohith

Babu and three others. Petitioner is arrayed as accused No.3 in

the FIR. In the complaint, it is averred that the complainant's

daughter - Thejaswini was married to accused No.1 - Lohith

Babu on 07.02.2022. The complainant has stated that at the

time of marriage they had paid dowry to the accused persons

as per their demand. Inspite of the same, the accused persons

were torturing and harassing her daughter.      In this regard,

panchayath was held and inspite of the same, the accused

persons continued to harass and torture the complainant's

daughter. About 20 days prior to the complaint, complainant's

                                 -3-

                                              NC: 2023:KHC:36605

                                         CRL.P No. 9281 of 2023





daughter - Thejaswini had suffered from typhoid fever, inspite

of that the accused persons did not take her to the hospital.



      4.    Thereafter,   the   complainant   and    her   husband

brought their daughter to their home and got treated and on

21.06.2023 they had left her in her matrimonial home.           On

23.06.2023 at about 10.00 a.m., the complainant was informed

by her son that the complainant's daughter - Thejaswini was

not receiving the phone.        She immediately telephoned the

accused and he informed her that her daughter - Thejaswini

had committed suicide by hanging herself to a fan in a room.

Immediately, the complainant and her family members went to

the house of Lohith Babu and thereafter, had approached the

police and filed the compliant, which has resulted in registration

of FIR in Crime No.82/2023.





      5.    During the course of investigation in the said case,

the petitioner was arrested on 23.06.2023. His bail application

filed in Crl.Misc.No.386/2023 before the I Addl. District &

Sessions    Judge,    Chikkaballapura,    was       dismissed   on

17.07.2023. Therefore, the petitioner is before this Court.

                                  -4-


                                              NC: 2023:KHC:36605

                                          CRL.P No. 9281 of 2023


      6.       Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the

petitioner is the elder brother of accused no.1 who is the

husband of the deceased. The petitioner is staying separately

along with his wife and children. Investigation in the case is

complete and charge sheet has been filed. Accordingly, he

prays to allow the petition.





      7.       Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the bail

application.





      8.       The complainant is the mother of the deceased -

Thejaswini. Thejaswini and her husband - Lohith Babu, who is

accused No.1 in the FIR are stated to be residents of Ward

No.19 of the Chickballapur District, whereas the material

produced by the petitioner along the criminal petition would go

to show that the petitioner and his wife - Shilpa were residing

in a premises at Ward No.24 of Chickballapur District.        The

inquest mahazar would go to show that the body of Thejaswini

was found hanging in a room in her husband's house and the

door of the room in which Thejaswini had hanged herself was

broke open and thereafter, the body was brought down and the

post-mortem report of the Thejaswini would go to show that

                               -5-

                                           NC: 2023:KHC:36605

                                      CRL.P No. 9281 of 2023





death was due to asphyxia as a result of suspension by the

neck (antimortem hanging).





     9.    This material prima-facie would go to show that

Thejaswini had died by committing suicide and she had left a

death note before committing suicide.    In the said note it is

stated that the accused persons have tortured her, but there is

no mention of any demand for payment of dowry either

immediately prior to she committing suicide or even earlier to

the same. For the purpose of attracting offence under 
Section

304B
 of IPC there should be some material to show that the

accused persons had harassed or tortured the deceased

immediately prior to she committing the act of suicide and such

harassment or torture should be in respect of demand for

dowry. Such material is not present in the death note of the

deceased. The petitioner who has no criminal antecedents is in

custody from 23.06.2023 onwards.





     10.   Investigation in the case is complete and charge

sheet has been filed. The allegation against the petitioner is

required to be proved in full-fledged trial. Under these

circumstances, I am of the view that, petitioner has made out a

                                    -6-

                                                     NC: 2023:KHC:36605

prima facie case for grant of regular bail.              Accordingly, the

following:
