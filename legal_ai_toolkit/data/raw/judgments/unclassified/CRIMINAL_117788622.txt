                           2.     Briefly stated, circumstances relevant for present purposes are as
                          follows. On complaint dated 27.04.2023 of one Mr. Suresh Kumar, FIR No.
                          79/2023 for offence under 
Section 304B
/
498A
/
34
 IPC was registered by PS
                          Jaffarpur Kalan. After completion of investigation, chargesheet for offences
                          under 
Section 304B
/
498A
/
34
 IPC was filed against the accused/applicant,
                          his parents and sister. Currently, the matter is pending trial and six out of
                          forty prosecution witnesses stand examined.



                          2.1    In his complaint, which was registered as FIR, Shri Suresh Kumar
                          alleged that he got his daughter Raveena married on 22.02.2023 with Vinay
                          (the accused/applicant), but the very next day of marriage, the
                          accused/applicant told Raveena that she was not his choice and he had
                          married her under pressure of his family; that after marriage, 2-3 times
                          Raveena went to her matrimonial home where she was harassed by all the
                          accused persons, demanding money and stating that the amount of Rs.
                          7,00,000/- given by her parents would fetch only a small car, so she must
                          bring more money from her parents; that about one and a half months
                          earlier, Raveena had called him up to apprise him of the abovesaid
                          allegations, so he brought her to her parental home; that after shifting to her
                          parental home, she used to remain depressed; that on the day of incident
                          (27.04.2023), he was in his room while Raveena was watching TV in the

                           other room and when she did not respond to his call, he went to the other
                          room where he found Raveena hanging with a dupatta from ventilator; and
                          that he immediately extricated Raveena and called PCR.



                          3.     It is in the above backdrop that the accused/applicant has filed the
                          present application seeking to be released on bail.



                          3.1    Learned counsel for accused/applicant took me through the above
                          mentioned FIR statement of complainant de facto and contended that since
                          the deceased Raveena committed suicide admittedly at her parental home
                          and not at her matrimonial home, offence under 
Section 304B
 IPC is not
                          attracted. It was also argued on behalf of accused/applicant that even
                          according to the FIR, there was no harassment or dowry demand during the
                          period between 15.03.2023 when the deceased was shifted to her parental
                          home and 27.04.2023 when she committed suicide, so even if the allegation
                          of dowry demand till 15.03.2023 is believed, there is no material to show
                          that soon before her death Raveena was subjected to cruelty or dowry
                          harassment. Lastly, learned counsel for accused/applicant also argued that
                          going by its stage, trial would take long time to conclude, so
                          accused/applicant deserves to be released on bail. In support of his
                          arguments, learned counsel for accused/applicant placed reliance on the
                          judgments in the cases titled Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh vs State of


                          BAIL APPLN.

                          3.2    On the other hand, learned counsel for complainant de facto also took
                          me through record and contended that the deceased was consistently
                          harassed and mentally tortured by the accused/applicant and his family
                          members not just till she shifted to her parental home, but even thereafter till
                          she committed suicide. Learned counsel for complainant de facto also
                          referred to institution of judicial separation proceedings by the
                          accused/applicant on 19.04.2023, which followed a long telephonic
                          conversation between the accused/applicant and the deceased on 23.04.2023,
                          triggering her suicide on 27.04.2023. So, according to learned counsel for
                          complainant de facto, the accused deserves no relief.



                          3.3    Learned Additional Public Prosecutor strongly opposed the bail
                          application in view of heinous nature of crime. Learned prosecutor took me
                          through chargesheet to point out continuity of communication between the
                          accused/applicant and the deceased, especially the Call Detail Records
                          reflecting last conversation which took place for 584 seconds between the
                          accused/applicant and the deceased on 23.04.2023, after which on
                          27.04.2023 the deceased committed suicide. Learned prosecutor also

                           submitted that one crucial witness related to the efforts of the complainant
                          de facto to resolve the issue amicably prior to death of the deceased is yet to
                          be examined. Therefore, according to prosecution this is not a fit case to
                          grant bail. 
In support of his arguments, learned prosecutor placed reliance
                          on the judgment dated 03.03.2025 of the Supreme Court in the case titled
                          
Shabeen Ahmad vs The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.
, 2025 INSC 307.




                          4.     To begin with, having perused the judicial precedents cited on behalf
                          of the accused/applicant, I am of the opinion that none of the same would
                          support his case. In the case of Javed Gulam (supra), the Supreme Court
                          recapitulated the principles of speedy trial and bail, holding that if the State,
                          including the Court, cannot provide fundamental right of speedy trial, the
                          prosecution should not oppose the bail plea on the ground of seriousness of
                          the crime, as the object of bail is to secure attendance of the accused at the
                          trial and bail is not to be withheld as a punishment. In the said case, the
                          Supreme Court was faced with a situation where the accused was in jail for
                          four years but the trial court had not been able to even frame charges and the
                          prosecution intended to examine not less than eighty witnesses. That is not
                          so in the present case, as mentioned above.       
The judgment in the case of
                          
Nitish Chauhan
 (supra) is basically a short order without any discussion on
                          the legal issues.
 
In the case of 
Amarkant Mahto
 (supra), only official
                          witnesses remained to be examined as all public witnesses had already

                           testified and a crucial aspect was the statements of the parents of the
                          deceased showing it to be not a case of dowry death.




 
5.     The Supreme Court judgment in the case of 
Shabeen Ahmad
 (supra)
                          referred to by the learned prosecutor is the latest analysis carried out by the
                          apex court on the issue hardly one month ago. In the said case, the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court dealt with the challenge to grant of bail to the parents-in-law
                          and sisters-in-law of the deceased in case for offence under 
Section
                          498A
/
304B
 IPC. After elaborate discussion on law and facts, the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court cancelled the bail granted to the parents-in-law of the
                          deceased, observing thus:




                                  "11. At the outset, it is crucial to underscore the seriousness of an
                                  alleged dowry death under 
Sections 498A
 and 
304B
 of the IPC, read
                                  with 
Sections 3
 and 
4
 of the Dowry Prohibition Act..... Stricter judicial
                                  scrutiny is necessary in matters where a young woman loses her life
                                  in her matrimonial home so soon after marriage, particularly where
                                  the record points to persistent harassment over unmet dowry
                                  demands.

                                  12. ..... In dowry-death cases, courts must be mindful of the broader
                                  societal impact, given that the offence strikes at the very root of social
                                  justice and equality. Allowing alleged prime perpetrators of such
                                  heinous acts to remain on bail, where the evidence indicates they
                                  actively inflicted physical, as well as mental, torment, could undermine
                                  not only the fairness of the trial but also public confidence in the
                                  criminal justice system.

                                  13. ... Moreover, 
Section 304B
 IPC (dowry death) prescribes a
                                  stringent standard because of the grave nature of the offence and the
                                  systemic harm it perpetuates. Where the facts clearly indicate direct
                                  involvement in the fatal events, courts must act with an abundance of

                                   caution. Thus, permitting the father-in-law and mother-in-law to
                                  remain at large would run counter to the ends of justice, especially
                                  when the evidence reflects a probable nexus between their persistent
                                  dowry demands, physical cruelty, and the deceased's death.
                                  Consequently, their bail warrants cancellation so that a fair and
                                  unimpeded trial may take place, in keeping with the legislative intent
                                  behind anti- dowry laws.

                                  ....

 
15. We also find it necessary to express our concern over the
                                  seemingly mechanical approach adopted by the High Court in
                                  granting bail to the Respondent accused. While the Court did note the
                                  absence of prior criminal records, it failed to fully consider the stark
                                  realities of the allegations. It is unfortunate that in today's society,
                                  dowry deaths remain a grave social concern, and in our opinion, the
                                  courts are duty- bound to undertake deeper scrutiny of the
                                  circumstances under which bail is granted in these cases. The social
                                  message emanating from judicial orders in such cases cannot be
                                  overstated: when a young bride dies under suspicious circumstances
                                  within barely two years of marriage, the judiciary must reflect
                                  heightened vigilance and seriousness. A superficial application of bail
                                  parameters not only undermines the gravity of the offence itself but
                                  also risks weakening public faith in the judiciary's resolve to combat
                                  the menace of dowry deaths. It is this very perception of justice, both
                                  within and outside the courtroom, that courts must safeguard, lest we
                                  risk normalizing a crime that continues to claim numerous innocent
                                  lives. These observations regarding grant of bail in grievous crimes
                                  were thoroughly dealt with by this Court in

                           15.03.2023 when the deceased shifted to her parental home and 27.04.2023
                          when she committed suicide, the period is too large a period to be taken as a
                          period contemplated by the phrase "soon before her death" used in the said
                          provision.



                          7.     I am unable to convince myself that merely because the deceased
                          committed suicide in her parental home and not in her matrimonial home, it
                          is not a case of dowry death. Place where a tormented lady gets compelled
                          to kill herself has no bearing. For purposive interpretation of the provision
                          under 
Section 304B
 IPC, it is the existence and continuance of matrimony
                          which has to be kept in mind and not the place(s) to which the deceased
                          shifts herself before taking her life.



                          8.     Section 304B was inserted in the 
Indian Penal Code
 by way of an
                          amendment in the year 1986 with the object of dealing with the cases of
                          dowry death, which apart from killing of a hapless lady surrounded by
                          adverse alien ecosystem, entail grave social ramifications. As contemplated
                          by 
Section 304B
 IPC, the dowry death is death of a woman caused by burns
                          or bodily injury or under abnormal circumstances within seven years of her
                          marriage, where she had been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her
                          husband or any of his relative, which harassment or cruelty was for or in
                          connection with demand of dowry and had occurred soon before her death.

                           8.1    The expression "soon before her death", as used in 
Section 304B
 IPC

                          has to be construed keeping in mind the scope and purpose behind the
                          enactment. Doing so, this expression has to be read as an expression of
                          continuity of time and not an expression of mere length of time. Plethora of
                          judicial pronouncements flowing from the apex court and different High
                          Courts across the country reiterate that the expression "soon before" is a
                          relative term, which has to be considered under specific factual matrix of the
                          case in hand and no straitjacket formula can be laid down fixing any time
                          limit. One has to keep in mind that the legislature in its wisdom used the
                          phrase in question as "soon before" and not "immediately before". What is
                          contemplated by 
Section 304B
 IPC is "soon before death" and not
                          "immediately before death".

Satbir Singh & Anr. vs State of Haryana
, (2021) 6
                          SCC 1, the Supreme Court held thus:




                                  "10. Section 304­B, 
IPC
 is one among many legislative initiatives
                                  undertaken by Parliament to remedy a long­standing social evil. The
                                  pestiferous nature of dowry harassment, wherein married women are
                                  being subjected to cruelty because of covetous demands by husband
                                  and his relatives has not gone unnoticed. The Parliament enacted the
                                  
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
 as a first step to eradicate this social
                                  evil. Further, as the measures were found to be insufficient, the
                                  Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act 46 of 1983) was

                                   11. However, despite the above measures, the issue of dowry
                                  harassment was still prevalent. Additionally, there was a growing
                                  trend of deaths of young brides in suspicious circumstances
                                  following demands of dowry. The need for a stringent law to curb
                                  dowry deaths was suo motu taken up by the Law Commission in its
                                  91st Law Commission Report. The Law Commission recognized that
                                  the 
IPC
, as it existed at that relevant time, was insufficient to tackle
                                  the issue of dowry deaths due to the nature and modus of the crime.
                                  They observed as under:

                                           "1.3 If, in a particular incident of dowry death, the facts are
                                           such as to satisfy the legal ingredients of an offence already
                                           known to the law, and if those facts can be proved without
                                           much difficulty, the existing criminal law can be resorted to
                                           for bringing the offender to book. IN practice, however, two
                                           main impediments arise ­

                                                (i)     either the facts do not fully fit into the
                                                        pigeon­hole of any known offence; or

                                                (ii)    the peculiarities of the situation are such that
                                                        proof of directly incriminating facts is thereby
                                                        rendered difficult."



                                  12. Taking into consideration the aforesaid Law Commission Report,
                                  and the continuing issues relating to dowry related offences, the
                                  Parliament introduced amendments to the 
Dowry Prohibition Act
, as
                                  well as the 
IPC
 by enacting 
Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act,
                                  1986
 (Act 43 of 1986). By way of this amendment, Section 304­B,
                                  
IPC
 was specifically introduced in the 
IPC
, as a stringent provision
                                  to curb the menace of dowry death in India.

                                  .....

                                  15. Considering the significance of such a legislation, a strict
                                  interpretation would defeat the very object for which it was enacted.
                                  Therefore, it is safe to deduce that when the legislature used the
                                  words, "soon before" they did not mean "immediately before".
                                  Rather, they left its determination in the hands of the courts. The
                                  factum of cruelty or harassment differs from case to case. Even the
                                  spectrum of cruelty is quite varied, as it can range from physical,
                                  verbal or even emotional. This list is certainly not exhaustive. No
                                  straitjacket formulae can therefore be 
laid down by
 this Court to
                                  define what exacts the phrase "soon before" entails".

                           8.3    In the case of 
Kans Raj vs State of Punjab
, (2000) 5 SCC 207, the


                          Supreme Court analysed the provision under 
Section 304B
 IPC and after
                          traversing through various judicial precedents, held thus:



 
"15. It is further contended on behalf of the respondents that the
                                  statements of the deceased referred to the instances could not be
                                  termed to be cruelty or harassment by the husband soon before her
                                  death. "Soon before" is a relative term which is required to be
                                  considered under specific circumstances of each case and no
                                  straight jacket formula can be 
laid down by
 fixing any time limit.
                                  This expression is pregnant with the idea of proximity test. The term
                                  "soon before" is not synonymous with the term "immediately before"


                                  and is opposite of the expression "soon after" as used and
                                  understood in Section 114, Illustration (a) of the 
Evidence Act
. These
                                  words would imply that the interval should not be too long between
                                  the time of making the statement and the death. It contemplates the
                                  reasonable time which, as earlier noticed, has to be understood and
                                  determined under the peculiar circumstances of each case. In
                                  relation to dowry deaths, the circumstances showing the existence
                                  of cruelty or harassment to the deceased are not restricted to a
                                  particular instance but normally refer to a course of conduct. Such
                                  conduct may be spread over a period of time. If the cruelty or
                                  harassment or demand for dowry is shown to have persisted, it
                                  shall be deemed to be 'soon before death' if any other intervening
                                  circumstance showing the non existence of such treatment is not
                                  brought on record, before the alleged such treatment and the date
                                  of death. It does not, however, mean that such time can be
                                  stretched to any period. Proximate and live link between the effect
                                  of cruelty based on dowry demand and the consequential death is
                                  required to be proved by the prosecution. The demand of dowry,
                                  cruelty or harassment based upon such demand and the date of
                                  death should not be too remote in time which, under the
                                  circumstances, be treated as having become stale enough.

                                   16. No presumption under 
Section 113B
 of the Evidence Act
                                  would be drawn against the accused if it is shown that after the
                                  alleged demand, cruelty or harassment the dispute stood resolved
                                  and there was no evidence of cruelty, and harassment thereafter.
                                  Mere lapse of some time by itself would not provide to an accused a
                                  defence, if the course of conduct relating to cruelty or harassment in
                                  connection with the dowry demand is shown to have existed earlier
                                  in time not too late and not too stale before the date of death of the
                                  woman".

                                                                                    (emphasis supplied)


                          9.     Falling back to the present case, as mentioned above, in the FIR there
                          are specific allegations of dowry harassment. As also mentioned above, the
                          accused/applicant got married with the deceased on 22.02.2023; on the very
                          next day of marriage, the accused/applicant and his family members started
                          harassing the deceased over dowry, stating that the deposit of Rs. 7,00,000/-
                          brought by her from her parental home would fetch only a small car; on
                          15.03.2023, the deceased shifted to her parental home, after which she
                          continued to remain in communication with the accused/applicant over
                          telephone, the last telephone call being of 584 seconds on 23.04.2023, which
                          followed her suicide on 27.04.2023. In view of these circumstances, though
                          yet to be tested in trial, I am unable to accept the contention of learned
                          counsel for the accused/applicant that the offence under 
Section 304B
 IPC
                          would not be made out because there is no allegation of harassment soon
                          before death of the deceased. However, I must cautiously reiterate the rider
                          that the above analysis is only for examining the bail plea of the accused/
