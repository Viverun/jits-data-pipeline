6. At the very outset, learned counsel for applicant submits that co-accused Muneeb Urf Rajmani has already been enlarged on bail vide order dated 21.12.2023 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.51698 of 2023 (Muneeb Urf Rajmani Vs. State of U.P.). For ready reference the order dated 21.12.2023 is reproduced herein-under:

2. This application for bail has been filed by applicant Muneeb Urf Rajmani seeking his enlargement on bail in Case Crime No. 137 of 2023 under 
Sections 452
,

 I.P.C., Police Station-Kapsethi, District-Varanasi during the pendency of trial. 



3. Record shows that an F.I.R. dated 12.08.2023 was lodged by first-informant Smt. Rekha Devi and was registered as Case Crime No. 137 of 2023 under 
Sections 498-A

 I.P.C., and 3/4 
D.P. Act
, Police Station-Kapsethi, District- Gomti (Commissionerate Varanasi). In the aforesaid F.I.R., one person namely Sanjay Bind (husband) has been nominated as named accused, whereas, father-in-law, two Jeth, mother-in-law, both the Jethani and alleged one Tantrik have also been arraigned as accused. 



4. It is apposite to mention here that in the day, date and time column of the F.I.R. no particulars have been mentioned. However, in the body of the F.I.R. the occurrence relatable to the present applicant is said to have occurred in the year 2015. 



5. Learned counsel for applicant contends that applicant is innocent and he has been falsely implicated in the crime in question. Applicant is not named in the F.I.R. Attention of the Court was then invited to the F.I.R. and on basis thereof, it is urged that allegations made in the F.I.R. relate to the occurrence of the year 2015. The F.I.R. giving rise to the present criminal proceedings was lodged on 12.08.2023 i.e. after expiry of a period of almost 8 years. He therefore, contends that the F.I.R. qua the present applicant is highly belated. However, neither in the F.I.R. nor in the statement of the first informant recorded under 
Section 161
 Cr.P.C.,therefore, there is no explanation with regard to the delay in lodging the F.I.R. Placing reliance upon the judgment of Supreme Court in 
P. Rajagopal And Ors. Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu
, AIR 2019 SC 2866/2019(5) SCC 40, the learned counsel for applicant contends that since the F.I.R. is highly belated and there being no explanation for the delay in lodging the F.I.R., the present criminal proceedings against applicant is itself not maintainable. As such, the applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail.




6. Even otherwise, applicant is a man of clean antecedents having no criminal history to his credit except the present one. Applicant is in jail since 08.09.2023. As such, he has undergone more than three months of incarceration. The police report in terms of 
Section 173(2)
 Cr.P.C. has already been submitted. Therefore, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands crystallized. Upto this stage, no such circumstance has emerged on record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial. He, therefore, submits that applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. In case, the applicant is enlarged on bail he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall co-operate with the trial. 



7. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail. He submits that since applicant is a charge sheeted accused, therefore, he does not deserve any indulgence by this Court. However, he could not dislodge the factual and legal submissions urged by the learned counsel for applicant in support of the present application for bail with reference to the record at this stage. 



8. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State, upon perusal of record, evidence, nature and gravity of offence, complicity of accused and accusation made coupled with the fact that, the F.I.R. giving rise to the present criminal proceedings was lodged on 12.08.2023 i.e. after expiry of a period of almost 8 years, as such, the F.I.R. qua the present applicant is highly belated, however, neither in the F.I.R. nor in the statement of the first informant recorded under 
Section 161
 Cr.P.C., there is no explanation with regard to the delay in lodging the F.I.R., the judgment of Supreme Court in 
P. Rajagopal
 (Supra), the clean antecedents of applicant, the period of incarceration undergone, the police report in terms of 
Section 173(2)
 Cr.P.C. has already been submitted, therefore, the entire evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution against applicant stands crystallized, yet inspite of above the learned A.G.A. could not point out any such circumstance from the record necessitating the custodial arrest of applicant during the pendency of trial, therefore, irrespective of the objections raised by the learned A.G.A. in opposition to the present application for bail, but without making any comment on the merits of the case, applicant has made out a case for bail.
