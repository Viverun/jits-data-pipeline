                                                                     ... ... for the State


                               1.
     It is submitted on behalf of the petitioner that he is the husband

                               of the victim lady. It is further submitted petitioner and other in-laws

                               were falsely implicated over a matrimonial discord. Co-accused has

                               been granted pre-arrest bail. Accordingly, he prays for the same relief.


                               2.     Learned Advocate for the State opposes the prayer for

                               anticipatory bail and submits victim suffered injuries.


                               3.     We have considered the materials on record including the

                               statement of the victim and injury report. It is alleged one Robin Bouri

                               i.e. brother-in-law outraged the modesty of the victim. The said co-

                               accused has been granted pre-arrest bail. Allegation against the

                               petitioner-husband is with regard to assault. However, injuries are

                               simple. In view of the aforesaid facts, we are of the opinion custodial

                               interrogation of the accused/petitioner is not necessary and he may be

                               granted anticipatory bail.



                               4.     Accordingly,    we    direct     in   the   event   of   arrest,   the

                               accused/petitioner, namely, Shambhu Bouri, be released on bail upon

                   for regular bail within four weeks from date.
