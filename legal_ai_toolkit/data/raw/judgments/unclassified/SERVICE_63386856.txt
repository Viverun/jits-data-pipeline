Per Sanjay Yadav, J.



                   In these batch of writ petitions, we are mainly concerned

with two notifications issued by the State of Madhya Pradesh

through its Department of Labour, viz. Notification No.195-

2014-,-16 dated 27.5.2014 published in Madhya Pradesh

(Asadharan) Rajpatra dated 6.6.2014 and Notification No.1A-

06-14-B-16 dated 10.12.2014 published in Madhya Pradesh

Rajpatra dated 19.12.2014 in purported exercise of the powers

conferred by

establishment(s) from the operation of provisions of 1972 Act,

if, in its opinion, these employees or class of employees

employed in these establishment(s) are in receipt of gratuity or

pensionary benefits not less favourable than the benefits

conferred under the 1972 Act.

                                             14024/15, 14025/15, 14028/15, 14029/15, 14032/15, 14035/2015, 14036/15, 14554/15, 17404/15, 17405/15 and W.P. No.17407/15




Government restructured existing Madhya                                                                                       Pradesh State

Electricity Board (earlier constituted under 
Section 58(4)(a)
 of

Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 by dissolving the

then existing Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board which was

constituted under the 
Indian Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948
) into

different corporate entities viz. Generating Company known as

Madhya                  Pradesh                      Power                   Generating                          Company                         Limited,

companies viz. Madhya Pradesh Poorva Kshetra Vidyut Vitran

Company Limited, Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut

Vitran Company Limited and Madhya Pradesh Pashchim Kshetra

Vidyut Vitran Company Limited. And, as evident from the

Notification dated 31.5.2005, the restructuring of erstwhile

Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board is with effect from

1.6.2005. No such notification has been commended at to

establish that any of these company owe an existence prior to

1.6.2005 (the relevancy of this observation will have the

bearing when we will be dealing with the issues which are

raised, at relevant stage).



3.          That, prior to coming into existence of these five
                                                                           :: 5 ::

corporate entities, the establishments viz. Madhya Pradesh

Electricity Board and Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board

had adopted Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,

1976. This fact would be evident from the contentions in

paragraph 16 and 17 of the return filed by the respondents

no.2 to 7 in Writ Petition No.573/2015 and adopted in Writ

Petition No.2544/2015; wherein, it is stated that Madhya

 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948

vide notification dated 19.10.1963 made applicable New

Pension Rules, 1951 and vide notification dated 3.4.1978

applied the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,

1976 w.e.f. 1.6.1976 to its employees. And, vide said

notification (i.e. 3.4.1978) also applied the Madhya Pradesh

Civil Pension (Commutation) Rules, 1976 w.e.f. 1.1.1976.


4.          In the past, the employees of erstwhile Board claiming

that the gratuity payable under the 1976 Rules being less

favourable had availed the remedy under the 
Payment of

Gratuity Act, 1972

as per 
Section 4
 of 1972 Act. These orders came to be affirmed

in Appeal and in Writ Petitions. In one such Writ Petition

No.5618/2007(s)                               :        Chief                Engineer,                      MPSEB                    Gwalior                    vs

Radheyshyam Goyal, a Division Bench of this Court by order-

dated 19.11.2008 while upholding the claim of the employees,

held -



          "5. After having heard at length to the counsel
          for the parties and going through the orders passed
          by the Controlling Authority as well as by the
          Appellate Authority, we are of the opinion that
          there is no merit in the petition. 
Section 14
 of the
          Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 overrides the
          provisions of other enactments. Under sub-section
          (5) of 
Section 4
 of the Act, there is a right available
          to the employee to opt for better terms of gratuity.

          Employee has right to choose the gratuity under
          the provision which is more beneficial. The
          Payment of Gratuity is more beneficial under the
          
Gratuity Act
 has been concurrently found on facts.
          Thus, in our opinion, the orders passed by the
          Controlling Authority and the Appellate Authority
          are proper.



          6.     The petitioner counsel was unable to point
          out any provision in pension rules that in case
          gratuity is availed under the 
Payment of Gratuity
          Act
 benefit of pension would be available. The
          petitioner's counsel has relied on DTC Retired
          Employees' Association (supra); it was a case with
          regard to the applicability of the Pension Scheme
          and applicability of Provident Fund Scheme. In that
                                                                         :: 10 ::

            pension scheme was required to be accepted using
            the option within the specified time which is not the
            case of the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner
            further relied on EID Parry (I) Ltd. (supra) in which
            the provision of A.P. Shops and Establishment Act,
            1996 was found to be more beneficial as compared
            to the 
Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972
. Here,
            position is contrary."



7.          These decisions led these five corporate entities move the

State Government vide their letter No.15801 dated 7.3.2014,

seeking exemption under 
Section 5
 from the provisions of 1972

Act. The relevant note-sheet contained in File No.195/2014/ l-

16 of Labour Department brought on record of Writ Petition

No.2315/2015 reveals that the Labour Commissioner, whose

opinion was sought, negatived the claim for exemption from

applicability of 1972 Act to these establishments. Pertinently,

the exemption was being sought only in respect of the

employees belonging to erstwhile Board. Later on, a decision

was taken on 23.5.2014 of issuing exemption notification

prospectively, in the following terms :

receipt of gratuity and terminal benefits not less favourable

than the benefits conferred under 1972 Act. And, that if the

exemption is not granted from retrospective date, there will be

additional financial burden of Rs.90 crores. The claim paved the

11.       That, learned single Judge, Gwalior Bench of this Court in

entities against the order passed by Authorities under 1972 Act

wherein these notifications i.e. notification dated 27.5.2014 and

10.12.2014 were pressed in service and though such challenge

being negatived by order dated 14.3.2014 in a batch of Writ

Petition No.573/2015 (re-registered as W.P. No.14554/2015 at

Jabalpur) : 
M.P. Vidyut Karamchari Pensioners' Association vs

State of M.P
 and forming an opinion that the matter involves

substantial question of law of general importance, has referred

the matter for decision by larger Bench by formulating the

question :




                          "whether the notification dated 10.12.2014
                                                                       :: 16 ::

   No.554/15, W.P. Nos.13995/15, 13997/15, 13998/2015, 14001/15, 14003/15, 14005/15, 14006/15, 14007/15, 14009/15, 14011/15, 14012/15, 14014/15, 14019/15, 14021/15,

                                           14024/15, 14025/15, 14028/15, 14029/15, 14032/15, 14035/2015, 14036/15, 14554/15, 17404/15, 17405/15 and W.P. No.17407/15




          will nullify or take away the effect and benefit of

          the orders passed by the Controlling and Appellate

          Authority under the 
Gratuity Act
 ?".



12.       The question referred though is confined only to the

aspect as to whether an order passed by quasi-judicial

authority of conferring certain service benefits under 1972 Act

could be retrospectively taken away. In other words, whether

such a quasi-judicial pronouncement tantamount to accrual of

right in favour of such employees or class of employees and the

right so accrued can be taken away by effecting an exemption

from 1972 Act from retrospective date. And, whether the choice

of date can be beyond the date from which the corporate entity

has come into existence.



13.       The answer could have been short had the question

referred was the only issue, the reason being that, though all

these           five             corporate                        entities                  were                 reconstituted                             and

restructured with effect from 1.6.2005 yet, in TRANSCO, the

exemption has been made effective from 16.9.1972 i.e. from

the date when Act of 1972 came into existence. Whether this

could be done was the only issue. But, it is not to be so

because alongwith these batch of Writ Petitions is also a Writ
                                                                       :: 17 ::

Petition (W.P. No.14554/2015) wherein the vires of notification

dated 10.12.2014 is being questioned. Therefore, we intend to

deal with the issue of vires also by this order.



14.       We straightaway go to the aspect of vires.


15.       The contentions on behalf of petitioners to the validity of

notification is that it is beyond the powers of the appropriate

Government to review the notification earlier issued and make

it effective from retrospective date and grant exemption from a

retrospective effect thereby taking away the right of gratuity

accrued under 1972 Act and thereby, creating a class within a

class. And that subjecting the class to be exempted to the

provisions less favourable than the benefits conferred under

1972 Act. It is also the contention that the right accrued in

favour of the employees has been taken away from a

retrospective date without affording an opportunity of hearing.

In substantiation of these submissions, learned counsel for the

employees have led us through the benefit towards gratuity

computed as per 
Section 4
 of 1972 Act being more beneficial

than the gratuity payable under the Pension Rules 1976.

Formula provided under the Act of 1972 and one under 1976

Rules for computation of gratuity has been commended at to
                                                                       :: 18 ::

16.       Jettisoning the contentions, respondents No. 2 to 7 while

relying on the powers conferred vide 
section 5
 of 1972 Act on

appropriate Government to exempt the establishment from a

date not earlier than the enactment, have to submit that it

being within the competence of the appropriate government to

exempt the respondent from the applicability of the provisions

of 1972 Act and having satisfied that the benefit under existing

1976 Rules being more beneficial than the benefits conferred

under 1972 Act, the impugned notification does not suffer from

the vice of arbitrariness or excessive exercise of delegated

powers. Emphasizing that the benefits under 1976 Rules are

better than those under the 1972 Act, respondents have placed

a comparative chart, which we intend to reproduce at relevant

stage while dwelling over the aspect as to whether the gratuity

payable under 1976 Rules are more beneficial than 1972 Act.

Respondents have placed reliance on Rules 43 and 44 of the
                                                                      :: 19 ::

17.      The question which arises for consideration is whether it

is within the powers of the appropriate Government to issue

exemption notification under 
Section 5
 of 1972 Act. And if the

answer is 'Yes', whether the said power can successively be

exercised by issuing subsequent notification exempting the

establishment from a retrospective date. And, whether the date

for exemption could be beyond the date when the corporate

entity has come into existence. If the answer to these issues

are in affirmative, the next question which would arise for

consideration is as to whether there is an accrual of vested

right in the employees whose services are transferred to new

corporate entities to claim gratuity under 1972 Act and whether

the gratuity or pensionary benefits under 1976 Rules are not

less favourable than the benefits conferred under 1972 Act.


18.       
Section 5
 of 1972 Act stipulates :



          5.              Power to exempt. - (1) The appropriate
          Government may, by notification, and subject to
          such conditions as may be specified in the
          notification, exempt any establishment, factory,
          mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway company or
          shop to which this Act applies from the operation of
          the provisions of this Act if, in the opinion of the
          appropriate Government, the employees in such
          establishment, factory, mine, oilfield, plantation,
          port, railway company or shop are in receipt of
          gratuity or pensionary benefits not less favourable
          than the benefits conferred under this Act.

          (2)             The               appropriate                           Government                              may,                by
          notification and subject to such conditions as may
          be specified in the notification, exempt any
          employee or class of employees employed in any
          establishment, factory, mine, oilfield, plantation,
          port, railway company or shop to which this Act
          applies from the operation of the provisions of this
          Act,             if,         in         the            opinion                   of          the            appropriate
          Government, such employee or class of employees
          are in receipt of gratuity or pensionary benefits not
          less favourable than the benefits conferred under
          this Act.

                                                                       :: 21 ::

                                           14024/15, 14025/15, 14028/15, 14029/15, 14032/15, 14035/2015, 14036/15, 14554/15, 17404/15, 17405/15 and W.P. No.17407/15




          (3)             A notification issued under sub-section (1) or
          sub-section (2) may be issued retrospectively a
          date not earlier than the date of commencement of
          this Act, but no such notification shall be issued so
          as to prejudicially, affect the interests of any
          person.



19.       Thus, if sub-section (1) and (2) of 
Section 5
 empowers

the appropriate Government to exempt any establishment,

factory, mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway company or

shop; any employee or class of employees employed in these

establishment(s) from the operation of provisions of Act of

1972; sub-section (3) of 
Section 5
 grafts in appropriate

Government to issue such notification even from a retrospective

date. Apparently, the powers conferred to the appropriate

Government is not only to issue notification for exemption but

also to issue the same from retrospective date. Thus, two

independent                       powers                    are            conferred                       in          the            appropriate

Government. True it may be that the exercise of power under

Section (3) of 
Section 5
 may be exerciseable with the issuance

of notification under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of


Section 5
, but it delegates powers independent to these powers

by making exemption effective from retrospective date. Thus, in

a case as the present one, having notified an exemption under
                                                                       :: 22 ::

sub-section (1) of 
Section 5
 vide notification dated 27.5.2014, it

was still within the powers of the appropriate Government as

conferred under sub-section (3) of 
Section 5
 to issue a separate

notification specifying the date from which the exemption is

granted. In other words, the powers to make the notification

effective from a retrospective date does not get exhausted

merely because it does not find mention in a notification issued

under sub-section (1) or (2) of 
Section 5
, as the case may be.

Thus, to exempt the establishment or the employee or class of

employees from retrospective date not earlier than the date of

commencement of Act of 1972 conferred upon the appropriate

Government is supplementary to and additional constituent of

power of exemption as conferred under sub-section (1) and (2)

of 
Section 5
. Thus, there is no transgression of the powers

conferred in the appropriate Government who, at one point of

time, issue an exemption notification by making it effective

from the date of issuance of notification and at another point of

time, issue notification by making the exemption from the date

prior to issuance of exemption notification.



20.       The issue can also be looked in the context of 
General

Clauses Act, 1897
. 
As the Act
 of 1972 being a Central Act, the
                                                                       :: 23 ::

provisions contained under 1897 Act can be taken aid of


Section 14
 and 21 of 1897 Act, which stipulate -



          14.             Powers conferred to be exercisable
          from time to time. - (1) Where, by any Central
          Act or Regulation made after the commencement
          of this Act, any power is conferred, then unless a
          different intention appears that power may be
          exercised from time to time as occasion requires.

          (2)             This section applies also to all Central Acts
          and Regulations made on or after the fourteenth
          day of January, 1887.

          ...

          21.             Power to issue, to include power to add
          to, amend, vary or rescind notifications,
          orders, rules or bye-laws. - Where, by any
          Central Act or Regulations a power to issue
          notifications, orders, rules or bye-laws is conferred,
          then that power includes a power, exercisable in
          the like manner and subject to the like sanction and
          conditions (if any), to add to, amend, vary or
          rescind any notification, orders, rules or bye-laws
          so issued.



21.       These two provisions have been interpreted to mean that

"...... when a power is conferred on an authority to do a

particular act, such power can be exercised from time to time
                                                                       :: 24 ::

and carry with it power to withdraw, modify, amend or cancel

the notifications earlier issued, to be exercised in the like

manner and subject to like conditions, if any, attached with the

exercise of the power." (See. Shree Sidhbali Steels Limited

v. State of U.P. (2011) 3 SCC 193, Paragraph 41).



22.       Taking any view of the matter, it being within the

competence of the appropriate Government to notify exemption

and make the exemption effective from retrospective date, the

exercise of such power in issuing notifications dated 27.5.2014

and 10.12.2014 cannot be faulted with, as the appropriate

Government is empowered in that behalf vide 
Section 5
 of 1972

Act.



23.       Next question which crops up for consideration is whether

an exemption from the applicability of the provisions of Act of

1972 can be from a date prior to coming into existence of the

establishment concerned, because sub-section (3) of 
Section 5


of 1972 Act enables that a notification under sub-section (1)

and (2) can be issued "retrospectively a date not earlier than

the date of commencement of this Act".



24.       That, being an enabling provision, the exercise of power

under 
Section 5
 of 1972 Act has to be within the limits implicit

therein. What are these limits ? Close reading of sub-sections

(1) and (2) of 
Section 5
 reveals that exemption of an
                                                                       :: 25 ::

establishment to which 1972 Act applies, such establishment

must, therefore, be in existence. And, even when exempted

from a retrospective date, the establishment must be in vogue.

For example, in the case at hand, one of the establishments,

viz. Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company Limited

which though came in existence w.e.f. 31.5.2005 because of

the restructuring of erstwhile Madhya Pradesh State Electricity

Board which was dissolved yet, the Company is exempted from

the provisions of 1972 Act w.e.f. 16.9.1972. And though, similar

is the case of other corporate entities such as Madhya Pradesh

Power Generating Company, Madhya Pradesh Poorva Kshetra

Vidyut Vitran Co. Ltd., Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut

Vitran Co. Ltd., Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran

Co. Ltd. and Madhya Pradesh Power Management Co. Ltd.



which also came into existence w.e.f. 31.5.2005 and are

exempted from the date they came into existence. In other

words,            the            notification                        for          exemption                         of          establishment

establishment in question is in existence. In other words, the

notification would be effective from and during the period when

such establishment exists unless provided to the contrary. It

can be argued that since the power vests with the appropriate

Government to even exempt the employee(s) from the

provisions of 1972 Act and since liability to pay pension to

existing pensioners has been conferred on Madhya Pradesh

Power Transmission Company Limited after the dissolution of

erstwhile                Madhya                     Pradesh                    State                Electricity                     Board,                  the

notification in respect of this Company be construed as being

issued in purported exercise of powers conferred under sub-



section (2) of 
Section 5
 of 1972 Act. Quite true it may be,

because of the settled principle that, in case if an order passed

in exercise of power, the sources of power is not quoted, it will

not invalidate the order if the power can be referred to a

jurisdiction which confers validity upon it (for an authority

please see 
M.T. Khan v. State of A.P.
 (2004) 2 SCC 267 at

page 273). However, even if it is to be construed to be a

composite notification, under 
Section 5
 of 1972 Act
, 
in that

case
, it must meet two requirements, viz. (i) the gratuity or

pensionary benefit already available to the employees are not

less favourable than the benefit conferred by the Act of 1972
                                                                       :: 27 ::

and        (ii)          that             the            retrospective                            exemption                         should                  not

prejudicially affect interest of any person.



25.       Coming to the case at hand, it is not being disputed that,

finding the provisions of Act of 1972 more beneficial than the

existing gratuity provisions contained in 1976 Rules, the

Controlling Authority has been allowing the claim and directing

for computation of gratuity in consonance with 
Section 4
 of

1972 Act. That being so, there is accrual of right in the

employees/existing pensioners who have been held entitled for

the gratuity under 1972 Act as could be taken away from the

retrospective date.



26.       This issue can be analysed from another angle. The

impugned notification exempting the corporate entities from

retrospective effect has been issued on the bedrock that the

provisions of 1976 Rules were made applicable to erstwhile

Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board and the gratuity and

pension component were more beneficial than the gratuity

under 1972 Act. However, as noticed above, the aspect as to

whether the gratuity under 1976 Rules are more beneficial than

under 1972 Act has been the subject matter of scrutiny before

the Controlling Authority and the Appellate Authority in

umpteen number of cases in past where on adjudication it has
                                                                         :: 28 ::

been found that the gratuity under 1976 Rules being less

favourable than what is payable under 1972 Act.



27.         To overcome these findings justification as to that the

gratuity under 1976 Rules is more beneficial, it is being

presented as a package comprising of gratuity and pension. A

chart has been prepared and filed along with the return to

bring home the submissions that benefit under 1976 Rules from

its inception has been more than under the 
Gratuity Act, 1972
.

            Thus, employee could get benefit of one time gratuity of
            Rs.10,00,000/- and pension of Rs.39,779/- per month inclusive of
            interest of gratuity


28.         To justify the exemption from retrospective date, it is

contended on behalf of respondents that under the Act of 1972,

the employees are entitled only of gratuity whereas under the

Rules of 1976 they, besides gratuity, are entitled for the pension

which is paid lifelong. Taking an employee's service span of 35

years, it is urged that under the Act of 1972, a Class IV

employee gets one time gratuity of Rs.4,39,288/- and if divided

in terms of future benefits he gets Rs.3,122/- per month.

Similar breakup has been given in respect of Class III and Class

II employees. As evident, comparison has been drawn in case

of an employee governed by Rules, 1976.



29.         However, evidently while computing benefits under 1976

Rules, three factors are taken into consideration; viz., gratuity

(as provided under Rule 43(1) of Rules, 1976), Pension (as

provided under Rule 43(2) and Commutation of pension (as

covered under Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Commutation of

Pension) Rules, 1996 (which in turn replaced M.P. Civil Services
                                                                       :: 31 ::

Mahanagarpalika Naukar v. State of Gujarat
.




30.       The judgment in Janak Prasad proceeded with the facts

as borne out from paragraphs 16, 17, and 18 that in Bihar

Electricity Board Workmen were earlier paid gratuity in terms of


Payment of Gratuity Act
 and it was on account of persistent

demand raised through the representatives employees Union

that the Board ultimately agreed to pay monthly pension by

adopting Bihar Pension Rules which was a package for payment

of gratuity to the employees (under Rule 27 of the Pension

Rules pension includes gratuity). The Court thus found that the

pension package available under the Bihar Pension Rules

provides a better support system to the retired officer/

employees and their dependents unlike the benefits conferred

by the gratuity Act.

Division Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court while

dwelling on the challenge to an exemption notification took into

consideration the fact that the employee therein was a member

of CPF Scheme and obtained his due amount to which the

employer has also contributed by the giving matching grant and

that if all retiral benefits are taken into account then the

amount of gratuity which become payable under the Act of

1972 would be for less than those benefits. Though in this case

specific provisions of Service Rules are not spelt out, however, it

is gathered from the decision that this case also, as in the case

of      Bihar              Electricity                     Board,                 other               retiral               dues              such              as

contributory pension was clubbed with the gratuity to ascertain

the aspect as to whether the exemption notification from a

retrospective date would prejudicially affect the interest of any

person. Similar is the view of Gujarat High Court in 
Vadodara

Mahanagarpalika Naukar
 (supra).




31.         In the case at hand, the Rules adopted by the

respondents are "The Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension)

Rules, 1976".



32.         Under Rule 2(i) the expression "Gratuity" includes: (1)
                                                                       :: 33 ::

   No.554/15, W.P. Nos.13995/15, 13997/15, 13998/2015, 14001/15, 14003/15, 14005/15, 14006/15, 14007/15, 14009/15, 14011/15, 14012/15, 14014/15, 14019/15, 14021/15,

                                           14024/15, 14025/15, 14028/15, 14029/15, 14032/15, 14035/2015, 14036/15, 14554/15, 17404/15, 17405/15 and W.P. No.17407/15




'Service Gratuity" payable under sub-rule (1) of Rule 43; (2)

"Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity" payable under sub-rule (1) of

Rule 44 and (3) "Residuary gratuity" payable under sub-rule (2)

of Rule 44.



33.       Under Rule 2(n) expression "Pension" includes: "Gratuity

except when it is used in contradistinction to gratuity".


34.       Thus, the gratuity though payable under the Rules of

1976 but it is an entity different than pension. Because, while

pension is payable on completion of qualifying service of 10

years as provided under Rule 43 (2) of 1976 Rules, the gratuity

is payable before completion of qualifying service of ten years

as per computation under sub-rule (1) of Rule 43 of 1976

Rules. Whereas, death-cum-retirement gratuity is payable to

an employee who has completed five years' qualifying service

and has become eligible for service gratuity or pension under

Rule 43 on his retirement equal to 1/4th of his emoluments for

each completed six monthly period of qualifying service, subject

to maximum of 16½ times the emoluments.



35.       In other words, an employee completing qualifying

service of ten years would be entitled for pension calculated as
                                                                       :: 34 ::

per sub-rule (2) of Rule 43 and Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity

calculated as per sub-rule (1) of Rule 44. Whereas, an

employee having less than 10 years of qualifying service is

entitled for gratuity as per sub-rule (1) of Rule 43 and Death-

cum-Retirement Gratuity as per sub-rule (1) of Rule 44 if has

completed 5 years of service. The Rules of 1976 does not,

therefore, aim at treating gratuity and pension as one.

In

Association
 AIR 1988 SC 501, reiterating the law 
laid down

in
 
State Government Pensioners' Association v. State of

Andhra Pradesh
 (1986) 3 SCC 501, it has been held by the

Supreme Court: "From the foregoing it is clear that this Court

has made a distinction between the pension payable on

retirement and the gratuity payable on retirement. While

pension is payable periodically as long as the pensioner is alive,

gratuity is ordinarily paid only once on retirement."

       Jain that gratuity has to be taken as a part of
       pension, to support which contention our attention
       has been invited to this Court's judgment in 
Jarnail
       Singh
 case'. Perusal of that judgment shows that
       gratuity was taken to be a part of pension because of
       the definition of "pension" as given in clause (o) of
       sub-rule (i) of Rule 3 of Central Civil Services
       (Pension) Rules, 1972.
 
It is because of this definition
       that the case of 
D.V. Kapoor v. Union of India
 [(1990)
       4 SCC 314] in which it had been held that gratuity
       was not a part of pension, was not followed, as the
       Bench which decided that case had not been referred
       to the aforesaid                                      definition of pension.
 Similar
       observation                         was             made                in         Jarnail                Singh               case'
       regarding F.R. Jesuratnam v. Union of India [1990
       Supp SCC 640] wherein also gratuity was not
       regarded as part of pension without noting the
       abovenoted definition.

       14.             To buttress his aforesaid submission, Shri Jain
       also refers to clause (17) of 
Article 366
 of the
       Constitution which has defined pension to include
       gratuity. Merely because what has been stated in
       clause (17) it cannot be held that gratuity has to be
       taken always and for all purposes as part of pension,
       because this definition apparently has enlarged the
       meaning of the word "pension" by stating that this
       would include gratuity. It is well known that
       legislature very often wants to give enlarged meaning
                                                                       :: 36 ::

          the defined word would include some named related
          subjects also.

 
15.             We, therefore, state that either because of
          what was stated in 
Jarnail Singh
 case or the way
          "pension" has been defined in the Constitution, it
          cannot be held that pension and gratuity are
          conceptually same, as stated in paragraph 9 of 
Jarnail
          Singh
 case' to which our attention is invited by Shri
          Jain. According to us, this Court took the view in
          question in Jarnail Singh because of the definition of
          the word "pension" in the concerned rule; otherwise,
          what was held in D. V. Kapoor and F.R. Jesuratnam
          cases seem to be correct legal position."

In 
Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Dharam

Prakash Sharma
 (1998) 7 SCC 221) while dwelling on the

issue whether an employee of the Municipal Council Delhi

would be entitled to payment of gratuity under the 
Payment of

Gratuity Act
 when the MCD itself has adopted the provisions of

the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, whereunder there is a provision

both for payment of pension as well as of gratuity, it is held:


          "......... 
The Payment of Gratuity Act
 being a special
          provision for payment of gratuity, unless there is
          any provision therein which excludes its
          applicability to an employee who is otherwise
          governed by the provisions of the Pension Rules, it
                                                                      :: 37 ::

         is not possible for us to hold that the respondent is
         not entitled to the gratuity under the 
Payment of
         Gratuity Act
. The only provision which was pointed
         out is the definition of "employee" in 
Section 2 (e)

         which excludes the employees of the Central
         Government and State Governments receiving
         pension and gratuity under the Pension Rules but
         not an employee of the MCD. The MCD employee,
         therefore, would be entitled to the payment of
         gratuity under the 
Payment of Gratuity Act
. The
         mere fact that the gratuity is provided for under the
         Pension Rules will not disentitle him to get the
         payment of gratuity under the 
Payment of Gratuity
         Act
. In view of the overriding provisions contained
         in 
Section 14
 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the
         provision for gratuity under the Pension Rules will
         have no effect. Possibly for this reason, 
Section 5
 of
         the Payment of Gratuity Act has conferred authority
         on the appropriate Government to exempt any
         establishment from the operation of the provisions
         of the Act, if in its opinion the employees of such
         establishment are in receipt of gratuity or
         pensionary benefits not less favourable than the
         benefits conferred under this Act. Admittedly MCD
         has not taken any steps to invoke the power of the
         Central Government under Sectopm 5 of the
         
Payment of Gratuity Act
. In the aforesaid premises,
         we are of the considered opinion that the
         employees of the MCD would be entitled to the
         payment of gratuity under the 
Payment of Gratuity
         Act
 notwithstanding the fact that the provisions of
         the Pension Rules have been made applicable to
         them for the purpose of determining the pension.

         Needless to mention that the employees cannot
         claim gratuity available under the Pension Rules. ."

                                                                       :: 38 ::

made on behalf of respondents to establish that the provisions

under the Rules of 1976 are more beneficial than that of 1972

Act but by clubbing the gratuity and pension; however, since

the two are different entities, respondents have utterly failed to

establish that the gratuity payable under Pension Rules, 1976

are more beneficial than payable under 1972 Act. And since by

virtue of 
Section 14
 of 1972 Act the provisions therein have an

overriding effect, the accrual of right to receive gratuity under

1972 Act cannot be taken away from the existing pensioners

even if it is within the powers of the appropriate government to

cause exemption from a retrospective date.



40.       The next issue for consideration is that whether the

impugned notification takes away the vested right said to have

accrued in favour of existing pensioners. In order words,

whether the retrospective operation would have an adverse

effect over the right of existing pensioners for a gratuity under

the Act of 1972.

Amendment in Gujarat

Panchayat Act, 1961
 which extinguished the status of ex-

ministerial employees allocated to Panchayat Service as

Secretaries, Officers and Servants of Gram and Nagar

Panchayats as government servants, it was held by the

Supreme Court -




          "52. The legislature is undoubtedly competent to
          legislate with retrospective effect to take away or
          impair any vested right acquired under existing
          laws but since the laws are made under a written
          Constitution, and have to conform to the dos and
          don'ts of the Constitution; neither prospective nor
          retrospective laws can be made so as to contravene
          Fundamental Rights. The law must satisfy the
          requirements of the Constitution today taking into
          account the accused or acquired rights of the
          parties today. The law cannot say twenty years ago
          the parties had no rights, therefore, the
          requirements of the Constitution will be satisfied if
          the law is dated back by twenty years. We are
          concerned with today's rights and not yesterday's.

          A Legislature cannot legislate today with reference
          to a situation that obtained twenty years ago and
          ignore the march of events and the constitutional
          rights accrued in the course of the twenty years.

          That would be most arbitrary, unreasonable and a
          negation of history."

Salabuddin Mohamed Yunus v. State of A.P.

1984 (Supp) SCC 399, while striking down the amendment
in the relevant Rules applicable to employee in the service of

the Constitution of India, which was effective from a
retrospective date by substituting "Rs.857.15 a month" in place
of "Rs.1000 a month" in clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 299
being violative of 
Article 31(1)

it was held that -




          "6. .. The fundamental right to receive pension
          according to the rules in force on the date of his

          amendment to the said Rule 299(1)(b) more than
          fifteen years after that right had accrued to him,
          what was done was to take away the appellant's
          right to receive pension according to the rules in
          force at the date of his retirement or in any event
          to curtail and abridge that right, To that extent,

-



          "24. In many of these decisions the expressions
          "vested rights" or "accrued rights" have been used
          while striking down the impugned provisions which
          had been given retrospective operation so as to
          have an adverse effect in the matter of promotion,
          seniority, substantive appointment, etc. of the

          from an anterior date and thereby taking away the
          benefits available under the rule in force at that
          time. It has been held that such an amendment
          having retrospective operation which has the effect
          of taking away a benefit already available to the
          employee under the existing rule is arbitrary,
          discriminatory and violative of the rights
          guaranteed under 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the
          Constitution. We are unable to hold that these
          decisions are not in consonance with the decisions
          in Roshan Lal Tandon AIR 1967 SC 1189, B.S.
          Yadav AIR 1969 SC 118 and Raman Lal Keshav Lal
          Soni (1983) 2 SCC 33.



45.       There is another reason why the impugned notification

will exclude the persons in whose favour there exist decision by

the Authorities under 1972 Act of receiving gratuity thereunder

and such decision having attained finality. 
In 
State of Tamil

Nadu v. State of Kerala
 AIR 2014 SC 2407, it is held :-


          "146. ... Once a judicial decision on ascertainment
          of a particular fact achieves finality, we are afraid
          the legislature cannot reopen such final judgment
          directly or indirectly. In such cases, the courts, if
          brought before them, may reopen such cases in
          exercise of their own discretion."



46.       To sum up, though we uphold the competence of the

appropriate Government to issue a notification of exemption as

also notifying exemption from a retrospective date. However,

the notification dated 10.12.2014 since does not meet out the
                                                                                         :: 42 ::

                  twin safeguards, viz. that the gratuity or pensionary benefit

                  already available to the employees is not less favourable than

                  the benefit conferred by the Act of 1972 and that the

                  retrospective exemption should not prejudicially affect interest

                  of any person. We hold that the notification will not nullify nor

                  take away the effect and benefit of the orders passed by the

                  Authorities under 1972 Act. Nor will it take away the right of

                  the employees, including the existing pensioners, of gratuity

                  under 1972 Act.



                  47.       The petitions are finally disposed of. However, no costs.
