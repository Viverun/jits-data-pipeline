                   further sold by Ambience to Tutelage, the notice stated that it was
                  being addressed to both the respondents. The notice alleged that the
                  leased area was not habitable and that the columns in the leased area
                  did not possess the requisite compressive strength and would require
                  repair. As neither Ambience nor Tutelage took any steps in this
                  regard, the notice alleged that the petitioner had to spend considerable
                  amounts in attempting to make the leased area habitable. It was further
                  pointed out that the Enforcement Directorate had also issued a Public
                  Notice stating that the entire building at Commercial Plot No.10 had
                  been attached by it in relation to an investigation into the affairs of the
                  Ambience Group. In these circumstances, the notice alleged that the
                  petitioner was not in a position to enjoy the leased area. The
                  petitioner, therefore, invoked Clause 18.2 of the lease deed which
                  entitled the petitioner to terminate the lease deed, if the leased area
                  became unusable for the petitioner. Alleging that Ambience was in
                  fundamental breach of its obligations under the lease deed, and had
                  failed to provide the usable leased area to the petitioner despite
                  repeated representations in that regard, the petitioner stated that it
                  intended to terminate the lease deed. The respondents were therefore
                  called upon to cure the defaults in the leased area within 60 days, by
                  providing a habitable and usable access to the leased area and
                  reimbursing to the petitioner the amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90, stated to
                  have been incurred by the petitioner in executing the repairs in the
                  leased area.      Failure, on the part of the respondents, to cure the
                  defaults within 60 days, it was said, would constrain the petitioner to
                  issue a notice for cancellation of the lease deed.

                   7.     The period of 60 days, provided in the notice, expired on 9 July
                  2023. Neither of the respondents, however, took any step towards
                  curing the defaults indicated by the petitioner. The petitioner,
                  therefore, addressed a second communication to both the respondents
                  on 10 July 2023, alleging that the respondents continued to be in
                  breach of their obligations to provide a habitable and usable access to
                  the leased area to the petitioner and to reimburse the amounts spent by
                  the petitioner in repairing the premises.       The respondents were,
                  therefore, put on notice that failure, on their part, to cure the notified
                  defects     within   30    days    would     result    in   ipso      facto
                  cancellation/termination of the Lease Deed. The notice also asserted
                  that the petitioner was entitled to recover, from the respondents, the
                  security deposit of ₹ 1,92,48,300/-, maintenance security deposit of ₹
                  47,05,140/- and any other amounts due to the petitioner, apart from ₹
                  1,29,01,487.90 incurred by the petitioner in repairing the leased area.



                  8.     According to the petitioner, as the notified defects were not
                  cured by the respondents, the lease deed stood terminated on 10
                  August 2023. The petitioner in the circumstances, addressed a
                  communication dated 10 August 2023 to Tutelage, handing over
                  thereunder the vacant, physical and actual possession of the leased
                  area to Tutelage.



                  9.     Simultaneously, the petitioner addressed a Notice of Demand to
                  both the respondents, calling upon them to pay, to the petitioner, a
                  total amount of ₹ 14,63,44,072.29 towards cost of repairs and reworks
                  carried out by the petitioner and agreed to be repaid by Ambience, as

                   well as other costs incurred by the petitioner, and compensation for
                  the losses suffered by the petitioner. The respondents were called
                  upon to pay the aforesaid amount within 30 days, failing which the
                  petitioner stated that it would seek recourse to appropriate legal
                  remedies.



                  10.        Ambience responded on 11 September 2023, denying all
                  liabilities in the matter in view of the sale of the leased area to
                  Tutelage on 18 November 2022, with concomitant transfer of all its
                  rights and obligations. The situation thus reached a stage, according to
                  the petitioner, where it was left with no option but to seek recourse to
                  the remedies available in law.



                  11.        In accordance with the protocol envisaged by Clause 26.1 of the
                  Lease Deed, the petitioner addressed a notice to the respondents on 12
                  September 2023 calling upon them to settle the matter amicably.



                  12.        This attempt also failed. The petitioner, thereupon, issued a
                  notice to the respondents under Section 214 of the Arbitration and
                  Conciliation Act, 19965 on 3 October 2023, proposing resolution of
                  the disputes between the petitioner and respondents by arbitration.
                  The petitioner suggested the name of Hon'ble Ms. Justice R.
                  Banumathi, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India, to arbitrate
                  on the issue.

                   13.       On 2 November 2023, Ambience replied, denying all liability in
                  the matter. There has been no response from Tutelage to the Notice of
                  Arbitration dated 3 October 2023.



                  14.       It is in these circumstances that the petitioner has approached
                  this Court under Section 11(6)6 of the 1996 Act, requiring the Court to
                  appoint an Arbitrator to arbitrate on the disputes between the
                  petitioner and respondents.



                  15.       Both the respondents have filed counter-affidavits by way of
                  response to the writ petition and the petitioner has filed rejoinders
                  thereto.



                  Rival Submissions



                  16.       I have heard lengthy arguments from both sides. The petitioner
                  was represented by Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, learned Senior Counsel
                  assisted by learned Counsel Mr. Sidharth Sethi, Ms. Pragya Chauhan,
                  Mr. Kunal Saini and Ms. Meherunissa Anand. Mr. V. Anush Raajan
                  appeared for Ambience and Mr. Hitesh Sachar represented Tutelage.



                  Opening submissions of Mr. Raj Shekhar Rao


                  6

                      (6)   Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,--

                            (a)        a party fails to act as required under that procedure; or

                            (b)        the parties, or the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them
                            under that procedure; or

                            (c)        a person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it
                            under that procedure,
                  the appointment shall be made, on an application of the party, by the arbitral institution designated by the
                  Supreme Court, in case of international commercial arbitration, or by the High Court, in case of arbitrations
                  other than international commercial arbitration, as the case may be to take the necessary measure, unless the
                  agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for securing the appointment.

                   17.     Mr. Rao submits that Clause 23.1 of the Lease Deed dated 15
                  January 2021 releases Ambience only from "further liability".
                  Moreover, Clause 23.1 recorded the consent of Ambience to attorn the
                  lease to Tutelage provided Tutelage honoured the terms of the Lease
                  Deed.    He submits that no such document, attorning the lease to
                  Tutelage, was ever signed by his client.            Ambience, therefore,
                  continues to remain liable to the petitioner.



                  18.     At the same time, possession of the leased area was handed over
                  by Ambience to Tutelage. Ambience also transferred the security
                  deposit paid by the petitioner to Tutelage. Any direction for refund of
                  the security deposit would, therefore, have to be issued to Tutelage.
                  Moreover, inasmuch as the petitioner continued to remain in the
                  leased area for nearly 9 months after the sale thereof to Tutelage, the
                  issue of the extent to which Ambience, or Tutelage, or both, would be
                  liable to the petitioner, also fell for determination.



                  19.     Thus, submits Mr. Rao, both respondents have necessarily to be
                  impleaded as parties in the arbitral proceedings, and it would be for
                  the learned arbitrator to adjudicate on the situs of liability.

                          "2.5 Subsequent to the execution of the Lease Deed, the
                         Petitioner was informed on 5 December 2022 that Respondent No
                         1 had sold the Leased Area to Respondent No 2 in November 2022
                         and that:



                                    (i)    all payments on deposits made by the Petitioner
                                    under and in terms of the Lease Deed had been transferred
                                    by Respondent No. 1 to Respondent No. 2;



                                    (ii)    Respondent No. 1 had assigned all its rights and
                                    obligations under the Lease Deed to Respondent No. 2.



                         2.6     As such, the Respondent No. 2 stepped into the shoes of
                         Respondent No. 1 with effect from November 2022 and became
                         the successor in interest to the Respondent No. 1. Respondent No.
                         2 is entitled to all rights which were enforceable by the Respondent
                         No. 1 under the Lease Deed and is bound by all obligations that
                         Respondent No. 1 was bound by, without any further act or deed.
                         Being the assignee and successor interest of Respondent No. 1,
                         Respondent No. 2 is also bound by the arbitration clause contained
                         in the Lease Deed and is a necessary party for the proper, fair and
                         final adjudication of the disputes between the parties."



 
Mr. Raajan submits that the petitioner was, therefore, always aware of
                  the sale of the leased area to Tutelage. No live dispute, therefore, he
                  submits, survives between the petitioner and Ambience.                        The
                  petitioner cannot, therefore, forcibly involve Ambience in the
                  proposed arbitral proceedings.           He relies on paras 25 and 28 of
                  
N.T.P.C. Ltd v. SPML Infra Ltd7
 to submit that a Court which is
                  seized with an application under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act has
                  also to examine whether a live arbitral dispute exists between the
                  parties.

                  echoes Mr. Rao's submission that Clause 23.1 of the Lease Deed only
                 insulates Ambience from "further liability".                  Inasmuch as the
                 allegation of the petitioner against Ambience relates to a period prior
                 to the sale of the leased area to Tutelage, Mr. Sachar submits that
                 Ambience continues to remain liable towards the petitioner and, in
                 fact, Tutelage has no liability in that regard. He also draws attention
                 to paras 3, 4 and 11 of the Legal Notice dated 9 May 2023 addressed
                 by the petitioner to the respondents, which read thus:

                          "3. As per the terms of the Lease Deed, Ambience was obliged to
                          provide the Leased Area to ESRI in a habitable, accessible
                          condition to enable ESRI to be able to use it for its activities.
                          Ambience had also represented that the Leased Area was
                          structurally sound and in good condition. Even otherwise, in law
                          also, providing habitable access to the leased area is a fundamental
                          obligation of the lessor.



                          4. However, it is an admitted fact and a matter of record that till
                          date (i.e. even after 2.5 years of execution of the Lease Deed),
                          Ambience/Tutelage has failed to provide a habitable or usable
                          Leased Area to ESRI. This fact has been documented in various
                          communications, photographs and reports of third-party
                          vendors/consultants. Pertinently, on 29 August 2022, Ambience
                          had categorically acknowledged that the compressive strength on
                          all columns in the Leased Area and Building failed to meet the
                          appropriate requirements which would require repair.



                          11. Therefore, by way of this notice, ESRI is notifying the
                          defaults/breaches of Ambience/Tutelage and as a last opportunity,
                          calling upon Ambience/Tutelage to cure the defaults within a
                          period of 60 days by:

                                  a. Providing a habitable and usable access to the Leased
                                  Area to ESRI;

                                  b. Reimbursing the amount of INR 1,29,01,487.90 incurred
                                  by ESRI in executing repair works for water leakage and
                                  accommodating Landlord's structural remediation work
                                  within the Leased Area."

                   petitioner's clear allegation was against Ambience, in failing to
                  provide the leased area to the petitioner in a habitable and accessible
                  condition. Even in paras 4 and 11, he submits that the petitioner's
                  allegation continues to remain against Ambience. The claims of the
                  petitioner in para 11, he submits, have also to be met by Ambience,
                  not by Tutelage.



                  22.    Mr. Sachar also places reliance on para 15, 16 and 19 of the
                  reply tendered by Ambience to the Notice of Demand dated 10
                  August 2023 of the petitioner:

                         "15. As per the terms of the lease deed, ESRI is liable to pay

                         of Clause 14.1.1 of the Lease Deed and you are hereby called upon
                         to forthwith pay INR 9,38,03,382/- as of 15th August 2023. You
                         will note that the above demanded amount will carry interest@
                         18% per annum up to the date of payment, if the demanded amount
                         is not paid within the 30 days of receipt of the present letter and a
                         cure period of 30 days.

                         19.     On several occasions, including but not limited to the
                         emails from Sim Saran, Senior Real Estate Attorney of 01.11.2022
                         and emails from Mr. Rohit Singh of India Operations, ESRI that
                         ESRI even as of November 2022 was in occupation of the Leased
                         Area and was running its operations from the premises. All the
                         requests of ESRI to delay the rent commencement on one pretext
                         or the other, viz. water seepage in July 2022 or the structural
                         integrity improvements and reports, were denied by Ambience and
                         demands were raised on several occasions. However, ESRI on one
                         hand occupying the Leased Area merely used the reason of

                  The counter claims of Ambience, therefore, he submits, are also
                  against the petitioner. The contractual liability, if any, therefore, is
                  between the petitioner and Ambience. He further submits that there
                  has never been any attornment of the lease by the petitioner to
                  Tutelage.



                  23.    Mr. Sachar therefore submits that it is not Ambience, but
                  Tutelage, which is being unnecessarily dragged into arbitral
                  proceedings.



                  Mr. Rao's submissions in rejoinder



                  24.    Advancing submissions by way of rejoinder to the submissions
                  of Mr. Raajan and Mr. Sachar, Mr. Rao submits that, inasmuch as the
                  leased area was sold by Ambience to Tutelage on 18 November 2022,
                  and, on 10 August 2023, possession of the leased area was handed
                  over by the petitioner to Tutelage, both respondents have necessarily
                  to be made parties in the arbitral proceedings, and it would be for the
                  arbitrator to adjudicate as to the actual situs of liability.



                  25.    Mr. Rao alludes to the following e-mail dated 29 August 2022
                  addressed by Ambience to the petitioner, to submit that Ambience
                  cannot seek to escape its liability merely on the ground that it had sold
                  the leased area to Tutelage along with all rights and obligations:

                  This e-mail, he submits, was written much before the leased area was
                  sold by Ambience to Tutelage. Ambience cannot, therefore, plead
                  indifference in the matter.



                  26.    After having been sold the leased area, Tutelage, too, made no
                  effort to rectify the defects in the premises. This is why the petitioner
                  was compelled to issue a Notice of Default to the respondents to
                  terminate the lease. Mr. Rao points out that, in the Notice of Default
                  addressed by the petitioner to the respondents on 9 May 2023, the
                  petitioner had claimed not only provision of a habitable and usable
                  access to the leased area but also reimbursement of the amount of ₹
                  1,29,01,487.90 spent by the petitioner in executing repair of the leased
                  area. Inasmuch as Tutelage had purchased the leased area with all

                   rights and obligations, the question would fall for consideration as to
                  the extent to which Tutelage would be liable for the monetary claim of
                  the petitioner. It would be for the learned arbitrator to adjudicate on
                  this issue.       For this purpose, Mr. Rao further refers me to the
                  following paras from the Notice of Demand sent by the petitioner to
                  the respondents on 10 August 2023:

                         "3.    In terms of clause 18.2 of the Lease Deed,
                         Ambience/Tutelage is obliged to refund the following refundable
                         deposits to ESRI within 30 days of the termination of the Lease
                         Deed (i.e. by 9 September 2023):



                         3.1   Interest free refundable security deposit equivalent to 6
                         months' rent amounting to ₹ 1,92,48,300; and

                         3.2        Maintenance Security Deposit amounting to ₹ 47,05,140.



                         4.      In addition to the above, in view of the fundamental
                         breaches/defaults committed by Ambience/Tutelage, ESRI is also
                         entitled to receive the below amounts incurred by:



                         4.1   Cost of Repairs and Reworks carried out by ESRI and
                         agreed to be reimbursed by Ambience

                                    4.1.1 It is an admitted fact that ESRI has spent
                                    considerable amounts in attempting to make the Leased
                                    Area habitable and usable. An amount of ₹ 1,29,01,487.90
                                    was incurred by ESRI in executing repair works for water
                                    leakage and to accommodate structural remediation work
                                    within the Leased Area. Though Ambience had admitted
                                    its liability to reimburse such amount to ESRI, it has failed
                                    to do so to date, despite repeated requests.



                         4.2        Other costs incurred by ESRI

                                    4.2.1 ESRI had installed certain enhancements and fit
                                    outs over the Leased Area and had to expend substantial
                                    amounts towards the same. On termination of the Lease
                                    Deed, whatever could be removed, has been removed by
                                    ESRI with a view to mitigate its losses. However, it is not
                                    possible and/or feasible to remove certain enhancements
                                    made to the Leased Area by ESRI. An indicative (and not

                                       the present notice. At the same time, since these are being
                                      left behind, Ambience/Tutelage will obviously benefit from
                                      these enhancements that have been installed at ESRI's cost.

                                      However, for ESRI, these are sunk costs, attributable solely
                                      to the breaches by Ambience/Tutelage. Consequently,
                                      Ambience/Tutelage is also liable to pay these sunk costs to
                                      ESRI. ESRI is in the process of quantifying the exact sunk
                                      costs incurred by it towards the enhancements that cannot
                                      be removed and the quantification will be submitted in due
                                      course.



 
27.       Mr. Rao also refers me to the reply dated 11 September 2023 by
                  Ambience to the said notice, and points out that though, in the said
                  reply, Ambience has disowned all liabilities vis-a-vis the petitioner
                  regarding determination of lease and its sequelae, it has nonetheless
                  answered the claim of damages for the period during which the
                  ownership of the property continued to be with Ambience, i.e. prior to
                  sale of property to Tutelage. Thus, he submits that Ambience cannot
                  completely disclaim liability in the transaction. Mr. Rao has also
                  placed reliance on para 163 of the judgment of the Constitution Bench
                  of the Supreme Court in 
Cox and Kings Ltd v. SAP India Pvt Ltd8
.




                  28.       Mr. Rao submits that, in view of Section 16(1)9 of the 1996
                  Act, which incorporates the kompetenz-kompetenz doctrine, the issue
                  of the relevant parties to an arbitral dispute goes to the very root of the
                  competence of the Arbitral Tribunal, and must be left to the Arbitral
                  Tribunal.

                   Analysis


                  Scope of jurisdiction of the referral court under Section 11(6) and
                  Section 11(6A)



                  29.       The first aspect to be examined is the scope of inquiry by the
                  referral court under Section 11(6) of the 1996 Act.



                  30.       Sub-section (6A)10 was introduced in Section 11 by 
Section
                  6(ii)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act 201511.
                  Section 3(v) of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act,
                  201912 omits sub-section (6A) from 
Section 11
. 
Section 3(v)
 of the
                  2019 Amendment Act, however, is yet to be enforced and, therefore,
                  
Section 11(6A)
 continues to remain on the statute book and in force.
                  This position stands recognized in para 161 of Cox and Kings:

                            "161. In 2015, the 
Arbitration Act
 was amended to insert 
Section
                            11
(6-A). The said provision reads as follows:



                                      "11. (6-A) The Supreme Court, or as the case may be, the
                                      High Court, while considering any application under sub-
                                      section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), shall,
                                      notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any
                                      court, confine to the examination of the existence of an
                                      arbitration agreement."

                                                                            (emphasis supplied)

                            By virtue of non obstante clause, 
Section 11
(6-A) has set out a new
                            position, which takes away the basis of the position 
laid down in

                            SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.13 In 2019, Parliament passed the


                                      (b)        a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not
                                      entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.

                  10


                     (6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under
                  sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of
                  any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.

                 Evolution of the law - the decisions in Boghara Polyfab, Master
                 Construction Co., New India Assurance Co. Ltd, Duro Felguera,
                 Antique Art Exports, Mayawati Trading and Vidya Drolia



                 31.      Prior to the insertion of sub section (6A) in 
Section 11
, the view
                 of the Supreme Court with respect to the issues which could be
                 examined by a referral court, seized with a petition for referring a
                 dispute to arbitration, was more expansive. 
In 
National Insurance
                 Co. Ltd v. Boghara Polyfab Pvt Ltd14
, the Supreme Court held that,
                 where it was contended that no arbitrable dispute survives as the
                 dispute stood discharged by accord and satisfaction, the referral court
                 had to examine the issue.
 
Following the decision in Boghara
                 Polyfab, the Supreme 
Court further held
 in 
U.O.I. v. Master
                 Construction Co.15
, that where reliance was placed on a discharge
                 voucher, no claim certificate or settlement agreement as evidence of
                 discharge of the claim, the referral court had to prima facie examine
                 the credibility of the allegations before referring the dispute to
                 arbitration.
 
Further in 
New India Assurance Co. Ltd v. Genus Power
                 Infrastructure Ltd16
, the Supreme Court held that where fraud,
                 coercion, duress and undue influence was alleged, the party raising the
                 allegations had to, prima facie, substantiate the allegations by

                  evidence.




                 32.      Apparently of the view that a referral court ought not to enter
                 into these aspects, which should be left for decision by the Arbitral
                 Tribunal, the legislature, by the 2015 Amendment Act. introduced sub

 
-section (6A) in 
Section 11
 of the 1996 Act. 
Section 11(6A)
, plainly
                 read, strictly confines the scope of examination by a referral court
                 exercising referral jurisdiction under 
Section 11(6)
 to the existence of
                 an arbitration agreement. This position was explicitly elucidated, by
                 the Supreme Court, in 
Duro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port
                 Ltd17
, by ruling that the jurisdiction of the referral court was,
                 following the insertion of 
Section 11(6A)
, "limited to examining
                 whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties - nothing
                 more, nothing less".




 
33.      A two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in 
United India
                 Insurance Co Ltd v. Antique Art Exports Pvt. Ltd18
, even after the
                 introduction of 
Section 11(6A)
 and the decision in Duro Felguera
                 held, nonetheless, that a plea of discharge of the debt by accord and
                 satisfaction, if urged, would have to be examined by the referral court
                 under 
Section 11(6)
.
 
This view was, however, reversed by a Bench of
                 three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court in 
Mayawati Trading Pvt
                 Ltd v. Pradyuat Deb Burman19
, which again reiterated the principle
                 in Duro Felguera that, post the insertion of sub-section (6A) in

, the referral court had to confine the scope of its

                  examination to the factum of existence of an arbitration agreement,
                 and not peregrinate beyond that.




 
34.      Another Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court,
                 in 
Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corporation20
, examined the entire
                 legal position and held thus:


                          "133. Prima facie case in the context of 
Section 8
 is not to be
                          confused with the merits of the case put up by the parties which
                          has to be established before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is restricted to
                          the subject-matter of the suit being prima facie arbitrable under a
                          valid arbitration agreement. Prima facie case means that the
                          assertions on these aspects are bona fide. When read with the
                          principles of separation and competence-competence and 
Section
                          34
 of the Arbitration Act, the referral court without getting bogged
                          down would compel the parties to abide unless there are good and
                          substantial reasons to the contrary.



                          134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a primary
                          first review to weed out manifestly and ex facie non-existent and
                          invalid arbitration agreements and non-arbitrable disputes. The
                          prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood
                          and trim off the side branches in straightforward cases where
                          dismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law
                          the litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the court is
                          certain that no valid arbitration agreement exists or the
                          disputes/subject-matter are not arbitrable, the application
                          under 
Section 8
 would be rejected. At this stage, the court should
                          not get lost in thickets and decide debatable questions of facts.
                          Referral proceedings are preliminary and summary and not a mini
                          trial......



                                                          *****


                          138. ......On the other hand, issues relating to contract
                          formation, existence, validity and non-arbitrability would be
                          connected and intertwined with the issues underlying the merits of
                          the respective disputes/claims. They would be factual and disputed
                          and for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.



                          139. We would not like to be too prescriptive, albeit observe that
                          the court may for legitimate reasons, to prevent wastage of public

                          and private resources, can exercise judicial discretion to conduct an
                         intense yet summary prima facie review while remaining conscious
                         that it is to assist the arbitration procedure and not usurp
                         jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. Undertaking a detailed full
                         review or a long-drawn review at the referral stage would obstruct
                         and cause delay undermining the integrity and efficacy of
                         arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Conversely, if the
                         court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine
                         effectiveness of both the arbitration and the court. There are certain
                         cases where the prima facie examination may require a deeper
                         consideration. The court's challenge is to find the right amount of
                         and the context when it would examine the prima facie case or
                         exercise restraint. The legal order needs a right balance between
                         avoiding arbitration obstructing tactics at referral stage and
                         protecting parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is
                         clearly non-arbitrable.



                         140. Accordingly, when it appears that prima facie review
                         would be inconclusive, or on consideration inadequate as it
                         requires detailed examination, the matter should be left for final
                         determination by the Arbitral Tribunal selected by the parties by
                         consent. The underlying rationale being not to delay or defer and to
                         discourage parties from using referral proceeding as a ruse to delay
                         and obstruct. In such cases a full review by the courts at this stage
                         would encroach on the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and
                         violate the legislative scheme allocating jurisdiction between the
                         courts and the Arbitral Tribunal. Centralisation of litigation with
                         the Arbitral Tribunal as the primary and first adjudicator is
                         beneficent as it helps in quicker and efficient resolution of
                         disputes.

                         153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression "existence of an
                         arbitration agreement" in 
Section 11
 of the Arbitration Act, would
                         include aspect of validity of an arbitration agreement, albeit the
                         court at the referral stage would apply the prima facie test on the
                         basis of principles set out in this judgment. In cases of debatable
                         and disputable facts, and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the
                         court would force the parties to abide by the arbitration agreement
                         as the Arbitral Tribunal has primary jurisdiction and authority to
                         decide the disputes including the question of jurisdiction and non-
                         arbitrability.

Sections 8
 or 11 of
                                    the 
Arbitration Act
, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016
                                    (with retrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post
                                    the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 9-8-
                                    2019), is no longer applicable.



                                    154.2. Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the
                                    court under 
Sections 8
 and 
11
 of the Arbitration Act is
                                    identical but extremely limited and restricted.



                                    154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the
                                    legislative mandate clear from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of
                                    2019, and the principle of severability and competence-
                                    competence, is that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred
                                    first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-
                                    arbitrability. The court has been conferred power of
                                    "second look" on aspects of non-arbitrability post the
                                    award in terms of sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of 
Section
                                    34(2)(a)
 or sub-clause (i) of 
Section 34(2)(b)
 of the
                                    Arbitration Act.



                                    154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere
                                    at 
Section 8
 or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie
                                    certain that the arbitration agreement is non-existent,
                                    invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature
                                    and facet of non-arbitrability would, to some extent,
                                    determine the level and nature of judicial scrutiny. The
                                    restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties
                                    from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is
                                    demonstrably "non-arbitrable" and to cut off the deadwood.
                                    The court by default would refer the matter when
                                    contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly
                                    arguable; when consideration in summary proceedings
                                    would be insufficient and inconclusive; when facts are
                                    contested; when the party opposing arbitration adopts
                                    delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration
                                    proceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into
                                    a mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the
                                    jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and
                                    uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative
                                    dispute resolution mechanism."

                  the Supreme Court in 
NTPC Ltd v. SPML Infra Ltd21
, on which Mr.
                 Sachar places reliance. The appeal in NTPC arose from a decision
                 rendered by this Court. NTPC and SPML Infra22 executed a contract
                 for      installation     services   in   a   power   project   situated      at
                 Vishakhapatnam. SPML furnished bank guarantees to the tune of ₹
                 14,96,89,136/- to secure NTPC.                NTPC issued a Completion
                 Certificate on 27 March 2019, but withheld the bank guarantees. On
                 SPML inquiring about the reasons for withholding the bank
                 guarantees, NTPC referred to certain pending liabilities and disputes
                 with SPML with respect to other projects. SPML protested, stating
                 that NTPC had no jurisdiction to link the bank guarantees to other
                 liabilities of SPML. Following this, SPML raised a demand of ₹
                 72,01,53,899/- on NTPC. NTPC, naturally, did not release the bank
                 guarantees, resulting in SPML filing WP (C) 7213/2019 before this
                 Court for a direction to NTPC to release the bank guarantees
                 forthwith.




                 36.       Pending the writ petition, NTPC and SPML entered into a
                 settlement agreement on 27 May 2020, whereunder NTPC agreed to
                 release the withheld bank guarantees and SPML agreed to withdraw
                 WP (C) 7213/2019 and also not to initiate any other proceedings,
                 including arbitration. The bank guarantees were, therefore, released
                 by NTPC on 30 June 2020, and SPML withdrew WP (C) 7213/2019
                 on 21 September 2020. SPML, however, thereafter, repudiated the
                 settlement agreement and filed a petition under

                   1996 Act before this Court, seeking appointment of an arbitrator to
                  arbitrate on the disputes with NTPC. It was alleged, in the said
                  petition, that SPML had been forced to enter into the settlement
                  agreement dated 27 May 2020 by duress and coercion. It was alleged
                  that the retention of the bank guarantees by NTPC had left SPML with
                  no option but to agree to sign the settlement agreement. Submitting
                  that NTPC had failed to appoint an arbitrator despite repeated requests
                  by SPML, SPML requested this Court to step in and appoint an
                  arbitrator in exercise of its power under 
Section 11(6)
 of the 1996 Act.



                  37.    Responding to the writ petition, NTPC submitted, inter alia,
                  that no dispute survived between the parties in view of the settlement
                  agreement dated 27 May 2020, in compliance of which NTPC
                  released, to SPML, the bank guarantees and SPML withdrew WP(C)
                  7213/2019.        The claim of SPML, therefore, stood discharged by
                  accord and satisfaction. The allegations of duress and coercion were
                  categorically denied as false and attempt to wriggle out of the
                  settlement agreement. NTPC, therefore, prayed that SPML's petition
                  under 
Section 11(6)
 of the 1996 Act be rejected outright.



                  38.    This Court held, on SPML's plea of duress and coercion and
                  NTPC's response thereto, that it was unable to accept NTPC's
                  contention that the dispute as to whether the contract between NTPC
                  and SPML stood discharged/novated by the settlement agreement
                  dated 27 May 2020 was untenable, insubstantial, or frivolous. This
                  Court, therefore, allowed SPML's petition and appointed a retired
                  Judge of this Court to arbitrate on the disputes.

                   39.        NTPC appealed to the Supreme Court.



                  40.        The Supreme Court took note of the decisions already cited
                  hereinabove, upto Vidya Drolia, as well as a subsequent decision of
                  the Supreme Court in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd23.
                  Having examined all these decisions, the Supreme Court held the
                  position of law to be thus:

                             "25. Eye of the Needle: The above-referred precedents
                             crystallise the position of law that the pre-referral jurisdiction of
                             the courts under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Act is very narrow and
                             inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence
                             and the validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an
                             inquiry as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant's
                             privity to the said agreement. These are matters which require a
                             thorough examination by the referral court. The secondary inquiry
                             that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect to the
                             non-arbitrability of the dispute.



                             26.     As a general rule and a principle, the arbitral tribunal is the
                             preferred first authority to determine and decide all questions of
                             non-arbitrability. As an exception to the rule, and rarely as a
                             demurrer, the referral court may reject claims which are manifestly
                             and ex-facie non-arbitrable...



                             27.     The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of
                             a claim is only prima facie. Referral courts must not undertake a
                             full review of the contested facts; they must only be confined to a
                             primary first review and let facts speak for themselves. This also
                             requires the courts to examine whether the assertion on
                             arbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the
                             facts must lead to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige
                             of doubt that the claim is non-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if
                             there is the slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to
                             arbitration.



                             28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is
                             necessary and compelling. It is intertwined with the duty of the

                           referral court to protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate
                          when the matter is demonstrably non-arbitrable30. It has been
                          termed as a legitimate interference by courts to refuse reference in
                          order to prevent wastage of public and private resources31.

 
Further, as noted in 
Vidya Drolia
 (supra), if this duty within the
                          limited compass is not exercised, and the Court becomes too
                          reluctant to intervene, it may undermine the effectiveness of both,
                          arbitration and the Court32.
 
Therefore, this Court or a High Court,
                          as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under 
Section
                          11(6)
 of the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to
                          deliver a purported dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of
                          the chosen arbitrator, as explained in 
DLF Home Developers
                          Limited v. Rajapura Homes Pvt
. Ltd24."




                 41.      The Supreme Court went on, thereafter, to apply these
                 principles to the facts before it and held on facts thus:

                          "44. A simple narration of the bare facts, as indicated above,
                          leads us to conclude that the allegations of coercion and economic
                          duress are not bona fide, and that there were no pending claims
                          between the parties for submission to arbitration. The
                          Respondent's claim fits in the description of an attempt to initiate
                          "ex facie meritless, frivolous and dishonest litigation". We will
                          endeavour to give reasons for our conclusion.



                          45.      The whole dispute revolves around the solitary act of the
                          Appellant, NTPC, in not returning the Bank Guarantees despite the
                          successful completion of work. This continued even after SPML
                          issued the No-Demand Certificate and NTPC released the final
                          payment. These undisputed facts led to the institution of the Writ
                          Petition before the Delhi High Court. There were no allegations of
                          coercion or economic duress compelling SPML to withdraw any
                          pending claims under the subject contract as a condition for the
                          return of the Bank Guarantees. On the contrary, the only allegation
                          by SPML was with respect to NTPC's "illegal" action of
                          interlinking the release of the Bank Guarantees with some other
                          contracts. This was precisely the argument before the High Court,
                          and, in fact, this submission is recorded by the High Court while
                          issuing notice and injuncting NTPC. This fact clearly indicates that
                          the plea of coercion and economic duress leading to the Settlement
                          Agreement is an afterthought.



                          46.    We will now examine whether the allegations of coercion
                          and economic duress in the execution of the Settlement Agreement

                          are bona fide or not. This inquiry has a direct bearing on the
                         arbitrability of the dispute. It was during the subsistence of the
                         Writ Petition and the High Court's interim order, when SPML had
                         complete protection of the Court, that the parties entered into the
                         Settlement Agreement. This agreement was comprehensive. It inter
                         alia provided for (i) the release of Bank Guarantees by NTPC, (ii)
                         the withdrawal of SPML's Writ Petition, (iii) restraining NTPC
                         from filing contempt proceedings against SPML for letting the
                         Bank Guarantees expire, and finally, (iv) restraining SPML from
                         initiating any proceedings under the subject contract, including
                         arbitration. The Settlement Agreement also recorded that there
                         were no subsisting issues pending between the parties.



                         47.     The plea of coercion and economic duress must be seen in
                         the context of the execution of the Settlement Agreement not being
                         disputed, and its implementation leading to the release of the Bank
                         Guarantees on 30.06.2020 also not being disputed. Almost three
                         weeks after the release of the Bank Guarantees, a letter of
                         repudiation was issued by SPML on 22.07.2020. This letter was
                         issued about two months after the Settlement Agreement was
                         executed and in fact during the subsistence of the Writ Petition.

                         After reaping the benefits of the Settlement Agreement, the Writ
                         Petition was withdrawn on 21.09.2020. It is thereafter that the
                         present application under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Act was filed. The
                         sequence of events leads us to conclude that the letter of
                         repudiation was issued only to wriggle out of the terms of the
                         Settlement Agreement.



                         48.     The foregoing clarifies beyond doubt that the claims sought
                         to be submitted to arbitration were raised as an afterthought.
                         Further, SPML's allegations of coercion and economic duress in
                         the execution of the Settlement Agreement lack bona fide. They
                         are liable to be knocked down as ex facie frivolous and untenable.



                         49.      In view of the above-referred facts, which speak for
                         themselves, we are of the opinion that this is a case where the High
                         Court should have exercised the prima facie test to screen and
                         strike down the ex-facie meritless and dishonest litigation. These
                         are the kinds of cases where the High Court should exercise the
                         restricted and limited review to check and protect parties from
                         being forced to arbitrate."



                  42.    Mr. Raajan relies on para 25 of NTPC to contend that I, in my
                  referral Court avatar in the present case, have necessarily to

                 43.      The scope of examination by the Court in the light of 
Section
                 11(6A)
 and the law that has developed in that regard was also
                 examined by various other decisions, which are not, however, of
                 particular significance to the present case, but may be noticed. 
In
                 
Magic Eye Developers Pvt Ltd v. Green Edge Infrastructure Pvt
                 Ltd25
, a Bench of two Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court examined
                 the extent to which a 
Section 11(6)
 referral court could examine the
                 plea of existence of validity of the arbitration agreement.           The
                 Supreme Court noted the introduction of 
Section 11(6A)
 and the
                 principle stated therein, that the Court could only examine whether an
                 arbitration agreement exists between the parties; nothing more,
                 nothing less. Thereafter, however, the Supreme Court reiterated the
                 view expressed in para 25 of NTPC that the referral court was
                 required to enquire as to the parties to the agreement and the
                 applicant's privity to the agreement, and conclusively decide this issue
                 at the referral stage itself. Similarly, held the Supreme Court in para
                 12 of the report in Magic Eye Developers, the dispute regarding the
                 existence of the validity of the arbitration agreement has also to be
                 conclusively determined by the referral court, and cannot be left for
                 decision by the Arbitral Tribunal.     Paras 9 to 13 of Magic Eye
                 Developers may be reproduced, thus, in this context:

                           "9.     Thus, post-
Arbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act,
                          2015
, the jurisdiction of the court under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Act is
                          limited to examining whether an arbitration agreement exists
                          between the parties - "nothing more, nothing less". Thus, as per
                          the 
Section 11(6A)
 of the Act, it is the duty cast upon the referral
                          court to consider the dispute/issue with respect to the existence of
                          an arbitration agreement.



                          10.     At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the settled
                          position of law, pre-referral jurisdiction of the court under 
Section
                          11(6)
 of the Arbitration Act is very narrow and inheres two
                          inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the
                          validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry
                          as to the parties to the agreement and the applicant's privity to the
                          said agreement. The said matter requires a thorough examination
                          by the referral court. [para 25 of the decision in NTPC] The
                          Secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is
                          with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute. Both are
                          different and distinct.



 
11.     So far as the first issue with respect to the existence and the
                          validity of an arbitration agreement is concerned, as the same goes
                          to the root of the matter, the same has to be to conclusively decided
                          by the referral court at the referral stage itself. Now, so far as the
                          non-arbitrability of the dispute is concerned, even as per the law
                          laid-down by this Court in the case of 
Vidya Drolia
 (supra), the
                          court at prereferral stage and while examining the jurisdiction
                          under 
Section 11(6)
 of the Act may even consider prima facie
                          examining the arbitrability of claims. As observed, the prima facie
                          review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood and trim off
                          the side branches in straightforward cases where dismissal is
                          barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law the litigation
                          must stop at the first stage.




                          12.     However, so far as the dispute with respect to the existence
                          and validity of an arbitration agreement is concerned and when the
                          same is raised at pre-referral stage, the referral court has to decide
                          the said issue conclusively and finally and should not leave the
                          said issue to be determined by the arbitral tribunal. The reason is
                          that the issue with respect to the existence and validity of an
                          arbitration agreement goes to the root of the matter.



                          13.    As observed by the Constitution Bench in the case of N.N.
                          Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd.26, sans an agreement, there cannot be
                          any reference to the arbitration.

                          also specifically observed and held that the intention behind the
                         insertion of 
Section 11(6A)
 in the Act was to confine the Court,
                         acting under 
Section 11
, to examine and ascertain about the
                         existence of an arbitration agreement. We are of the opinion that
                         therefore, if the dispute/issue with respect to the existence and
                         validity of an arbitration agreement is not conclusively and finally
                         decided by the referral court while exercising the pre-referral
                         jurisdiction under 
Section 11(6)
 and it is left to the arbitral tribunal,
                         it will be contrary to 
Section 11(6A)
 of the Arbitration Act. It is the
                         duty of the referral court to decide the said issue first conclusively
                         to protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when there
                         does not exist any arbitration agreement and/or when there is no
                         valid arbitration agreement at all."




 
44.      Another Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court
                in 
Lombardi Engineering Ltd v. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam
                Ltd27
, reiterated the legal position emerging from Duro Felguera and
                Vidya Drolia, after referring to the relevant passages from the said
                decisions:


 
"29. Following the general rule and the principle 
laid down
                         in
 
Vidya Drolia
 (supra), this Court has consistently been holding
                         that the arbitral tribunal is the preferred first authority to determine
                         and decide all questions of non-arbitrability.
 
In 
Pravin Electricals
                         (P) Ltd v. Galaxy Infra
 and 
Engineering Private Ltd28, Sanjiv

 and 
Indian Oil Corpn Ltd v. NCC
                         Ltd30
, the parties were referred to arbitration, as the prima facie
                         view in each of these cases on the objection of non-arbitrability
                         was found to be inconclusive. Following the exception to the
                         general principle that the court may not refer parties to arbitration
                         when it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-


 
arbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks India Pvt Ltd,
                         
Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah
 and
                         
Sons31 and B & T AG v. Ministry of Defence32
, arbitration was
                         refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably time-

                  45.    A deeper analysis into the aspect of the parties to arbitration,
                  and the extent to which this could be decided by a referral court under
                  
Section 11(6)
 was undertaken by a constitution Bench of the Supreme
                  Court in Cox and Kings, before which the issue which had arisen for
                  consideration was thus delineated:

                         "2.     Five Judges of this Court are called upon to determine the
                         validity of the "Group of Companies" doctrine in the jurisprudence
                         of Indian arbitration. The doctrine provides that an arbitration
                         agreement which is entered into by a company within a group of
                         companies may bind non-signatory affiliates, if the circumstances
                         are such as to demonstrate the mutual intention of the parties to
                         bind both signatories and non-signatories. This doctrine is called
                         into question purportedly on the ground that it interferes with the
                         established legal principles such as party autonomy, privity of
                         contract, and separate legal personality. The challenge before this
                         Court is to figure out whether there can be a reconciliation between
                         the Group of Companies doctrine and well-settled legal principles
                         of corporate law and contract law."



                  46.    The following question of law had been referred by a Bench of
                  three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court, for determination by a
                  Larger Bench, in Cox and Kings:

                         "5.1. (a) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be read
                         into 
Section 8
 of the Act or whether it can exist in Indian
                         jurisprudence independent of any statutory provision;



                         5.2. (b) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should continue
                         to be invoked on the basis of the principle of "single economic
                         reality";



                         5.3. (c) Whether the Group of Companies doctrine should be
                         construed as a means of interpreting implied consent or intent to
                         arbitrate between the parties; and

                         5.4. (d) Whether the principles of alter ego and/or piercing the
                         corporate veil can alone justify pressing the Group of Companies
                         doctrine into operation even in the absence of implied consent."

                   47.    After considering a veritable plethora of decisions not only by
                  the Supreme Court of India, but also the law as it exists in France,
                  Switzerland, England, Singapore and the US, the Supreme Court
                  examined in detail the circumstances in which a party who was not a
                  signatory to the arbitration agreement could nonetheless be made a
                  party to the proceedings. The conclusion of the Supreme Court on
                  this issue is to be found in paras 83, 84 and 86 of the report, which
                  read thus:

                         "83. Reading 
Section 7
 of the Arbitration Act in view of the
                         above discussion gives rise to the following conclusions : first,
                         arbitration agreements arise out of a legal relationship between or
                         among persons or entities which may be contractual or otherwise;
                         second, in situations where the legal relationship is contractual in
                         nature, the nature of relationship can be determined on the basis of
                         general contract law principles; third, it is not necessary for the
                         persons or entities to be signatories to the arbitration agreement to
                         be bound by it; fourth, in case of non-signatory parties, the
                         important determination for the Courts is whether the persons or
                         entities intended or consented to be bound by the arbitration
                         agreement or the underlying contract containing the arbitration
                         agreement through their acts or conduct; fifth, the requirement of a
                         written arbitration agreement has to be adhered to strictly, but the
                         form in which such agreement is recorded is irrelevant; sixth, the
                         requirement of a written arbitration agreement does not exclude the
                         possibility of binding non-signatory parties if there is a defined
                         legal relationship between the signatory and non-signatory parties;
                         and seventh, once the validity of an arbitration agreement is
                         established, the Court or tribunal can determine the issue of which
                         parties are bound by such agreement.



                         84.     It is presumed that the formal signatories to an arbitration
                         agreement are parties who will be bound by it. However, in
                         exceptional cases persons or entities who have not signed or
                         formally assented to a written arbitration agreement or the
                         underlying contract containing the arbitration agreement may be
                         held to be bound by such agreement. As mentioned in the
                         preceding paragraphs, the doctrine of privity limits the imposition
                         of rights and liabilities on third parties to a contract. Generally,
                         only the parties to an arbitration agreement can be subject to the
                         full effects of the agreement in terms of the reliefs and remedies

                          because they consented to be bound by the arbitration agreement.
                         Therefore, the decisive question before the Courts or tribunals is
                         whether a non-signatory consented to be bound by the arbitration
                         agreement. To determine whether a non-signatory is bound by an
                         arbitration agreement, the Courts and tribunals apply typical
                         principles of contract law and corporate law. The legal doctrines
                         provide a framework for evaluating the specific contractual
                         language and the factual settings to determine the intentions of the
                         parties to be bound by the arbitration agreement.



                                                        *****


                         86.     Courts and tribunals across the world have been applying
                         traditional contractual and commercial doctrines to determine the
                         consent of the non-signatory parties to be bound by the arbitration
                         agreement. Generally, consent-based theories such as agency,
                         novation, assignment, operation of law, merger and succession,
                         and third-party beneficiaries have been applied in different
                         jurisdictions. In exceptional circumstances, non-consensual
                         theories such as piercing the corporate veil or alter ego and
                         estoppel have also been applied to bind a non-signatory party to an
                         arbitration agreement. The Group of Companies doctrine is one
                         such consent-based doctrine which has been applied, albeit
                         controversially, for identifying the real intention of the parties to
                         bind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement."



                  48.    In para 97, the Supreme Court advocated the interpretation of
                  commercial contracts in a pragmatic manner, keeping in mind
                  commercial realities:

                         "97....... The Courts must interpret contracts in a manner that
                         would give them a sense of efficacy rather than invalidating the
                         commercial interests of the parties. The meaning of the contract
                         must be gathered by adopting a common sense approach, which
                         should " not be allowed to be thwarted by a narrow, pedantic and
                         legalistic interpretation". Therefore, there is a need to adopt a
                         modern approach to consent, which takes into consideration the
                         circumstances, apparent conduct, and commercial facets of
                         business transactions."



                  49.    The position which emerges where there are multiple
                  agreements was also examined thus, in paras 121 and 122 of the
                  report:

                            "121. In case of a composite transaction involving multiple
                           agreements, it would be incumbent for the Courts and tribunals to
                           assess whether the agreements are consequential or in the nature of
                           a follow-up to the principal agreement. This Court in Canara
                           Bank33observed that a composite transaction refers to a situation
                           where the transaction is interlinked in nature or where the
                           performance of the principal agreement may not be feasible
                           without the aid, execution, and performance of the supplementary
                           or ancillary agreements.



                           122. The general position of law is that parties will be referred
                           to arbitration under the principal agreement if there is a situation
                           where there are disputes and differences "in connection with" the
                           main agreement and also disputes "connected with " the subject-

                           matter of the principal agreement. In Chloro Controls34, this Court
                           clarified that the principle of "composite performance" would have
                           to be gathered from the conjoint reading of the principal and
                           supplementary agreements on the one hand, and the explicit
                           intention of the parties and attendant circumstances on the other.
                           The common participation in the commercial project by the
                           signatory and non-signatory parties for the purposes of achieving a
                           common purpose could be an indicator of the fact that all the
                           parties intended the non-signatory party to be bound by the
                           arbitration agreement. Thus, the application of the Group of
                           Companies doctrine in case of composite transactions ensures
                           accountability of all parties who have materially participated in the
                           negotiation and performance of the transaction and by doing so
                           have evinced a mutual intent to be bound by the agreement to
                           arbitrate."



                 50.       The threshold standard was thus explained:

                           "127. In Cox & Kings35, Surya Kant, J. observed that Reckitt
                           Benckiser36 fixed a higher threshold of evidence for the
                           application of the Group of Companies doctrine as compared to
                           earlier decisions of this Court. This Court's approach is Reckitt
                           Benckiser is indicative of the fact that the mere presence of a
                           group of companies is not the sole or determinative factor to bind a
                           non-signatory to an arbitration agreement. Rather, the Courts or
                           tribunals should closely evaluate the overall conduct and
                           involvement of the non-signatory party in the performance of the
                           contract. The nature or standard of involvement of the non-

                           signatory in the performance of the contract should be such that the
                          non-signatory has actively assumed obligations or performance
                          upon itself under the contract. In other words, the test is to
                          determine whether the non-signatory has a positive, direct, and
                          substantial involvement in the negotiation, performance, or
                          termination of the contract. Mere incidental involvement in the
                          negotiation or performance of the contract is not sufficient to infer
                          the consent of the non-signatory to be bound by the underlying
                          contract or its arbitration agreement. The burden is on the party
                          seeking joinder of the non-signatory to the arbitration agreement to
                          prove a conscious and deliberate conduct of involvement of the
                          non-signatory based on objective evidence.




                          128. An arbitration agreement is a distinct and separate
                          agreement from the substantive commercial contract which
                          contains the arbitration agreement. An arbitration agreement is
                          independent of the other terms of the contract, to the extent that
                          nullification of the contract will not lead to invalidation of the
                          arbitration agreement. The concept of separability of the arbitration
                          agreement from the underlying contract ensures that the intention
                          of the parties to resolve the disputes through arbitration does not
                          vanish merely because of a challenge to the legal validity of the
                          underlying contract.al. To join a non-signatory to arbitration, the
                          decisive question that has to be answered is whether a non-
                          signatory consented to the arbitration agreement, as distinct from
                          the underlying contract containing the arbitration agreement.



                                                           *****

                          132. We are of the opinion that there is a need to seek a balance
                          between the consensual nature of arbitration and the modern
                          commercial reality where a non-signatory becomes implicated in a
                          commercial transaction in a number of different ways. Such a
                          balance can be adequately achieved if the factors laid down under
                          Discovery Enterprises37 are applied holistically. For instance, the
                          involvement of the non-signatory in the performance of the
                          underlying contract in a manner that suggests that it intended to be
                          bound by the contract containing the arbitration agreement is an
                          important aspect. Other factors such as the composite nature of
                          transaction and commonality of subject-matter would suggest that
                          the claims against the non-signatory were strongly interlinked with
                          the subject-matter of the tribunal's jurisdiction. Looking at the
                          factors holistically, it could be inferred that the non-signatories, by
                          virtue of their relationship with the signatory parties and active
                          involvement in the performance of commercial obligations which
                          are intricately linked to the subject-matter, are not actually

                  51.    Thereafter, the Supreme Court went into the aspect of the
                  standard of determination by a referral court, which was the last issue
                  arising for consideration before it. In para 161, the Supreme Court
                  noted the insertion of sub section (6A) in 
Section 11
 of the 1996 Act
                  by the 2015 Amendment Act, as well as the omission of the said
                  inserted sub section (6A) by the 2019 Amendment Act, and observed
                  that, as the amendment to 
Section 11
 by the 2019 Amendment Act
                  have yet to be notified, 
Section 11(6A)
 continues to remain in force.
                  Thereafter comes para 163, on which Mr. Rao relies:

                         "163. 
Section 16
 of the Arbitration Act enshrines the principle of
                         competence-competence in Indian arbitration law. The provision
                         empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction,
                         including any ruling on any objections with respect to the existence
                         or validity of arbitration agreement. 
Section 16
 is an inclusive
                         provision which comprehends all preliminary issues touching upon
                         the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. The doctrine of
                         competence-competence is intended to minimise judicial
                         intervention at the threshold stage. The issue of determining parties
                         to an arbitration agreement goes to the very root of the
                         jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunal."



                  52.    Following this, in para 166, the Constitution Bench held that, at
                  the referral stage, a Court has only to determine prima facie existence
                  of an arbitration agreement and if the issue could not be determined
                  by the referral court, it has to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. It
                  was emphasized that "referral court" should not unnecessarily
                  interfere with the arbitral proceedings and, rather, show allow the
                  Arbitral Tribunal to exercise its primary jurisdiction.



                  53.    On the aspect of inclusion of a non-signatory to the arbitral
                  proceedings, the Constitution Bench holds in para 169 thus:

                          "169. In case of joinder of non-signatory parties to an arbitration
                         agreement, the following two scenarios will prominently emerge:

                         first, where a signatory party to an arbitration agreement seeks
                         joinder of a non-signatory party to the arbitration agreement; and
                         second, where a non-signatory party itself seeks invocation of an
                         arbitration agreement. In both the scenarios, the referral court will
                         be required to prima facie rule on the existence of the arbitration
                         agreement and whether the non -signatory is a veritable party to
                         the arbitration agreement. In view of the complexity of such a
                         determination, the referral court should leave it for the Arbitral
                         Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory party is indeed a
                         party to the arbitration agreement on the basis of the factual
                         evidence and application of legal doctrine. The Tribunal can delve
                         into the factual, circumstantial, and legal aspects of the matter to
                         decide whether its jurisdiction extends to the non-signatory party.
                         In the process, the Tribunal should comply with the requirements
                         of principles of natural justice such as giving opportunity to the
                         non-signatory to raise objections with regard to the jurisdiction of
                         the Arbitral Tribunal. This interpretation also gives true effect to
                         the doctrine of competence-competence by leaving the issue of
                         determination of true parties to an arbitration agreement to be
                         decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under 
Section 16
."

                  54.    Following the above discussion, in para 170 and in its various
                  sub-paras, the Supreme Court has laid down determinative
                  conclusions, of which the following are relevant for the present
                  dispute:

                         "170.1. The definition of "parties" under 
Section 2(1)(h)
 read with
                         
Section 7
 of the Arbitration Act includes both the signatory as well
                         as non-signatory parties;



                         170.2. Conduct of the non-signatory parties could be an indicator
                         of their consent to be bound by the arbitration agreement;



                         170.3. The requirement of a written arbitration agreement under
                         
Section 7
 does not exclude the possibility of binding non-signatory
                         parties;



                         170.4. 
Under the Arbitration Act
, the concept of a "party" is
                         distinct and different from the concept of "persons claiming
                         through or under" a party to the arbitration agreement;

                         170.12. At the referral stage, the referral court should leave it for
                         the Arbitral Tribunal to decide whether the non-signatory is bound
                         by the arbitration agreement; and"



                  55.    The resultant position that emerges from a consolidated reading
                  of all these decisions is that, while the legal position as it existed prior
                  to 2015 empowered - rather, required - the referral court could enter
                  into several aspects such as existence of fraud, validity of the contract,
                  discharge of liability by accord and satisfaction and the like, this
                  position does not continue after the insertion of sub section (6A) in
                  
Section 11
 by 2015 Amendment Act. Inasmuch as the omission of
                  
Section 11(6A)
 by the 2019 Amendment Act is yet to be notified, the
                  sub-section continues to remain in force. 
Section 11(6A)
 considerably
                  restricts the scope of inquiry by the referral court under 
Section 11(6)
.
                  The referral court is essentially to concern itself with the existence
                  and validity of the arbitration agreement. Peripheral, but connected,
                  issues such as the aspect of limitation, and whether non-signatories to
                  an arbitration agreement can be bound by it, would also fall for
                  determination by the referral court. While examining these issues, the
                  referral court has to adopt a prima facie approach and is not to arrive
                  at a conclusive determination. The final arbiter on these issues is, by
                  operation of 
Section 16
, the Arbitral Tribunal, and the jurisdiction of
                  the Arbitral Tribunal in that regard has to be respected. The referral
                  court, however, cannot completely distance itself, while examining

                   the existence of validity of an arbitration agreement, from the aspect
                  of whether parties, who are being sought to be included in the arbitral
                  proceedings, are or are not required to be included. If, however, it is
                  not possible from the material on record to arrive at a prima facie
                  finding in this regard, then, applying the kompetenz kompetenz
                  principle and in view of 
Section 16
 of the 1996 Act, the matter has to
                  be left for determination by the Arbitral Tribunal.



                  56.    It is in the backdrop of these principles and standards that the
                  rival contentions of learned Counsel have to be examined.



                  On merits



                  57.    If the contention of learned Counsel for both the respondents
                  were to be accepted, the sequitur would be that the petitioner's claims
                  could never be arbitrated, and that is obviously not acceptable. Every
                  arbitrable dispute must be arbitrated, if the arbitral institution is to
                  retain any validity and legitimacy. It is not open to the Court to hold
                  that there exists an arbitral dispute, but it cannot be arbitrated.



                  58.    Indeed, neither of the respondents contends that there is no
                  arbitrable dispute. Each of the respondents contends that the dispute
                  is solely between the petitioner and the other respondent. Ambience
                  contends that the dispute is between the petitioner and Tutelage,
                  whereas Tutelage contends that the dispute between the petitioner and
                  Ambience.         The petitioner contends, on the other hand, that the
                  dispute is with both Respondents 1 and 2. The only issue before the

                   Court is whether one, or the other, or both the respondents, have to be
                  made parties to the arbitration.



                  59.    In exercise of its jurisdiction under 
Section 11(6)
 and in the
                  light of 
Section 11(6A)
 and the law that has developed in that regard,
                  which reached its high watermark in Cox and Kings, the Court can
                  examine this issue only on a prima facie basis. If, prima facie, the
                  Court is able to arrive at a conclusion that either Ambience or
                  Tutelage - but not both - cannot be impleaded in the proposed
                  arbitration, the Court must so hold.      While examining the issue,
                  however, the Court must be conscious of the autonomy that vests in
                  the Arbitral Tribunal in this regard. As Cox and Kings holds, it is
                  fundamentally for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide who should, or
                  should not, be a party before it. It is always open to a party before the
                  Arbitral Tribunal to contend that it has been unnecessarily roped in,
                  and to seek deletion from the array of parties. It is not, therefore, as
                  though any permanent prejudice results to either of the parties, even if
                  this Court were to refer the dispute between the petitioner and both the
                  respondents to arbitration. The only situation in which any lasting
                  prejudice may result is if the Court were to affirmatively hold that one
                  or the other respondent cannot be impleaded in the arbitral
                  proceedings. If this Court so holds, even prima facie, it is bound to
                  inhibit the discretion vested in the Arbitral Tribunal in that regard. Of
                  course, that said, the Court must, while referring the dispute to
                  arbitration, ensure that parties, who are clearly not necessary parties,
                  and are not roped in. This is also a pre-eminent consideration. The
                  Court cannot blindly accept the stand of either party and refer the

                   dispute to arbitration, where one or the other party contests its liability
                  to be subjected to arbitral proceedings.



                  60.    The present controversy at hand, has to be examined keeping in
                  mind all these factors.



                  61.    The claims that the petitioner proposes to refer to arbitration
                  included providing of a habitable and usable access to the petitioner to
                  the leased area and reimbursement of the amount incurred by the
                  petitioner in executing repair works in the leased area, apart from
                  compensation for the losses incurred by the petitioner. Paras 3, 4.1,
                  4.2 and 4.3 of the Notice of Demand dated 10 August 2023 addressed
                  by the petitioner to the respondents involves both the respondents
                  within the ambit of the disputes. Para 4.1 flags a claim of ₹ 1,
                  29,01,487.90, which is stated to have been spent by the petitioner in
                  making the leased area habitable and usable. The petitioner claims the
                  said amount from Ambience. Para 4.2 includes other costs incurred
                  by the petitioner.        The petitioner points that, as this included
                  enhancement made by the petitioner to the leased area which cannot
                  be removed, Tutelage would continue to benefit from the said
                  enhancement installed at the petitioner's costs. The amounts incurred
                  towards these enhancements are, therefore, being sought both from
                  Ambience and Tutelage. As Mr. Rao points out, even after Tutelage
                  purchased the leased area on 18 November 2022, nearly nine months
                  elapsed before the leased area was handed over by the petitioner to
                  Tutelage.         During this period, the prejudice to the petitioner
                  continued, and Tutelage made no efforts to redress it. According to

                   the petitioner, it continued to be prejudiced by having to hold
                  possession of an inhabitable and unusable area. It had, in the process,
                  to incur expenses towards transportation, loading and unloading fee,
                  moving fee, storage fee, rent, security deposit, incidental expenses and
                  expenses towards architectural services, design services, fit outs,
                  construction registration, installation, structural assessment, security
                  services and transit insurance, apart from other costs.           Both the
                  respondents, according to Mr. Rao, would be liable to reimburse these
                  expenses and costs, to one extent or the other, and the extent to which
                  either petitioner would be liable, would have to be arbitrated.



                  62.    It cannot be said, at this prima facie stage, without a
                  comprehensive examination of the entire dispute and possibly by
                  leading of evidence, that all these expenses would, if they were found
                  to be payable to the petitioner, have to be borne either by Ambience or
                  by Tutelage, to the exclusion of the other.



                  63.    Inasmuch as the petitioner's primary contention is that
                  Ambience was in breach of its liability to provide, to the petitioner, a
                  leased area in a habitable and usable form, and Clause 23.1 of the
                  Lease Deed dated 15 January 2021 specifically insulates Ambience
                  from "further liability", it would require consideration as to whether,
                  if the alleged breach of the lease agreement is found to have actually
                  taken place, Ambience can claim immunity from liability in that
                  regard on the ground that it had sold the leased area to Tutelage on 18
                  November 2022. This would have to be decided keeping in mind the
                  covenants of the Lease Deed and the terms of sale of the leased area

                   from Ambience to Tutelage. It would further have to be examined
                  whether the sale of the leased area by Ambience to Tutelage
                  transferred all obligations by Ambience to Tutelage including the
                  obligations relating to a period prior to 18 November 2022. The
                  effect of the email 29 August 2022 from Ambience to the petitioner,
                  which acknowledges the fact that the compressive strength of certain
                  columns from the eighth floor is not as per the latest design
                  parameters and assures the petitioner that Ambience aligning its teams
                  to have changes executed at the site, would also have to be
                  considered. Inasmuch as the petitioner is seeking damages, and had to
                  continue to remain in possession of the leased area for a considerable
                  period even after 18 November 2022, the extent to which these
                  damages, if payable to the petitioner, would have to be apportioned
                  between Ambience and Tutelage, would also fall for determination.



                  64.    In my opinion, these are all intricate mixed issues of fact, which
                  have to be determined keeping in mind all the attendant facts and
                  circumstances and may require a detailed analysis of the material on
                  record, perhaps by requiring evidence to be led.          Applying the
                  principle in the judgments cited earlier, these are not aspects on which
                  this Court can, even prima facie, arrive at a conclusion, which would
                  bind the Arbitral Tribunal. The cumulative effect of Clauses 3, 8 and
                  sub clauses (xv), (xxiv) of Clause 9(a) and Clause 9(b) of the Sale
                  Deed dated 18 November 2022, as well as Clause 23.1 of the Lease
                  Deed dated 15 January 2021 would also be required to be examined.

                   aspects have necessarily to be left for determination by the Arbitral
                  Tribunal and, within the limited scope of jurisdiction of this Court in
                  view of 
Section 11(6)
 read with 
Section 11(6A)
 of the 1996 Act, it is
                  not appropriate for this Court to enter into this territory and return any
                  definitive findings thereon, even if they are prima facie. The very fact
                  that each respondent is seeking to palm off the liability on the other
                  gives rise to disputed and triable factual issues, which would fall
                  within the exclusive province of the Arbitral Tribunal.



                  66.    I cannot, therefore, concur with the submission either of Mr.
                  Raajan or Mr. Sachar that either of the respondents has unnecessarily
                  been dragged into the arbitral proceedings. While it would be open to
                  both the respondents to convince the learned Arbitral Tribunal that it
                  should be deleted from the array of parties, I am of the opinion that
                  such a request, if made, should be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal,
                  and that within the limited scope of 
Section 11(6)
 of the 1996 Act, this
                  Court should not pronounce on this issue.



                  Conclusion



                  67.    For all the aforesaid reasons, the objections of Ambience and
                  Tutelage, to their proposed inclusion in the arbitral proceedings, are
                  rejected. This shall, however, not inhibit either of the respondents
                  from raising the issue before the learned Arbitral Tribunal. If it is so
                  raised, it shall be decided in accordance with law, uninhibited by any
                  observations in this judgment, which have been made solely for
                  disposing of the present petition under 
Section 11(6)
 of the 1996 Act.
