       R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                            CAV JUDGMENT


1.            Before adverting to the factual background of the

captioned Criminal Misc. Applications, it is pertinent to mention

here that the Criminal Misc. Application No.17169 of 2013 came up

for hearing on 3.12.2014 and upon hearing both the rival parties,

the said matter was reserved for judgment. However, upon finding

something amiss, the said matter was released from CAV and was

heard along with Criminal Misc. Application No.20387 of 2014 on

12.12.2014 and 19.12.2014 since both are cognate matters arising

from the Sessions Case No.22 of 2003 filed before the Court of

learned Sessions Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Ahmedabad.



Upon finally hearing learned counsel for the respective parties on

19.12.2014,       the      captioned     Criminal     Misc.    Applications        was

reserved for judgment. As common and identical question of law

and   facts are         involved,   both the captioned              Criminal   Misc.

Applications      are decided and disposed of by this                       common

judgment.





2.            By these applications, the applicants - original accused

Nos.1, 2, 3 and 4 seek to invoke the inherent powers of this Court

under 
Section 482
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for

quashing of the F.I.R registered vide C. R. No.I-261/2001 at

Navrangpura         Police     Station,      Ahmedabad        for    the    offences

punishable under 
Sections 306
 and 
114
 of the Indian Penal Code

and the charge-sheet bearing No.129/2002 dated 24.6.2002.

      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                           CAV JUDGMENT


3.           The      case      of    the    prosecution     is   that   deceased

Devangbhai Vimalbhai Shah and Respondent No.2 were husband

and wife and they were working with one B.V.C. Travel Agency Pvt.

Ltd., Ahmedabad as Manager and Accountant, respectively. The

main business of the firm is to take possession of the consignment

in the form of gold, silver, etc. cleared from the airport and to

deliver the same to the consignee safely. This firm possesses a

strong room at Deora House running in the name of Deora Vault.

One of the keys of this strong room used to remain with the

deceased and the custodian keys used to remain with the owner of

Deora Vault. As per the F.I.R, on 19.5.2001, the Respondent No.2

inquired with the deceased as to why he looks perturbed, to which,

the deceased informed that the accused herein who is serving as

Manager of State Bank of India. Overseas Branch, Gold Desk

Officer and partners of one firm by the name K.L.Chokshi &

Company have put the deceased in lot of difficulty and if he is not

able to get out, he would be incurred huge debt. On 6.5.2001, at

10 a.m., the Respondent No.2 received a call from an employee of

the office informing that the deceased has consumed some

poisonous substance and he is admitted in emergency ward of

V.S.Hospital and later, he was shifted to a hospital in Shahibaug.




4.           On           9.5.2001,     when          the   deceased     regained

consciousness, he told Respondent No.2 that a cargo consisting of





                                       Page 3 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                            CAV JUDGMENT




1000 TT Gold Bars was cleared from Ahmedabad Airport on

2.3.2001 and upon oral telephonic instructions of the accused, the

deceased instructed the employees of the firm to deliver the

consignment to Guru Exports, a sister concern of K.L.Chokshi &

Company. The allegations are that the consignment belongs to the

Bank and by misleading the deceased, entire consignment of gold

was usurped by the accused in collusion with the co-accused. It is

further alleged that 1000 TT Gold Bars which were of Standard

Chartered Bank were deposited in the strong room of the State

Bank of India by the deceased on account of pressure and threats

by the accused and when the deceased requested the accused to

save him from the imbroglio, he was told that he will not get the

gold and silver and if he wants to consume poison, he may do so. As

he felt that he has no other option, he consumed poison. On

9.5.2001, the Executive Magistrate, Metropolitan Area, Ahmedabad

recorded dying declaration of the deceased wherein the deceased

told that the accused herein have caused and created tension

which led him to commit suicide. On the same day and on the next

day, i.e. 10.5.2001, statement of the deceased was recorded by the

Investigating Officer wherein the deceased reiterated the same

allegations and on 17.5.2001, the deceased sustained massive

cardiac attack and passed away. However, on 8.5.2001, one F.I.R.

came to be lodged against the deceased by one Mr. Percy Madan,

an employee of the firm for the offences punishable under 
Section

408
 and 
420
 of the Indian Penal Code alleging that the deceased




                             Page 4 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                               CAV JUDGMENT




has misappropriated the property worth Rs.4,68,12,000/-. Thus, the

main crux of the charge is that the accused abetted the commission

of suicide by putting the deceased in great difficulty.




5.           Per contra, the applicants in Criminal Misc. Application

No.17169 of 2013 have averred that they have never received 1000

TT Gold Bars as alleged in the complaint on 2.3.2001. On plain

reading of the F.I.R, it is revealed that no allegations have been

made against the applicants that on their request, the deceased

had delivered the consignment to the applicants. On the contrary,

it is alleged in the F.I.R that upon telephonic instructions by one

Mr.Mohit Srivastava, Officer of the bank and original accused no.1,

the deceased had delivered the consignment at the place of the

applicants. The applicants further averred that, on 16.3.2001, all

applicants were declared as defaulters of the bank. On 24.3.2001,

C.B.I raided the office and residential premises of the applicants

and accused no.3 was arrested on 26.3.2001 and accused no.2 & 4

were arrested on 8/9.4.2001 and they were sent to judicial custody

and thereafter released on bail in the month of June and July 2001

respectively. When the deceased consumed poison on 6.5.2001, the

applicants were in judicial custody much prior to 6.5.2001. Vide

additional affidavit, the applicants have placed a copy of post

mortem report of the deceased and averred that the doctor has

opined the probable cause of death as "Cardio Respiratory Failure"


and as per FSL report; no poisonous content is found in the body of




                               Page 5 of 36


       R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                         CAV JUDGMENT




the deceased. Therefore, it cannot be said that the applicants are

involved in the offences.



6.            As     regards   delay   in    filing   the    present    quashing

application, the applicants have averred that the accused no.1,

Mr. Mohit Srivastava had filed Criminal Revision Application

No.435/2004 before this Court which was decided on 23.8.2012.

The applicants were under the impressions that if the accused no.1

is discharged then the Court will consider their case as no specific

role has been attributed to them. However, after the order of this

Court on 23.8.2012, the present applicants have preferred this

quashing application and therefore the delay caused may not be

construed otherwise.





7.            Further, the applicant in Criminal Misc. Application

No.20387 of 2014 has averred that earlier the applicant had

preferred an application before the Court of learned Additional

Sessions Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Ahmedabad, seeking

discharge under 
section 227
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

1973, which was rejected and thereafter he had preferred Criminal

Revision Application No.435 of 2004 before this Court which came

to be rejected by an order dated 23.8.2012. Against the said order,

the   applicant        preferred   Special        Leave     Petition   (Criminal)

No.8/2013 before the Hon'ble Apex Court, which too came to be

rejected on 1.2.2013.





                                   Page 6 of 36


        R/CR.MA/17169/2013                             CAV JUDGMENT





7.1            The applicant has further averred that from the records

it is crystal clear that the death of the deceased was due to cardio-

respiratory failure due to pathological changes and therefore it is

not the outcome of consumption of any poisonous substance and

even no traces of poisonous substance was found in the viscera

which was collected and sent to FSL for examination, which is

suggestive of case of natural death. While deciding the discharge

application, neither the Trial Court nor this Court has delve into the

very pertinent aspect as to whether the death of the deceased was

suicidal. Looking to the post-mortem report and FSL report, it is

crystal clear that the death of the deceased was not a case of

suicide as alleged and therefore there is no question of prosecuting

the applicant for abetment.





7.2.           The applicant - the accused No.1 has further averred

that the entire story put forth by the deceased is concocted and

unbelievable as once the goods cleared from the airport, the BVC

Travels Agency has to pick them and bring them to the strong room

of the State Bank of India or as per the instructions in writing

signed by two Senior Managers (two level above the applicant). The

applicant herein has no authority to sign the delivery order as per

the rules of the Bank. It is case of the prosecution that the goods

were delivered and acknowledged by Guru Exports, however, no

such receipt is brought on record. In fact, the statement of the





                                Page 7 of 36


       R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                      CAV JUDGMENT




deceased reveals that he created problems for himself. In case, in

everything is taken as true then the act of the deceased

transferring Standard Chartered Bank's consignment of gold to the

vault of State Bank of India itself would be an offence and an

illegality committed by the deceased. Except a bald assertion that

the applicants threatened the deceased to act accordingly, there is

no iota of evidence to even remotely suggest that all these transfers

of consignment were at the instance of the applicants. Even if that

being true, he could have immediately informed about this fact to

the police or to his head office. The deceased kept quite absolutely

and when things were out of control for him and when pressure

was exerted by his head office to account for the gold consignment

he came under the bout of depression and tension, Even in the

departmental proceedings, the applicant is exonerated and has

been granted due promotion and is now working as Chief Manager,

State Bank of India, Kalol Branch. In view of the above

circumstances, it is evident that prosecution of the applicants for

the offence
 u/s.306
 of Indian Penal Code is wholly misconceived

and   continuation         of   such    prosecution   will   lead   to   serious

miscarriage of justice and abuse of the process of law.




8.            Heard Mr. S. I. Nanavati, learned Senior Counsel

assisted by Mr. Saurabh Mehta for the applicants in Criminal Misc.

Application No.17169 of 2013 and Mr. Umesh Trivedi, Advocate

with Mr. Rohit Verma, Advocate for the applicant in Criminal Misc.




                                       Page 8 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                               CAV JUDGMENT




Application No.20387 of 2014 and Ms. Jirga Jhaveri, learned

Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent No.1 in

both the applications. Though served, no appearance has been

made on behalf of respondent No.2.





9.           Mr.Nanavati,   learned    Senior   Counsel   argued     that


Sections 108
 to 
120
 of the Indian Penal Code deal with abetment.

The liability of an abettor of a crime is co-extensive with the

liability of the principal offender. Suicide contemplates a situation

where the person committing suicide is not available to present his

case. Therefore, for such an offence, abettor has been made

punishable under 
Section 306
 of the Indian Penal Code. However,

in order to prove the offence under 
Section 306
 of the Indian Penal

Code, it must be first proved that the accused has intentionally

instigated or driven the deceased to commit suicide or has engaged

anybody in any conspiracy to achieve the desired result. Abetment

would imply an intentional abetment. Presence of mens rea is

necessary concomitant of investigation. In the present case, it is

extremely doubtful if all the circumstances taken cumulatively

could indicate any mens rea on the part of the applicants. Even the

dying declaration and statement before the Investigating Officer

could not involve the applicants in offence punishable under


Section 306
 of the Indian Penal Code as it provides for abetment of

suicide. Except one word "harassment", nothing is alleged or

explained by the deceased. There is no evidence to suggest that the




                              Page 9 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                         CAV JUDGMENT




applicants knew or had reason to believe that deceased would

contemplate or commit suicide. 
In support of his contention,

Mr.Nanavati has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble

Apex Court in Sanju alias 
Sanjay Singh Sengar v. State of

M.P.
, reported in AIR 2002 SC 1998, wherein the Hon'ble Apex

Court has observed in para 13 and 15 as under:-


              "13. Reverting to the facts of the case, both
              the courts below have erroneously accepted
              the prosecution story that the suicide by the
              deceased is the direct result of the quarrel
              that had taken place on 25th July, 1998
              wherein it is alleged that the appellant had
              used abusive language and had reportedly told
              the deceased 'to go and die'. For this, the
              courts      relied    on   a    statement   of   Shashi
              Bhushan, brother of the deceased, made under
              
Section 161
 Cr.P.C. when reportedly the
              deceased, after coming back from the house of
              the appellant, told him that the appellant had
              humiliated him and abused him with filthy
              words. The statement of Shashi Bhushan,
              recorded under 
Section 161
 Cr.P.C. is annexed
              as annexure P-3 to this appeal and going
              through the statement, we find that he has not
              stated that the deceased had told him that the
              appellant had asked him 'to go and die'. Even
              if we accept the prosecution story that the
              appellant did tell the deceased 'to go and die',
              that itself does not constitute the ingredient of
              'instigation'.       The   word 'instigate'      denotes




                                     Page 10 of 36


 R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                      CAV JUDGMENT




         incitement or urging to do some drastic or
         unadvisable action or to stimulate or incite.

         Presence of mens             rea, therefore,   is   the
         necessary concomitant of instigation. It is
         common knowledge that the words uttered in
         a quarrel or in a spur of the moment cannot be
         taken to be uttered with mens rea. It is in a fit
         of anger and emotional. Secondly, the alleged
         abusive words, said to have been told to the
         deceased were on 25th July, 1998 ensued by
         quarrel. The deceased was found hanging on
         27th July, 1998. Assuming that the deceased
         had taken the abusive language seriously, he
         had enough time in between to think over and
         reflect and, therefore, it cannot be said that
         the abusive language, which had been used by
         the appellant on 25th July, 1998 drived the
         deceased to commit suicide. Suicide by the
         deceased on 27th July, 1998 is not proximate
         to    the   abusive    language uttered        by   the
         appellant on 25th July, 1998. The fact that the
         deceased committed suicide on 27th July, 1998
         would itself clearly pointed out that it is not
         the direct result of the quarrel taken place on
         25th July, 1998 when it is alleged that the
         appellant had used the abusive language and
         also told the deceased to go and die. This fact
         had escaped notice of the courts below."



         "15. A plain reading of the suicide note would
         clearly show that the deceased was in great
         stress and depressed. One plausible reason
         could be that the deceased was without any



                               Page 11 of 36


 R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                  CAV JUDGMENT




         work or avocation and at the same time
         indulged in drinking as revealed from the
         statement of the wife Smt. Neelam Sengar. He
         was a frustrated man. Reading of the suicide
         note will clearly suggest that such a note is not
         a handy work of a man with sound mind and
         sense. Smt. Neelam Sengar, wife of the
         deceased, made a statement under 
Section
         161
 Cr.P.C. before the Investigation Officer.
         She stated that the deceased always indulged
         in drinking wine and was not doing any work.
         She also stated that on 26th July, 1998 her
         husband came to them in an inebriated
         condition and was abusing her and other
         members of the family. The prosecution story,
         if believed, shows that the quarrel between the
         deceased and the appellant had taken place on
         25th July, 1998 and if the deceased came back
         to the house again on 26th July, 1998, it cannot
         be said that the suicide by the deceased was
         the direct result of the quarrel that had taken
         pace on 25th July, 1998.          Viewed from the
         aforesaid circumstances independently, we are
         clearly of the view that the ingredients of
         'abetment' are totally absent in the instant
         case for an offence under 
Section 306
 I.P.C. It
         is in the statement of the wife that the
         deceased always remained in a drunkened
         condition. It is a common knowledge that
         excessive drinking leads one to debauchery. It
         clearly appeared, therefore, that the deceased
         was a victim of his own conduct unconnected
         with the quarrel that had ensued on 25th July,



                           Page 12 of 36


       R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                         CAV JUDGMENT




               1998 where the appellant is stated to have
               used abusive language. Taking the totality of
               materials    on    record         and     facts      and
               circumstances of the case into consideration,
               it will lead to irresistible conclusion that it is
               the deceased and he alone, and none else, is
               responsible for his death."



9.1           Mr. Umesh Trivei and Mr. Rohit Verma has placed

reliance on the decision of this Court in 
A. K. Chaudhari and

Others v. State of Gujarat
, reported in (2005) 3 GLH 444,

wherein this Court has observed in para 17 as under :-


               "17. In view of the above, it appears that the
               ingredients for abetment for suicide would be
               satisfied only if the suicide is committed by the
               deceased    due    to     direct        and    alarming
               encouragement/incitement           by    the   accused
               leaving no option but to commit suicide.
               Further, as the action of committing suicide is
               also on account of great disturbance to the
               psychological imbalance of the deceased such
               incitement can be divided into two broad
               categories, one normally where the deceased
               is having sentimental tie or physical relations
               with the accused and second category would
               be where the deceased is having relations with
               the accused in official capacity. In case of
               former category some times a normal quarrel
               or the utterance of hot exchange of words may
               result into psychological immediate imbalance.
               Consequently creating situation of depression,

         loss of charm in the life and if the person is
         unable to control sentiments of expectations, it
         may give temptations to the person to commit
         suicide, e.g., when there is relation of husband
         and wife, mother and son, brother and sister,
         sister and sister and other relations of such
         type, where sentimental tie is by blood or due
         to physical   relations.    In case of second
         category the tie is on account of official
         relations, where the expectations would to
         discharge the obligation as provided for such
         duty in law and to receive the considerations
         as provided in law. In normal circumstances,
         relationships by sentimental tie cannot be
         equated with the official relationship and the
         reason being the different conduct of the
         parties for maintenance of the relations. The
         former category leaves more expectations,
         whereas in the latter category, by and large,
         expectations and obligations are prescribed by
         law, rules and regulations. Of course, for
         meeting with the requirement for ingredients
         of abetment to suicide, the provisions of the
         
IPC
 are the same, but for the purpose of
         examination on the aspects of abetment to
         commit suicide or incitement/encouragement
         to suicide, it may have some relevance. Since,
         in the present case this Court is not concerned
         with the matter of matter        of abetment to
         suicide where the deceased or the accused
         had the relations covered in the first category,
         no further discussion may be required in this
         regard to that extent. However, in case where



                          Page 14 of 36


       R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                                CAV JUDGMENT




               the     allegations     for     abetment          of    suicide
               committed by the deceased falling in second
               category         are      concerned,          the         strict
               interpretation is called for, otherwise it may
               result into damaging the discipline of any
               institution or organization or department,
               which may consequently result into creating a
               situation against national interest for which
               the expectation would be the strict discipline
               and the rule of law only and nothing else."



 
Mr. Verma has also submitted that the case of the

applicant is also covered by the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court

in the case of 
Netai Dutta v. State of W.B
, reported in (2005) 2

SCC 659 and in view of the ratio 
laid down by
 the Hon'ble Apex

Court in the aforesaid case, the F.I.R and charge-sheet is required

to be quashed and set aside.






10.           In     counter,    Ms.      Jirga       Jhaveri,    Additional      Public

Prosecutor      strongly    opposed        the        quashing        applications     and

vehemently argued that the present applicants are the primary

abettors who have driven the deceased to commit suicide. Even the

dying declaration and the statement of the deceased before the

Investigating Officer indict the present applicants as the abettors in

the crime. Therefore, the quashing applications are liable to be

rejected at its threshold. She further submitted that specific role

has been attributed against all the applicants, therefore, the Court

may not exercise jurisdiction under 
Section 482
 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure, 1973, as the charge is framed against the

applicants. Ms. Jhaveri has placed reliance on the decision of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in Praveen Pradhan v. State of Uttaranchal

and another, reported in (2012) 9 SCC 734, wherein the

Hon'ble Apex Court has observed in para 18 and 19 as under:-



              "18.        In fact, from the above discussion it is
              apparent that instigation has to be gathered
              from the circumstances of a particular case.
              No straight-jacket formula can be laid down to
              find out as to whether in a particular case
              there has been instigation which force the
              person to commit suicide. In a particular case,
              there may not be direct evidence in regard to
              instigation which may have direct nexus to
              suicide.      Therefore,     in       such   a   case,   an
              inference       has   to     be       drawn      from    the
              circumstances and it is to be determined
              whether circumstances had been such which
              in fact had created the situation that a person
              felt totally frustrated and committed suicide.
              More so, while dealing with an application for
              quashing of the proceedings, a court cannot
              form a firm opinion, rather a tentative view
              that would evoke the presumption referred to
              under 
Section 228
 Cr.P.C."



              "19.        Thus, the case is required to be
              considered in the light of aforesaid settled
              legal propositions. In the instant case, alleged
              harassment had not been a casual feature,




                                    Page 16 of 36


     R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                         CAV JUDGMENT




             rather      remained     a     matter    of    persistent
             harassment. It is not a case of a driver; or a
             man having an illicit relationship with a
             married woman, knowing that she also had
             another paramour; and therefore, cannot be
             compared to the situation of the deceased in
             the instant case, who was a qualified graduate
             engineer      and      still     suffered      persistent
             harassment and humiliation and additionally,
             also had to endure continuous illegal demands
             made by the appellant, upon non-fulfillment of
             which, he would be mercilessly harassed by
             the appellant for a prolonged period of time.
             He had also been forced to work continuously
             for a long durations in the factory, vis-a-vis
             other employees which often even entered to
             16-17 hours at a stretch. Such harassment,
             coupled with the utterance of words to the
             effect, that, "had there been any other person
             in    his   place,   he        would    have    certainly
             committed suicide" is what makes the present
             case distinct from the aforementioned cases
             considering the facts and circumstances of the
             present case, we do not think it is a case
             which requires any interference by this court
             as regards the impugned judgment and order
             of the High Court. The appeal is, therefore,
             dismissed accordingly."



 
She has further placed reliance on the decision of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in 
Rajinder Prasad v. Bashir and Others
,

reported in AIR 2001 SC 3524, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court




                                  Page 17 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                          CAV JUDGMENT




has observed in para 7 and 8 as under:-






              "7.     We are of the opinion that when the
              earlier revision petition filed under 
Section
              397
 of the Code had been dismissed as not
              pressed, the accused-respondents could not be
              allowed to invoke the inherent powers of the
              High Court under 
Section 482
 of the Code for
              the grant of the same relief. We do not agree
              with the arguments of the learned counsel for
              the respondents that as the earlier application
              had been dismissed as not pressed, the
              accused had acquired a right to challenge the
              order adding the offence under 
Section 395
 of
              the     Code   and    arraying       four   persons     as
              accused-persons by way of subsequent petition
              under 
Section 482
 of the Code. The object of
              criminal trial is to render public justice and to
              assure punishment to the criminals keeping in
              view that the trial is concluded expeditiously.

 
Delaying       tactics       or      protracting       the
              commencement or conclusion of the criminal
              trial are required to be curbed effectively, lest
              the interest of public justice may suffer. For
              exercising power under 
Section 482
 of the
              Code the learned Judge of the High Court
              relied upon a judgment of this Court in
              
Krishnan & Anr. v. Krishnaveni & Ors.
 [1997
              (4) SCC 241].        A perusal of the aforesaid
              judgment, however, shows that the reliance by
              the learned Judge was misplaced.
 
This Court
              in 
Krishnan
's case (supra) had held that
              though the power of the High Court under



                                   Page 18 of 36


     R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                                    CAV JUDGMENT


Section 482
 of the Code is very wide, yet the
             same         must     be      exercised           sparingly       and
             cautiously particularly in a case where the
             petitioner is shown to have already invoked
             the revisional jurisdiction under 
Section 397
 of
             the Code. Only in cases where the High Court
             finds that there has been failure of justice or
             misuse of judicial mechanism or procedure,
             sentence or order was not correct, the High
             Court may, in its discretion, prevent the abuse
             of the process or miscarriage of justice by
             exercise of jurisdiction under 
Section 482
 of
             the Code.           It was further held, "Ordinarily,
             when revision has been barred by 
Section
             397(3)
        of      the         Code,           a      person     -


             accused/complainant - cannot be allowed to
             take recourse to the revision to the High Court
             under        
Section       397(1)
          or     under     inherent
             powers of the High Court under 
Section 482
 of
             the         Code     since        it       may         amount      to
             circumvention of provisions of 
Section 397(3)

             or 
Section 397(2)
 of the Code.".



             8.      We are of the opinion that no special
             circumstances           were           spelt          out   in    the
             subsequent           application            for       invoking    the
             jurisdiction of the High Court under 
Section
             482
 of the Code and the impugned order is
             liable to be set aside on this ground alone"





 
She has also placed reliance on the decision of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in 
Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and

another
, reported in (2012) 9 SCC 460, wherein the Hon'ble



                                        Page 19 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                        CAV JUDGMENT




Apex Court has observed in para 20 and 27 as under :-




              "20.         The jurisdiction of the Court under
              
Section 397
 can be exercised so as to examine
              the correctness, legality or proprietary of an
              order passed by the trial court or the inferior
              court, as the case may be. Though the section
              does        not   specifically    use the    expression
              'prevent abuse of process of any court or
              otherwise to secure the ends of justice', the
              jurisdiction under 
Section 397
 is a very
              limited       one. The legality, proprietary         or
              correctness of an order passed by a court is
              the very foundation of exercise of jurisdiction
              under 
Section 397
 but ultimately it also
              requires justice to be done. The jurisdiction
              could be exercised where there is palpable
              error, non-compliance with the provisions of
              law, the decision is completely erroneous or
              where the judicial discretion is exercised
              arbitrarily. On the other hand, 
Section 482
 is
              based upon the maxim quando lex liquid
              alicuiconcedit, conceder videtur id quo res
              ipsa esse non protest, i.e., when the law gives
              anything to anyone, it also gives all those
              things without which the thing itself would be
              unavoidable. The Section confers very wide
              power on the Court to do justice and to
              ensure that the process of the Court is not
              permitted to be abused."



              "27.        Having     discussed       the   scope    of
              jurisdiction under these two provisions, i.e.,



                                     Page 20 of 36


 R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                                   CAV JUDGMENT


Section 397
 and 
Section 482
 of the Code and
         the fine line of jurisdictional distinction, now
         it will be appropriate for us to enlist the
         principles with reference to which the courts
         should exercise such jurisdiction. However, it
         is    not        only    difficult        but    is    inherently
         impossible         to     state    with         precision    such
         principles. At best and upon objective analysis
         of various judgments of this Court, we are
         able to cull out some of the principles to be
         considered for proper exercise of jurisdiction,
         particularly,           with   regard       to    quashing       of
         charge either in exercise of jurisdiction under
         
Section 397
 or 
Section 482
 of the Code or
         together, as the case may be :



         27.1) Though there are no limits of the
         powers of the Court under 
Section 482
 of the
         Code but the more the power, the more due
         care and caution is to be exercised in invoking
         these powers. The power of quashing criminal
         proceedings, particularly, the charge framed
         in terms of 
Section 228
 of the Code should be
         exercised           very        sparingly             and     with
         circumspection and that too in the rarest of
         rare cases.



         27.2) The Court should apply the test as to
         whether the uncontroverted allegations as
         made from the record of the case and the
         documents submitted therewith prima facie
         establish the offence or not. If the allegations
         are         so   patently      absurd           and    inherently
         improbable that no prudent person can ever



                                   Page 21 of 36


 R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                  CAV JUDGMENT




         reach such a conclusion and where the basic
         ingredients of a criminal offence are not
         satisfied then the Court may interfere.



         27.3) The High Court should not unduly
         interfere. No meticulous examination of the
         evidence is needed for considering whether
         the case would end in conviction or not at the
         stage of framing of charge or quashing of
         charge.



         27.4) Where the exercise of such power is
         absolutely   essential      to   prevent   patent
         miscarriage of justice and for correcting some
         grave error that might be committed by the
         subordinate courts even in such cases, the
         High Court should be loathe to interfere, at
         the threshold, to throttle the prosecution in
         exercise of its inherent powers.



         27.5) Where there is an express legal bar
         enacted in any of the provisions of the Code
         or any specific law in force to the very
         initiation or institution and continuance of
         such criminal proceedings, such a bar is
         intended to provide specific protection to an
         accused.



         27.6) The Court has a duty to balance the
         freedom of a person and the right of the
         complainant or prosecution to investigate and
         prosecute the offender.



         27.7) The process of the Court cannot be

         ultimate/ulterior purpose.



         27.8) Where the allegations made and as they
         appeared from the record and documents
         annexed therewith to predominantly give rise
         and constitute a 'civil wrong' with no 'element
         of criminality' and does not satisfy the basic
         ingredients of a criminal offence, the Court
         may be justified in quashing the charge. Even
         in such cases, the Court would not embark
         upon the critical analysis of the evidence.



         27.9) Another very significant caution that the
         courts have to observe is that it cannot
         examine the facts, evidence and materials on
         record      to   determine           whether    there      is
         sufficient material on the basis of which the
         case would end in a conviction, the Court is
         concerned        primarily    with      the    allegations
         taken as a whole whether they will constitute
         an offence and, if so, is it an abuse of the
         process of court leading to injustice.



         27.10) It is neither necessary nor is the court
         called upon to hold a full-fledged inquiry or to
         appreciate        evidence       collected       by      the
         investigating agencies to find out whether it is
         a case of acquittal or conviction.



         27.11) Where allegations give rise to a civil
         claim and also amount to an offence, merely
         because a civil claim is maintainable, does not
         mean that a criminal complaint cannot be
         maintained.

         27.12) In exercise of its jurisdiction under
         
Section 228
 and/or under 
Section 482
, the
         Court cannot take into consideration external
         materials given by an accused for reaching
         the conclusion that no offence was disclosed
         or that there was possibility of his acquittal.

         The Court has to consider the record and
         documents annexed with by the prosecution.



         27.13) Quashing of a charge is an exception to
         the rule of continuous prosecution. Where the
         offence is even broadly satisfied, the Court
         should      be   more      inclined   to   permit
         continuation of prosecution rather than its
         quashing at that initial stage. The Court is not
         expected to marshal the records with a view
         to decide admissibility and reliability of the
         documents or records but is an opinion
         formed prima facie.



 
27.14) Where the charge-sheet, report under
         
Section 173(2)
 of the Code, suffers from
         fundamental legal defects, the Court may be
         well within its jurisdiction to frame a charge.

         27.15) Coupled with any or all of the above,
         where the Court finds that it would amount to
         abuse of process of the Code or that interest
         of justice favours, otherwise it may quash the
         charge. The power is to be exercised ex
         debito justitiae, i.e. to do real and substantial
         justice for administration of which alone, the
         courts exist. {Ref.

                 27.16.       These      are    the       principles    which
                 individually and preferably cumulatively (one
                 or more) be taken into consideration as

                 wide plenitude and jurisdiction under 
Section
                 482
 of the Code by the High Court. Where the
                 factual foundation for an offence has been laid
                 down, the courts should be reluctant and
                 should not hasten to quash the proceedings
                 even        on   the    premise         that   one    or   two
                 ingredients have not been stated or do not
                 appear to be satisfied if there is substantial
                 compliance         to    the     requirements         of   the
                 offence."





11.             Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at

length and minutely perused the records and proceedings of the

Sessions case No.22 of 2003. Upon appreciating the evidence in

chronological order, following undisputed facts emerges from the

records of this case :





11.1.           It has come on record from the prosecution side that

Mr. Naresh Chokshi and Mr. Prashant Chokshi, applicants was

arrested on 10.4.2001 and released on bail on 5.7.2001 and

Mr.Jignesh Chokshi, applicant was arrested on 30.3.2001 and

released on bail on 25.6.2001 in connection with CBI Case

No.2(E)/2001 CBI BS&FC, Mumbai.

11.2.           On 2.3.2001, alleged incident of delivering 1000 TT

Gold Bars to Guru Exports took place. However, no receipt of

delivery and acknowledgment is brought on record.



11.3.           On 6.5.2001, the deceased allegedly consumed some

poisonous substance and was rushed to V.S.Hospital, Ahmedabad

and thereafter shifted to private hospital in Shaibaug.



11.4.           On 8.5.2001 a F.I.R. was lodged against the deceased

by B.V.C. Travel Agency Pvt. Ltd allegedly revealing that the

deceased misappropriated property of 1000 Gold Bars worth

Rs.4,68,12,000/- between 4.5.2001 and 6.5.2001.



11.5.           The deceased regained consciousness on 9.5.2001

whereupon he allegedly revealed the turmoil to his wife -



Respondent No.2. On the same day, dying declaration of the

deceased was recorded and on 10.5.2001 statement of the

deceased was recorded by the Investigating Officer.



11.6.           On 17.5.2001, the deceased sustained massive cardiac

attack and passed away. The post-mortem report reveals that the

death of the deceased was due to cardio-respiratory failure due to

pathological changes and the FSL report reveals no traces of

poisonous substance in viscera.

11.7.           Complaint was filed against the present applicants on

19.5.2001.





12.             It is noticed that dying declaration of the deceased was

recorded by the Executive Magistrate at about 01.15 p.m. on

09.5.2001 and was completed at about 01:35 p.m. The dying

declaration is in question and answers form. After asking about 1 to

13 preliminary questions, following questions were asked and their

answers were taken down as under :-





      Sr. Question                                Answer
      No.
      14. Whether you               tried    to Yes, I tried to commit
              commit suicide?                     suicide.

      15.     Whether               anybody I was mentally harassed

              harassed you mentally or by Shri Mohit Srivastav,
              physically?                         Gold Desk Officer, S.B.I.
                                                  Overseas            Branch,
                                                  Navjivan Press Building,
                                                  Behind     Income      Tax,
                                                  Ahmedabad.



      16.     Do     you     want    to     say Shri Mohit Srivastav and
              anything more?                      Naresh,    Prashant        &
                                                  Jignesh,     owners        of
                                                  K.L.Chokshi & Company
                                                  have tried to frame him.





13.             Having perused the records and considering the rival

submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and




                                       Page 28 of 36


         R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                 CAV JUDGMENT




having regard to the nature of the allegations, and looking to the

proposition laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of


Amit Kapoor
 (supra), I am inclined to accept the submissions

canvassed on behalf of the applicants that the F.I.R and Charge-

Sheet deserves to be quashed, for the reasons that :-


13(a)           The present applicants in Criminal Misc. Application

No.17169 of 2013 were in jail since 30.3.2001 and 10.4.2001 and

were released on bail on 5.7.2001 and 25.6.2001, respectively and

the alleged consumption of poison by the deceased took place on

6.5.2001. Hence, when the deceased allegedly consumed poison;



prior to that date, the present applicants were in jail, so there

appears no possibility of incitement, instigation or any act to drive

the deceased to commit suicide.





13(b)           It is revealed from the matter available on record that

the complainant, i.e. Respondent No.2 and the deceased were

working together in a travel firm, which was owned by the

brother-in-law of the deceased stationed at Mumbai. It is also

revealed that an F.I.R. was lodged before the Police Station by an

employee of the travel firm against the deceased on 8.5.2001. This

factor might have prompted the deceased to commit suicide. Such

possibility cannot be ruled out as the F.I.R mentions that the

deceased         misappropriated     property      worth   Rs.4,68,12,000/-

between 4.5.2001 and 6.5.2001.





                                   Page 29 of 36


         R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                      CAV JUDGMENT





13(c)           The complaint was lodged against deceased Devang

Shah by one Shri Parsi Rusi Madan alleging that consignment

consisting        of    1000   TT   Gold     Bars   came   to     be   disposed

of/misappropriated by the deceased in between 4.5.2011 and

6.5.2001, whereby the deceased had committed the offence of

criminal breach of trust and cheating. The aforesaid complaint

came to be lodged under the instructions from the brother of

Dakshaben Shah i.e. brother-in-law of the deceased as per the

instruction given to the complainant on 5.5.2001 and the deceased

consumed poison and substance on 6.5.2001. As per the complaint,

custody of 1000 TT Gold Bars was with the deceased and the same

was disposed of/misappropriated in between 4.5.2001 and 6.5.2001

and to the same effect, the aforesaid complaint was lodged against

the deceased himself prior to that period that means from 4.5.2001

to 6.5.2001 and even prior to that period, the petitioners were in

jail. The complaint was given on behalf of the company where he

was serving, gave specific details when the goods came to be

misappropriated/disposed of during the aforesaid period. Whereas

in the dying declaration and the complaint against the present

applicants only general and vague allegations have been made. At

the relevant time, the goods were definitely in the custody of the

deceased as per the complaint against the deceased. In that view of

the matter, there was no reason to harass or instigation by the

applicants to the deceased to commit suicide.




                                    Page 30 of 36


         R/CR.MA/17169/2013                              CAV JUDGMENT





13(d)           On going through the complaint, it reveals that

Respondent No.2, who is the wife of the deceased was informed by

the deceased on 6.5.2001, i.e. after consumption of poison, that

there was instigation from the accused. However, at that relevant

time, the present applicants were in jail since about 25 days prior

to the incident. Hence, there appears no possibility of incitement,

instigation or any act on the part of the present applicants to drive

the deceased to commit suicide.





13(e)           On overall perusal of material available on record, this

Court do not find any proximate reason to infer that the present

applicants caused any abetment and it is nobody's case that the

applicants abetted the deceased to commit suicide from the jail.

For this simple reason also, instigation of any sort from the

applicants appears to be unbelievable.





13(f)           The offence of abetment by instigation depends upon

the intention of the person who abets and not upon the act which is

done by the person who has abetted. The abetment may be by

instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under 
Section

107
 of the Indian Penal Code. It is true that instigation has to be

gathered from the circumstances of a particular case. There may

not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may have

direct nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has

to be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be determined



                                 Page 31 of 36


         R/CR.MA/17169/2013                                       CAV JUDGMENT




whether such circumstances in fact created a situation which

warranted the person to commit suicide. In the present case, there

is no iota of evidence to suggest or indicate any instigation in

whatsoever manner by the applicants. In fact, the evidence on

record suggests that the applicants in Criminal Misc. Application

No.17169 of 2013 were in judicial custody prior to the date when

the deceased committed suicide.





13(g)           In    the    instant   case,      alleged   harassment    by    the

applicants appears to be not a matter of persistent harassment. It

appears to have been mentioned in very casual manner by the

deceased as no specific role has been attributed to the applicants

by him.





13(h)           The post-mortem report reveals that the death of the

deceased was due to cardio-respiratory failure occurred due to

pathological changes. Moreover, FSL report reveals no traces of

poisonous substance in viscera. Thus, the medical evidence

suggests that the death of the deceased is not caused due to

consumption of poisonous substance but the death occurred due to

cardio-respiratory failure. There is no nexus between the cause of

the death of the deceased as well as allegations of harassment.



13(i)           The proximate cause appears to be communication of

lodging of complaint by the brother-in-law of the deceased, which

might have caused the deceased to consume allegedly poisonous



                                       Page 32 of 36


         R/CR.MA/17169/2013                            CAV JUDGMENT




substance.





13(j)           From the report submitted by the process serving

agency, it appears that whereabout of the widow of the deceased is

not known and she is not traceable. She is the sole witness as the

case of the prosecution is that the deceased had told his turmoil to

his wife, which is also in the nature of hearsay evidence.



13(k)           Dying declaration of deceased Devang Shah was

recorded by the Executing Magistrate on 9.5.2001 at about 1.15

p.m. in question and answer form at page 102 of the paper book,

wherein he has stated that he has attempted to commit suicide and

reason shown by him is that due to harassment made by Mohit

Srivastava and further he had also stated that Mohit Srivastava and

owner of K. L. Chokshi Firm i.e. Naresh, Prashant and Jignesh have

tried to implicate him into the matter.





                On perusal of the aforesaid dying declaration and the

statement made by the deceased, no details as regards to

harassment came to be meted out by the present applicants are

revealing, only general and vague allegations are made and during

that period, the applicants were already in jail.



13(l)           Allegations made in the dying declaration recorded by

the Executive Magistrate and in the statement of the deceased

before the Investigating Officer appear to be general and vague in




                                Page 33 of 36


      R/CR.MA/17169/2013                              CAV JUDGMENT




nature as no role has been attributed to them and does not inspire

confidence in its truthfulness and correctness. It appears that the

dying declaration is influenced by other factors such as complaint

lodged against him by his own firm for misappropriating property

worth Rs.4,68,12,000/-. Such statement cannot be relied upon in

the facts and circumstances of the present case as it appears that

the deceased has made an attempt to cover up the truth. It is well

settled law that, if prosecution solely depends on the dying

declaration, the normal rule is that the Court must exercise due

care and caution to ensure genuineness of the dying declaration

keeping in mind that the accused have no opportunity to test the

veracity of the statement of the deceased by cross examination.



13(m)        Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Praveen Pradhan (supra) is

concerned, on facts, the same would not be of any assistance to the

respondent, as in this case the alleged harassment is a casual

feature and not a matter of persistent harassment. 
Similarly, the

case of 
Rajinder Prasad
 (supra) would not be of any assistance as

the Hon'ble Apex Court has further observed in para 7 that "only in

cases where the High Court finds that there has been failure of

justice or misuse of judicial mechanism or procedure, sentence or

order was not correct, the High Court may, in its discretion,

prevent the abuse of the process of miscarriage of justice by

exercise of jurisdiction under 
Section 482
 of the Code".

         R/CR.MA/17169/2013                             CAV JUDGMENT





13(n)           On overall perusal of the material available on record,

this Court does not find any basic ingredients required to

substantiate an offence of 
Section 306
 of the Indian Penal Code.

The allegations leveled are inherently improbable.


13(o)           This Court is conscious of the fact that 
Section 482
 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, as observed by the Hon'ble

Apex Court in the case of 
Amit Kapoor
 (supra), is based upon the

maxim "quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id

sine quo res ipsa esse non potest", i.e when the law gives anything

to anyone, it also gives all those things without which the thing

itself would be unavoidable. This Court is also conscious of the fact

that such power is to be exercised "ex debito justitiae", i.e. to do

real and substantial justice for administration of which alone, the

Court exist.

considered opinion that this is a fit case wherein the powers under


Section 482
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are required

to be exercised. It is true that such powers are to be exercised

sparingly.





15.             For the reasons stated herein-above, these applications

succeed and are hereby allowed. The F.I.R registered vide
