Leave granted.



These  appeals   project  a  challenge  to  the  judgment  and  order  dated
11.5.2015 rendered by the High Court of Karnatka in  the  appeals  preferred
by the respondents herein, thereby  acquitting  them  of  the  charge  under

Sections 120B
 and 
109
 of Indian Penal Code,  1860  (for  short  “
IPC
”)  read
with 
Sections 13(1)(e)
 and 
13(2)
 of the Prevention of Corruption  Act,  1988
(for short “1988 Act”) as framed against them and also resultantly  setting-
aside the order of the  Trial Court for confiscation   of  properties,  both
movable and immovable, of the concerned firms,  as  mentioned  therein.   In
the meantime, after the conclusion of the  arguments,  the  respondent  No.1
expired  and,  thus  in  law,  the  appeals   against   her   have   abated.
Nevertheless, in view of the gamut of the imputations and the frame-work  of
the charges as well as the nature of the  evidence,  oral  and  documentary,
available on records, reference to her role and involvement,  based  thereon
in collaboration  with  other  respondents  would  have  to  be  essentially
examined. The  respondents-accused  would  hereinafter  be  referred  to  as
respondents/accused/A1/A2/A3/ A4,  as the case may  be,  contingent  on  the
context.



Charges were framed against A1 – former  Chief  Minister  of  the  State  of
Tamil Nadu and the co-accused viz. A2, A3 and A4 (respondents  herein),  for
commission of the alleged offences punishable under  
Section  13(1)(e)
  read
with 
Section 13(2)
 of the 1988 Act  and  further  under  Section  120-B  and

Section 109
 of IPC. It is  the  case  of  the  prosecution  that  A1  (since
deceased) was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from  24th  June,  1991  till
13th May, 1996. Prior to this, she was a member  of  the  Rajya  Sabha  from
April, 1984 till 27th January, 1989 and further she was a  member  of  Tamil
Nadu Legislative Assembly from 27th January, 1989 till 30th  January,  1991.
She also acted in the films during 1964-1972. Facts reveal that she was  the
daughter of late Smt. N.R. Sandhya, who also acted in films  during  1960’s.
Smt. N.R. Sandhya died in the year 1971 and by virtue of her  mother’s  Will
dated 01.11.1971, A1 became the owner of the following properties viz.,

Land and building at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86;



House at Plot No.36, Door No.8/3/1099  in  Sri  Nagar  Officer’s  Colony  at
Hyderabad City;



Lands totally measuring 10.20 acres in Sy.No.52 and Sy.No.50  of  Jeedimetla
village and Sy. No.93/1 of Pet  Basheerabad  Village  in  Metchal  Taluk  in
Ranga Reddy Dist. of Andhra  Pradesh  with  Grape  Garden,  Farm  House  and
Servants quarters;



Land in Sy.No.93/2 to the extent of 3.15 acres in  Pet  Basheerabad  village
in Andhra Pradesh;



In addition to the above properties, A1 was also in possession of –

Agricultural land measuring 3.43 acres in Cheyyur Taluk now  in  Anna  Dist.
(as per Doc. No.4564/81, dt.16.12.1981 of SRO North Madras);



An old Ambassador car and an old Contessa car;



A new Maruti car bearing registration No.TMA-2466 worth Rs.60,435/- and

Company shares.



Thus, the assets which were in the possession of A1 up to  1987  were  found
to be worth only Rs.7.5 lakhs. Besides, she also claimed to  have  possessed
balance in her bank accounts to the extent of Rs.1 lakh  and  certain  items
of jewellery.



A2 – Tmt. Sasikala Natarajan is the wife of one Mr.  M.  Natarajan  who  had
joined Government service as a Publicity  Assistant  in  the  Department  of
Information and Public Relation, Government of Tamil Nadu, in the year  1970
and thereafter promoted in succession eventually as Deputy Director  in  the
year  1986  in  the  same  department.  He  tendered  his  resignation  from
Government  service  on  1st  November,  1988  which  was  accepted  by  the
Government of Tamil Nadu with retrospective effect on 3rd April, 1991.



A2, as it appears from the facts, is the daughter  one  C.  Vivekanandan,  a
Medical Compounder, and her marriage with said Natarajan  was  held  in  the
early 1970’s.  A2 was initially an occasional visitor to  the  residence  of
A1 at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86, and started permanently  living  there
with A1 from 1988 onwards and was acknowledged and declared  by  A1  as  her
friend-cum-sister.  A2 continued to live with A1 since then.



A3 – Tr. V.N. Sudhakaran is the son of A2’s elder  sister  Smt.  Vanithamani
and T.T. Vivekanandan. He started residing at No.36, Poes  Garden,  Chennai-
86 in the year 1992 while pursuing his studies at New College,  Chennai.  A1
had acknowledged and proclaimed A3 as her “foster  son”  and  had  conducted
his marriage with one Sathiyalakshmi at Chennai on  7.9.1995,  in  a  lavish
celebrations.



A4, Tmt. J. Elavarasi is the wife of late V. Jayaraman,  the  elder  brother
of A2. The said V. Jayaraman  was  a  Government  servant  and  he  died  in
December, 1991 due to electrocution while attending to works  in  the  Grape
Garden of A1 at Hyderabad. Following her husband’s death, A4  came  to  live
at No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai-86, from the beginning of 1992.



The case of the prosecution is  that,  as  on  1.7.1991,  A1  was  found  in
possession of properties and pecuniary resources in  her  name  and  in  the
name of A2 Smt. N. Sasikala, who was living with A1 at No. 36, Poes  Garden,
Chennai to the extent of Rs.2,01,83,957/- including the properties  acquired
in the name of M/s. Jaya Publications, M/s.  Sasi  Enterprises  and  Namadhu
MGR, which had been floated by A1 and A2 with themselves as  partners.  But,
after 1.7.1991, there was sudden spurt in  the  acquisition  of  assets  and
during this period, A1 and A2 floated several firms in the names of  A2,  A3
and A4 viz.,

M/s. J. Farm Houses;



M/s. J.S. Housing Development;



M/s. Jay Real Estate;



M/s. Jaya Contractors and Builders;



M/s. J.S. Leasing and Maintenance;



M/s. Green Farm Houses;



M/s. Metal King;



M/s. Super Duper TV (P) Ltd.,

M/s. Anjaneya Printers Pvt. Ltd.,

M/s. Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd.,

M/s. Signora Business Enterprises Pvt., Ltd.,

M/s. Lex Property Development Pvt., Ltd.,

M/s. Riverway Agro Products Pvt., Ltd.,

M/s. Meadow Agro Farms Pvt., Ltd.,

M/s. Indo Doha Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,

M/s. A.P. Advertising Services;



M/s. Vigneswara Builders;



M/s. Lakshmi Constructions;



M/s. Gopal Promoters;



M/s. Sakthi Constructions;



M/s. Namasivaya Housing Development;



M/s. Ayyappa Property Developments;



M/s. Sea Enclave;



M/s. Navasakthi Contractors and Builders;



M/s. Oceanic Constructions;



M/s. Green Garden Apartments;



 M/s. Marble Marvels;



Vinod Video Vision;



Fax Universal;



Fresh Mushrooms;



M/s. Super Duper TV., and

M/s. Kodanadu Tea Estate;



The further case of the prosecution is that during  the  check  period  i.e.
from 1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996, there were no  business  activities  at  all  in
respect of  many  of  the  above  firms,  and  in  respect  of  others,  the
activities  were  more  in  the  nature  of  acquiring  assets  like  lands,
machinery, building etc., which were not production oriented. No  income-tax
returns were filed by these firms. No  assessment  for  commercial  tax  has
also been done with respect to the business of these firms. A1 also did  not
file her Income-tax returns for the  assessment  years  1987-88  to  1992-93
till November, 1992  and  when  this  issue  was  sought  to  be  raised  in
Parliament, A1  filed  the  income-tax  returns  for  the  above  period  in
November, 1992. Subsequent to 1.7.1991, assets in the form  of  movable  and
immovable properties and pecuniary resources like bank deposits  etc.,  were
found acquired not only in the name of A1, but also in the names of  A2,  A3
and A4 and the firms floated  in  their  names.  Scrutiny  of  various  bank
accounts maintained in the names of A1 to A4 and in the names of  the  above
firms disclosed that huge credits in cash  had  been  frequently  made  into
various accounts  which  were  not  commensurate  with  the  income  of  the
individuals and of the firms concerned. There  were  frequent  transfers  of
amounts between one account to the others to facilitate illegal  acquisition
of assets. The huge quantum of such assets, when viewed in the context  that
A1 was holding the office of the Chief Minister and that A2, A3 and A4  were
living under the same roof with  A1  and  not  having  sufficient  means  to
acquire the  assets  in  their  names,  established  that  the  assets  were
actually acquired by A1.



It is further alleged that, pursuant to the criminal conspiracy between  A1,
a public servant and her associates viz., A2, A3  and  A4,  to  acquire  and
possess properties and pecuniary resources by A1 in  her  name  and  in  the
names of A2, A3 and A4 and in the names of various firms  floated  by  them,
they  amassed  properties  and  pecuniary   resources   to   the   tune   of
Rs.66,64,73,573/- (later corrected as Rs.66,65,20,395/-), which was  grossly
disproportionate to the known sources of income of A1 and A2  to  A4  during
the check period from 1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996. According to  the  prosecution,
the income from the known sources of A1 during this period, such  as  rental
income, interest derived from various bank deposits and other deposits  held
by her in her name and in the names of A2, A3 and A4,  agricultural  income,
loans and the salary received by  her  as  Chief  Minister  of  Tamil  Nadu,
worked out to a total of Rs.9,34,26,054/-, whereas during  this  period  the
expenditure incurred by A1 including  repayment  of  principal  amounts  and
interest on loan, and other outgoings were  assessed  at  Rs.11,56,56,833/-.
Thus, as on 30.4.1996, A1 being a public servant was found to have  acquired
and possessed pecuniary resources and properties in  her  name  and  in  the
names of  A2,  A3  and  A4  and  the  firms  floated  by  them,  which  were
overwhelmingly disproportionate to  her  known  sources  of  income  to  the
extent of Rs.66,65,20,395/-  (Rupees  Sixty  Six  Crores  Sixty  Five  Lakhs
Twenty Thousand Three hundred and Ninety Five only) which is an  offence  of
criminal misconduct within the definition of 
Sec.13(1)(e)
  punishable  under

Section 13(2)
 of 1988 Act and A2, A3, and A4 conspired with A1  and  abetted
the commission of the above offence.



On 14.6.1996, Dr. Subramanian Swamy (PW-232), the then President  of  Janata
Dal lodged a complaint against  A1  before  the  Principal  Sessions/Special
Judge, Madras, under  
Section  200
  of  Cr.P.C.,  alleging  that  A1,  after
assuming the public office as Chief Minister of  Tamil  Nadu,  had  acquired
properties and earned  income  disproportionate  to  her  known  sources  of
income. The said complaint was registered as Crl.M.P. No.3238  of  1996  and
by order  dated  21.06.1996,  the  Principal  Sessions  Judge/Special  Judge
directed investigation under 
Section 17
 of  1988  Act  and  
Section  202
  of
Cr.P.C. and further directed to collect necessary  materials  and  submit  a
report before the Court within a period of  two  months.   Pursuant  to  the
said order, PW-240 - Smt. Letika Saran, a senior IPS Officer,  took  up  the
investigation, collected records and documents from various sources.



During the investigation, the said order passed by  the  Principal  Sessions
Judge/Special Judge was challenged before the  High  Court  of  Madras.  The
investigation was stayed for a brief period and thereafter  the  High  Court
was pleased to direct the Director of Vigilance and Anti Corruption,  Madras
(hereinafter also referred to as  “DVAC”)  to   take  appropriate  steps  to
investigate into the allegations made in the complaint  and  ultimately,  an
FIR was filed against A1 on 18.9.1996  as per Ext.P-2266.



During investigation, after conducting search of  the  residential  premises
of A1 and various other locations, the Investigating Officer  found  several
incriminating materials and voluminous documents were seized and  statements
of a large number of witnesses were  recorded.  The  incriminating  evidence
collected during such investigation disclosed the complicity of A2 to A4  in
the alleged offence. Hence, an application  was  filed  before  the  Special
Judge on 22.01.1997 for addition of A2, A3 and  A4  as  co-accused  and  for
incorporation of additional offences under 
Section 120-B
 of  IPC  read  with

Sections 13(2)
 and  
13(1)(e)
  of  1988  Act  and  
Section  109
  of  IPC.  On
completion of such investigation, PW-259  (Shri  Nallamma  Naidu)  laid  the
charges against all the accused on 4.6.1997 which  was  duly  registered  as
Spl. C.C. No.7/97 on the file of the IX Additional Sessions  Judge  (Special
Court, I), Chennai.



The ball was set into motion  and  following  charges  were  framed  by  the
Special Judge, Chennai:

Firstly:-  That you  A1  to  A4  during  the  period  between  1.7.1991  and
30.4.1996 in Chennai and other places in Tamil Nadu, you A1 being  a  public
servant, along with you A2 to A4, were  parties  to  a  criminal  conspiracy
with the object of acquiring and possession pecuniary  resources  of  income
to the extent of Rs.66,65,20,395/- in the names of you A1 and in  the  names
of you A2 to A4 and the thirty two (32) business enterprises floated in  the
names of A2 to A4, for which you (A1) could not satisfactorily  account  and
you (A2 to A4) abetted A1 by holding a substantial portion of the  pecuniary
resources and property in your names  (A2  to  A4)  on  behalf  of  you  and
thereby you A1 to A4 committed an offence punishable  u/Sec.s  120-B  I.P.C.

r/w 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e) of 
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
 and within  the
cognizance of this Court.



Secondly:- That you A1 in pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy,  during
the said period and the said places, being  a  public  servant  to  wit  the
Chief Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu, acquired and  possessed  in  your
name and in the names of  A2  to  A4  and  in  the  names  of  the  business
enterprises floated in the names  of  A2  to  A4,  pecuniary  resources  and
property disproportionate to your known sources of income to the  extent  of
Rs.66,65,20,395/- for  which  you  could  not  satisfactorily  account,  and
thereby you A1 committed an offence punishable u/Sec. 13(2) r/w 13(1)(e)  of

Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
 and within the cognizance of this Court.



Thirdly:- That you A2 to A4 in pursuance of  the  said  criminal  conspiracy
during the said period and the  said places abetted  A1  who  was  a  public

resources and property disproportionate to her known sources of  income  and
for which she could not satisfactorily account,  by  holding  a  substantial
portion of the said pecuniary resources and property in your  names  and  in
the names of the business enterprises floated in  your  names,  and  thereby
you A2 to A4 committed an offence punishable u/Sec.  109  
I.P.C
.  r/w  13(2)
r/w  13(1)(e)  of  
Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988
  and  within   the
cognizance of this Court.



The charges were denied by the accused persons. During the pendency  of  the
trial, the D.V. & A.C. was permitted  further  investigation  under  
Section
173(8)
 of Cr.P.C. and was granted letters rogatory by the  Designated  Court
for collecting evidence and materials relating to the  alleged  accumulation
of disproportionate assets/wealth by A1 in conspiracy with  A2  outside  the
country.  On  the  basis  of   the   evidence   collected   during   further
investigation, a separate  FIR  in  Crime  No.2/AC/2000  was  filed  by  the
prosecution on 2.9.2000 against A1 and A2 which culminated  into  a  charge-
sheet dated 23.3.2001 registered as Spl.C.C. No.2/2001.



Subsequent thereto evidence was recorded  from  time  to  time.  Thereafter,
steps were taken under 
Section 313
 Cr.P.C. So far as A1 was  concerned,  she
was permitted to answer a questionnaire which was delivered to  her  with  a
direction to answer it on 25.2.2003, which was adhered to by A1.  A2  to  A4
were also questioned as per 
Section 313
 Cr.P.C. which was duly concluded  on
26.2.2003. Thereafter, defence witnesses were examined. Thereafter,  by  its
judgment dated 18.11.2003 in Transfer  Petition  (Criminal)  Nos.77-78/2003,
the Supreme Court transferred the said matter to the State of Karnataka  and
in terms of the said judgment, the Government  of  Karnataka  by  its  order
dated 27.12.2003 duly accorded sanction for  establishment  of  the  Special
Curt at Bangalore and by Notification dated 19.02.2005, duly appointed  Shri
B.V. Acharya, Senior Advocate and former Advocate General  of  Karnataka  as
Public Prosecutor to conduct the said matter.



Thereafter, the said matter bearing Spl.C.C.  No.7/1997  was  renumbered  as
Spl.C.C. No.208/2004 and  Spl.C.C.  No.2/2001  was  renumbered  as  Spl.C.C.
No.209/2004 on the file of the Special Judge (i.e. 36th Addl. City  Civil  &
Sessions Judge at Bangalore. Subsequent thereto certain steps were taken  on
behalf of the accused and the matter  travelled  up  to  this  Court/Supreme
Court whereafter the trial  was  resumed  before  the  Special  Judge.   The
accused were called upon to examine  their  witnesses  and  subsequently  99
witnesses were produced before  the  Court  and  concluded  their  evidence.
Narration of all eventful factual interventions has been avoided  being  not
decisively essential for the adjudication.



It appears that the Trial Court after hearing the  parties  culled  out  the
following points for determination:



Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that A1, being  a
public servant acquired and possessed in her name and in the names of A2  to
A4 and in  the  names  of  business  enterprises  floated  in  their  names,
pecuniary  resources  and  assets  of   the   value   of   Rs.66,65,20,395/-
disproportionate to her known source of income during the check period  from
01.07.1991 and 30.04.1996, which she could not satisfactorily account?



Whether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that A1 to  4
were parties to a criminal conspiracy  with  the  object  of  acquiring  and
possessing pecuniary resources and assets to the extent of Rs.66,65,20,395/-
 in the names of A1 and in the  names  of  A2  to  4  and  the  32  business
enterprises floated in the names of  A2  to  4  and  thereby  committed  the
offence punishable u/Sec. 120-B of 
Indian Penal Code
 R/w.

Whether the prosecution further proves beyond all reasonable doubt  that  A2
to A4 abetted the commission of the above offence  by  intentionally  aiding
A1 in the acquisition and possession of pecuniary resources  and  properties
disproportionate to her known source of income by holding substantial
portion thereof in their names and in the names of 32  business  enterprises
floated in the names of A2 to A4, rendering them liable for  conviction  for
the offence punishable u/Sec. 109

What order ?



The Trial Court appraised the evidence adduced  in  respect  of  the  points
formulated by it  and  duly  dealt  with  the  charges  framed  against  the
accused.  The  Trial  Court  elaborately  dealt  with   the   matter   after
considering the evidence, facts as well as the judgments  cited  before  it,
the contentions raised and after dealing with all  aspects  of  the  matter,
inter alia held that:

“……There is no argument from any quarters  that  the  choice  of  the  check
period has caused any prejudice  or  disadvantage  to  the  accused  in  any
manner.  Hence,  in  my  view,  the  period  of  5  years  selected  by  the
prosecution is reasonably  sufficient  to  give  a  fair  and  comprehensive
picture of the known source of income and pecuniary resources  and  property
in the possession of the accused so to arrive at  a  fair  decision  on  the
issues involved in this proceedings.”


From the facts it appears, the prosecution has listed the details of  assets
held by the accused at the beginning of the check period  i.e.  1.7.1991  in
Annexure-I (Ext.P-2327). The said Annexure is reproduced hereunder:

It appears that the aforementioned expenditures are classifiable as
follows:

Amounts paid towards interest in respect of the loan.



Amounts paid to Corporation of Madras towards sanction of building plan.



Amounts  paid to Corporation, MMWSSB.
Amounts  paid for the purchase of provisions.
Amounts towards LIC premium.
Amounts paid towards DD Commission.
Amounts paid to telecom and Electricity
Department.

Income Tax and Wealth Tax.

Household Expenses.

Marriage Expenses.

Other outgoings.



The Trial Court after analyzing oral and documentary evidence  came  to  the
conclusion that the accused have not disputed the loan transactions  and  as
a result whereof it held that the prosecution has proved Item Nos.1 to 8  of
Annexure-IV. In respect of Item Nos.9 to 21,  the  Trial  Court  after  duly
considering the evidence, both oral and documentary, held that  the  accused
did not dispute the statutory permission obtained by them  for  constructing
new buildings and addition of the building as noted in Exts.65, 64, 51,  54,
63, 56, 48, 49, 50, 59, 60, 61, 62, 66 and 76, respectively  and  therefore,
it appeared  that  the  receipts  for  such  payments  and  the  proceedings
maintained by the concerned municipal authority had been established by  the
prosecution. Similarly,  the  Trial  Court  held  that  payments  made  with
respect to item Nos.23 to 35, 37 to 44, 46, 48 to 54 & 56 to  176  had  been
proved by the prosecution.  The corresponding documents  have  already  been
accepted before the Court and hence such expenditure has been proved by  the
prosecution. With regard to Item Nos.178  to  198,  such  expenditures  were
never disputed on behalf of the accused before the  Court.  After  analyzing
the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and  their  depositions,  it  held
that item Nos.229 & 230 have also been proved by the prosecution.



The Trial Court has duly considered the objections raised on behalf  of  the
accused and rejected the same.  Similarly, the Trial Court  has  also  dealt
with other expenditures such as  household  expenses  (Item  No.225  in  the
Chart)  and  the  objections  raised  on  such  account  on  the  ground  of
overlapping entries and it came to the conclusion that the argument  of  the
learned counsel raising the objections cannot be accepted.  After  analyzing
the oral and documentary evidence placed on record and the  judgments  cited
before it, the Trial Court came to the following conclusion:



“Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that as against  the  income
of Rs.9,91,05,094.75 and expenditure of Rs.8,49,06,833.00 during  the  check
period, A1 acquired and possessed in her name and in the names of A2  to  A4
and in the names  of  the  business  enterprises  acquired  in  their  names
immovable   properties   and   pecuniary   resources   of   the   value   of
Rs.53,60,49,954.00  which  she  could  not  satisfactorily  account.  Hence,
acting u/Sec.  248  (2)  of  896  Spl.C.C.208/2004  
Cr.P.C
.,  A1  is  hereby
convicted for the offence punishable u/Sec. 13 (1) (e) R/w. 
Sec. 13  (2)
  of
1988 Act.



Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that, A1 to A4  were  parties
to  criminal  conspiracy  with  the  object  of  acquiring  and   possessing
pecuniary resources and assets to the extent  of  Rs.53,60,49,954.00  beyond
the known source of income of A1. Hence,  A1,  A2,  A3  and  A4  are  hereby
convicted for the offence punishable u/Sec. 120-B of  
I.P.C
.  R/w.  
Sec.  13
(1) (e)
 R/w. 
Sec. 13 (2)
 of  1988 Act.



Prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that A2  to  A4  abetted  the
commission of the above
offence by intentionally aiding A1 in the acquisition
and possession of pecuniary resources  and  properties  disproportionate  to
her known source of income as  above.  Hence,  A2,  A3  and  A4  are  hereby
convicted for the offence punishable u/
Sec.109
 of I.P.C. R/w.  
Sec.  13  (1)


(e) R/w. 
Sec. 13 (2)
 of 1988 Act.”

The Trial Court after hearing the learned counsel appearing for the  accused
and the learned Public  Prosecutor  on   sentence,   awarded  the  following
sentence against the accused:

“For the offence u/Sec. 13 (1) (e) R/w. 
Sec. 13 (2)
 of
the 1988 Act, A1 Selvi.  J.  Jayalalitha,  D/o.  Late.  Jayaram,  is  hereby

Sec. 13 (2)
  of  1988

Period of custody already undergone by the  accused shall be given  set  off
u/Sec. 428 of Cr.P.C.



It is further ordered that, necessary  direction  shall  be  issued  to  the
concerned banks to remit the proceeds of the Fixed  Deposits  and  the  cash
balance standing to the credit of  the  respective  accused  in  their  bank
account and the proceeds thereof shall be appropriated and adjusted  towards
the fine amounts.



If after adjustment, still the  fine  falls  short,  the  gold  and  diamond
ornaments seized and produced before the Court  (after  setting  apart  7040
grams of gold with proportionate diamond  jewellery),  as  observed  in  the
body of the judgment shall be sold to RBI or SBI or  by  public  auction  to
make deficit of  fine  amount  good.  The  rest  of  the  gold  and  diamond
jewellery shall be confiscated to the Government.



All the immovable  properties  registered  in  the  names  of  Lex  Property
Developments Pvt. Ltd., Meadow Agro Farms  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Ramaraj  Agro  Mills

made over to the State of Karnataka towards reimbursement  of  the  cost  of
trial conducted in the State of Karnataka.

Furnish a free copy of the full judgment to the accused forthwith.”


Being aggrieved, appeals were filed by the accused before the High Court  of
Karnataka at Bangalore challenging the order passed by  the  Court  of  36th
Addl. City Civil & Sessions Judge  at  Bangalore.  The  High  Court  on  its
analysis came to the conclusion that the value of assets at the end  of  the
check period in respect of accused Nos.1, 2, 3 & 4 together along  with  the
firms/companies involved was Rs.66,44,73,537/-  and accepted  the  value  of
the assets as indicated by  the  prosecution.  The  High  Court,  thereafter
applying the principles laid down in Krishnanand Agnihotri Vs. The State  of
Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1977 SC 769 = (1977) 1 SCC  816,  on  a  calculation  of
total assets, income & expenditure of accused Nos.1 to 4,  their  firms  and
companies, arrived at the percentage of disproportionate assets as under:

The  High  Court,  following  the  principles  laid  down  in    Krishnanand
Agnihotri  (supra), held that when there is disproportionate  asset  to  the
extent of 10%  or  below,   the  accused  are  entitled  to  acquittal   and
accordingly the  High  Court  passed  the  following  order  acquitting  the
accused:



“(A) Criminal Appeal  Nos.835/2014,  836/2014,  837/2014  and  838/2014  are
allowed.



[i] The Judgment of Conviction and  Sentence  passed  in  Spl.C.C.No.208  of
2004, dated 27.9.2014, on the file of  the  36th  Additional  City  Civil  &
Sessions  Judge  (Spl.  Court  for   Trial   of   Criminal   Cases   against
Kum.Jayalalitha & Ors.), Bengaluru, is hereby set-aside.  Appellants-Accused
Nos.1 to 4 are acquitted of all the charges levelled against them.



[ii] The Bail bonds of A1 to A4 are discharged.



(B) The Appeals in Criminal Appeal Nos.17/2015, 18/2015,  19/2015,  20/2015,
21/2015 and 22/2015 are allowed in part.



[i] Order of the Trial Court relating  to  confiscation  of  the  properties
both movable and immovable, is hereby set aside.”


Assailing the judgment and order dated 11.05.2015, passed by the High  Court
of Karnataka at Bengaluru, appeals,  by  special  leave,   have  been  filed
before this  Court  by  the  State  of  Karnataka  and  Mr.  K.  Anbazhagan.
Although the State of Tamil Nadu was arrayed as the sole respondent  in  the
appeals before the High Court, these appeals have been filed  by  the  State
of Karnataka, in view of the  decisions of this Court in 
K.  Anbazhagan  Vs.
State of Karnataka and Ors.
, reported in (2015) 6 SCC 86 and  (2015)  6  SCC
158, wherein it was held that it is only the State of Karnataka  (being  the
Transferee State) which is the sole Prosecuting Agency and was competent  to
appoint the Public Prosecutor.




We  have  given  a  patient  hearing  to  all  the  parties,  including  the
intervenor, in the matter. We have been taken through various documents  and
the evidence of the parties.



Mr. Dushyant Dave and Mr. B.V. Acharya, learned senior counsel appearing  in
support of the appeals first contended that the High  Court  has  calculated
the disproportionate assets by  adopting  an  incorrect  method  with  wrong
particulars and our attention was drawn to Page 997 of the SLP  Paper  Book,
where in the table consisting of assets and expenditure, the High Court  has
reduced  the  values  therein  but  has  inflated  the   income   and   thus
inaccurately assessed the disproportionate assets to be  Rs.2,82,36,  812/-.
It is pointed out before us that there are concurrent findings  of  the  two
Courts in respect of the fact that  the  accused  did  own  disproportionate
assets during the check period and the difference between the two Courts  is
only with regard to the quantum. While the  Trial  Court  held  that  it  is
Rs.53,60,49,954/-, the High Court held it as Rs.2,83,36,812/-.  It  is  also
submitted that in calculating the disproportionate assets, value of  assets,
expenditure and income of all the accused has been taken jointly along  with
that of firms and companies (34 in number). Both the Courts, High  Court  as
well as Trial Court, have recorded concurrent findings and  have  taken  all
the assets, income and expenditure  of  all  the  accused  together.  It  is
further pointed out that the sole  source  of  inflow  is  of  A1,  although
assets were standing in the names of other accused  or  the  firms/companies
owned by them. It is further submitted, as appears from  the  records,  that
both the Courts did not accept the claim to consider the case of A1  and  A2
to A4 separately. Hence, it is submitted that now they cannot claim  such  a
course to be adopted at this stage before this Court.



It is also submitted that  both  the  Courts  have  rejected  the  claim  of
Namadhu MGR scheme which according to the accused worked out  to  more  than
Rs.14 crores during the check period and that  the  finding  of  the  Courts
that all properties purchased  by  the  6  companies  actually  belonged  to
accused has not been challenged by anybody and therefore it stands.



Mr. B.V. Acharya, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf  of  the  State
of Karnataka contended that if the final figures arrived by the  High  Court
(appearing at Pages 997-998 of  its  judgment)  are  accepted  and  apparent
errors therein including calculation and arithmetical errors as  also  error
apparent on the face of  the  record  are  corrected,  the  disproportionate
assets will be more than Rs.35  crores  and  this  alone  is  sufficient  to
sustain the conviction, according to him.  Mr. Acharya has placed before  us
a Chart which is as follows:



|Sl.  |ERROR              |CORRECTIONS                                 |
|No.  |                   |                                            |

|1.   |CALCULATION ERROR  |The method of calculating D.A. is wrong. If |
|     |                   |all the findings of the high court is       |
|     |                   |accepted in toto then the amount of D.A. is |
|     |                   |Rs.14,38,93,645 i.e. 41.3% & not            |
|     |                   |Rs.2,82,36,36,812 i.e. 8.12% as held by the |
|     |                   |High Court – (The previous two charts have  |
|     |                   |details of the same)                        |
|2.   |ARITHMETIC ERROR   |While totalling loans as income at (Pg.939  |
|     |                   |Vol IV), the High Court has committed an    |
|     |                   |arithmetic error to the tune of 13.50       |
|     |                   |Crores. If this arithmetic error is alone   |
|     |                   |corrected then the Disproportionate Asset   |
|     |                   |come to Rs.16,32,36,812/- i.e. 76.7%        |
|     |                   |This is fully covered in Pg 1028-1030 – SLP |
|     |                   |Vol.IV                                      |
|3.   |ADMISION OF ACCUSED|Under Expenditure:                          |
|     |                   |Cost of Construction : The accused have     |
|     |                   |admitted that the cost of construction      |
|     |                   |incurred is Rs.8,60,59,261 – Pg 2350 Vol IX.|
|     |                   |However the High Court values the same at   |
|     |                   |Rs.5,10,55,060 – Pg 979 Vol IV, which is    |
|     |                   |Rs.3,50,05,210 lesser than the admitted     |
|     |                   |amount.                                     |
|     |                   |Under income:                               |
|     |                   |Business income of Jaya Publication: The    |
|     |                   |accused have admitted that the income of    |
|     |                   |Jaya Publication was Rs.1,15,94,849/- (As   |
|     |                   |per written submission of A-2 –Extracted in |
|     |                   |Pg 1034 SLP Vol IV). The High Court         |
|     |                   |calculated this at Rs.4 Crores – Pg 946-960 |
|     |                   |Vol IV, which is Rs.2,84,05,151/- more than |
|     |                   |the admitted amount.                        |
|4.   |GIFTS AS INCOME    |Gifts as income is subject matter of SLP    |
|     |                   |Nos.1163-1167 of 2012 – Pg 1032-1033 Present|
|     |                   |SLP Vol IV. Therefore although Trial Court  |
|     |                   |has held that gifts received cannot be held |
|     |                   |to be a lawful source of income – Pg        |
|     |                   |1283-1296 Vol V, the High Court has added   |
|     |                   |1.5 Crores as income under this head, which |
|     |                   |is liable to be reduced.                    |


Therefore if the above corrections are  carried  out,  the  disproportionate
assets will be :

On the basis of finding of High Court -  Rs.14,38,93,645

On the basis of finding of High Court, correction of the other  mistakes  in
arithmetic, admissions of accused and disallowing gifts as income:



|1.    |14,38,93,645       |Omission of Expenses – Corrected         |
|2.    |13,50,00,000       |Totalling Error – Corrected              |
|3.    |3,50,05,210        |Admission Reg Valuation of Construction  |
|4.    |2,84,05,151        |Admission Reg Business income of Jaya    |
|      |                   |Publication                              |
|5.    |1,50,00,000        |Gift – which is illegal                  |
|Disproportionate Asset – 35,73,04,006                               |


Income will have to be  : 16,92,60,503



Disproportionate Asset (D.A.)  = 35,73,04,006/-



%  of D.A.             =      35,73,04,006 x 100       =   211.09%

                                 16,92,60,503




Hence, he submitted that this process alone is  sufficient  to  sustain  the
conviction.



Mr. Acharya further contended that the findings of the High Court  regarding
the value of assets are patently erroneous and unsustainable.  He  submitted
that the High Court has accepted the  value  given  by  DVAC  except  for  a
single head i.e., value of additional  constructions.  The  High  Court  has
accepted  the  amount  of  expenditure  except  for  1  item  i.e.  marriage
expenditure and the High Court has added 7 items towards  the  income  which
are patently erroneous. Mr. Acharya drew our attention to  Annexure-III  (64
items – Annexure-III, Pages 1224-1233  of  Vol.V)  and  submitted  that  the
income includes  loan,  interest,  rental,  agricultural  income  and  fixed
deposits. According to the prosecution, the said amount is  Rs.9,34,26,054/-
(which would appear at Pages 1224-1233 of Vol.V).  According  to  the  Trial
Court, the income would be Rs.9,91,05,094.75/- (appearing at  Page  1396  of
Vol. VI). However, the High Court has shown such income as Rs.34,76,65,654/-
 (appearing at Pages 997-998 of Vol. IV). It  is  submitted  that  the  High
Court considered additional income under  7  heads  and  has  increased  the
income to Rs.34,76,65,654/-.



The High Court has shown the value of  income from loan as Rs.24,17,31,274/-
 which contains error of totalling and the  sum  total  of  these  10  items
ought to be Rs.10,67,31,274/-. Therefore, there  is  a  totalling  error  of
Rs.13,50,00,000/-. He further contended that these loans  as  income  cannot
be taken into consideration as has been taken by the High Court.  Since  the
prosecution has already considered such loans as  income  which  appears  at
Annexure-III at Page 1228 Vol. V (Items 1-8) and expenditure at  Annexure-IV
(Page 1397 of Vol.VI, Items  1-8).  He drew our attention to the High  Court
judgment regarding 10 loans, which would appear at Page 938-939, Vol. IV  of
the SLP Paper Book, which is as under:




|1.  |Ex.P1027     |OMTL-Indian Bank,    |Rs.1,50,00,000.00   |

|    |             |Total                |Rs.24,17,31,274.00  |



Mr. Acharya pointed out that the High Court has wrongly taken  into  account
the above-mentioned 10 loan  amounts,  being  the  loan  from  Indian  Bank.
Regarding the loan of Rs.1,50,00,000/- by OMTL – Jaya Publication, which  is
shown as item No.1 in Annexure-IV Ext.-P 2330, Page 1397 of  Vol.VI,  (being
expenditure list),  he submitted that  this  amount  cannot  be  taken  into
account by the High Court. He also drew  our  attention  to  the  deposition
made by PW-182 and PW-160 wherefrom  it  appears  that  the  said  loan  was
repaid. The Trial Court has dealt with  such  loan  as  it  is  specifically
stated that the  said  loan  was  closed  on  June  25,  1994.  Mr.  Acharya
therefore submitted that the High Court  taking  this  amount  again,  would
amount to a double entry.



Regarding MD Loan of  Rs.3,75,00,000/-  which  is  shown  as  Item  No.8  in
Annexure III Exh.P-2329, Page 1225 of Vol. V (income list), it is  submitted
by Mr. Acharya that this loan has been discussed  by   the  Trial  Court  at
Page 1237-1239 of Vol. V while dealing with income and the Trial  Court  has
accepted the case of the prosecution. The accused at no point of  time  have
disputed  about  any  loan  not  being  taken  into  consideration  by   the
prosecution. Mr. Acharya therefore submitted that the High Court should  not
have taken this amount into  consideration  as  taking  this  amount  again,
would amount to double entry.



Mr. Acharya further submitted that the  Loan  of  Rs.90,00,000/-  which  has
been taken after the check period is only a credit voucher shown  in  Exh.P-
1114, marked by PW-182, who has deposed that this loan was taken in  August,
1996 i.e. after the check period. He  therefore  submitted  that  this  loan
could not have been considered by the High Court at all.



Regarding the Loan  of  Rs.25,00,000/-  which  is  shown  as  Item  No.4  in
Annexure-III Exh.P-2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V (Income list) and Item No.5  of
Annexure-IV, Exh.P-2330, Page 1397 of Vol.  VI  (Expenditure  list),  it  is
submitted by Mr. Acharya that this amount has been deposed to by PW-182  and
marked as Exh.P-1161 to 1163 through him. He  submitted  that  although  the
Bank had sanctioned Rs.25 lakhs, it had released only a sum of  Rs.5  lakhs.
The principal amount and interest has not been paid back by  the  firm.  The
Trial Court has discussed this loan at Page 1234 of  Vol.  V  while  dealing
with income and at Page 1417 of Vol.VI while dealing with  expenditure.  Mr.
Acharya submitted that this income has been duly  considered  and  the  High
Court could not have taken the amount of Rs.25 lakhs under this head.



Regarding the loan of Rs.12,46,000/- J.S. Housing which  is  shown  as  item
No.3 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol.  V,  (Income  list)  and
Item NO.4 in Annexure-IV  Exh.P-2330  Page  1397  of  Vol.  VI  (Expenditure
list), it is submitted by the  learned  counsel  that  this  loan  has  been
deposed to by  PW-182 and marked as  Exh.P-1171  to  1173  through  him.  He
submitted that although the Bank  had  sanctioned  Rs.12.46  lakhs,  it  had
released only a sum of Rs.7 lakhs and the principal amount and interest  has
not been paid back by the firm. The Trial Court has discussed this  loan  at
Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing with income and at  Page  1417  of  Vol.VI
while dealing with expenditure. Mr. Acharya, therefore, submitted that  this
income has been duly considered and the High Court could not have taken  the
amount of Rs.12.46 lakhs under this head.



Regarding the loan of Rs.50,00,000/- J. Farm House which is  shown  as  item
No.2 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol.  V,  (Income  list)  and
Item No.3 in Annexure-IV  Exh.P-2330  Page  1397  of  Vol.  VI  (Expenditure
list), it is submitted by the  learned  counsel  that  this  loan  has  been
deposed to  by   PW-182  and  marked  as  Exh.P-1211-1212  through  him.  He
submitted that  although  the  Bank  had  sanctioned  Rs.50  lakhs,  it  had
released only a sum of Rs.28 lakhs and the  principal  amount  and  interest
has not been paid back by the firm. The Trial Court has discussed this  loan
at Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing with income and at Page 1416 of  Vol.VI
while dealing with  expenditure.  Therefore,  Mr.  Acharya  submitted,  this
income has been duly considered and the High Court could not have taken  the
amount of Rs.50 lakhs under this head.



Regarding the loan of Rs.25,00,000/- by Sasikala  which  is  shown  as  item
No.1 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol.  V,  (Income  list)  and
Item No.2 in Annexure-IV  Exh.P-2330  Page  1397  of  Vol.  VI  (Expenditure
list), it is submitted by the learned counsel  that  this  amount  has  been
deposed to by  PW-182 and marked as Exh.P-1260  through  him.  He  submitted
that the principal amount due under this account was  Rs.13,55,023  and  the
Trial Court has discussed this loan at Page 1234 of  Vol.  V  while  dealing
with income and at Page 1416  of  Vol.VI  while  dealing  with  expenditure.
Therefore, Mr. Acharya submitted that this income has been  duly  considered
and the High Court could not have taken the  amount  of  Rs.25  lakhs  under
this head.



Regarding the loan of Rs.1,57,00,000/- by Sudhakaran (A3) which is shown  as
item No.7 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol.  V,  (Income  list)
and Item No.8 in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of  Vol.  VI  (Expenditure
list), it is submitted by Mr. Acharya that this loan has been taken  by  Lex
Property Development Ltd. and not by Sudhakaran. It has been deposed  to  by
PW-182  and  marked  as  Exh.P-1330  through  him.  He  submitted  that  the
principal amount due under this  account  was  Rs.83,00,000  and  the  Trial
Court’s discussion on this loan is at Page 1234  of  Vol.  V  while  dealing
with income and at Page 1418  of  Vol.VI  while  dealing  with  expenditure.
Therefore, Mr. Acharya submitted, this income has been duly  considered  and
the High Court could not have taken a sum of Rs.1.57 lakhs under this head.



Regarding the loan of Rs.1,65,00,000/- by Ramraj  Agro  Mills  Ltd.   it  is
submitted by the learned counsel that this loan is not shown as an  item  in
Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329, Page 1224 of Vol. V, (Income list) or as  an  item
in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of Vol. VI (Expenditure  list).  It  has
been deposed to  by  PW-182  and  marked  as  Exh.P-1349-1354  through  him.
Exh.1354 is a statement of account of OCC-19 of Ramraj Agro Mills  Ltd.  PW-
235 at 145 of Vol. 11 has stated  of  his  knowledge  about  Rs.1.65  crores
being sanctioned. However, there is no  evidence  of  disbursement  of  this
loan amount. Mr. Acharya submitted that the amount due to the Bank  on  this
account was Rs.39,10,781/-, hence, the High Court could  not  have  taken  a
sum of Rs.1.65 crores under this head.



Regarding the loan of Rs.17,85,274/- by  Mahalakshmi  Kalyanamandapa,  which
is shown as item No.6 in Annexure-III Ext.-P 2329,  Page  1224  of  Vol.  V,
(Income list) and Item No.7 in Annexure-IV Exh.P-2330 Page 1397 of  Vol.  VI
(Expenditure list), it is submitted  by  Mr.  Acharya  that  this  has  been
deposed to by PW-182 and marked as  Exh.P-1357  through  him.  He  submitted
that the amount due in this account was Rs.19,81,802 and the  Trial  Court’s
discussion on this loan is at Page 1234 of Vol. V while dealing with  income
and at Page 1417 of Vol.VI while dealing with  expenditure.  Therefore,  Mr.
Acharya submitted that this income has been duly  considered  and  the  High
Court could not have taken a sum of Rs.17.85 lakhs under this head.



Mr. Acharya thus submitted that the detailed  discussion  in  the  preceding
paragraphs will clearly disclose that that the High Court  considered  these
10 items against the weight of the evidence on record and the entire  amount
of Rs.24,17,31,274/- which after  deduction  of  Rs.5,99,85,274/-  comes  to
Rs.18,17,46,000/- is liable to be set aside. He further contended  that  the
accused have nowhere in their written statement under 
Section  313
  Cr.P.C.,
their Memorandum of Appeal or  their  written  arguments  before  the  Trial
Court and the High Court, taken any  plea  of  any  loan  from  nationalized
banks being left out of  consideration  while  calculating  the  income  and
expenditure and then arrived at the value of  Rs.9,34,26,054/-  (Page  1224,
Vo. V) and Rs.11,56,56,833/- (Page 1397, Vol. VI), respectively.  Therefore,
he contended that 10 items valued at Rs.24,17,31,274/-  taken  by  the  High
Court at Page 939, has to be totally excluded  since  the  same  amounts  to
nothing but double credit. If this error is corrected, than the  income  has
to be reduced by, according to him, Rs.18,17,46,000/-. Therefore,  from  the
finding of the total income of  Rs.34,76,65,654/-  of  the  High  Court,  an
amount of Rs.18,17,46,000/- is liable to be deducted and  the  total  income
would be only  Rs.16,59,19,654/-  and  not  Rs.34,76,65,654/-.   He  further
contended that from this amount, if we deduct the income  on  the  basis  of
admission  and  gift  treating  it  as  income,  then  the  income  will  be
Rs.16,59,19,654/-  -  Rs.2,84,05,151/- (admitted amount) +  Rs.1,50,00,000/-
(gifts)  = Rs.12,25,14,503/-.



Mr. Acharya  further  contended  that  significantly  the  accused  are  not
pressing for remand of  the  case  to  the  appellate  Court  (High  Court).
Consequently, the accused accept all the findings  of  the  High  Court.  Of
course, this  Court  will  have  to  correct  the  calculation  mistakes  or
arithmetic errors and also errors  apparent  on  the  face  of  the  record.
Reacting to the ingenious  endeavour on  the  part  of  the  respondents  to
maintain their acquittal by only  assailing  the  errors  committed  by  the
Trial Court, while abstaining from  questioning  any  finding  of  the  High
Court, the learned Public Prosecutor  urged  that   the  choice  before  the
respondents was two-fold:-



To treat all assets together as one unit and sustain the  same,  subject  to
this  Court  modifying  the  same  by  correcting  calculations/mathematical
errors as also considering  admissions  of  accused  and  excluding  illegal
income as pointed out by the appellants at  Chart  No.6  (pages  18  to  20)
which results in the figure of above  Rs.35.00  crores  as  disproportionate
assets;  or

to assail the findings of the High Court and request for  a  remand  of  the
case to the High Court to hear the appeals filed by them in the presence  of
the State of Karnataka, which is the sole prosecuting agency.



Without following one  of  the  above  two  options,  accused  cannot  claim
confirmation of acquittal by merely pointing  out  few  infirmities  in  the
order of the Trial Court and without proper  analysis  of  the  evidence  on
record, he urged.



It is further the case of the prosecution that the Accused Nos.1 to  4  have
entered into a conspiracy and in furtherance of the same, the  Accused  No.1
(A1)  who  is  a  public  servant  had  come  into  possession   of   assets
disproportionate to the known sources of income  to  the  tune  of  Rs.66.65
crores during the check period (1991-1996).  It is further the case  of  the
appellants that A2 to A4 have abetted A1 in the commission of the offence.



It is the case of the  appellants  that  when  A2  to  A4  had  jointed  the
household of A1, they did not have any worthwhile  property/asset  in  their
names.  They did not have any independent source of income. Properties  were
acquired  in  the  names  of   newly   formed   or   acquired   thirty   two
firms/companies and two existing firms, i.e.,  Jaya  Publications  and  Sasi
Enterprises in which A1 and A2 were partners.  Among  these  entities,  only
few were registered as a company under  the  
Companies  Act,  1956
  and  all
others are firms.  In the said firms or companies, A2 or A3 or A4 or all  of
them are partners or  directors.   It  is  not  in  dispute  that  the  said
properties were acquired during the check period.  It is  further  submitted
that it is on record that six firms were registered on a single  day,  i.e.,
on 25.01.1994, where partners were A2, A3 and A4 and ten  other  firms  were
registered on another single day, i.e., on 06.02.1995, where A2, A3  and  A4
were the partners and further in Lex Proeprty Development (P) Ltd.,  A3  and
A4 were the directors, which would be evident from  the  deposition  of  PW3
(D. Thangavalu in Vol.2, Pg. 11-23).  It was further pointed out that  about
50 bank accounts were opened in Indian Bank, Abiramapuram Branch and  Canara
Bank, Mylapore in the names of accused and the firms/companies, which  would
be evident from the deposition of PW-182 (A.R. Arunachalam in Vol.8 –  Pages
90-182) and PW-201 (C.K.R.K. Vidyasagar in Vol.9 –  Pages  80-231).   It  is
also submitted that the  accused  shared  common  auditors,  architects  and
accountants.



On the question of abetment and conspiracy, Mr. Acharya has  duly  taken  us
through the Paragraph Nos. 88 to 99 of the judgment and order of  the  Trial
Court appearing at Page Nos. 1838-2028 in Vol. 7  &  8  and  submitted  that
there was no source of income of A2 to A4 and further  A2  to  A4  were  not
related to A1. Moreover, A2 to A4 resided with A1.



It is submitted that the properties standing in the name  of  A3;  formation
of large number of firms in the names of  A2  to  A4;  opening  of  50  bank
accounts and transfer of funds from one account to another and cash  credits
into the banks shows that the origin of the resources is from A1.  According
to the prosecution, the other circumstances which  disclose  the  conspiracy
and abetment would appear from the following facts :-



General Power of Attorney was given by A1 to A2;



Constitution of various firms;



Operations of firms from residence of A1;



Installation of A2 to A4 in the house of A1;



A1 had knowledge of capital investments into Sasi Enterprises;



Flow of money from one account to another;



Calling of Sub-registrars to the residence of A1 and

properties were registered.



All these acts would come within the purview of the conspiracy and  abetment
between A2 to A4 with A1. Mr. Acharya submitted that all  the  circumstances
mentioned above establish the abetment and conspiracy.  In support  of  said
contention, the following decisions were cited before us:-

 - (
2001) 1 SCC 378

Firozuddin Basheeruddin & Ors. Vs. State of Kerala - (2001) 7 SCC 596


He further submitted that to prove conspiracy it is  not  possible  to  have
direct evidence. The same has to be proved by drawing  inferences  from  the
proved circumstances. It is fundamental that the ultimate  decision  has  to
be  by  considering  cumulative  effect  of  all  the  circumstances   taken
together. He also submitted that in  the  case  of  conspirators,  each  one
became an agent of the other and is bound by the actions of others.  So  far
as A1 and A2 are considered, one is an agent of other in three ways –
as partners of two firms,
by virtue of power of attorney,
capacity as conspirator.




To support his contention, he submitted that:

A1 had given specific instruction to  follow  the  directions  given  by  A2
(PW–198 -M. Jayaraman in Vol.9 – Pg 28-58 @ 29).



Huge unaccounted cash deposits are made to  these  two  accounts  from  cash
originating from No.36, Poes Garden, Chennai.



It is A2 who has given direction as to which account the huge cash  deposits
are to be made (PW–198 -M. Jayaraman in Vol.9 – Pg 28-58).



There are numerous inter account transfers showing  that  all  accounts  put
together were treated as one account.



Officials were used to locate and purchase  lands  at  various  places  like
Thirunelveli, Uthukadu, Uthukottoai and other places.



PW 47  - K. Muthian          Vol.2  - Pg.237-245

PW 71  - S. Radhakrishnan    Vol.3 – Pg 110-170

PW 159 – Rajagopalan         Vol.7 – Pg 19-124




Acquisition of immovable properties  both  agricultural  as  well  as  urban
lands are as per registered  sale  deeds  numbering  146,  which  have  been
produced.  They  were  acquired  in  the  name  of  individuals/  firms   or
companies. Agricultural lands acquired were of about 3000 acres  of  fertile
lands of which about 900 acres formed a tea estate (Item No.166  –  Annexure
II, Pg 1588 Vol.VI). These properties were purchased  at  a  cost  of  about
Rs.20 crores.



In respect of most of the sales it is A2 who had given directions as to  the
names of which firm/individual the sale was to be registered in  (PW  159  –
Rajagopalan in Vol 7 – Pg.19-124).



The  amounts  were  paid  from  amongst  the   various   accounts   of   the
accused/firms/companies and cash.



Most of the Sale transactions have taken place below the Guideline value.

PW 221  - R.Kesava Ramanujam Vol.10 Pg162-249 @ 172



In many transactions, the vendor was not kept aware  of  the  purchaser  and
the registrations took place through the registrars at the residence of  A1.
So also vendors were put under duress to sell  their  properties.  Instances
of officials also being put under duress were available. Evidence  disclosed
that A1 was aware of the transactions.



There were also additional or new constructions made and old buildings  were
also renovated at huge costs.



Mr. Acharya submitted that the Trial Court has  categorized  the  assets  at
Page 1543 in Vol. VI.  He furnished us the chart as follows:-

He also drew our attention to the particulars of  these  sales,  which  were
furnished before us.  The total sale price under these sale deeds  comes  to
Rs.19,77,18,164/-  though  according  to  the  Trial  Court  the   same   is
Rs.20,07,80,246/-. The difference is marginal  and  it  can  be  taken  that
immoveable properties worth about Rs.20 (twenty) crores have  been  acquired
during  the  check  period.  He  submitted  that  to  prove   these   sales,
prosecution has examined about 60 Vendors and about 20 Sub-registrars.



He further contended that though according to DVAC there were 21 items,  the
Trial Court has taken only 18 out of them and the High Court has taken  only
17 there from.  Hence he submitted that the  High  Court  has  miscalculated
the area of construction of 17  items  as  1668.39  Squares,  i.e.  1,66,839
Sq.Ft. instead of 2174.69 Squares, i.e., 2,17,469 sq. ft.  which  is  nearly
506.3 Squares, i.e., 50,630 sq. ft. lesser than the actual area as  per  the
valuation reports.  In support of such contention, he filed a  Chart,  which
is set out hereunder:

|23076.84sq mts = 2483.97 squares. The High court has however considered 17 items      |
|instead of 21.Therefore the area of construction of 4 items i.e. item nos 146, 147,   |
|192, and 301 is hereto deducted and the total area of 17 items is equalent to 20,203  |
|sq mts which is = 2174.69 squares i.e 2,17,469 Sq ft.                                 |
|                                                                                      |
|The high court has miscalculated the area of construction of 17 items as 1668.39      |
|Squares i.e 1,66,839 sq ft instead of 2174.69 Squares i.e 2,17,469 Sq ft which is     |
|nearly 506.3 Squares i.e 50,630 Sq ft lesser than the actual area as per the valuation|
|reports.                                                                              |


He further submitted that the valuation of the constructions has  been  made
by qualified  PWD  engineers.  Even  the  defence  has  examined  a  retired
engineer (DW-95). Detailed valuation reports have been produced and all  the
engineers  who  have  valued  the  buildings  after  inspection  have   been
examined. The contention of the defence that Trial Court has  rejected  this
evidence is not correct. In fact the Trial Court has accepted the  evidence.

But having regard to the fact that in valuing the constructions,  there  are
several imponderables and taking note of the possibility of marginal  error,
the Trial Court has given a discount of 20% which in the  circumstances,  is
reasonable. Having regard to the superior  quality  of  marble  and  granite
used as described in the valuation reports and having regard  to  the  value
of various special items,  the  ultimate  finding  of  the  Trial  Court  is
justified, he urged.



He further submitted that  even  the  accused  have  admitted  valuation  of
buildings at Rs.8,60,59,261/- excluding one building of  Anjaneya  Printers.
If the value of this construction of Rs.2,13,63,457/- is added to this  sum,
the total will be Rs.10,74,22,718/-.  As  can  be  seen  from  Chart  10  as
reproduced above, under other items of assets IV to  XII,  the  Trial  Court
has totally excluded the value of Sarees and footwear.  Regarding  Gold  and
Diamond jewellary also after detailed discussion  at  Pages  1756  to  1785,
Trial Court has reduced the value from Rs.5,53,02,334/- to  Rs.2,51,59,144/-
and Silverwares  from  Rs.48,80,800/-  to  Rs.20,80,000/-.  Regarding  other
items such as Fixed Deposits and cash balance in bank account, there can  be
no dispute. Therefore, the conclusion of the Trial Court regarding value  of
other  assets  is  fully  justified  as  per  the  evidence  on  record,  he
contended.



So far expenditure is concerned, the High Court has accepted the  amount  of
expenditure fixed by DVAC in respect of all items except the  marriage.  The
High Court has reduced the marriage expenditure  from  Rs.6,45,04,222/-  (as
per prosecution) to Rs.28,68,000/-, i.e.,  a  reduction  of  Rs.6,16,36,222.
According to the prosecution, the total expenditure is Rs.11,56,56,833/-.



He submitted that the main dispute under caption  expenditure  is  regarding
marriage. In support of the prosecution case as many as  21  witnesses  have
been examined as detailed in the  chart.  Though  according  to  prosecution
expenditure incurred for marriage is Rs.6,45,04,222/-, the  Trial  Court  on
detailed consideration has fixed  the  same  at  Rs.3  Crores.  It  is  thus
totally erroneous to contend that the Trial Court has rejected the  evidence
of prosecution  witnesses,  he  pleaded.  In  fact  the  Trial  Court  on  a
consideration, not  only  of  the  prosecution  evidence  but  also  defence
evidence of 23 witnesses, has rightly fixed the  amount  of  expenditure  to
the tune of Rs.3 Crores. It is even conceded that  a  total  expenditure  of
Rs.2 to 3 Crores has been spent for the  marriage.  According  to  him,  the
Trial Court has rightly disbelieved the evidence of DW’s  who  claimed  that
the party workers have collected funds and have spent for expenses  such  as
façade, decoration, food etc. It  is  unbelievable  that  a  person  of  the
stature of A1, would allow her party workers to spend  on  the  marriage  of
her foster son. He elaborated that though  A1  has,  in  her  reply  to  the
notice to the Income Tax Department,  claimed  that  A2  has  spent  amounts
under different heads, A2 has failed to account for the same.



Mr. Acharya submitted that according to the prosecution the total income  of
the accused is Rs.9,34,26,054/- and   according  to  the  Trial  Court,  the
total income is Rs.9,91,05,094.75/-. However, according to the  High  Court,
the total income is Rs.34,76,65,654/-. In coming  to  this  conclusion,  the
High Court added to the income seven items such as :

|S.No.   |Description                         |Amount                |
|1.      |Loans as income                     |18,17,46,000          |
|2.      |Income from grape garden            |46,71,600             |
|3.      |Gifts                               |1,50,00,000           |
|4.      |Sasi Enterprises                    |25,00,000             |
|5.      |Jaya Publications and Namadhu MGR   |4,00,00,000           |
|6.      |Super Duper TV Pvt.Ltd.             |1,00,00,000/-         |
|7.      |Rental Income                       |3,22,000/-            |



According to Mr. Acharya, there is no lawful source so far as  the  Gift  is
concerned. He further submitted that the Trial Court has rightly  disallowed
the claim. The High Court has erroneously fixed it at Rs.4 crores  based  on
belatedly filed Income Tax returns, which even if accepted, amounts to  only
Rs.1.15 Crores.



Therefore, he submitted that if the  above  is  the  correct  position,  the
conclusion of the Trial Court is fully  justified.  According  to  him,  the
Trial Court has considered every contention raised by  the  accused  and  if
some of the contentions are not urged  before  the  Trial  Court,  then  the
respondent  cannot  complain  before  this  Court  about   non-consideration
thereof.



He further contended that if  the  contention  of  the  appellants  that  in
calculating Disproportionate Assets, the value of  the  Assets,  Expenditure
and Income of all the Accused have to be taken jointly along  with  that  of
firms and companies (34 in number), as done by both the courts  below,  then
the explanation offered in the individual  chart  of  A1  and  the  combined
chart given by A2 to A4 will be of no effect and the same do not deserve  to
be taken note of. The accused have  deliberately  given  their  explanations
separately as they cannot give any satisfactory explanation  if  the  assets
are taken jointly.



In refutation, learned senior counsel appearing for A1  submitted  that  the
Trial Court wrongly excluded from consideration the  Income  Tax  Assessment
Orders in favour of the accused by relying upon the judgment of  High  Court
of Patna in 
State of Bihar Vs. Lalu Prasad &  Anr.
,  (2008)  Crl.L.J.  2433,
which, according to him, is clearly inapplicable since the order  passed  by
the Patna High Court was  in  the  nature  of  an  interlocutory  order.  He
further stated that while dealing with the  assets  of  A1  under  the  head
“Additional Construction”, the Trial Court by an arbitrary  method  deducted
20% from the  overall  cost  of  construction.  Similarly,  in  relation  to
marriage expenditure, the Trial Court  erroneously  estimated  the  cost  of
construction of a thatched pandal and arbitrarily  came  to  the  conclusion
that the marriage expenditure was to the tune of Rs.3 crores, for  which  no
basis has been given, according to  him.  He  further  contended  that  with
regard to the possession of gold and jewellery,  although  the  Trial  Court
accepted that A1 had 7040 gms. in 1987-1988, as reflected in the Wealth  Tax
Assessment order, it overlooked the other Wealth Tax Assessment  orders  for
the subsequent years whereby there was an addition  of  Rs.2,51,59,144/-  in
the holdings of A1, which is also contrary to the  evidence  on  record.  He
further submitted that the Trial Court and the prosecution  have  failed  to
take into account the income from  Grape  Garden,  interest  income,  rental
advance, rental income, wealth tax  refund,  income  from  gifts,  Partner’s
drawings of A1 from Jaya Publications and income from  Namadhu  MGR  scheme,
etc.

Learned senior counsel submitted that  the  Trial  Court,  contrary  to  the
settled law, has required the public servant to offer an explanation to  the
properties held by A2 to A4 and  the  companies,  without  any  foundational
basis or any evidence to show that those properties in the names  of  A2  to
A4 or companies were acquired out of the resources of A1 or that  there  was
any flow of fund from A1 to  A2  to  A4.  The  Trial  Court  has  sought  to
attribute criminal conspiracy between A1 and A2 to A4  on  the  sole  ground
that A1 to A4 were living in the same house under a common roof.




He  further  contended  that  in  a  disproportionate   assets   case,   the
prosecution has to discharge the initial burden to prove that the assets  of
the accused were disproportionate  to  the  known  sources  of  income.  The
prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt, the value of the  assets
possessed by the accused and it has  a  further  burden  to  show  that  the
properties which were standing in the name of third parties, like A2  to  A4
and the companies, were being held benami for the public servant.  Once  the
prosecution discharges this initial  burden  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the
onus then shifts to the accused to satisfactorily account for the source  of
such income. He further contended that for  the  accused,  the  standard  of
proof is one based on preponderance of probabilities and  it  is  sufficient
for the accused to provide a plausible explanation that is  satisfactory  to
the Court. In support of his contention, the learned senior  counsel  relied
upon the following decisions:

V.D. 
Jhingan Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh
 - (
1966) 3 SCR 736

State of Maharashtra Vs. Wasudeo Ramchandra Kaidalwar
 - (1981) 3 SCC 199

Mr. Krishna Reddy Vs. State, Deputy Superintendent of  Police,  Hyderabad  -
(1992) 4 SCC 45

Amba Lal Vs. Union of India - (
1961) 1 SCR 933

K. Veeraswami Vs. Union of India & Ors.
 - (1991) 3 SCC 655

Prithipal Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. - (2012) 1 SCC 10



He further contended that in  establishing  the  link  between  the  alleged
benamdar and the public servant, the standard of proof  required  is  direct
evidence or circumstantial evidence of a clinching nature, which has  to  be
strictly discharged by adducing legal evidence of a definite  character.
  He
further  relied  upon  the  decisions  of  this  Court  in  Jaydayal  Poddar
(deceased) through L.Rs. & Anr. Vs.  Mst.  
Bibi  Hazara,  (1974)  1  SCC  3,
Krishnanand Agnihotri (supra), 
Valliammal (D) by  L.Rs.  Vs.  Subramaniam  &
Ors.
, (
2004) 7 SCC 233, and  Heirs  of  Vrajlal  J.  Ganatra  Vs.  Heirs  of
Parshottam S. Shah
, (1996) 4 SCC 490.




The learned senior counsel, next dwelt upon the purport of “income  received
from any lawful source” and drew our attention to 
Section  13(1)(e)
  of  the
1988 Act, which reads as follows:

13. Criminal misconduct by a public servant – (1) A public servant  is  said
to commit the offence of criminal misconduct,-



xxx              xxx              xxx              xxx


(e) if he or any person on his behalf, is in possession or has, at any  time
during the period of his office, been in possession  for  which  the  public
servant cannot satisfactorily account, of pecuniary  resources  or  property
disproportionate to his known sources of income.



Explanation.- For the purposes of this section, “known  sources  of  income”
means income received from any lawful  source  and  such  receipt  has  been
intimated in accordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders  for
the time being applicable to a public servant.”



He further contended that the term “income” which has been used  in  
Section
13(1)(e)
, would include all earnings, sources whereof are not prohibited  by
law and it is always open to the accused to prove  those  other  sources  of
income which have not been taken into account or brought  into  evidence  by
the prosecution. The term “income”, according to  him,  would  also  include
receipts in the form of “gifts” and “loans” which  have  been  disclosed  to
and accepted by the income tax authorities. He further pointed out that  the
concept of ‘known sources of income’ is not  confined  only  to  the  source
known to the prosecution  but  every  other  source  of  income   which  the
accused is able to establish during the course of trial. In support  of  the
said contention, he relied upon the following decisions of this Court:

C.S.D. Swami Vs. The State
 - (1960) 1 SCR 461

P. Nallammal & Anr. Vs. State - (1999) 6 SCC 559

Krishnanand Agnihotri (supra)

M. Krishna Reddy (supra)



According to the learned senior counsel, income tax/wealth tax  returns  and
assessment orders, being public documents, are admissible  in  evidence.  He
further submitted that this Court has also accepted the  income  tax  orders
while deciding the cases under the 1988 Act. This Court has relied upon  the
following decisions:


Mohd. Mumtaz Vs. Nandini Satpathy (II
) - (
1987) 1 SCC 279

State of M.P. Vs. Mohanlal Soni
 - (
2000) 6 SCC 338

Ananda Bezbaruah Vs. UOI
 - (1994) Crl.L.J. 12, para 8-14

M. Krishna Reddy (supra)


State of A.P. Vs. J. Satyanarayana
, JT 2000 (10) SC 430

DSP, Chennai Vs. K. Inbasagaran, (2006) 1 SCC 420

Kedari Lal Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors., (2015) 14 SCC 505



On the basis of above, the learned senior counsel submitted that  under  the
1988  Act  the  burden  on  the  accused  is  proved  by  preponderance   of
probabilities as in a civil case and same is the degree  of  proof  required
under  the  
Income  Tax  Act
  also.  Therefore,  where  the   assessee   had
established the income and the extent of the expenditure before  the  Income
Tax authorities, the judicial decision thereunder would be  binding  on  the
prosecution in a case under the 1988  Act.  Hence,  he  submitted  that  the
judgment of the Trial Court on this question is wrong.




Having regard to the various evaluations relied upon by the prosecution,  as
he mentioned that in law,  the  expert  evidence  is  an  exception  to  the
hearsay rule under 
Section 46
 of the  Evidence  Act.  An  expert  is  not  a
witness to a fact. His evidence therefore must be based  on  verifiable  and
reliable data and an expert witness has to give an opinion  with  certainty.
He relied on the judgment of this Court  in  
State  of  H.P.  Vs.  Jai  Lal
,
(1999) 7 SCC  280  and  other  decisions.  He  further  submitted  that  the
evidentiary value of prevaricating witnesses is to be rejected.
 
He  relied
upon the case of 
Suraj Mal Vs. State
 (1979) 4 SCC 725.




Learned senior counsel further submitted that the  Court  cannot  set  up  a
third case which is not the  basis  of  prosecution  case  or  that  of  the
accused. He further contended that without making a company an accused,  its
property cannot be forfeited. He further  contended  that  A1’s  income  and
expenditure have been accepted by the Income Tax  authorities  for  all  the
five years of the check period. In none of the assessment years  any  income
is assessed as from an unexplained source. Same is the position  as  regards
Jaya Publication and for A2 also, and those orders have  been  exhibited  in
evidence. He further submitted that A1 had no  disproportionate  assets  but
her likely savings were to the extent of  Rs.67,72,128.54.  The  prosecution
has valued all the assets belonging to A1 to A4 and the 32  firms/companies,
in a sum of Rs.66,65,20,395/-. The value of the assets held by  them  before
the check period was  assessed  at  Rs.2,01,83,957/-.  The  assets  acquired
during the check period  is  Rs.64,42,89,616/-.  The  value  of  the  assets
acquired by A1 alone as per DVAC is Rs.24,29,40,490/-.



However, it is A1’s case that the assets acquired  (including  construction)
by A1 during check period amounted to Rs.6,52,34,410.00 for  which  she  had
satisfactorily explained out of her  known  sources  of  income.  The  major
heads  of  assets  and  the  errors  committed  by  the  Trial  Court   were
highlighted as hereunder:

A1 acquired only one property during the entire check  period.  It  is  vide
Exhibit P1 for Rs.10,00,000/- shown as item 18 in Annexure-II. She made  two
constructions, a Farm House at  Jeedimetla  Village  near  Hyderabad  and  a
construction at 31-A Poes Garden and renovated her residential  building  at
36 Poes Garden.



Vis-à-vis new and additional constructions, Mr. L.  Nageswara  Rao,  learned
senior counsel (as he then was) submitted that according to the  prosecution
the total cost  was  Rs.13,65,31,901/-  and  according  to  the  accused  as
determined by the Income Tax authorities it is Rs.3,62,47,700/-.  Hence,  he
submitted that  deduction  of  Rs.10,02,84,201/-  is  required.  He  further
pointed out that there are fundamental defects in the  prosecution  evidence
in relation to the valuation of all the construction because measurement  is
not verifiable, age of the building is not given,  there  is  no  basis  for
calculating  the  price  of   non-scheduled  items.  As  per   prosecution’s
calculation the cost under the head  new/additional  construction  in  Grape
Garden Farm  House  is  Rs.6,40,33,901/-  while  as  per  A1  this  cost  is
Rs.1,39,62,300/-. Therefore, he submitted that an amount of Rs.5,00,71,601/-
  should be deducted.



According to the learned senior counsel, the prosecution has examined  PW-98
M. Velayudam, PWD Engineer (Vol.4 Page 148-179) and marked his Report Exh.P-
645 (Vol.33 Page 86-112).  He submitted that the evidence  of  PW-98  should
be rejected since there are three major defects in his evidence. He  further
pointed out that his report is unreasoned and cannot be  relied  upon.   The
entire evaluation of electrical appliances  by  Mr.  Udaya  Suriyan,  Asstt.
Electrical   Engineer,   amounting   to   Rs.41,53,653/-   (Exh.P-645)    is
inadmissible in evidence as this expert has not been examined as a  witness.
 He further submitted that the defence evidence  has  not  been  taken  into
account by the Trial Court. He further contended  that  the  calculation  of
the prosecution under the head ‘New/Additional Construction  at  residential
buildings at 31-A and 36  Poes  Garden’  is  Rs.7,24,98,000/-  (Trial  Court
Judgment – Page 1709 of  Vol.VII),  whereas  the  valuation  as  per  A1  is
Rs.2,14,35,4000/-.   Accordingly,   he   submitted   that   an   amount   of
Rs.5,10,62,600/- is to be deducted from the said amount.



He submitted that the prosecution has relied mainly on the evidence  of  PW-
116 Jayapal, PWD Executive Engineer  (appear  at  Vol.5  Page  41)  and  the
report prepared by him i.e. Exh.P-671 (Vol. 35 Page 16-47) to arrive  at  an
erroneous  calculation  of  Rs.7,24,98,000/-.  According  to   the   learned
counsel, there are several infirmities in the report Exh.P-671  as  well  as
deposition of PW-116. He also raised dispute with regard  to  the  valuation
of electrical lay outs being Exh.P-2152 submitted by PW-220. He also  relied
on the evidence of DW-78 –  R.  Raviraj,  Executive  Engineer  (Vol.91  Page

212). He further  contended  that  the  total  expenditure  incurred  by  A1
towards construction was accepted by the Income Tax authorities  after  deep
and pervasive  scrutiny.  He  also  submitted  that  the  total  expenditure
incurred by A1 in the entire three constructions amount to only as under:

      Renovation of 36 Poes Garden           Rs. 76,74,900/-



      Construction at 31-A Poes Garden  Rs.1,35,10,500/-



      Hyderabad Farm House addition     Rs.1,39,62,300/-



      Compound Wall for Hyderabad       Rs. 11,00,000/-



Farm House                        ________________

                 Total            Rs.3,62,47,700/-


whereas the prosecution has wantonly inflated the expenditure in  a  sum  of
Rs.13,65,31,901/-.   Therefore,   there   has   to    be    deduction     of
Rs.10,02,84,201/- from the  Annexure-II  which  denotes  the  value  of  the
assets during the check period.



He further submitted that the prosecution has shown the  DVAC  valuation  of
golden jewellery acquired by A1 during the check period as  Item  286,  288,
289, 290 & 291 to Rs.5,14,19,462.25.  The  learned  senior  counsel  further
pointed out that the Trial Court’s valuation of gold jewellery  acquired  by
A1 during the check period is  Rs.2,51,59,144/-. With  regard  to  the  gold
jewellery possessed by A1, Mr. Rao submitted that the total jewellery as  on
31.3.1991 which was 21.280.300, was valued at Rs.1,50,56,146/- and there  is
no addition to the jewellery in that year. The above figure was  arrived  at
on the basis of increase  in  value  of  gold  and  as  per  report  of  the
registered valuer being Exh.P-860. Therefore, it is indisputable and as  per
the prosecution  document  above-mentioned,  being  Exh.  P-2180,  and  also
wealth tax assessment orders and evidence of PW-227 and PW-213, it would  be
evident from Exh. P-1016, Vol.57, Page 186-187,  the  total  gold  jewellery
owned and possessed by A2 as on 31.3.1991 was 1,912.150 gms. Therefore,  the
total jewellery comes to about 23,192.450 gms.  It is  further  stated  that
A1 in her capacity as General Secretary of the AIADMK Party,  got  3,365.800
gms.  of gold Mementos which should be added to the total holding of A1  and
A2. From Exh.P-704, Vol. 36, at 253-292, it would be evident that the  total
weight of the gold  jewellery  seized  was  26,902.08  gms.  which  included
mementoes. Therefore, he submitted that there  is  insignificant  difference
of 343.830 gms. According to him this difference might have  arisen  out  of
faulty weighment. He further submitted that the valuation of  the  jewellery
filed in the return before  the  wealth  tax  authorities  did  not  include
mementoes.



He further pointed out that A1 had succeeded in all the  proceedings  before
the Income Tax authorities and her case that the gold jewellery was  already
possessed by her earlier to the  check  period  had  been  accepted  by  the
authorities. Hence, he submitted that the total jewellery to the  extent  of
26,558.250 gms. has been accounted for and  what remains is only  a  balance
of around 343.830 gms. which is meager difference.



The learned senior counsel next pointed out that  416  Kgs.  of  silver  was
seized from A1 during the check period. The value of this  silver  has  been
taken as Rs.20,80,000/- at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per  Kg  as  described  in
Item No.291 of the DVAC Annexre-II  (Vol.1  Page  112).  The  Trial  Court’s
finding is that 416 Kgs of silver is the illegal acquisition  of  A1  during
the check period and the value of this at the rate of Rs.5,000/- per kg,  is
assessed at  Rs.20,80,000/-.



The High Court has also accepted the said valuation.  The  Trial  Court,  in
respect of costly watches, has duly accepted and allowed  the  case  of  the
prosecution while accepting the valuation report and oral  evidence  of  PW-
129 and PW-130.  According to the learned senior counsel,  PW-130  had  been
examined to value 91 watches. His report is Exh.740. He had given the  total
value of 91 watches at Rs.6,87,350/-. However, it would be evident from  the
testimony of these witnesses that they are  not  experts  as  they  have  no
special proficiency on valuation of watches nor do they have  experience  in
evaluating watches. He  further  submitted  that  A1  was  not  required  to
disclose personal effects as it is  exempted  under  
Section  2(14)
  of  the
Income Tax Act.  Hence,  the  amount  of  Rs.15,90,350/-  is  liable  to  be
excluded from the computation of the assets of A1. He  also  submitted  that
the entire amount with regard to footwear and  sarees  has  to  be  excluded
from the assets of A1 since the Trial Court has disbelieved the  version  of
the prosecution.



The learned senior counsel next turned to the expenditure.  Annexure-III  of
DVAC shows that the valuation of expenditure attributable to A1  to  A4  and
the companies during the check period is Rs.11,56,56,833/- and  as  per  the
prosecution the expenditure attributable to  A1  is  Rs.8,98,69,833/-.  A1’s
case was that the expenditure incurred by her during the  check  period  was
Rs.2,49,28,815/.   As  per  the  Trial  Court’s  judgment   its   value   is
Rs.8,49,06,833/- (Page 1542 Vol.VI) and  the  findings  of  the  High  Court
which has been placed before us  is at Pages 889-831.

He  drew  the  attention  of  this  Court  specifically  to  the   following
particulars with regard to the Marriage of Tr. V.N. Sudhakaran:



Prosecution’s  Valuation – Rs.6,45,04,222.00

A1’s case – Expenditure incurred by A1 for the marriage – Rs.28,68,000.00

Value as per Trial Court Judgment – Rs.3,00,00,000  (Page1452-1542 Vol.VI).



Value as per the High Court Judgment – Rs.28,68,000.00 (Pages 889-931)

The Prosecution value of Rs.6,45,04,222.00 was split up by  the  prosecution
itself in Item 226 of Annexure IV as follows:



Expenses   towards   erection   of   marriage   pandal,   over   and   above
admitted/recorded payments – Rs.5,21,23,532/-



Expenditure  towards  cost  of  food,  mineral   water   and   tamboolam   -

            Rs.1,14,96,125/-



Cost of 34 titan watches

 (disallowed by the Trial Court) –           Rs.1,34,565/-


Amount towards stitching wedding

dress for A3                                 Rs.1,26,000/-

Amount for purchase of 100 silver

Plates (paid by N. Sasikala) -               Rs.4,00,000/-

Postal expenses for dispatching

56000 wedding invitations:              Rs.2,24,000/-

                             Total           Rs.6,45,04,222/-


Qua  Marriage  Pandals,  the  prosecution  relied  upon  the   evidence   of
Thangarajan who was examined as PW-181 who specifically stated that  a  huge
pandal had been erected for the marriage and the cost of pandal  itself  was
Rs.5,21,23,532/-.  It  is  submitted  that  the  evidence   of   PW-181   is
unacceptable as it is merely hearsay, speculative, arbitrary  and  based  on
no verifiable data to reach the said amount. Hence, it is submitted  by  the
learned counsel that his evidence ought to be  rejected.  According  to  A1,
she had spent a sum of Rs.28,68,000/- which is reflected in  the  orders  of
the Income  Tax  authorities.   The  Trial  Court  has  fixed  this  sum  at
Rs.3,00,00,000/- towards the expenditure for marriage. According to  learned
senior counsel appearing for A1, the  prosecution  has  not  discharged  its
burden in respect of the quantum of expenditure for the marriage as well  as
the cost which was borne by A1.   According  to  the  learned  counsel,  the
prosecution neither could establish the cost  of  construction  of  marriage
pandal nor it led any evidence to show that  A1  incurred  any  expenditure.
Hence, the amount of Rs.5.21 crores cannot be said to have been  established
by the prosecution and hence the entire amount is  liable  to  be  deducted.
The prosecution has not proved the entire item 226  in  Annexure-II.  Hence,
the entire amount of Rs.6,45,04,222/- is liable to be excluded.



Learned counsel further pointed out  that  the  Income  Tax  Department  had
accepted the version of A1 that she had  incurred  only  an  expenditure  of
Rs.29.81 lakhs, all by cheques except for a sum of Rs.3.1  lakhs.  According
to him, at the most, Rs.29,66,552/- is  to  be  added   in  respect  of  the
expenditure incurred by A1.  According to him, the  findings  of  the  Trial
Court cannot be accepted to the tune of Rs.3 crores towards the  expenditure
for marriage. On the contrary, the High Court has rightly accepted the  case
of the accused.



The Trial Court and the  High  Court  have  calculated  the  combined  total
income of A1 to A4 and we find that no appeal has been filed by A1 to A4  in
respect thereof.  Therefore, we at this stage, make it clear that  we  would
adopt the same yardstick in respect of the combined income of A1 to  A4,  in
absence of any persuasive reason to the contrary.



In re, income from Grape Garden, it appears  that  that  the  difference  in
estimated  Grape  Garden  income  between  the   prosecution   and   A1   is
Rs.46,71,660/-. The prosecution has cited the income from the  Grape  Garden
during  the  check  period  to  the  extent  of  Rs.5,78,340/-  instead   of
Rs.52,50,000/- as computed by A1. While the Trial Court has  concurred  with
the prosecution, the High Court has accepted the case of A1 and  allowed  an
addition to the extent of Rs.46,71,660/- in respect  of  the  income  of  A1
from Grape Garden.  It is further submitted that the agricultural income  of
Rs.52,50,000/- requires to be taken as income available  to  A1  during  the
check period. According to the learned senior counsel, A1 has  fully  proved
the receipt of agricultural income and the  High  Court  has  also  accepted
this.



With regard to the interest income of A1, the prosecution  has  allowed  the
same to the extent of Rs.58,90,925/- instead of  Rs.77,40,135/-  as  claimed
by A1  on  the  basis  of  amounts  declared  and  assessed  in  Income  Tax
Returns/Assessment  orders.   The  Trial  Court  has  concurred   with   the
prosecution and disallowed interest income of A1 amounting to Rs.18,49,210/-
.



According to  A1,  the  rental  income  was  Rs.2,32,000/-  per  annum  from
1.7.1991 to 30.4.1996, at the rate of Rs.4,000/- per month, in  relation  to
the property in St. Mary’s Road, Chennai.  It  is  also  accepted  that  the
Income Tax return could not  be filed for the year 1.4.1992 to 31.3.1993.



The claim of A1 is that the amount of gifts received by her on the  occasion
of  her  44th   birthday   was   Rs.2,15,00,012/-(cash   and   drafts)   and
Rs.77,52,059/- (foreign remittance) and this entire amount is to be  allowed
as income. He has submitted that the prosecution has  admitted  the  receipt
of the gift, it having been contemporaneously banked, but the  amounts  were
not taken into account as income or lawful resource  available  to  A1.  The
Trial Court has disallowed it in entirety. However, the High Court  accepted
the case of A1 and reduced the  amount  of  Rs.1,50,00,000/-  received  from
gift.  It is submitted that the said income ought to have  been  taken  into
consideration by the Trial Court.



Learned senior counsel further submitted that gift has  been  recognized  as
valid source of income by this Court in its judicial pronouncements  and  he
relied upon the case of M. Krishna Reddy (supra)  and  Kedari  Lal  (supra).
It is further pointed out that A1 had received an amount  of  Rs.6,28,569.00
from Sasi Enterprises in her capacity as partner  during  the  check  period
which was not repaid by A1 to M/s. Sasi Enterprises, thereby treating it  as
her drawings as a partner of the said firm.



It is further pointed out that A1 had received a loan  of  Rs.1,53,03,000.00
from A2 and her proprietary firms.  Jaya  Publication  was  started  in  the
year 1988. At the relevant time, A1 and A2 were the only  partners.  It  was
carrying on business of printing and was running a  daily  newspaper  called
Namadhu MGR. This daily newspaper used to carry  all  the  announcements  of
the  General  Secretary  as  also  all  the  AIADMK  Party’s   news.    Jaya
Publication apart from its regular business income had also  received  money
through subscribers deposit schemes.  It is submitted that with  a  view  to
boost the circulation and the readership of the newspaper,  the  subscribers
scheme was started one year earlier to the check period.  Under  the  scheme
any person could make a deposit of Rs.12,000/-,  15,000/-  or  18,000/-  and
the subscribers would receive  4,  5,  or  6  copies  daily  free  of  cost,
according to the deposit he made. The deposit  was  refundable  on  15  days
notice of demand.



To establish the receipt under the said deposit scheme, A1  produced  Income
Tax returns and independent evidence from  subscribers  to  probabilise  and
prove receipt of money.  The money received under the scheme  from  1990  to
1996 was deposited in the bank account of Namadhu MGR or in the  account  of
Jaya Publication.  It is submitted that the Income Tax authorities  accepted
the said scheme of deposit. According to the learned senior  counsel,  there
was a scrutiny of the account of Jaya Publication  and  Namadhu  MGR  by  an
internal auditor of the prosecution department and a report was  filed.  Yet
the auditor was not examined nor his report was marked in  evidence.  It  is
submitted  that  an  adverse  inference  ought  to  be  drawn  against   the
prosecution evidence on account of suppression  of  the  material  evidence.
It is submitted that the Trial Court committed glaring errors while  dealing
with the scheme deposit claim of  Jaya  Publication.   The  learned  counsel
submitted that the  accused  had  produced  the  order  of  the  Income  Tax
authorities relating to the scheme deposit covering the entire check  period
of 5 years which was overlooked by the Trial Court. According  to  him,  the
drawing of A1 from Jaya Publication in  her  capacity  as  partner  of  Jaya
Publication, to the extent of Rs.34,92,000/- is proper  and  lawful.  It  is
further submitted that A1 received from Jaya Publication Rs.24,75,000/-  and
further amount spent by Jaya Publication on behalf of  A1  for  construction
of residence at 36, Poes Garden, Chennai, at  Rs.76,74,900/-.  The  evidence
was placed before the Court, being Exh.D-226 and the  deposition  of  DW-88.
Therefore,  the  total  of  the  above  two  items  in  aggregate  comes  to
Rs.1,01,49,900/-. It is further submitted that the loan from Can  Fin  Homes
is about Rs.75,00,000/- which was availed as loan  from  Can  Fin  Homes  on
29.9.1992. The loan was also repaid by Jaya Publication on behalf of  A1  on
27.3.1995 and the same was not repaid by A1  to  Jaya  Publication,  thereby
treating it as her drawings as  a  partner  of  Jaya  Publication.    It  is
submitted that the entire amount of Rs.13,89,19,475.00 is also the  resource
available to A1 and A2 for offering an explanation under the 1988 Act.



Referring to the attribution of assets of A2 to A4, six companies and  other
firms to A1, the learned senior counsel contended that the  prosecution  has
included the properties acquired by the following companies to  the  account
of A1 and the value of all the properties has been  included  in  the  total
assets.

|S.No. |NAME OF THE COMPANY                 |DATE OF           |
|      |                                    |INCORPORATION     |

|2.    |Meadow Agro Mills Ltd.              |11.10.1990        |
|3.    |Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd.              |28.05.1986        |
|4.    |Riverway Agro Pvt. Ltd.             |22.10.1990        |
|5.    |Indo Doha Chemicals and             |02.01.1990        |
|      |Pharmaceuticals Ltd.                |                  |
|6.    |Signora Business Enterprises Ltd.   |22.10.1990        |



The properties held by  all  the  above  companies  have  been  computed  in
Annexure-II by the prosecution in a sum of Rs.4,70,24,439/-.



According to the learned senior counsel, the companies  assets  required  to
be excluded.  He urged that A1 was neither a shareholder nor a  director  or
associate of these six companies. Therefore, it is submitted that  there  is
no justification to attribute the properties of the  companies  to  A1.  For
these reasons, he submitted that the  property  of  the  company  cannot  be
included in the holding of A1 requiring her to give an  explanation.  Hence,
it is submitted that all the properties acquired by and constructed  by  the
said companies are liable to be  excluded  totally  from  consideration  and
thus a total amount of  Rs.4,70,24,439/- is liable to be excluded.



The  learned  senior  counsel  submitted  that  conspiracy,  though  can  be
inferred from circumstances, in this case, the mere fact that A1 to A4  were
residing in the house belonging to A1 cannot  be  a  circumstance  to  prove
conspiracy.  According to him, A1 and A2 were partners  in  two  partnership
firms  and  such  partnership  connection   cannot   be   an   incriminating
circumstance. According to him, A1 to  A4  have  purchased  properties  with
their own efforts, with the money earned or mobilized by them.  Accordingly,
it is submitted that the prosecution has not  established  any  circumstance
from  which  an  inference  of  conspiracy  can  be  drawn.  There   is   no
circumstance proved in this case by the prosecution from which a  conclusion
can be drawn that there was meeting of minds of A1 to  A4  with  a  view  to
enable A1 to commit an offence under 
Section 13(1)(e)
 of the  1988  Act.  He
further submitted that during the check period, starting of a firm by a non-
public servant could never be a circumstance by itself to infer  conspiracy.
Hence, it is submitted that there is no direct or indirect evidence  in  the
form of proved circumstance to infer  conspiracy.  Hence,  it  is  submitted
that the judgment of the High Court should be affirmed.



Mr.  Shekhar  Naphade,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  on  behalf   of
respondent Nos.2 to 4 submitted that the abstract of Annexures-I to VII  are
assets relating to A2 to A4, firms & companies and he drew our attention  to
the said Annexures.  According to him, the properties acquired by A2 to  A4,
firms & companies prior to the check period as per DVAC, would  appear  from
the following chart:

 The judgment of the High Court at page 966 reveals  that  it  has  for  the
purposes  of  computation,  accepted  the  value  of  the  assets   of   the
respondents at the end of the check period to be Rs.66,44,73,537/- as  noted
by the prosecution.  Further, though it has reduced the value of the  assets
vis-a-vis  item  Nos.1,  2,  3,  10  and  11  out  of  the   12   categories
aforementioned, it  essentially  caused  modification,  in  quantifying  the
value of assets, with regard   to  item  number  3,  pertaining  to  new  or
additional  construction  of  buildings.   As  would  be  evident  from  its
rendering,  it  assessed  the  value  of  this  item  of   assets,   to   be
Rs.5,10,54,060/-  compared  to  Rs.28,17,40,430/-  as   mentioned   by   the
prosecution.  It thus reduced the value of the assets by  Rs.23,06,86,370/-.
 While making the calculations, however the High Court  took  the  value  of
the cost of construction as cited by the prosecution to  be  Rs.27,79,88.945
and on the basis of its assessment of the value of  the  new  or  additional
construction of buildings at Rs.5,10,54,060/-, it effected  a  reduction  of
Rs.22,69,34,885/-.  According to the prosecution even if this  valuation  of
the new or additional construction of buildings as made by  the  High  Court
is accepted, the other items remaining intact, the total value of assets  of
the respondents at the end of the check period, would  be  Rs.66,44,73,573/-
minus Rs.22,69,34,885/-   = Rs.43,75,38,688.



 According to it, thus while computing the  percentage  of  disproportionate
assets qua the income of the respondents, this figure  ought  to  have  been
applied in the  relevant formula.



 Noticeably, the valuation of the assets except as cited by the  prosecution
at serial numbers  1, 2, 3, 10 and 11 has been accepted by the  High  Court.
Nevertheless, while computing the value of the assets finally,  it  did  not
take into account as well its evaluation in respect of item  numbers  1,  2,
10 and 11 and limited its consideration only to item number 3 which  it  had
valued at Rs.5,10,54,060/-.



 Thus in the above revealing perspective, it is  not  considered   essential
to scrutinise the evidence on the assets pertaining  to  all  items  thereof
and it would be adequate enough to limit the audit only qua  item  number  3
i.e. new or additional construction of buildings, more particularly  because
of its decisive bearing on the adjudication.



 In the above premise, being of crucial relevance, evidence with  regard  to
the item number three namely; new or additional  construction  of  buildings
in the list of assets  demands scrutiny.  As mentioned  hereinabove,  though
the High Court had altered the value of five out of twelve   items,  in  the
ultimate quantification, it did focus only on the item of new or  additional
construction  of  buildings  and  computed   the   worth   thereof   to   be
Rs.5,10,54,060/- against Rs.22,53,92,344/-  adjudged  by  the  Trial  Court.
According to the prosecution, however, the  investment  on  this  count  had
been Rs.28,17,40,430/-.  Significantly, the  respondents  had   valued  this
item of their assets at  Rs.8,60,59,261/-   which  is  about  Rs.3.5  crores
above the valuation made by the High Court.



  Be that as it may, whereas the  prosecution  had  listed  out  twenty  one
items under the head new or additional construction of buildings, the  Trial
Court took note of  eighteen items and the High Court of seventeen items  as
would be adverted to in details hereafter. The total  construction  area  of
these twenty one items, according  to  the  prosecution  is   23,076.84  sq.
meters which is equivalent to 2483.97 squares.  The area of four items  left
out by the High Court when deducted from the total area of  2483.97  squares
calculate to 2174.69 squares. However, the High Court computed the value  by
adopting the area of the 17 items selected  by  it  to  be  1668.39  squares
instead  of  2174.69  squares  and  thus  reduced  the  actual  area   under
consideration by 506.3 squares. Ergo,  according  to  the  prosecution,  not
only did the High Court exclude four out of twenty one  items  in  assessing
the value of  the  assets  under  examination,  it  erred  as  well  on  the
resultant area corresponding to the seventeen items chosen by it.  This  did
also impact upon the value eventually arrived at.



 In course of the arguments before this Court, emphasis  has  been  laid  on
item numbers 179, 180 and 181 of annexure  II  i.e.   buildings/construction
on which investments had been made to sum up the  total  to  the  figure  of
Rs.29,35,68,982/-  according  to  the   prosecution.    According   to   the
respondent No. 1, as against  the  figure  of  Rs.24,29,40,490/-  being  the
value  of  her  assets  during  the  check  period,  as  computed   by   the
prosecution, her assertion is of Rs.6,52,34,410/-.  It  has  been  urged  on
her behalf that she had acquired only one property during the  entire  check
period i.e. the item at serial number 18 in anneuxre II  worth  Rs.10  lakhs
and in addition thereto, she had made  two  constructions  i.e.  of  a  farm
house at Jeedimetla  Village  near  Hyderabad  and  at  31-A,  Poes  Garden,
besides renovating her residential building  at  36,  Poes  Garden.  Against
item numbers 179 and 181 referred  to  hereinabove,  it  has  been  asserted
that as against Rs.13,65,31,901/- assessed by the prosecution, the value  of
her  assets  corresponding  thereto  and  as  accepted  by  the  income  tax
authorities is Rs.3,62,47,700/-  and thus  an  amount  of  Rs.10,02,84,201/-
needs to be deducted. The break up of  expenditure on  the  relevant  counts
towards these items has been provided as hereinbelow:



a)  Renovation of 36 Poes Garden  :          Rs.76,74,900


b) Construction at 31-A, Poes Garden :       Rs.1,35,10,500


c)   Hyderabad   Grape   Garden   Farm    House    :          Rs.1,39,62,300



d) Compound wall for Hyderabad Farm House :  Rs.11,00,000

                             Total                       Rs.3,62,47,700/-



 While endeavouring to authenticate the above figure,  the  deficiencies  in
the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  relating  to  the  valuation   of   the
constructions have been highlighted  in quite some  details.   Broadly,  the
denunciation qua the process related thereto, refers to  the  non-verifiable
measurements  in  absence  of  essential  datas  and  want   of   supporting
particulars in the reports rendering them sterile  and  worthless  being  of
no  probative  worth,  absence  of  any  scientific   or  laboratory   tests
convincingly demonstrating the age of the buildings to correctly  appreciate
the value thereof, absence of any basis for calculating the  price  of  non-
scheduled  items  etc.  Vis-a-vis  the  price  of  non-scheduled  items   in
particular, it has been asseverated that  though  the  valuers  had  deposed
that with regard thereto, market enquires had been made and the inputs   had
been recorded in a paper or a note book, the same had not been retained  but
destroyed  and  were  not  enclosed  with  the  corresponding  reports.  The
assessment of the price of the non-scheduled items has thus  been  dismissed
to be not only as being bereft of any foundation but also as  mere  hearsay.



 The oral evidence of the prosecution witnesses namely;  PW-98,  PW-116  and
PW-220, amongst others, has been referred to and  analysed  apart  from  the
reports submitted by the inspection team which as adverted  to  hereinabove,
have  been  repudiated  to  be  lacking  in   indispensable   datas.   Other
documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution  has also been  dealt  with.
Evidence of defence witnesses,  amongst  others  of  DW-64,  S.  Shanmugham,
Chartered Accountant of R1/A1, DW-76 who was a part of the  inspection  team
and DW-78 who was one of the signatories to the report Ex.  P-671  has  been
highlighted.  Considerable emphasis has also been laid on the orders of  the
income  tax  authorities  by  way  of  corroboration  of  the   quantum   of
expenditure cited by the defence. This is more particularly  as  the  income
tax authorities had accepted the figure cited by the respondent  No.1/A1  on
the basis of independent enquiries conducted by the department  specifically
in respect of the market rates/price  of  the  marbles/granites  during  the
relevant period i.e. 1994-95 to 1996-97.  The  corresponding  invoices  have
also been referred  to  in  the  course  of  arguments.   According  to  the
defence,  the expenditure as shown by respondent No.1/A1  was  supported  by
bank documents, bills,  contemporaneous  vouchers  proved  through   defence
witnesses, which inter alia, establish that  the price  of  the  marble  per
square meter at the relevant time was  between  Rs.100  to  Rs.180  per  sq.
meter as against Rs.5000 per sq. meter to Rs.21000 per sq.  meter  cited  by
the prosecution. While dismissing the valuation offered by  the  prosecution
to be  arbitrarily exaggerated  and inflated, it has  been  asserted    that
though the Trial Court was right    in observing that  the  prosecution  had
not been able to establish the cost of construction in  respect  of  special
items like marble, it erred in accepting the valuation  made  by  it   after
granting only 20% deduction in the overall quantum.  It was pointed  out  as
well that the Trial Court's rejection of the documents  i.e..  D-210  series
pertaining to the price of marbles prevailing during 1995-96  by  construing
the same erroneously to be of subsequent years, was patently flawed. It  has
been urged that the  prosecution  had  failed  to  prove  beyond  reasonable
doubt, the expenditure towards the  construction  of  the  items  under  the
head, new or additional construction of buildings and thus no burden lay  on
the defence to explain  the amount spent towards  the  same.   According  to
the defence, the valuation made by the High  Court  of  the  expenditure  on
such construction is correct and does not merit any interference.



 Per contra, it has been insisted on behalf of the prosecution  that  though
its computation of the expenditure against twenty one items  comprising  the
investments in new or additional construction of buildings  did  sum  up  to
Rs.29,35,68,982/-, the Trial Court taking note of eighteen such  items,  did
quantify the expenditure at  Rs.22,53,92,344/-.  As  sample  instances,  the
prosecution highlighted the expenditure towards  item  numbers  179,180  and
181 of annexure II i.e. the list of items  of  assets  acquired  during  the
check period and referring to the oral testimony of  PW-98,107  and  166  as
well as the reports prepared and submitted by the inspection team  i.e.  Ex.
P-645, P-661 and P-671 maintained that the sum total of expenditure  on  the
basis  thereof  was  Rs.19,05,84,199/-.   Understandably,  this  figure  was
included  in  the  total  expenditure  of  Rs.29,35,68,982/-  and  had  been
highlighted as these three items accounted for  the  major  portion  of  the
investments.



 According to the prosecution, the High Court not only limited its  analysis
to seventeen out of twenty one items, it also erred in  the  measurement  of
the built up area of  these  items  so  much  so  that  instead  of  2174.69
squares, it proceeded to make the computation on the basis  of  an  area  of
1668.39 squares i.e. yielding a short fall of 506.30 squares.   In  addition
thereto, it has been urged on behalf of the prosecution that the High  Court
appraised the expenditure towards new and additional construction by  taking
only the cost  expended  for  a  sentry  shed  by  totally  overlooking  the
additional and highly expensive  enhancements  and  fixtures   of  the  main
buildings.  According to  the  prosecution,  whereas  as  per  the  evidence
adduced by it, the cost of construction of the new/additional buildings  was
Rs.4037 per  sq.  feet,  the  High  Court  on  the  basis  of  the  cost  of
construction of the sentry shed III adopted  the  rate  of  Rs.680  per  sq.
feet,  as  a  result  whereof  the  actual  cost  of  construction  of   the
new/additional building stood reduced by  83%.   The  prosecution  has  thus
insisted that in quantifying the expenditure  towards  the  construction  of
the new/additional building, the High Court  thus patently erred   not  only
on the actual built up area but also on the  basic rate of cost  by  drawing
an analogy of a sentry  shed   with  the  new/additional  buildings,  though
these two classes of structures with the  inherent  characteristics  thereof
were not comparable by any means.



 As referred to hereinabove,  the  Trial  Court  scrutinized  the  oral  and
documentary evidence of both sides relating to 18  items  of  new/additional
constructions  out  of  21  cited  by  the  prosecution.   It   exhaustively
evaluated the evidence  item  wise  and  weighed  the  merits  and  demerits
thereof  in  details.   It  took  note  of  the  reports  submitted  by  the
inspection team qua every new/additional building  involved  and  also  took
cognizance of the denunciation by  the  defence  thereof  primarily  on  the
ground that those lacked in details and  further  were  not  accompanied  by
supporting documents.  The Trial  Court  appreciated  the  evidence  of  the
prosecution  witnesses  who  were  participants  in  the  exercise  of   the
valuation of the buildings, the ancillary structures, accessories,  fixtures
and furnishings.  The  members  of  the  inspection  team,  who  were  Civil
Engineers drawn from the Public Works Department, in addition to  Electrical
Engineers from Electricity Department, as  their  evidence  noticed  by  the
Trial Court, would demonstrate did  take  into  account  all  the  essential
aspects of the subject matter of survey  including the make and age  of  the
structures and also duly discounted the value thereof  on  depreciation.   A
common feature  of  the  evidence  is  that  the  price  of  the  electrical
appliances mostly was assessed on the basis of their  age and the  expertise
of the officers undertaking the inspection.  Qua  the  non-scheduled  items,
according to the prosecution witnesses, the price was ascertained  from  the
market.  The demur of the defence that such evaluation was not  decisive  in
absence of the notes of the relevant  inputs  was  however  noticed  by  the
Trial Court.  For the general items,   the contemporaneous PWD  schedule  of
rates prevailing in  the  districts  involved  were  applied.   The  defence
witnesses who mostly were the members of the same  team  did  not  radically
differ from the substance of the version of the  prosecution  witnesses.   A
marked attribute of the prosecution witnesses, as noted by the Trial  Court,
was that when examined on their first recall, they seemed  to  vacillate  in
their disclosures  in  the  examination-in-chief  but  reaffirmed  the  same
narration on  their  second  recall.   The  defence  however  noticing  this
demeanour has endeavoured to discredit them as prevaricating and  unfaithful
witnesses.



 As had been elaborately appraised by the Trial Court, the evidence  of  the
prosecution witnesses disclose that the members of the inspection  team  did
minutely notice  all  the  salient  characteristics  of  the  new/additional
buildings under surveillance together with  their  exquisite  and  expensive
structural  attachments,   trappings,   fineries   and   adornments   having
formidable  potential of enhancing their overall worth.



 The Trial Court while taking note of the   income  tax  returns  disclosing
the expenditure statements and the  orders  accepting  the  same  after  the
departmental  inquiries  however  accepted  the  expenditure   towards   the
new/additional buildings to be Rs.22,53,92,344/- by discounting  the  figure
furnished by the prosecution by 20% as according to it, the prosecution  had
not produced convincing evidence in  support  of  the  value  fixed  by  the
Public Works Department engineers in respect of price of the  special  items
and as there was some dispute regarding  the  payments  of  the  architects’
fees.  In arriving at this conclusion, the Trial  Court  did  take  note  of
every objection of the defence  to  the  evaluation  of  the  new/additional
buildings and rejected the same.  In particular, the defence plea  that  the
valuation on plinth rate area ought not  to  have  been  adopted,  was  also
dismissed.  It took note of the evidence of DW-78  that  building  valuation
could be done on the basis of plinth area of the building  or  the  detailed
method.  It was of the firm view that the engineers involved in the  process
of the evaluation of the new/additional buildings  were  competent  for  the
assignment entrusted and that the defence had not disputed  the  measurement
of the buildings and the nature of the constructions as well as the  quality
of the materials used.  It however observed that the prosecution  could  not
produce any direct evidence in proof of the cost of the special  items  used
and had relied on the oral testimony of its witnesses who  had  stated  that
they had ascertained the price of marbles and other special items  from  the
market.



 The defence has tried to demonstrate that the rejection by the Trial  Court
of the invoices Ex.D210 series pertaining  to  marbles  as  proved  by  DW96
construing the same to be the year 1999 was patently erroneous as  the  said
document disclosed that those related to the period between 1994  and  1996.
Be that as it may, the Trial Court however while  rejecting  the  objections
of the defence on the valuation of the new/additional buildings, effected  a
reduction of  20%  of  the  total  estimate  furnished  by  the  prosecution
witnesses for want of persuasive evidence in support of the  recorded  value
fixed by the PWD Engineers in respect of the special items and  the  dispute
regarding  payments  of  architects  fees  and  quantified  the  amount   of
expenditure to be Rs.22,53,92,344/-.



 Noticeably, the exercise undertaken by the inspection team  was  a  massive
one chancing minor shortcomings and from  the  Trial  Court’s  comprehensive
narrative of the evidence on record, in our view, its estimate on the  basis
thereof cannot be said to be perverse.  As  it  is,  having  regard  to  the
nature and size of the survey, insistence on proof beyond  reasonable  doubt
with mathematical  exactitude would be both unwarranted, inexpedient and un-
pragmatic.



 In our comprehension, the appreciation made  by  the  Trial  Court  of  the
evidence on record and the final determination of the extent of  expenditure
incurred cannot be discarded  as absurd or implausible.



 The High Court on the other hand noted the reservations  expressed  by  the
defence  to  the  valuation  made  by  the  prosecution.    It   noted   the
denouncement that the valuation made was highly inflated and that  the  cost
of marbles and granites have been assessed on  a  very  exorbitant  measure.
The remonstrance that neither any sample  of  marble  or  granite  had  been
taken nor tenders had been called for to ascertain  the  rates  thereof  was
recorded.  The objection that forests officers have  not  been  examined  to
price the cost of the wood and that nobody had certified that  the  teakwood
had been used, was accounted for.  The High Court  did  take  cognizance  of
the reference to  the  inquiries  made  by  the  Income  Tax  Department  to
ascertain the prevailing  rates  of  marble  and  marble  slabs  during  the
relevant period.  Defence evidence to that effect was also marked.



 The High Court in the  ultimate  analysis  adopted  the  “per  square  foot
method” in evaluating the value of the new/additional  buildings.  According
to it, the Public Works Department  rates  were  supposedly  higher,  taking
into consideration the delayed payment  and  other  miscellaneous  expenses.
The High Court accepted the  cost  of  construction  of  the  new/additional
buildings to be Rs.28,000/- per square  basing on the rate of   construction
of the Sentry Shed-III.  Referring to the estimate for construction of  such
sentry shed, the High Court deduced that, it was valued for  one  square  at
Rs.31,580/-  and  therefrom  as  a  measure  of  cost  of  construction  for
new/additional building,  it applied  Rs.28,000/- per square  for  the  said
purpose.  It accounted for the other investments towards  super  structures,
windows, doors, internal painting, electrification, flooring,  water  supply
etc.   The  total  constructed  area,  according  to  the  High  Court,  was
1,66,839.68 sq.ft. i.e. 1668.39 squares.  It accepted an  area  of  25662.22
sq.ft. i.e. 256.62 squares as area on which  granites  had  been  used.   It
added an amount of Rs.9,65,060/- towards expenditure for  sanction  of  plan
and architect fees.



 Qua the prosecution evidence, the High Court observed that  though  reports
had been prepared by the inspection team for  the  new/additional  buildings
involved, all the  members  of  inspection  team  did  not  subscribe  their
signatures thereto.  Further in course of the testimony, they did not  speak
anything about the measurement of the floor area where marbles and  granites
had been used.  It held the view that the valuation  reports  by  themselves
did not prove the estimate of  granites  and  marble  stones  and  that  the
appreciation thereof was more or  less  on  guess  work.   By  adopting  the
valuation on square feet method and by applying the rate of Rs.28,000/-  per
square, the High Court computed the value of  new/additional  building  with
all its accessories and furnishings to be Rs.5,10,54,060/-.



 Prima facie thus  the  plea  of  the  prosecution  that  in  assessing  the
expenditure of  new/additional buildings, the High Court had not only  taken
a reduced constructed area of 1668.39 sqs. instead of 2174.69 sqs. (for  the
17 items considered by it), thereby introducing a shortfall of  506.3  sqs.,
it  also  applied  the  rate  of  Rs.28,000/-  per  square  based   on   the
construction cost of a sentry shed, as  the  base  value  to  work  out  the
amount    of    investments     made     towards     the      new/additional
buildings/constructions is borne out by the records.



 The approach of the High Court on both counts in the face of  the  evidence
on record does not commend for acceptance.  By no means,  in  our  estimate,
the High Court could have applied the base value of Rs.28,000/-  per  square
for  quantifying  the  expenditure  incurred  towards  the    new/additional
buildings/ constructions involved.  The adoption of Rs.28,000/-  per  square
as the base value, which is the cost of construction of a sentry  shed,  per
se is erroneous,  having regard to the fact  that  a  sentry  shed  and  the
new/additional constructions/buildings are  incomparable   on  many  counts.
Even if it is assumed, as has been pleaded by  the  defence  that  the  base
value so applied was only  for  appreciating  the  expenditure  towards  the
skeletal framework of the constructions, the  method  adopted  by  the  High
Court in the final  computation  of  the  investments  by  making  lump  sum
additions  towards   cost   of   marbles,   granites/interior   decorations,
staircase, overhead tank  and  other  furnishings,   having  regard  to  the
description of the constructions/buildings does  not  appear  to  be  either
realistic or rational and does not merit affirmation.



 In any case however even assuming that the arithmetic  undertaken   by  the
High Court is correct,  it  having  accepted  the  value  of  assets  to  be
Rs.66,44,73,573/-, the remainder would still value at Rs.43,75,38,688/-.  In
other words, in calculating  the  disproportionate  assets,  the  amount  of
Rs.43,75,38,688/- has to be applied even if there is a  reduction  in  value
of assets by Rs.22,69,34,885/ i.e.  (Rs.29,82,71,254.32 – Rs.5,10,54,060).



 According to  A2 to A4, the valuation of their assets at the  beginning  of
the check period as per the prosecution was Rs.59,29,168/- and according  to
them Rs.63,64,790.60.  At the end of the check period, the  figure  swelled,
as per the prosecution to Rs.37,55,10,354.38,  which  in  their  computation
became Rs.25,03,36,963.40/-. Thus, whereas  the  prosecution  case  is  that
the valuation of their assets acquired by A2 to A4 during the  check  period
was Rs.36,95,81,186.38, it had  been  only  Rs.24,39,72,172.80  as  per  the
estimate of these respondents.



 A2 to A4 have not disputed the prosecution's figure of  Rs.59,29,168/-  and
in fact had added Rs.4,35,622/- being the cash balance   available  with  A2
at that point of time making the  tally  according  to  the  respondents  at
Rs.63,64,790.60.  While commenting on the prosecution's valuation  of  their
assets at the end of the check period at Rs.37,55,10,354.38, A2 to  A4  have
asserted that the properties of six companies; Signora Business  Enterprises
(Private) Limited, Meadow Agro Farms (Private) Limited, Ram Raj  Agro  Mills
(Private) Limited, Riverway Agro Products (Private)  Limited,  Lex  Property
Development (P) Limited and Indo Doha Chemicals and  Pharmaceutical  Limited
being separate legal entities and not  arraigned  as  accused  in  the  case
ought to have been excluded from the corpus  of  assets,  more  particularly
in absence of any evidence that their acquisitions had been  made  with  the
funds provided by the respondents.



 In course of the arguments on  their  behalf,  several  disputed  items  of
assets have been highlighted, accompanied by emphatic assertion that  either
the value attached thereto ought to be excluded  wholly  or  to  the  extent
reduced on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence  relied   upon  by
them.



 A plain perusal of the compilation to  this  effect  reveals  that  broadly
these disputed items can be  categorized  as  “land  and  building,  shares,
acquisition of Indo Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceutical  Ltd.,  new/additional
constructions,  renovation,  vehicles,   fixed   deposits,   jewellery   and
machinery.



 As has been hinted hereinabove, these assets had been classified  under  12
components.  The High Court, though had altered the valuations  in  five  of
these items, it did ultimately limit  its  consideration  to  item  No.  III
(i.e.  new/additional  construction  of  buildings)  and  reduced  the  cost
thereof by  Rs.22,69,34,885.   As  a  corollary,  for  the  purpose  of  the
eventual quantification of the disproportionate assets, the High  Court  did
not consider it essential to invoke  its findings  vis-a-vis  the  remaining
four items on which it had differed from the  Trial  Court.    As  would  be
evident from the chart adduced by the defence, out of Part-B containing  the
disputed items in  Annexure-II  appended  to  the  charge-sheet,  ten  items
thereof i.e. item numbers 6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17  are  claimed   to  have
been acquired prior to the  check  period.   Vis-a-vis  the  other  disputed
items, to reiterate, referring to the oral and documentary evidence, it  has
been urged  that  either the full value as cited by the  prosecution  or  to
the extent, highlighted by them, ought  to  have  been  excluded.   Qua  the
items pertaining to “new/additional constructions”,  the  eventual  plea  is
that the Trial Court though had concluded that the  prosecution  had  failed
to prove the cost of construction, as cited by it, it  erroneously  accepted
the valuation by granting 20% reduction in the overall cost.   According  to
A2 to A4, in view of the failure of the prosecution  to prove  the  cost  of
construction, the entire valuation made by it to this effect ought  to  have
been discarded and the evidence adduced by it  should have been rejected  in
its entirety.



 In course of the elaboration of this salient feature  of  the  disputation,
it has been underlined that there has been non-application of  mind  by  the
Trial Court to the evidence on record in arriving at  its  findings.   Apart
from referring to the oral and documentary  evidence  adduced  by  both  the
parties, reliance has also been placed amongst  others  on  the  income  tax
returns and the  orders  passed  in  connection  therewith.   The  valuation
reports of the buildings submitted by  the  inspection  team,  comprised  of
civil engineers of  the  Public  Works  Department  and  others,  have  been
seriously   repudiated  on  the  ground  of  being  laconical,   incredible,
inchoate  and deficient  in  material  particulars.   The  respondents  have
been particularly critical about the valuation of  electrical  installations
and other items as in their  perception,  those  were  wholly  unfounded  in
absence of standard rates and  corroborative proof  based on market  survey.
 Even the expertise and competence of the members  of  the  inspection  team
offered by the prosecution as witnesses of valuation  has  been  questioned.
The respondents have sought to buttress this plea by examining   as  defence
witnesses, members of the same inspection team.  It has been urged  as  well
that the prosecution could not prove  that all new/additional  constructions
had been built  during the check period.  It has  been  contended  that  the
valuation of the  special  items  i.e.  marbles,  granites,  sanitary  ware,
decorative tiles, teakwood etc.  in absence of any  schedule  of  rates  had
been highly inflated without any contemporaneous documents or  authenticated
proof in  support  thereof.   According  to  the  respondents,  the  defence
witnesses who were members of the  inspection  team   did  not  support  the
conclusions recorded in the reports  rendering  those  wholly  unacceptable.
On smaller items, like vehicles, fixed deposits,  jewellery  and  machinery,
the respondents have  dismissed  the  valuations  made  by  the  prosecution
either on the ground that those had been wrongly  exaggerated  or  had  been
acquired before the check period.



  Apropos  the  above  impeachment,  the  prosecution  has  reiterated   its
valuation of the assets  and  has reconciled to the quantification  made  by
the Trial Court.  It has reiterated that the valuation of the  constructions
had been made by the qualified PWD  engineers  and  that  the  findings  are
elaborately  contained  in  the  valuation  reports,   based  on  exhaustive
inspection of all necessary components of the buildings  surveyed.   It  has
stoutly   refuted the defence plea that the Trial  Court  had  rejected  the
evidence adduced  and has maintained that the discount of  20%  accorded  by
the Trial Court had been due to the several imponderables attendant  on  the
massive exercise undertaken.  It has insisted that in view of  the  superior
quality of marbles and granite  used  in  the  buildings   as  well  as  the
prevalent price of the various  special  items  availed  by  way  of  ornate
enhancements, the cost appreciation made by the Trial Court  was  justified.
That the High  Court  had   wrongly  assessed  the  cost  of  new/additional
buildings at Rs.5,10,54,060 compared to  the  admitted  computation  by  the
respondents at Rs.8,60,59,261 has been underscored as well.



 Qua the other segments of the assets, the prosecution has  underlined  that
the Trial Court had totally excluded the valuation of  sarees  and  footwear
and that had effected considerable reduction in the value of  the  jewellery
and silverwares.  In all, according to the prosecution, though it had  cited
higher value of the assets, it has accepted  the  determination  thereof  as
made by the Trial Court.



 The prosecution has jettisoned the disclosures in the  income  tax  returns
and the orders/opinions expressed thereon by  the  departmental  authorities
as wholly inconsequential.  It has been insisted that enquiries made by  the
income tax authorities even if conducted, those had been ex-parte  in  which
the investigating agency had not been  associated.    In  any  view  of  the
matter, according to the prosecution, the findings  of  the  income  tax  or
wealth tax authorities on the valuation of  the  assets,  neither  bind  the
prosecution nor is of any conclusive relevance for the case and is far  less
final for the criminal court trying the same.  The cavil of the  respondents
that the  civil  engineers  of  the  inspection  team  were  incompetent  to
undertake  the  valuation  work  has  been  emphatically  refuted   by   the
prosecution.  That the High  Court  in  adopting  the  plinth  area  of  the
new/additional buildings had erroneously reduced  the  same  by  50,630  sq.
feet, has been reiterated.  It has been  asserted  as  well  that  the  High
Court had erred in taking into account only five special items by  excluding
the  other  expensive  furnishings/attachments  in  computing  the  cost  of
construction.   In specific terms, the prosecution has been critical of  the
valuation of the Otis lift at Rs.15,000/- and the cost  of  construction  of
staircase, pump and overhead tanks at Rs.40,000/- to be much  on  the  lower
side.  That the untenable attempt of the defence to represent that  ordinary
marble and granite had been issued against expensive versions  thereof,  has
been highlighted as well.



 As indicated hereinabove, the only item apart from the  new  or  additional
construction of buildings forming a major component of assets  is  immovable
properties which the prosecution valued at  Rs.19,77,18,164.70  whereas  the
Trial Court assessed the  same  Rs.20,07,80,246/-.  According  to  the  High
Court, it  computed  the  value  to  be  Rs.6,24,09,120/-.   Noticeably  the
respondents had indicated the  value  of  this  item  as  Rs.16,19,03,301/-.
Significantly though in all, 146 sale deeds were involved qua the  immovable
properties figuring therein, the High Court limited its  attention  only  to
97 such deeds and thus left out from its  consideration,  the  remaining  49
sale deeds, while arriving at its quantification of this item of  the  asset
to be Rs.6,24,09,120/-.



 To reiterate however the High Court though did accept the valuation of  the
assets for the purpose of computation to be Rs.66,44,73,573/- as  valued  by
the prosecution,  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  disproportionate
assets,  it  took  into  account  only  the  cost  of  new   or   additional
construction of buildings as  assessed  by  it  at  Rs.  5,10,54,060/-  thus
reducing the value  thereof  as  made   by  the  prosecution  by  a  sum  of
Rs.22,69,34,885/-.  The omission on the part of the High  Court  to  exclude
the other four items of assets, on which as well  it  had  scaled  down  the
value, in working out the extent of disproportionate assets however had  not
been questioned by the respondents before this Court.  The judgment  of  the
Trial  Court  does  not  demonstrate  as  well,  the  alleged   total   non-
consideration of the evidence adduced on behalf of the respondents.   On  an
overall appraisal of the materials on record, the reduction of the  cost  of
new or additional construction of buildings to Rs.5,10,54,060/- as  effected
by the High Court has to be held as  patently  erroneous.  Consequently  the
quantification of the disproportionate assets is also visibly wrong.



Expenditure

 Annexure IV to the charge-sheet enumerates 244 items of  expenditure  cited
by the prosecution.  This sums up to Rs.11,56,56,833.41  out  of  which  the
major segment being Rs.6,45,04,222/- is towards the expenditure incurred  in
connection with the marriage of Tr. V.N.  Sudhakaran,  (A3)  on  07.09.1995.
Incidentally, the High Court did accept  the  expenditure  assessed  by  the
prosecution in respect of all items  except  item  nos.  2  to  6  i.e.  the
marriage of A3 and reduced the sum of Rs.6,45,04,222/- as fixed by the  DVAC
to Rs.28,68,000/-, thus occasioning a drop of Rs.6,16,36,222/-.   The  Trial
Court however had also lessened the  amount  cited  by  the  prosecution  by
Rs.7,50,000/-  against  item  No.  235  and  also  the  marriage   item   by
Rs.3,45,04,222/-,  thereby  reducing  the  total  expenditure  incurred   to
Rs.8,49,06,833/-.  The Trial Court  had  assessed  Rs.3,00,00,000/-  towards
marriage expenses.



 In this  factual  premise,  it  would  thus  be  enough,  for  the  present
adjudication vis-à-vis this facet of the debate, to  confine  the  appraisal
of the evidence, oral and documentary pertaining  only  to  the  expenditure
towards the marriage of  A3.  As  the  Trial  Court’s  appreciation  of  the
materials on record  would  reveal,  it  analyzed  the  evidence  under  the
following heads:



a)     Expenditure  incurred  towards  the  erection  of            marriage
pandals.



2 b)        Expenditure  incurred  towards  the  cost  of  food,     mineral
water and tamboolam.



c)     Cost of 34 Titan watches  - Rs.1,34,565/-



d)    Cost of stitching charges of wedding dress - Rs.1,26,000/-



e)    Cost of 100 silver plates - Rs.4,00,000/-



f)     Postal Expenses - Rs.2,24,000/-



 In re the erection of marriage pandals, the  Trial  Court  did  assess  the
oral and documentary  evidence  adduced  by  the  parties.   It  took  note,
amongst others, of the testimony of PW-181 Shri  Thangarajan,  who  was  the
Assistant Engineer,  PWD  at  the  relevant  point  of  time  and  to  whom,
according to the witness, the  work  of  estimating  the  expenses  incurred
towards  the  pandals,  both  at  the  marriage  and  reception  venues  was
entrusted.  He referred to  the  measurements  of  these  pandals  including
amongst others those for VIPs with iron-sheet roof in his report Ex.  P-1019
mentioning the estimated cost towards the same and also with regard  to  the
incidental decorative trappings  and  furnishings.   He  mentioned  as  well
about the air conditioners used  and  the  chairs  with  the  dining  tables
arranged at the two venues and assessed the expenditure  towards  all  these
at  Rs.5,91,00,000/-.   The  Trial  Court  did  take  note  of  the   cross-
examination of this witness, branding him to be  partisan  and  without  any
personal knowledge or  information  about  the  event  or  the  expenses  in
connection therewith and  alleged to have been set  up  by  the  prosecution
with a view to inflate the expenditure by creating the document  Ex  P-1019.
The said document in any case was denounced as  not  being  contemporaneous,
having been prepared after 2 ½ years of the marriage without any  acceptable
foundation therefor.



 The Trial Court to start  with  did  not  endorse  this  criticism  of  the
witness and instead proceeded to evaluate the merit of his testimony  by co-
relating the same with the version of the other witnesses. In doing so,  the
Trial Court traversed the evidence of PW-200 Shri,  K.P.  Muthuswami,  Chief
Engineer, PWD, Tamil  Nadu,  who,  as  stated  by  this  witness,  had  been
entrusted to complete the pandals'  work by A2 in  a  proper  manner.   This
witness testified to have consulted a plan given to  him  by  the  architect
involved whereafter he amongst others levelled  the  land  and  put  up  the
pandals as specified.  This witness affirmed that several pandals  had  been
erected amongst others for serving food to the  VIPs,  kitchen  and  cooking
sheds together with marriage platform, bathroom, rooms  for  the  bride  and
bridegroom.  He further stated that the expenses towards  this  construction
work were made on behalf of A1.  This  witness  clarified  that  the  pandal
work at the reception venue was undertaken by Kumarason Nader which  too  he
had to oversee on  the  instructions  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the
secretariat of A1.  According to this witness, an amount of Rs.14  lakhs  in
four installments was also paid by the bride’s  father  Mr.  Narayan  Swamy.
Incidentally PW-181  had  also  referred  to  the  same  architect  and  the
contractors as named  by PW-200 in his evidence.



 The Trial  Court  after  taking  note  of  the  cross-examination  of  this
witness, accepted his version being  satisfied  that  he  had  a  first-hand
information  about  the   arrangements  made  at  the  marriage  venue   and
concluded that the same corroborated the testimony of  PW-181  sufficiently.



 The Trial Court assessed  the  evidence  of  PW-183  Mr.  Ramesh,  Managing
Director,  Moulis  Advertising  Services  (P)  Ltd.,  who  deposed  to  have
printed 65,000 cards for marriage invitation  as instructed by Tr.  Jawahar,
Assistant Secretary to A1.  This witness also claimed to have  printed  5000
car passes for which on the basis of his bill  submitted,  he  had  received
payment of Rs.11 lakhs through cheque issued  by  A1.  Though  this  witness
resiled from these statements in his cross-examination, when  recalled   and
was confronted with this inconsistency,  he  affirmed  his  version  in  the
examination-in-chief to be correct.



 PW-184 Mr. Vincent claimed to have lent  out  ten  cars  on  hire  and  had
received  Rs.27,502/-  through  cheque  signed  by  A1.   This  witness  too
recoiled from this statement in his cross-examination but  reverted  thereto
in his re-examination.



 PW-185 Prem Kumar did state to have, on the requisition of the  Tamil  Nadu
Guest House lent six cars for rent for four days against which he  was  paid
Rs.19,211/- through cheque 23.09.1995 issued by A1.



 The Trial Court next also took note of the evidence  of  PW-186  Chalapathy
Rao who had supplied chairs, tables, cooking wares,  vessels  etc.  for  the
event as ordered by A3 and  Sachitnanandam, PRO of A1 and  received  payment
of Rs 1,30,000/- by cheque as advance.  He also received  a  further  amount
of Rs.57,250/- by cheque issued by A1 and according  to  him,  Rs.2,65,000/-
was  still  outstanding.   This  witness  too  vacillated  in   his   cross-
examination only  to  affirm  the  correctness  of  the   statement  in  his
examination-in-chief after he was recalled for  re-examination.



 The endeavour on the part of the defence that the payment received by  this
witness by way of cheque of Rs.1,30,000/- was in fact  towards  supply  made
to the AIADMK Party was dismissed by the  Trial  Court  in  absence  of  any
evidence to that effect.



 The Trial Court also examined the evidence of PW-188, Sundareshan, who  was
the Senior Advertisement Manager of a local daily in which a  thanks  giving
message of A1 had been published in its issue dated  10.09.1995.   According
to this witness, such an advertisement was published in all  other  editions
of the daily  on 11.09.1995 as well and that he had raised  a  bill  of  Rs.
2,47,660/- therefor.



 The evidence of PW-199 A.G. Krishnamurti  of  A.G.K.  Travels,  Chennai  is
that  he  had  arranged   two  Ambassador  AC  cars  from   06.09.1995    to
08.09.1995 on rent, raised bills in the name of A1 and received  payment  of
Rs.15,814/- through cheque issued by her.



 PW228 Shri Rajasekharan, Chartered Accountant claimed to have filed  Income
Tax and Property Tax returns of A1 for year 1984-85 to  1996-97  and  stated
about  seizures  amongst  others  of  a  file  Ex.  P-2218  containing   the
expenditure bills, receipts etc. in  connection  with  the  marriage.   This
witness was not cross-examined at  the  first  instance  on  behalf  of  the
respondents and thereafter he failed to  appear  in  spite  of  issuance  of
summons.  Though the defence  raised  a  plea  that  in  absence  of  cross-
examination of this witness, his untested testimony ought  to  be  eschewed,
the Trial Court  noted  that  neither  the  respondents-accused  had  cross-
examined  this  witness  when  the  opportunity  was   available   nor   had
thereafter, when as many as 145 witnesses  have  been  recalled  for  cross-
examination, did they seek  the  assistance  of  the  court  to  secure  his
presence, if necessary by applying coercive legal process.  Even  otherwise,
according to the Trial Court the testimony of this witness pertained  mainly
to the seizure of the documents  from  his  office  which  included  amongst
others,  the  file  containing  vouchers,  receipts  etc.  relating  to  the
expenditure incurred in the marriage of A3.  This is  more  so  as  some  of
these documents had also been relied upon by the respondents-accused.



 Vis-a-vis the expenditure incurred towards cost of food, mineral water  and
thamboolam, the Trial Court did  assess the  evidence  of  PW-237,  Jawahar,
who at the relevant time, was working as Assistant Secretary to A1  and  his
office functioned amongst others from her   house  at  No.36,  Poes  Garden.
This witness stated about musical concerts presented  by  Mr.  Srinivas  and
Mr. A.R. Rahman whom he had met for such arrangement  on  the  direction  of
A1.  He deposed about the printing of invitation cards  for  the  VIPs.   He
also stated generally about the other features  of  the  marriage  including
the supervision of the pandal  works  by  Mr.  K.P.  Muthuswamy,  a  retired
Engineer.  This witness too had  resiled  from  the  above,  in  his  cross-
examination but reiterated, in his  re-examination,  his  testimony  in  his
examination-in-chief.



 The defence plea that  the  afore-mentioned  witnesses  in  view  of  their
contradictory orientations ought to be discarded as a  whole  did  not  meet
the approval of the Trial Court.  It recorded that not only the evidence  of
such witnesses does not deserve to be discredited as  a  whole  and  instead
can be acted upon  on  the  same  analogy  as  of  a  hostile  witness,  the
circumstances under which 76 prosecution  witnesses  were  recalled  by  the
respondents/accused after A1 had assumed the office of  the  Chief  Minister
of the State and  the way, 64  of  them  had  casually  resiled  from  their
earlier version, could  not  be  lightly  brushed  aside.  The  Trial  Court
observed that as most  of  these  witnesses  who  were  in  service  in  the
Government Departments, were likely to be influenced by the  status  of  A1,
it being one of the  considerations for which the  trial  of  the  case  had
been transferred out of Tamil Nadu  to  Karnataka,  it  concluded  that  the
temporary  retraction of these witnesses  in  cross-examination  from  their
testimony  in  their  examination-in-chief  ipso  facto  did   not   warrant
rejection of their version in toto.



 The Trial Court noted the evidence of PW-192 Mr.  Sanjay  Jain,  Proprietor
of Titan Show Room, Chennai to the effect that he had delivered  34  watches
amounting to Rs.1,34,565/- for which he was paid the amount in cash.



 PW-196 Mr. Sayad Bawker, claimed to have done the stitching work of  suits,
shirts,  sherwanis  etc.  for  the  bridegroom-A3  for  which  he   received
Rs.1,41,025/- as the  charges  therefor.   The  witness  conceded  that  the
payment was made by Ram Kumar, the maternal uncle of the bride.   The  Trial
Court however disbelieved the statement that the  uncle  of  the  bride  had
made the payment.



 On the expenditure of 100 silver plates, the prosecution had  examined  PW-
191, Mr. Srinivas and  PW-214  Mr.  A.R.  Rehman  who  had  conducted  music
concerts.  Both of them stated to have made the performances on the  request
made on behalf of A1 and that they had not charged therefor.   They  however
admitted to have been offered silver plate, silk saree and  a  small  kumkum
box at the time of their invitation for the event.   They  deposed  that  on
being requisitioned by  the  investigating  agency,  those  items  had  been
handed over to the concerned officers.



 Acting on the evidence of these witnesses, the Trial Court  concluded  that
on the occasion of the marriage, silver plates, silk saree/dhoti and  kumkum
box were presented to the VIPs.



 Regarding postal expenses, the prosecution relied on the  evidence  of  PW-
189 Office Administrator, Head Office of AIADMK who confirmed to  have  sent
56,000 invitations, expending therefor, Rs.2,24,000/-.  He  stated  to  have
received the said amount from Mr. Jawahar, Assistant/Joint Secretary of A1.



 In response, the respondents had examined several witnesses with  documents
to butress and consolidate the oral testimony.  DW1 Ram Kumar, the  maternal
uncle of the bride  in  his  deposition  claimed  to  have  met  the  entire
expenses of the marriage and for that purpose,  had  opened  an  account  in
State Bank of India being Account No. 95071 in  Gopal  Puram  Branch,  State
Bank of India and had remitted  a sum of Rs.92 lakhs which was spent on  the
occasion.  He also proved  Ex. D15, the photocopy of the pass  book  of  the
said account and stated  that the deposit had  been   arranged  through  the
brides' family.  In cross-examination, he disclosed  that  the  account  was
opened on 14.8.1995 but did not disclose  the  details  of  the  expenditure
therefrom.  He also  did  not  produce  the  counter-foils  of  the  cheques
issued in that account.  His statement in  cross-examination  also  revealed
that he had not produced a copy of the passbook earlier  in  course  of  the
investigation.  He however affirmed that  the  total  expenditure   in   the
marriage did sum up to Rs.92 lakhs only.



 Apart from this witness, the respondents examined a host of  party  workers
who, at the relevant time, held various positions at the district level  and
elsewhere.  These witnesses, as the tenor of their  testimony  demonstrates,
in essence asserted that they had collected various sums of money  from  the
party workers and others and had utilized  the  same  for  various  purposes
relating to the marriage like decorating the pandals erected  by  the  bride
party,  crackers,  music,  food  for  the  party  workers,  chairs   in  the
pandals, reception on the visit of A1 to areas in connection with the  event
etc.   All  these  witnesses,  however,  did  admit   that  there  was    no
instruction from the party to raise such fund and incur the expenditure  but
insisted that they   had  given  their  statements  before  the  income  tax
department in course of the enquiry made  in  this  regard.   The  witnesses
also did concede that accounts/receipts in connection  with  the  collection
and expenditures had not been retained/maintained.



 In addition to the above, the respondents  examined  DW64    S.  Shanmugam,
Chartered Accountant who claimed to be the auditor of A1 from 1996  to  2000
and had dealt with  her accounts/assessment for the assessment  years  1991-
92 to 1997-98.  He referred to the query made by the income  tax  department
in the year 1995 about the amounts spent by her in  the  marriage  and  also
the reply given by  A1  in  response  thereto.   He  also  deposed  that  on
necessary enquries being made, the income tax  authorities  eventually   did
write off the expenditure of Rs.94 lakhs, which earlier,  it  had  observed,
had been spent by  A1  on  the  event.   Reference  was  also  made  to  the
assessment made by the income tax authorities with regard to  food  expenses
to the tune of Rs.3 lakhs  which also stood deleted in appeal.



 DW24 T. Tharani, who was a painter and also Art Director of the films,  was
examined to affirm that in connection with the marriage, people from  AIADMK
party had approached him for designing the facade of  the  entrance  of  the
marriage hall  and that he had  entrusted the work to one of his  assistants
Mr. Ramesh. He also added that he did not charge any  remuneration  for  the
work.



 DW54 Gopi Kant, at the relevant time, was working as Cine Art Director  and
stated that on being requested by the bride's family, he met DW1 Ram  Kumar,
maternal uncle of the bride who introduced  him  to  PW  200,  Muthu  Swamy.
This witness stated that PW 200 asked him to prepare a pandal at  the  place
of reception/public procession of the bride and the bridegroom and to  erect
 two arches and sets at the designated locations.   According  to  him,  the
cost of the work was Rs.12,98,000/- which was paid by cheque   in  the  name
of G.K. Arts by DW1 Ram Kumar.  That a further  cheque  of  Rs.4  lakhs  was
also issued by DW1 towards some items of additional work,  was  also  stated
by this witness.  The witness confirmed that he was the proprietor  of  G.K.
Arts.



 The respondents also examined DW80,  B.  Vasudevan  who,  at  the  relevant
time,  was working as Junior Engineer, PWD, Madras.    The  witness  deposed
that  the  investigating  officer  of  the  case  on  17.4.1997  had  orally
instructed him to value the marriage pandal and other works.   This  witness
identified his signature in the report Ex. P1019  but  maintained  that  the
drawings pertaining to the pandals  and the stage  had  not  been  given  by
Vijay Shankar, Architect and that he did not know where the said panals  had
been put up.  He stated that the  measurements mentioned in the report  were
 based on the instructions of the I.O. and that the  said  report  had  been
prepared in the  office  without  carrying  out   any  inspection.  He  also
disputed the measurements mentioned  in the report.



 In cross-examination, however, this witness admitted that he along with  PW
181 Thangrajan were the members of the  valuation  team  and  also  conceded
that the report contained the signatures of the Architect,  Vijay Shankar.



 DW-85, as offered by the respondents, was  the  Manager  (Administration  &
Accounts) in Super Duper TV Private Limited, who conducted the  TV  coverage
of the wedding for which, according to this witness, a  sum  of  Rs.2  lakhs
was paid by DW1.  In cross-examination, this witness admitted that  at  that
time, the bridegroom- A3- Sudhakaran and A2- Sasikala were the directors  of
Super Duper T.V. Pvt. Limited and that A3 was its Managing Director.



      DW-97 A. Vijay Kumar, Assistant Commissioner of  Income  Tax,  Central
Circle-II, Chennai produced documents containing 10  volumes  and  exhibited
Ex. D325 to D364, referred to by the other witnesses for the  defence.  This
witness  however  admitted   that  the  assessment  for  the  year   1993-94
pertaining to the concerned respondents  was  sub  judice  before  the  High
Court in appeal and that the assessment orders  relating  to  them  had  not
been finalised and were pending before various authorities.



 It has been emphatically urged that the evidence of  PW181  ought  to  have
been summarily rejected being hearsay  and  besides  speculative,  arbitrary
and  based  on  no  verifiable  data  and  that  this  witness   is   wholly
untrustworthy even otherwise.  It was insisted on behalf of the  respondents
that the learned Trial Court had also rejected the evidence of PW181  to  be
hearsay in character and thus in absence of any other  admissible  evidence,
its computation of the expenditure  at  Rs.3  crores  is  also  without  any
tangible basis and is wholly  inferential.  The  testimony  of  PW181  being
clearly hearsay in nature, in terms of 
Section 60
 of the Evidence  Act,  the
same could not have been accepted  as  substantive  evidence  and  thus  the
Trial Court's approach  of  seeking  corroboration  thereto  had  also  been
flawed.  According to the respondents, the version  of  PW200  supports  the
case of the accused in view of his admission that Rs.16 lakhs  was  paid  by
the bride’s  father  towards  the  expenses  for  the  construction  of  the
pandals. It has been urged that  his  evidence  as  well  is  rejectable  as
hearsay in nature, as  this  witness  did  not  personally  know  about  the
expenses, if any made by A1 and that  he  had  only  been  informed  of  the
contribution of A1 by some unnamed pandal contractors.  In  absence  of  any
evidence to show that A1 had incurred the expenditure,  as  claimed  by  the
prosecution, towards the construction of the marriage pandal or towards  the
actual cost thereof, the entire amount of Rs.5.21 crores, as  cited  by  the
prosecution, ought to be deducted. Qua  the  expenses  on  the  other  heads
including food, mineral water, presentations, stitching  charges,  etc.,  it
has been argued that not only the  Trial  Court  had  wrongly  accepted  the
evidence forthcoming from the prosecution  that  the  expenditure  on  Titan
watches and stitching charges had  been  incurred  by  the  respondents,  it
grossly erred in holding that on   a  rough  estimate,  an  amount  of  Rs.3
crores had been  spent  by  the  respondents  on  the  event.  It  has  been
canvassed that in doing so, the   Trial  Court  left  out  of  consideration
amongst others, the evidence adduced by the defence through DW1  Ram  Kumar,
the maternal uncle of the bride, the party workers and most importantly  the
income tax proceedings, which  after  thorough  enquiries  and  scrutiny  at
different levels did finally record that only an amount  of  Rs.29,66,552/-,
as mentioned by A1 in her reply dated 19.09.2005, had been  spent  and  that
too by cheques except for a sum of Rs.3 lakhs.  In  all,  having  regard  to
the entire gamut of the evidence, it has been argued  that  considering  the
different segments of expenditures incurred by the bride’s  family  and  the
party workers, the same is Rs.1,85,17,000/-, to  which  Rs.29,66,552/-  only
could be added on account of A1.  In  this  premise,  the  respondents  have
maintained  that  the  High  Court’s  computation   of   the   expenses   of
Rs.28,68,000/- only by A1 by way of expenditure incurred by the  respondents
is unassailably correct being based on a logical analysis of  the  materials
on record.



 The High Court however readily discarded the testimony  of  PW181  and  the
report Ex.P1019 primarily on the ground that this witness  had  no  personal
knowledge or idea of the structures raised at the venue of the marriage  and
of the reception and that his version with regard thereto was on  the  basis
of derived inputs though it mentioned that the witness, as attested by  him,
did consult the architect,  the  Art  Director,  the  electrician  etc.  who
accompanied him  to the site and that he had been given as  well  a  drawing
of the wedding choultry  and the measurements of the pandal along  with  the
sketch of the decorative arches etc. It held the view that the  witness  had
prepared the report on the basis of what the  witness  had  heard  and  seen
from the drawings and the sketches and  was  not  personally  aware  of  the
authenticity thereof and that he did not ask for quotations or  confirm  the
sketches.  That his report Ex.P1019 was deficient and  scanty  in  essential
particulars to inspire confidence for its acceptance was recorded.  On  this
aspect, the  High  Court  also  referred  to  the  evidence  of  PW200  K.P.
Muthuswamy, who claimed to have been entrusted to oversee the works  related
to the pandals by A2. This witness,  to  reiterate  had  confirmed  that  he
visited both the venues and that a plan for the pandals  as  well  as  stage
arrangements, as prepared by architect Vijay Shankar had  been  handed  over
to him.  He narrated in details about the specifications of  the  structures
and the payments therefor.  He also admitted  to  have  received  a  sum  of
Rs.16 lakhs from the father of the bride in this regard.   The  High  Court,
however observed that this witness, amongst others,  did  neither  tell  the
police about the expenses of leveling nor  disclose  the  particulars  about
the number of  air  conditioner  machines  used.   The  High  Court  further
commented that he did not supervise the work of Art Director Gopi  Nath  and
that this witness could not remember as to how much money was spent for  the
marriage.  The High Court touched upon the evidence of other  witnesses  and
in particular elaborated on the testimony of  PW228   R.  Rajshekheran  from
whom  the  file  containing  the  original  vouchers,  bills,  invoices   in
connection with the marriage i.e.  Ex.  P2218  had  been  seized.   It  also
analyzed the queries made by the Income Tax Department and the  reply  given
thereto by A1 by her letter  dated  19.09.1995  wherein,  she  provided  the
breakup of the expenditure incurred  by  her.   The  testimony  of  DW1  Ram
Kumar, the maternal uncle of the bride,  more  specifically  to  the  effect
that the entire expenses had been borne by the bride’s family  to  the  tune
of Rs.92 lakhs by remittances through the bank account opened on  14.08.1995
was taken note of.   The  evidence  of  the  party  workers  claiming  their
contribution in the expenditure through collection  was  also  recorded  and
eventually the High Court accepted the statement  of  A1  furnished  to  the
Income Tax Department disclosing the expenditure by  her  of  Rs.28,67,520/-
towards marriage and rounded up the said figure to Rs.28,68,000/- to be  her
share of expenses.



  In reaching this conclusion, apart from rejecting the testimony  of  PW181
being  second  hand  in  nature,   the  High  Court  seemingly  accepted  in
substance the version  of  the  defence  witnesses  observing  that  at  the
relevant time A1 was the Chief Minister of the State  and  was  incidentally
then the General Secretary of AIADMK party  as  well.  It  recorded  further
that the bride was none else than the grand-daughter of  famous  cine  actor
Shivaji  Ganeshan.   It  observed  that  the  prosecution  for   no   reason
forthcoming, had omitted to examine the bride’s father who would  have  been
the best person to state about the actual expenses  on  the  marriage.   The
High Court as well seem to have accepted that it was the customary  practice
for the bride’s family to bear the expenses of  the  marriage  normally  and
though it was of the view that such expenditure was comprised of  verifiable
and non-verifiable components,  it  was  difficult  to  ascertain  the  non-
verifiable segment while verifiable expenditure could  be  assessed  through
investigation.  Et al,   the High Court eventually accepted  the  figure  of
Rs.28,67,520/-, as cited by the A1 to be the amount expended by her  in  the
marriage and limited the liability of the  respondent-  accused,  as  stated
above, to Rs.28,68,000/-.  Thereby the High Court  reduced  the  expenditure
of Rs.6,45,04,222/- towards marriage expenditure by the R1/A1, as  mentioned
by the prosecution, to Rs.28,68,000/-.



 A2 to A4 also have positioned themselves to  question  the  expenditure  of
Rs.2,38,89,609/- attributed to them by the prosecution.  This amount, as  is
apparent from annexure IV to the charge sheet, includes  sums  expended  not
only by A2, A3 and A4 but also by nine  companies/firms  as  named  therein.
In the compilation referred to in course of the arguments, the break  up  of
the expenditures incurred by A2, A3, A4 and the  firms  aforementioned  have
been provided.  It is however the contention of A2 to A4 that an  amount  of
Rs.1,63,06,897.16 is liable to be deducted on the grounds as  enumerated  in
the compilation so much so that the total admitted expenditure by  them  and
their firms as named  by  the  prosecution  was  Rs.75,82,712.17.   Qua  the
disputed items, it has been urged on behalf of these  respondents  that  the
Trial Court had overlooked the defence evidence  and  instead  had  received
the version of the prosecution witnesses though on the face of the  records,
the corresponding expenditures  had  not  been  proved.   According  to  the
respondents, apart from these infirmities, the  Trial  Court  also  ignored,
amongst others, the aspect that on several items of expenditure  by  way  of
payment  of  interest,  these  respondents  had  been  subjected  to  double
jeopardy inasmuch as though these sums had been accounted  for in  computing
their  net  profits,  these  amounts  were   shown   separately   again   as
expenditures.  Not only sums not expended  in  fact  had  been  deliberately
shown to be so, the attempt on the part of the prosecution  to  make  double
and inflated additions in respect of purchase of machineries in  some  items
has been overlooked.  It has been argued as  well   that  the   Trial  Court
erroneously  also  relied  on  the  evidence  of  prevaricating  prosecution
witnesses against the respondents.



 Per contra, the prosecution has insisted  that  the  challenge  to  the  so
called flaws in the assessment of the  evidence  by  Trial  Court  on  items
other than the one pertaining to marriage expenditure  is  wholly  misplaced
and unmerited as the High Court had also endorsed the amounts  corresponding
thereto.  This is more so in absence of any challenge to the conclusions  of
the High court in this  regard  by  the  respondents.     According  to  the
prosecution, the High  Court  scaled  down  the  marriage  expenditure  from
Rs.6,45,04,222/-,  as  quantified  by  the  prosecution  to  Rs.28,68,000/-,
though  the  Trial  Court  had  computed  the  same  to  be   Rs.3   crores.
Arithmetically thus, the High Court endorsed the  total  expenditure  to  be
Rs.5,40,20,611/- instead of Rs.11,56,56,833.41 quoted  by  the  prosecution.
It has been argued that the analysis of the evidence on record  as  a  whole
by the Trial Court and its computation of the marriage expenditure  of  Rs.3
crores is correct and did not call for any interference.  According  to  the
prosecution, the Trial Court did not reject the evidence adduced by it,  but
on a rational appraisal thereof, had moderated the marriage  expenditure  to
be Rs.3 crores. It has been urged as well that the Trial Court  had  rightly
disbelieved the evidence of the defence witnesses and more particularly  the
party workers who claimed to have collected funds to spend the same  on  the
event.  That A2 had failed to account for the expenditures, referred  to  by
A1 in her reply to  the  notice  to  the  Income  Tax  Department  had  been
underlined too.



 The break-up of expenditure of Rs.6,45,04,222/- on the  marriage  has  been
furnished by the prosecution as hereunder.

 In our comprehension, though PW181 had neither visited the  venues  on  the
dates of the event nor was then in-charge of  the  construction  of  pandals
and other arrangements auxiliary thereto,  his evidence is not liable to  be
excluded as a whole.  On being entrusted with the responsibility  of  making
an estimate of the expenses incurred in the construction of the pandals  and
other arrangements, it  is  discernible  from  his  testimony  that  he  did
consult the Architect Vijay Shankar, the Art Director  Thotha  Theerani  and
others, who were in  fact  actually  involved  in  the  said  works  at  the
relevant point of time.  This witness visited the venues and stated on  oath
that the Architect Vijay Shankar had given him the drawing of  the  choultry
and the measurements of the pandals on the basis of  which  those  had  been
constructed.  He also referred to the plans and  sketches  provided  to  him
by  the  Art  Director,  based  whereupon,  the   fixtures   and   ancillary
structures were raised.  In the report Ex.P1019 prepared by  PW181,  he  did
mention, inter alia, the areas of the  various  pandals  together  with  the
decorative attachments and after accounting for the  cost  thereof  and  the
price of the furniture  used  and  the  amenities  provided,  estimated  the
expenditure  to  be  Rs.5,91,00,000/-  towards   the   pandals   and   other
arrangements to secure the intended facilities for  the couple,  guests  and
other participants. True it is, that PW181 was not  an  eye-witness  to  the
marriage  arrangements  and  had  not  personally   undertaken   the   works
pertaining to the pandals and other  associated  arrangements,  yet  as  has
been observed by the Trial Court, his findings as  recorded  in  the  report
Ex. P1019 could be construed to be of an expert witness  and  further  could
be used  as  corroboration  for  the  testimony  of  PW200  who  indeed  had
supervised the same works himself and as claimed by the prosecution  on  the
instructions/advise of A2.   The  evidence  of  PW181,  that  the  Architect
Vijayshankar and the Art Director Thotha Tharani had provided him  with  the
plan and the sketch map on which the pandals and  other  structures  at  the
venues had been constructed, cannot be discarded as hearsay.  In  this  view
of the matter, the approach of the Trial Court to weigh the probative  worth
of the testimony of PW181 in conjunction with PW200   cannot  be  repudiated
to be impermissible in law or outrageously fallacious.



 PW200 K.P. Muttuswamy, Chief Engineer, Public Works Department, Tamil  Nadu
did assert on oath that he was instructed  by  A2  to  complete  the  pandal
works as early as possible.  He also referred  to  a  plan  to  that  effect
furnished by the Architect Vijay Shankar  in  presence  of  the  contractors
entrusted for the execution thereof.  The witness claimed to  have  arranged
land at the identified sites to be levelled and also provided in details  of
the number,  size  and  specification  of  the  pandals  together  with  the
purposes thereof.  The witness was candid to state that the  father  of  the
bride had paid Rs.14 lakhs towards the expenditure and  that  therefrom,  he
disbursed payments.  He deposed as well that A1 and  A2  had  inspected  the
work by visiting the site about a week prior to the  marriage.   He  claimed
to have signed the applications for securing temporary electric  connections
for the pandals for which payments were made by cheques  on  behalf  of  A1.
In this patent premise, the conclusion of the Trial Court that the  evidence
of PW200 was direct  and  of  first  hand  in  nature  with  regard  to  the
arrangements at the pandals cannot be faulted with.  Its  finding  that  his
testimony thus lent sufficient corroboration to that of  PW181  also  cannot
be dismissed as preposterous.



 The testimony of DW-80, who was also a signatory to the report Ex.  P-1019,
to the effect that the same had been prepared  without  any  inspection  and
that the measurements mentioned therein were not real had not  been  rightly
preferred to the otherwise consistent versions  of  PW181  and  PW200.   The
evaluation of  the  evidence  of  the  other  witnesses  touching  upon  the
remaining aspects of the expenditure incurred on the marriage, as  conducted
by the Trial Court, also does not merit rejection in toto.  Noticeably,  the
Trial Court did not accept the expenditure  quoted  by  the  prosecution  on
the cost of Titan watches as the evidence to that effect  was  construed  to
be inadequate to lay the same  in  the  account  of  the  respondents.   The
rejection of the evidence  of  the  party  workers  claiming  collection  of
various  amounts  from  its  cadres  and  utilization  thereof  towards  the
purposes  and  arrangements  mentioned  by  them  also  in  absence  of  any
persuasive corroborative evidence does not merit  any  repudiation.  In  the
face of the evidence in particular of  the  elaborate  arrangements  at  the
venues and the expenses incurred on other items associated with  the  event,
we are of the opinion that the Trial Court did not err in not accepting  the
figure of Rs.28,68,000/-, as the expenditure incurred by A1 on the basis  of
her reply to the queries made by the Income Tax Department.  Though  it  has
been urged on behalf of the  defence  that  this  figure  had  been  finally
accepted  after  the  necessary  enquiries  undertaken  by  the  income  tax
authorities, the result  of    such  enquiries   even  if  made,  being  not
binding on the Trial Court, it  was  not  obliged  to  accept  the  same  by
ignoring the evidence adduced before it.  The treatment of the  evidence  by
the High Court, on the other hand, in our assessment, had been  summary  and
sketchy  and it in a way promptly accepted the expenditure mentioned  by  A1
in  her  reply  to  the  notice  of  the  income  tax   department   without
independently appraising the  evidence adduced by the parties at the  trial.



 Though it is not unknown,  that  very often the bride's  family  shares  or
bears the expenditure  of marriage, dependent on the practice prevalent,  it
is not an invariable phenomenon and permits of exception   in  varying  fact
situations  and therefore no rigid assumption either way is tenable. In  any
case, necessary deductions would have to  be  drawn  on  the  basis  of  the
evidence  adduced.   As  the  investigation  into  the  expenditure  on  the
marriage had to be conducted more than two years  after  the  event,  it  is
logical that the exercise involved was expected to  be  informed  with  some
assumptions, which if realistic and logical, would not as such  vitiate  the
assessment as incurably infirm  or non-est.



 On an overall consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties, we  are
inclined to hold that the computation of the expenditure incurred by  A1  in
the marriage as made by the High Court is unacceptable in the teeth  of  the
materials on record to the contrary.  There  being  concurrent  findings  of
the two forums on the rest of the items of expenditure, we  construe  it  to
be inessential to undertake a fresh exercise  with  regard  thereto  in  the
present proceedings.



CONSPIRACY AND ABETEMENT

 The prosecution asserts that the respondents i.e.  A1  to  A4  had  entered
into a conspiracy and in furtherance thereof, A1 who was a  public  servant,
had come to possess assets to the tune of Rs.66.65 crores,  disproportionate
to her known sources of income, during the period  1991  to  1996  when  she
held the office of the Chief Minister of the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu.    The
prosecution has alleged as well that A2 to A4 had abetted  her  i.e.  A1  in
the commission of offence.  To reiterate, the check period is from  1.7.1991
to 30.4.1996. To buttress this imputation, the  prosecution  has  relied  on
the fact that A1, who was the Chief Minister of Tamil  Nadu  from  24.6.1991
to 13.5.1996 and A2 who was her close friend  and  associate,  were  amongst
others partners together  in Jaya Publications  and  Sasi  Enterprises  from
before the check period.  A2, who was  the  wife  of  Tr.  M.  Natarajan,  a
government servant with the Information  and  Public  Relations  Department,
initially was a  occasional  visitor  to  the  residence  of  A1  till  1988
whereafter  she  was   permanently  assimilated  in   the   household.   The
prosecution case as well  is that A3  who is proclaimed  to  be  the  foster
son of A1 is the biological son of A2's elder sister Tmt.  Vanamani  and  T.
Vivekanandan.  He too had come to reside in the residence of A1  during  the
year 1992 while pursuing studies at Chennai and remained  there  till  1997.
It is in evidence that A1 had solemnized his marriage on 7.9.1995,  claiming
him to be her foster son with noticeable pamp and  grandeur.  A4,  according
to the prosecution, is the wife of the elder brother of A2    and  had  been
residing in the house of A1 from the beginning of 1992.



 The above noticeable integration of A1 to A4 and their joint residence  has
been highlighted by the prosecution as a  formindable  indicator  to  attest
the imputation of conspiracy and abetment. Apart from maintaining  that  A2,
A3 and A4 at the time of joining the household of A1 were not  possessed  of
properties significant enough in their names nor did  have  any  independent
source of income as such, it  has  insisted  that  the  properties  acquired
during the check period in the names of the 34  firms  and  companies   were
with the unaccounted funds and resources of A1. It has been underlined  that
only few of the companies/firms which were formed with A2,  A3  and  A4  and
Lex  Property  Development  (Pvt).  Ltd.  in  different  combinations   were
registered under the 
Companies Act
.  Noticeably,  the  properties  of  these
companies/firms had been acquired during the check period and  significantly
about 50 bank accounts were opened with the Indian  Bank,  Abhirampuram  and
Canara  Bank,  Mylapore  in  the  names  of  the   respondents   and   their
firms/companies during that time.  The  prosecution   has  also  brought  on
record the fact that out of these firms/companies,  six  firms  namely;  Jay
Farm House, J. Real  Estate,  Jaya  Contractors  and  Builders,  Green  Farm
House, J.J. Leasing and Maintenance and J.S. Housing  Development  had  been
registered on the same day  ie.  25.1.1994  and  ten  other  firms   namely;
Vigneshwara Builders, Lakshmi  Constructions,  Gopal  Promoters,  Namasivaya
Housing  Developments,   Ayyappa   Property   Developments,   Sea   Enclave,
Navasakthi Contractors and Builders,  Oceanic  Constructions,  Green  Garden
Apartments and A.P. Advertising Services  on  15.2.1995.  According  to  the
prosecution,  all  the  respondents  availed  of  the  services  of   common
auditors, architects and accountants.  It has referred  to  numerous  inter-
account transfers involving the respondents and  the  above  firms/companies
so much so to unequivocally project that those represented  cash  flow  from
their accounts inter se for common purposes. Referring to  the  evidence  of
PW198 in particular, it has been contended  on  behalf  of  the  prosecution
that huge unaccounted cash deposits had  been  made  in  the  two  accounts,
maintained  in  Canara  Bank,  Mylapore  and   Indian   Bank,   Abhirampuram
originating from 36, Poes Garden, Chennai, the residence/secretariat  of  A1
with A2 monitoring the account(s) in which such deposits were  to  be  made.
Vis-a-vis the purchase of immovable properties, it  has  been  alleged  that
about 3000 acres of fertile lands, of  which  900  acres   comprised  a  tea
estate,  had been acquired in the  names  of  individuals/companies  through
various transactions evidenced by 146 sale deeds.  It  has  been  underlined
that  qua  most  of  the  sales,  A2  had  suggested  the   names   of   the
firms/individuals to figure in the deals. It has been imputed as  well  that
in connection with such transactions,  the  vendors/owners  were  kept  away
from the purchasers and  and the conveyances  were  made  through  attorneys
foisted upon them.  The vendors were also subjected to duress to  part  with
the property and the officials entrusted with the duty  of  registration  of
such transactions, were subjected to instructions  from  higher  authorities
to oblige the purchasers and that the registrations did take  place  at  the
residence of A1 on many occasions.  The consideration  price  of  such  sale
transactions very often had been below the  guidelines  prescribed  and  the
amounts were paid from various accounts of the respondents as well as  their
firms/companies and also by cash.  According to the prosecution,  all  these
circumstances are borne out unmistakably by the  evidence  on  record,  oral
and documentary do prove the charge of conspiracy and abetment and  that  in
furtherance of these criminal activities, each one  of  them  had  acted  on
behalf of  each  other   in  capacities  either  as  individuals,  partners,
directors,  of their firms/companies and also collaborators.



 In refutation on behalf of A1,  it  has  been  broadly  urged  that  though
conspiracy  can  be  inferred  from  circumstances,  the  same  has  to   be
essentially proved and that the mere fact that A2 to A4  had  been  residing
in the house of A1, per se  cannot  be  a  decisive  circumstance  to  prove
conspiracy.   It has been argued that from much prior to the  check  period,
A1 and A2 had been partners in the  firms namely; M/s Jaya  Publication  and
Sasi Enterprises and  their business connection ipso  fact  also  cannot  be
construed to be an incriminating circumstance.  It has been maintained  that
A2 to A4 have purchased properties with their own resources and efforts  and
that the prosecution  has failed to establish  even  a  single  instance  to
demonstrate that the funds for such acquisitions had been  doled out by  A1.
 Contending that starting of a  firm  by  a  non-public  servant  by  itself
cannot be an irrefutable determinant to assume  conspiracy   with  a  public
servant more particularly when A1  had never been a partner in  any  of  the
firms started during the check period, it has been pleaded that the  finding
of the Trial Court that  the  evidence  available   did  prove  issuance  of
cheques by A1 in favour of the co-accused and the applications by  her   for
availing loan for the firms involved is factually incorrect.   It  has  been
argued that the prosecution has failed to cite even one  instance  where  A1
had transferred any fund to A3 and A4 and for that matter to any of the  six
companies in particular which allegedly have acquired properties  therewith.
 It has been underlined as well that A1 had neither  received  any  dividend
from these companies nor been either a shareholder or  a  director  thereof.
In this context, the finding of the Trial Court that A2 to A4  had  acquired
defunct companies with a sinister motive has  been  dismissed  as  unfounded
and patently erroneous. It has been maintained that a circumstance to  admit
any inference of  an  illegal  act  must  be  one  incapable  of  any  other
reasonable explanation and the prosecution having failed to  offer  any,  by
furnishing either direct or indirect evidence,   the  charge  of  conspiracy
has remained unproved.



  Elaborating  further  the  refutation  of  the  imputation  that  the  six
companies namely; Meadow Agro Farms Pvt. Limited,  Riverway   Agro  Products
Limited,  Lex  Property  Development  (Pvt.)   Limited,   Signora   Business
Enterprises, Ramraj  Agro  Products  Limited  and  Indo  Doha  Chemical  and
Pharmaceutical  Pvt. Limited had no resources of their  own  and  that  with
the induction of A2, A3 and A4 in particular, a tide  of  funds  had  flowed
into their accounts generated from the coffers of  A1,  it  has  been  urged
with reference to the testimony of DW86 Vaidyanathan and  DW87  Srikant   as
well as the income tax returns for the period ending 31.3.1996  and  1996-97
as well as the balance sheets of the companies that so far  as  Meadow  Agro
Farm Pvt. Limited, and Riverway Agro Products Limited are concerned, at  the
relevant time, the respondents were not the shareholders thereof  and  their
share capital was formed of the contribution of the  shareholders  of  these
entities.  According to the respondents, all these companies had  sufficient
funds of their own where from acquisition  of  properties  and  expenditures
were made. That huge amount of loans were also advanced by these  companies,
to name in  particular,  Meadow  Agro  Farms  Pvt.  Limited,  Riverway  Agro
Products Limited and Lex  Property  Development  (Pvt.)  Limited  have  been
highlighted.  The loans, noticeable were more prominently to A2, A3 and  the
firms/companies formed by them  in  different  combinations  including  Sasi
Enterprises and Jaya Publications. The  amount  of  loans  range  from  Rs.2
lakhs to Rs.62,52,000/-. Vis-a-vis Lex Property Development (Pvt.)  Limited,
it has been contended  that from its balance sheet for the  assessment  year
1996-97, it was patent that it had received share application money  to  the
tune of Rs.46,00,000 and that it had borrowed a  sum  of  Rs.84,07,172  from
the Indian Bank.  Further, it had a receipt of  Rs.2,04,98,350  from  sundry
creditors. In addition to the above, it has been pleaded  that  the  company
also received an inter-corporate deposit (ICD)  from  Kalyani  Constructions
Pvt.  Ltd.  of  an  amount  of  Rs.  1,56,67,000   during  the  year  ending
31.3.1996 and Rs. 45,00,000 from Altaf Constructions Private Ltd. That  this
company did make an investment of  Rs.2,63,49,857/-  in  immovable  property
apart from  granting loans to  A3  and  three  other  firms  including  Sasi
Enterprises, has been mentioned. According  to  the  respondents,  thus  the
total  expenditure  of  this  company  including  advances  did  sum  up  to
Rs.3,03,48,357/- which was met  from its own corpus, as  had  been  accepted
by the income tax authorities.



 It has been insisted in particular that the properties acquired by  Signora
Business Enterprises Private Limited were prior to A3 and  A4  becoming  the
additional directors of  the  company  and  therefore  the  finding  to  the
contrary as recorded by the Trial Court was apparently erroneous.



 With regard to Ram Raj Agro Products Limited, it has been argued  that  the
balance sheet of the company for the year  1994-95  disclosed  that  it  had
made investment of Rs.14,39,446/- in the purchase  of   land.  Referring  to
the balance-sheet of this company for the assessment year  1995-96,  it  has
been maintained that it  had  secured  loans  from  banks  to  the  tune  of
Rs.1,43,87,336 and unsecured loans of Rs.75,30,561.   It has been  urged  as
well that during  the  said  period,  this  company had  received a  sum  of
Rs.1 crore also from Mangutta Investment Pvt.  Limited.   That  the  company
had received back from the government a  refund  of  Rs.40,00,000  has  also
been urged to contend that it  thus had funds to the tune of  Rs.2,59,17,897
 wherefrom it spent Rs.62,57,000 towards constructions at Thanjavour  during
1994-95 and 1995-96.



 Vis-a-vis, Indo Doha Chemicals and  Pharmaceutical  Pvt.  Limited,  it  has
been  asserted   that  on  31.3.1995,  it  had  paid  up  share  capital  of
Rs.97,00,000/- as disclosed by its balance-sheet.  Referring  to  the  order
passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax  (Appeals)  in  ITA  No.  144/1999-
2000,  it is  submitted that 9,69,400 shares of face value  of  Rs.10   each
had been purchased by A2 at Rs.6 per share and the remaining 600 shares  had
been purchased by six other persons. That the price of the  9,69,400  shares
@ Rs.6 per share amounting to Rs.58,16,400/- and registered in the  name  of
A2 had been paid by  A3  is  however  admitted.  Contending  thus  that  the
prosecution  version  that  Indo  Doha  Chemicals  and  Pharmaceutical  Pvt.
Limited during the check period had a total income of Rs.30,40,000    to  be
wrong, it has been urged that after the purchase of the  shares,  the  whole
factory was leased out to Southern Petrochemical Company Limited (SPIC),  in
return whereof the company received an amount of  Rs.1,39,08,584/-.  It  has
however  been admitted that out of such  receipt,  Rs.25,00,000/-  had  been
lent  to  Meadow  Agro  Farm  (Private)  Limited.   Further,  an  amount  of
Rs.20,00,000/- had been  paid  to  James  Frederic   and  Rs.72,00,000/-  to
S
IPC
OT by way of repayment of loan availed  earlier  leaving  a  balance  of
Rs.57,08,584/-  in deposit. This is to contradict  the  prosecution's  claim
that the income of Indo Doha Chemicals and  Pharmaceutical  Private  Limited
during the check period was Rs.30,40,000/-. It has thus been urged that  all
the properties acquired and  constructions   raised  by  the  six  companies
have  been  from   their  own   funds   and   therefore,   the   amount   of
Rs.4,70,24,439/- towards the same is  not  liable  to  be  integrated  while
adjudging the assets of A1 to A4.



 In consolidation of the above, it has been urged on  behalf  of  A2  to  A4
that they along with the six companies whose assets, income and  expenditure
have been combined by the prosecution to lay the charge,  being  not  public
servants, cannot, in law, be called upon to explain their source  of  income
or the manner of acquisition of their assets  or  the  mode  and  extent  of
their expenditures.



 Referring to 
Section 13(1)(e)
 of the 1988 Act, it has  been  asserted  that
the same does not cast any  obligation  on  a  non-public  servant  even  if
arraigned as a co-accused with the public servant,  to  furnish  explanation
as otherwise contemplated therein.  It has been maintained that  though  the
clear mandate of this legal provision is that for  the  charge  to  succeed,
the prosecution must establish that the public servant, had been during  the
term of his/her office holding his/her assets through some other  person  or
to put it differently, some other person had  been  holding  the  assets  on
behalf of the public servant, the Trial Court had grossly erred  in  absence
of any evidence to that effect, to proceed on  the  basis  of  surmises  and
conjectures to return a finding  against  A2 to A4 and  the  above  referred
six companies.    The  prosecution  having  utterly  failed  to  adduce  any
evidence to demonstrate that  A2 to A4 or these companies had received   any
money  from  A1,  her  financial  involvement  in  their  affairs   remained
unproved, more particularly as she was neither a director nor a  shareholder
of these  companies.    Underlining  the  fact  that  no  charge  of  benami
transaction had been framed against the respondents, it  has  been  insisted
that even otherwise the prosecution has failed to discharge  its  burden  to
prove this fact. It has been argued that it having been established that  A2
to A4 and the six companies at all relevant  times,  had  their  independent
sources of income and individual business, the 1988 Act  did  not  cast  any
burden on them to prove that they did not hold  any assets on behalf of  A1.
 Elaborating on this aspect, it has been contended  that  from  much  before
the commencement of the check period, A2 had been carrying  on  business  in
her own right as the proprietor of Vinod Vision and she had been filing  her
income tax returns in connection therewith.  Reference  of  the  income  tax
returns and wealth tax returns of A2 for the  assessment  years  1985-86  to
1992-93 have been referred to.  All  these  returns  as  the  dates  thereof
would indicate had been submitted much  belatedly  and  noticeably  on  same
dates i.e. 23.2.1993 and 25.2.1993 for income tax  and  wealth  tax  returns
respectively.  No explanation for such delayed  submission  of  returns  had
been furnished.



 Though A2 had been a partner in  Jaya  Publications  and  Sasi  Enterprises
which did exist as well from before the check period, it  has  been  pleaded
that the Trial Court completely disregarded the evidence with regard to  her
income and assets  of these firms as  disclosed  more  particularly  in  the
income tax returns and accepted by the income tax  authorities,  in  holding
that the  transactions  involved   were  really   of  A1  catalysed  by  her
finances. Similarly the income tax returns  of A3, A4 and the six  companies
had also been left out of consideration by the Trial Court.



 Reiterating that there is no evidence on record even to  indicate  that  A1
had been the director or a shareholder of any of the six companies,  it  has
been emphasized that these companies had been floated  prior  to  the  check
period. Apart form contending that there is no evidence to suggest  that  A1
had either given loan to the  six  companies  or  had  made  any  investment
therein, it has been urged as well that  these  companies  not  having  been
arraigned  as  accused,  their  income  and  assets  could  not  have   been
attributed to any of the  respondents, being  impermissible  in  law.  In  a
way, thus it has been argued that the assimilation of the  assets  of  these
companies with those  of  the  respondents  and  the  eventual  confiscation
thereof amounts to condemning these entities unheard.   The  prosecution  as
well has been  severely criticized to be unfair  in  withholding  the  audit
report prepared by Mr. Chokkalingam  in respect  of  Jaya  Publications  and
Namadhu  MGR.   That  several  other  documents  seized  in  course  of  the
investigation were also endeavoured to be withheld and that it  was  on  the
intervention of this Court that the respondents could secure an  opportunity
to traverse the same, has also been mentioned.    In  reiteration  of  their
plea made  with  regard  to  the  deficiencies  in  the  assessment  of  the
valuation  of  the  construction  made  by  the  engineers  deputed  by  the
prosecution, it has been insisted that they could by no  means  be  accepted
as experts, the appraisals  and  the  reports  based  thereon  being  wholly
incomplete, faulty  and  conjectural  in  absence  of  any   contemporaneous
document in support thereof. The approach of the Trial  Court  in  accepting
the valuation  furnished  by  the  prosecution  through  such  witnesses  by
allowing a discount of 20% has also been castigated as absurd and  perverse.
According to the respondents, the Trial Court readily accepted the  evidence
of the prosecution  on many  issues   without  analysing  the  same  in  the
correct  perspective which patently exhibits its non application of mind.



 Aside impeaching the failure of the Trial Court in omitting to  lay  before
the A2, all the incriminating circumstances under 
Section 313
  Cr.P.C.,  its
acceptance of the charge of conspiracy and abetment  on  the   consideration
of  the joint residence of A1 to A4, execution of general power of  attorney
by A1 in favour of A2, constitution of various firms  and  companies  during
the check period and inference of cash flow  from  one  account  to  another
has been branded as visibly  flawed.  It has been argued on  behalf  of  the
respondents  that the deed of power of attorney  was  executed  by  A  1  in
favour of A2  only for the purpose of bank transactions of Indian  Bank  and
not for all purposes as assumed by the Trial Court.    Further,  as  A1  was
neither a partner  in any of  the  firms/companies  constituted  during  the
check period and as the six companies,  the  properties  whereof   had  been
confiscated, had been incorporated  prior to the  check  period  with  third
party promoters/directors, this factor also  did  not  merit  acceptance  to
reinforce the charge of conspiracy.



 It has been assiduously pleaded that having regard to the fact that  A1  is
a spinster and that she and A2 were partners in M/s  Jaya  Publications  and
M/s Sasi Enterprises from before the check  period  and  thus  did  share  a
close relationship,  A2's  accommodation  with  A1  per  se  cannot  suggest
conspiracy as alleged.  Similarly, A3 being the nephew of  A2  and  A4,  the
widowed sister-in-law of A2, their residence with A1  also  ipso  facto  was
not an unmistakable circumstance to deduce conspiracy,  in  absence  of  any
evidence direct or indirect or a single instance evidencing flow of cash  or
finance either from any source of A1 or her account to  that  of  the  other
accused persons or the six companies. Such a factor was really non  est  but
presumed and  acted  upon  by  the  Trial  Court  to  infer  conspiracy  and
abetment.   It has been emphatically contended that the Trial Court  ignored
as well the fact  that M/s Jaya Publications and M/s Sasi Enterprises  along
with A2 to A4 and six companies had  secured  substantial  amounts  of  loan
from banks and other private sources which they rolled in  their  respective
business  to  assume  their  inter  dependence   and    sustenance   through
circulation of  unaccounted reserves  of A1 in their accounts.



 On the aspects of abetment and conspiracy, the High Court  dwelt  upon  the
evidence in  general   without  undertaking   any  minute  analysis  of  the
testimony of  the  individual  witnesses   or  the  documents/  transactions
related thereto. It  in  particular,  while  dealing  with  the  charge   of
accumulation of unaccounted wealth by A1 and diversion thereof to A2  to  A4
to  acquire  immovable  properties   and  administer   the   firms/companies
involved, noted that the respondents along with the firms and companies  had
borrowed  loans of Rs.24,17,31,274/- from banks. The  High  Court  therefore
concluded that  this  amount  having  been  utilised  for  the  purchase  of
immovable  properties  and  administration  of  the  firms   and   companies
involved, there was no foundation for  the  charge  of  abetment.   Qua  the
imputation of conspiracy, the High Court ruled that the joint  residence  of
A2 to A4 did not warrant an inference thereof and  though  as  this  offence
contemplates an agreement between two or more persons to commit an  unlawful
act, a court to be satisfied with regard  thereto  ought  to   have  at  its
disposal prima facie evidence. It  observed  that  where  evidence  is  only
circumstantial, it must be complete, continuous  and  unimpeachable   to  be
consistent with the guilt of the accused so much so to exclude any  possible
hypothesis of his innocence. The High  Court  concluded  that  the  evidence
disclosed that A2 to A4 had borrowed huge amounts from the  banks and  other
sources and had therefrom acquired the  immovable  properties  and  the  six
companies.  It thus ruled, that not only the source of  income  was  lawful,
the object was also legal. The charges of abetment  and  conspiracy  against
the respondents have  thus  been  dismissed  by  the  High  Court  on  these
considerations.



 The Trial Court, while examining these charges, did address at  the  outset
the imputation of the prosecution  that  the  pecuniary  resources  and  the
properties of A2 to A4 as  well  as  the  six  afore-named  companies   were
really held for and on behalf of  A1,  thus  attracting  the  offence  under

Section  13(1)(e)
 of the Act.  The Trial Court  recounted in  this  context,
the plea of A2 to A4 that the cash deposits  in  their  accounts  and  their
assets  had been acquired out  of  their  own  funds  and  that  A1  had  no
association therewith or contribution therefor  in  any  manner  whatsoever.
This, is in  the  face  of  the  accusation  of  the  prosecution  that  the
financial resources as well as the assets of A2 to A4 and the six  companies
were in fact those of A1, as A2 to A4 and the said companies did  not  have,
at all relevant times, any income, or wherewithal to acquire the  same.  The
Trial Court was thus alive to the assertion  of  the  prosecution  that  the
pecuniary resources and the properties of A2 to A4 and of the six  companies
as endeavoured to have been acquired from their funds were  held  in  benami
for and on behalf of A1. It proceeded to analyse  the  evidence  adduced  by
the prosecution on the touchstone of the  accepted  legal  formulation  that
benami transactions admitted of direct or  circumstantial  evidence  leading
to such inference and embarked on the process of scrutinizing the facts  and
circumstances  attendant  on  the   various   transactions   pertaining   to
acquisition of properties of the six  companies   of  which  A2  to  A4,  in
different combinations, were the directors, as well as  the cash flow  inter
se in their bank accounts.



 As the narration outlined by the Trial Court would reveal,  it  dealt  with
in minutest details the oral and documentary evidence available  on  record.
Without  resorting to a  dialectical  appraisal   of  the  evidence  of  the
individual witnesses and the  documents  brought  on  record,  it  would  be
suffice in our comprehension to notice the   salient  features   discernible
therefrom and strikingly common to the transactions.



 The evidence on record demonstrates that these  companies  though  were  in
existence from before the commencement of the check period and of  which  A3
and A4  were not the  directors  then,  did  neither  have  any  significant
business activity nor transaction nor any profit earning  pursuit  to  their
credit.  This  the  Trial  Court  rightly  noticed  was  apparent  from  the
relevant returns and  balance  sheets.  The  contemporaneous  evidence  also
evinced that these companies were not possessed of sufficient  resources  to
acquire properties to the extent amassed during the  check  period.  Neither
did these companies have fixed assets nor did they avail or  give  loans  to
evince financial  soundness  or  stability  permitting  acquisition  of  the
assets and properties as made during the check period.   In  all,  in  these
six companies, A3 and A4 were nominated  as  additional  directors/directors
in the year  1994   and  soon  thereafter   their  registered  office  stood
shifted to Shop No. 21, First Floor, Wellington  Plaza  No.  19,  Annasalai,
Madras.  The original directors resigned leaving the reins of the  companies
wholly with A3 and A4 in particular. Noticeably, soon after A3 and A4   were
inducted as  additional  directors/directors,  bank  accounts  were  opened.
Simultaneously A2 to A4 formed several partnership firms with the  principal
place of business thereof also at the  above  address.  Co-incidentally  the
dates of registration of most of these firms  were  common  in  batches  and
the  duration  of  their  existence  were   mentioned   to   be   at   will.
Significantly, A3 and A4 resigned from the above six companies  markedly  on
the eve of the expiry of the check period.



 The Trial Court, in details, took notice of the testimony of the  witnesses
examined  as  well  as  the  documents  on  the  aspect  of  acquisition  of
properties  by  these  six  companies.  The  witnesses  included   erstwhile
directors of these companies, bank officials who stated about  the   opening
of their accounts  as well as  advancement  of  loans,  the  concerned  sub-
registrars, who registered the  sale  deeds  of  lands  purchased  by  these
companies, officials from the office  of  the  Company  Registrar  and   Mr.
Shiva, Real Estate Agent, who acted as the agent/attorney  of  the  vendors,
whose lands were purchased by these companies.  The materials   examined  by
the Trial Court evidenced heavy deposits/withdrawals of cash  and  transfers
thereof  hitherto absent before A3, A4 had taken over  the  companies.   The
amounts varied very often in the range of Rs.10 lakhs and above.   The  pay-
in-slips for the deposits amongst others showed address of 36  Poes  Garden,
Chennai.  Transfers of heavy amounts to and from other accounts of A2 to  A4
and their  firms  also  surfaced.   The  income-tax  returns/balance  sheets
belatedly filed  also  demonstrated  exchanges  of  deposits  inter  se  the
accounts of A2 to A4 and their firms as well as these companies.



 In respect of the acquisition of the  immovable  properties,  the  evidence
attested that soon after A3 and A4 had become directors of these  companies,
they got involved in the negotiations and survey of  lands  intended  to  be
purchased.  The sales were got executed through the attorneys of the  owners
of the lands for which deeds of power of attorney were  obtained  from  such
owners.  Not only uneven bargains but  also  inadequate  consideration/price
by  undervaluing  the  properties  was  noticeable  in   the   transactions.
Evidence on record disclosed that instructions were issued from  the  higher
authorities to the Registrars/Sub-Registrars to respond  to  the  directions
issued from the office of A1  for  documentation  and  registration  of  the
deeds involving  such  purchases  and  as  a  matter  of  fact,  on  various
occasions, such precepts did come and were readily  complied  with.  Several
registrations were executed in the house of the vendors and at  times,  also
in the concerned office of  the  Registrar/Sub-Registrar.   The  sale  deeds
executed, which are not disputed so far as those relate to these  companies,
did not indicate  that  the  purchases  had  been  made  from  their  assets
existing prior thereto.  The evidence of the witnesses did suggest  as  well
that the registration norms were flexed and  that  resultant  irregularities
in the process were ignored  and  cast  aside  to  oblige  the  respondents.
Evidence of direct involvement of A3 and A4 in the purchase  of  shares  and
properties on behalf of Ramraj Agro Mills (Private) Limited and that  of  A3
in the purchase of property for  Meadow  Agro  Farms  (Private)  Limited  is
discernible from the evidence adduced.   In some cases, A2 was also  present
at the time of negotiations for such purchases.   The  active  role  of  Mr.
Shiva, the attorney of the owners, is apparent on the face of the records.



 The Trial Court also noticed the  evidence  that  the  companies  had  been
transferred to A3 and A4 at paltry sums. On a totality of  the  scrutiny  of
the evidence on record which significantly  is  adequately  exhaustive,  the
Trial  Court  held  that  at  the  relevant  time  of  acquisition  of   the
properties, as above, all the six companies were exclusively in the  control
and  management  of   A2   to   A4.   The   statement   of   the   erstwhile
directors/promoters  of  the  companies  that  they  did  not  purchase  any
property  in their names either  before  or  after  the  formation  of  such
companies was also taken note of. The Trial Court noted as well that  A2  to
A4 had taken over the management of the companies even  without  buying  the
requisite shares and concluded  that these entities in  fact  did  not  have
the trappings of a company.  It was  determined as well that none  of  these
companies had any account in their names before A3 and  A4  had  taken  over
the charge thereof and that there was no evidence to  demonstrate  that  the
funds of these companies had been utilised to purchase properties  in  their
names.   It recorded as  well,  that  the  funds  were  transferred  to  the
accounts of these companies either from the accounts held in  the  names  of
Namadhu MGR, M/s Jaya Publications or other firms of the  respondents  which
unassailably  proved  that  the  resources  for  the  acquisition   of   the
properties of these companies had in  fact  been  availed  from  A1  or  the
accounts maintained in the joint accounts of A1  and  A2.   That  admittedly
none of the companies had filed returns either before the Registrar  of  the
Companies or before the income tax authorities declaring the funds  for  the
purchase of properties or acquisitions made in the names  of  the  companies
was noted. The Trial Court also recorded the non-compliance of  the  various
provisions namely, i.e.  
Sections  209
,  
210
,  
211
,  
215
  and  
220
   of  the
Companies  Act  in  particular  to  conclude  that  as  required  by   these
provisions, no proper books of accounts had been maintained, no returns  had
been filed by these companies from the date of incorporation till  the  date
of attachment of  their properties pursuant to the notifications  issued  by
the Government of Tamil Nadu under  the  provisions  of  
Section  3
  of  the
Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance 1944 as per GOMS No.  120  dated  29.1.1997
and GOMS No. 1183   dated 25.9.1997. That the balance sheet and  profit  and
loss account of the companies were not maintained and processed as  mandated
by 
Sections 213
 and 
220
 of the Companies Act was also underlined. It was  of
the view as well that there was nothing on record to show that A2 to A4  had
convened any general meeting of the companies during the  relevant  time  or
that regular returns were filed before the Registrar as required  under  the
law.  It also noted that the companies  did  not  have  their  own  auditors
appointed under 
Section 234
 of the Companies Act and that  the  auditors  of
A1 to A4 themselves submitted  the  returns  after  the  properties  of  the
companies were  attached.   The  Trial  Court  thus  deduced  that  all  the
circumstances  conjointly  substantiated  that  the  acquisition  of   these
companies were never intended to be the assets thereof  and  were  also  not
treated to be their properties at any  point  of  time.   According  to  the
Trial Court, it was only after the attachment of  the  properties  that  the
respondents raised the contention that the ownership  thereof  did  vest  in
the companies and thus could not be said to have been held  benami  for  A1.
 The Trial Court also,  with  reference  to  the  certified  copies  of  the
orders in Misc. Petition No. 768/2014 dated  18.6.2014  and  Misc.  Petition
289/2014 dated 26.6.2004 passed under  
Section  5(3)
  of  the  Criminal  Law
Amendment Ordinance recorded that after the resignation of A3 and A4,  there
was no appointment of directors and that  seemingly  for  that  reason,  the
order of  attachment passed in 1997 was not assailed for nearly  two  years.
It thus rejected on a comprehensive analysis of the evidence on record,  the
contention of the respondents that the properties acquired in  the  name  of
the companies  did  belong  to  these  entities  and  could  not  have  been
assimilated in the assets of A1.



 Qua 'the respondents’  plea  that  the  companies  incorporated  under  the

Companies Act
 cannot hold property benami for another person, it  entered  a
finding that none of the documents of title registered in the names  of  the
companies did bear the seal thereof.  That in 90% of the  registered  deeds,
the companies were not represented by their secretary or director  and  that
the address of the companies  were not recorded in such  deeds,  was  noted.
The  Trial  Court  concluded  that  the  registrar  who   registered   these
properties and PW 181 who negotiated  with  the  purchasers,  distorted  the
rules to help A1 and they went out of his way to oblige her.  That  in  some
of the deeds, the names of the purchasers were not  included  and  that  the
properties were undervalued was reiterated.  The admission of  the  District
Registrar that  he  proceeded  with  the  registration  solely  because  the
properties were purchased by A1 was taken cognizance of.   It  was  thus  of
the view  that  the  intention  of  the  respondents  in   taking  over  the
companies  was for acquiring large number of properties in their  names  for
diverting the funds unlawfully amassed by A1  during  her  tenure  as  Chief
Minister of  the State. It  thus concluded that  the  properties  registered
in the names of these companies and which formed the subject matter of  GOMs
No. 1183 dated 25.9.1997 and GOMs No. 120  dated  12.1.1997  issued  by  the
State of Tamil Nadu  were really the properties acquired and held by  A2  to
A4 for and  on behalf of A1.



 The evidence  on  record  thus  propel  several  conspicuous  and  singular
features as noted comprehensively  by the Trial Court. Apart from  the  fact
that the  properties aforementioned  had  been  acquired  during  the  check
period, the general phenomenon decipherable is  that  the  acquisitions  had
been made in the names of the newly formed or acquired firms/companies  with
their directorial composition, as noticed hereinabove and the  two  existing
firms i.e. M.s. Jaya Publications and Sasi Enterprises of which  A1  and  A2
were partners.



 Evidently about 50  banks  accounts  were  opened  with  the  Indian  Bank,
Abhaypuram and Carana Bank, Mylapore in the names  of  accused  persons  and
the firms/companies as has been stated  by  PW182   and  PW201,  details  of
which are as under:

       The  accused  persons   also   availed   the   services   of   common
auditors/accountants.



  As  conspiracy  cannot  be  proved  by  direct  evidence  and  has  to  be
essentially inferred from  proven  circumstances,  the  ultimate  conclusion
with regard thereto has to be deduced from the attendant  state  of  affairs
cumulatively taken.   It  is  a  trite  proposition  that  in  the  case  of
conspiracy, each member thereof becomes the agent of the other  and  in  law
is bound by their actions inter se. So far as A1 and A2 are  concerned,  one
is the agent for other as partners of the two firms and additionally  A2  is
the attorney of A1 and is a  co-conspirator, as  imputed.  As  testified  by
PW198, a blanket  instruction had been issued by A1 that the  directions  as
made by A2 from time to  time ought to  be  followed  and  consequently  the
latter was to decide in which account the huge  cash  deposits  were  to  be
made. The numerous inter accounts transfers would only  corroborate  massive
unaccounted cash deposits being made, the origin  whereof  had  been  number
36, Poes Garden, Chennai.  For all  intents  and  purposes,  these  accounts
were construed to be one.



 The evidence of  PW47,  PW  71  and  PW  159  taken  together  attest  that
officials were used to   locate and purchase lands  at  various  places.  In
terms of the testimony of PW159 , in most of the sales, it was  A2  who  had
directed as to  the names of the firms/individuals to be  mentioned  in  the
sale deeds and in whose names the sales were to be registered.  The  amounts
had been paid from amongst various accounts of the  accused/firms/companies.
In many cases, the sale transactions had taken  place  below  the  guideline
value as has been deposed by PW159  and PW 221.



 The testimony of PW 15, PW 40, PW43, PW 56, PW 76, PW 89,  PW  160,  PW  77
and PW237  is amongst others to the  effect  that  the  vendors   were  kept
unaware  of the purchasers’ identity and in some cases were also  put  under
duress to agree to the transactions. Their statements also divulge that  not
only was A1 aware of  these  transactions  but  on  several  occasions,  the
registrations thereof were performed at her residence.



 Dealing with the plea that the companies incorporated under  the  
Companies
Act
 cannot hold properties in benami for another, the Trial  Court  recorded
that a company is a legal entity with  perpetual  succession  and  a  common
seal and  has to essentially act through   its  agents   and  all  contracts
entered into by them must be under the seal thereof.  It  observed  that  in
the case in hand there was hardly any document of title  registered  in  the
name of above companies bearing their seal.  It concluded  on  this  premise
that the properties purchased in the  names  of  the  companies  thus  never
acquired the status of  the   assets  thereof.   It  noticed,  as  well,  to
reiterate, that in 90% of the  registered  deeds,  the  companies  were  not
represented either by the Secretary or the Director and the  documents  also
did not contain the address of the companies which was  a  clear  indication
of the shady and murky deals undertaken  in  their  names  with  a  view  to
screen the  properties  acquired  through  illegal  means.   The  fact  that
evidence   had   disclosed   that   on   many   occasions,   the   concerned
Registrar/District Registrar had compromised the rules only  to  accommodate
A1 was adverted to in this context.   Referring  to  the  decision  of  Aron
Salomon (Pauper) Vs. A. Salomon and Company  Limited  (supra),  in  which  a
company, as a legal entity, is held to be distinct from  its  members,   the
court propounded that though as a corollary, its corporate veil normally  is
impervious,  but when its corporate identity  is applied to circumvent  law,
to defeat public policy, perpetuate fraud or illegality or is sought  to  be
used as a cover or a facade to justify a wrong,  defend  crime,  to  lend  a
name to private  dealing,  law  would  cease  to  acknowledge  it  to  be  a
corporate entity and afford such protection otherwise entitled to under  the
Companies Law. It concluded that when camouflaged transactions  are  carried
on behind the legal front, the court may lift the veil and look  behind  the
artificial personality of the company and identify  the  real  personalities
or natural persons operating behind  the  screen.  According  to  the  Trial
Court, the proved facts and circumstance of the  case,  did  establish  that
respondents had adopted an ingenious ploy or device in furtherance of  their
criminal conspiracy to shield the properties acquired  through  perpetration
of a series of offences and had illegally amassed wealth totaling 300  acres
of  land,  in  the  name  of  the  above  shell  companies  which  they  had
strategically taken over to present as a smoke screen  to  mask  such  large
scale transactions.  The Trial Court thus concluded that the acquisition  of
properties in such a colossal measure  along with the attendant  manoeuvres,
did manifest the criminal  motive  and  intention  of  the  accused  persons
attracting the ingredients of the offence under 
Section 13(1)(e)
 of the  Act
 read with 
Section 120B
 IPC.   It thus held  that the properties  registered
in the names of these six companies and which were  the  subject  matter  of
GOMS No. 1183 dated 25.9.1997 and GOMS  No.  120  dated  12.1.1997  were  in
reality  acquired and held by A2  to  A4  for  and  on  behalf  of  A1.   In
reaching this conclusion, the Trial Court also  did  allude  to  the  above-
referred decision of this Court that property held in the name of an  income
tax assessee per se did  not  signify  that  it  actually  belonged  to  the
assessee and that there was no embargo in getting  the  same  registered  in
the name of one person though the real beneficiary was another.



 In re the charge of abetment and conspiracy in general,  the  Trial  Court,
while dealing with the defence plea  that a non public servant could not  be
prosecuted for the offence under 
Section 109
 IPC  in  a   trial  constituted
under the Act, relied on the decision of this Court in P. Nallammal  (supra)
to the effect that the acquisition and  possession  of  any  property  by  a
public servant is capable of being abetted  and that  there  is  neither  an
express nor implied  exclusion  of  the  1988  Act   to  deal  with  such  a
situation.  The Trial Court  noted that under 
Section 3
  of  the  1988  Act,
the Special Judge had the power to try not only an offence punishable  under
the said statute but also one for conspiracy to commit or attempt to  commit
or abetment of any offence thereunder.   The  Trial  Court  thus  held  that
private individuals could be prosecuted by the Special Court under  the  Act
on the ground that they had conspired with and abetted the act  of  criminal
misconduct committed by a public  servant  within  the  meaning  of  
Section
13(1)(e)
 of the 1988 Act.



 Turning to the charge of criminal conspiracy,  the  Trial  Court,  noticing
the ingredients of the offence as enumerated in 
Section 120A
  IPC,  recorded
that  agreement   is  the  gist  of  the  offence   and  that  mere  passive
cognizance of a conspiracy is not sufficient. While  acknowledging  that  to
constitute an offence of criminal  conspiracy,  there  ought  to  be  active
cooperation  in furtherance of a  joint  evil  intent,  it  underlined   the
rule of evidence relating to such offence that  anything  said  or  done  by
anyone  of  the  conspirators,   with  regard  thereto,  is  under   certain
circumstances evidence against the other,  the logic being  that within  the
realm of conspiracy, the position of the conspirators is analogous  to  that
of partners, one being considered as the agent of the other.   Negating  the
assertion made on behalf of the respondents that the prosecution had  failed
to produce any material to demonstrate that A2, A3 and  A4  had  engaged  in
any criminal conspiracy with A1  in  order  to  acquire  properties  on  her
behalf  by  utilising  her  un-accounted  finances,  as  they  had  business
activities and income independent therefrom totally  unconnected  with  her,
the Trial Court recounted  the entire gamut of the prosecution  evidence  to
the effect that at the relevant time, A2, A3 and  A4  did  not  possess  any
source of income   proportionate to the value of the assets  purchased   and
held in their names  and in the name of the  six  companies  in  particular.
It traced the testimony, amongst others  of  PW128  Balakrishnan,  PW169  R.
Krishnamoorthy,  PW170  R.  Jayaraman  and  the  corresponding   documentary
evidence to hold that A2, A3  and  A4  indeed  had  neither  the  source  of
income,  means  or  the  wherewithal  to  be  capable  of  making  the  huge
acquisitions in their names or for their firms/companies  during  the  check
period. Referring, in particular, to the properties acquired  by  A3  either
in his name or in the name of  firms/companies  involved,  compared  to  his
income and the expenditure made, the Trial Court reverted  to  the  evidence
of PW 201, the officer of the Canara Bank, Mylapore  who,  inter  alia,  had
disclosed that in the application filed by this respondent  for  opening  of
his saving bank account No. 24621, he had given his address as No. 36,  Poes
Garden, Chennai-86.  This witness testified by adverting to the  ledger  for
this account which on 30.4.1996, showed  a  balance  of  Rs.61,430/-.  Prior
thereto, on 17.7.1992, A3 had remitted cash through signed  pay-in-slip  for
an amount of Rs.5 lakh   to this account.   He  clarified  further  that  in
this saving bank account, many receipts were  made  through  clearance.   He
referred to a withdrawal of Rs.5 lakh by this respondent on  7.12.1992  from
this account,  who  deposited  the  sum  in  a  fixed  deposit  account  No.
1401/1992 which on maturity was credited to his current  account  No.  2220.
This witness disclosed further that the application submitted by A3 to  open
this current account carried an introduction  by A2 and the address here  as
well was mentioned as 36, Poes Garden, Chennai.   Though  this  account  was
opened on 7.4.1993 by remitting an amount of Rs.501 by A3,  on 24.9.1994,  a
sum of Rs.4,10,000 was received in  deposit in the account by way  of  cash.
The Trial Court made an   itemised reference to  various  deposits  made  in
this account of heavy sums varying from Rs.26000 to Rs.11 lakhs  from  other
accounts standing inter alia in the name of A2 and several  other  firms  of
which A1, A2 and A3 in particular were  partners.  That  huge  amounts  were
credited through clearance and were similarly withdrawn were referred to  by
this witness.



 The Trial Court, thus deduced that the acquisitions of the properties  made
by A3 were out of the funds diverted from the accounts either of  A1  or  A2
and A3 and A4 did not invest any fund with regard  thereto.



 While dwelling on the charge of conspiracy and abetment,  the  Trial  Court
took cognizance of the formation of large number of firms in  the  names  of
A2 to A4 during the relevant period to be a  circumstance  establishing  the
said imputation.   That A1 and A2  had  commenced  partnership  business  by
constituting two partnership firms by the name Jaya  Publications  and  Sasi
Enterprises and though Jaya Publications  was  registered under   the  
Sales
Tax Act, 1988
 on 29.9.1988, it did not file returns up to 1998  as  per  the

Sales Tax Act
, was noted.    The  disclosure  of  PW3  Thangavelu,  District
Registrar, who at the relevant time was serving as Assistant  Chief  in  the
Registration Department, South District, Chennai and that he had  registered
eight firms out of which six namely;   J.J. Leasing  and  Maintenance,  J.S.
Housing Development, Green Farm House, Jaya Farm Houses, J. Real Estate  and
Jay Contractors   and  Builders  were  registered  on  the  same  date  i.e.
25.1.1994, taken note of.  The Trial  Court  also  took  cognizance  of  the
testimony of PW132, Prakashoon Epen Leelavati, District  Registrar,  Central
Chennai District Registration Office,  who  claimed  to  have  proved    the
certified copies of Form No. 1 relating to the  registration  of  ten  firms
with A2, A3, A4 and Lex Property Development Private  Limited  as  partners,
all registered incidentally on the same date i.e. 15.2.1995.   Reference  to
the statement of PW 230 Balaji on oath that he had  been  appointed  as  the
Auditor by A2 to A4 and that the firms referred to by him did  not  buy  any
property or invest in any other business but received money   as  loans  and
further that ten of such firms had closed their bank accounts  in  1995  was
taken note of.  According to  the  Trial  Court,  the  overall  evidence  as
considered by it disclosed that the business activities in the names of  A2,
A3 and A4 started only during the check period and that they did not  invest
any funds on their own for that purpose and in  fact  utilised  these  as  a
front to enable A1 and A2 to transfer huge  unaccounted  money  through  the
bank accounts thereof.



 The Trial Court noted that at the commencement of the check  period,  there
were hardly 10 to 12 bank accounts standing in the names of A1  and  A2  but
thereafter 50 accounts mushroomed during the check period as deposed by  PWs
182, 201, 207,209 and 239.  The particulars of the bank accounts, the  names
of the banks, the dates of opening thereof, and the  corresponding  exhibits
along with the names of the account holders were marked in details.



 Referring to the evidence of PW-201 in particular,  the  remittances  inter
se the accounts of A1 to A4 and  their  firms   also  were  set  out   which
would demonstrate  that the exchanges during  the  check  period   were  not
only  noticeably  frequent and numerous  but also  did  sum  up  to  figures
fluctuating  from Rs.12000/- to Rs.25,00,000/- as  would  be   evident  from
the particulars of such transfers involving the accounts of A1, A2, A3,  A4,
Namadhu MGR, Fax Universal, Anjaneya Printers, Green Farm House  and  Meadow
Agro Farm.



 Oral evidence in the form of testimony of  M.  Jayaraman  (PW-198),   Mani,
Ram Vijayan & Balakrishnan and the  documents  adduced  by  the  prosecution
through the witnesses prove that an amount  of  Rs.13,55,28,685.50  in  all,
had been deposited by cash through pay-in-slips  in the current accounts  of
A2 to A4 and the firms  by  these  witnesses  and  others.   These  deposits
significantly  had been made during the check period and  apart  from  heavy
amounts  on  every   occasion,   varying   from    above    Rs.50,000/-   to
Rs.33,70,000/-, there is a noticeable frequency thereof in  close  proximity
with each other.  The pay-in-slips proved in support of such  cash  deposits
and exhibited by the witnesses concerned even disclose deposits  of  various
amounts in different accounts on  the  very  same  date.   As  many  as  184
deposits between 17.9.1992 and 8.3.1996 have been made  in  current  account
No. 1952 of Namadhu MGR.  As many as 267 deposits  have  been  made  by  Ram
Vijayan himself only, totalling Rs.8,96,52,623.30 out of  the  total  amount
of  Rs.13,55,28,685/- indicated hereinabove, apart from  M.  Jayaraman  (PW-

198),  Mani,  Ram Vijayan & Balakrishnan  through  whom  deposits  had  been
made.  A2 and A3 as well have through pay-in-slips made such deposits  of  a
sum of Rs.28,74,000/-.  The noteworthy feature of  these  deposits  is  that
the same had not been in the account of A1.  Not only the cash  deposits  of
such a huge amount is out of the ordinary, the mode thereof i.e. by  pay-in-
slips  through  a  selected  few  and  the  frequency  thereof   render   an
overwhelming phenomenon, highly redolent and  admitting  of  a  logical  and
persuasive inference  of  laundering  of  gigantic  unaccounted  cash.   The
absence of  deposits  in  the  account  of  A1  in  the  multitude  of  such
operations admits  of  reasonable  and  unimpeachable  conclusion  that  the
wealth in circulation had its origin in her coffers. On a rational  analysis
of such mammoth inflow of  cash  in  the  accounts  of  A2  to  A4  and  the
firms/companies involved during the check  period,  the  conclusion  of  the
Trial Court that these resources were at all relevant times held  by  A2  to
A4 and their firms/companies on behalf of A1 in order to veil her  otherwise
unexplained  disproportionate assets is unassailable.



 The Trial Court next probed into the credit entries of  the  relevant  bank
accounts of the respondents  to seek the trail of  the fund flow   and  thus
examined the deposits of cash into their bank accounts and also in those  of
the  firms/companies  floated  by  them  spanning    from   Rs.10,000/-   to
Rs.33,70,000/.  On an audit of the  current and  saving  bank  accounts   of
the  respondents  and  the  firms  involved,  the  Trial  Court   identified
unexplained cash credits of huge sums  therein varying  from  Rs.2684.90  to
Rs.1,26,00,000/- involving the respondents, Namadhu MGR,  Sasi  Enterprises,
Vinod Video  Vision,  Jaya  Publications,  J.  Farm  House,  Maha  Subalaxmi
Kalayana Mandapam, Anjaneya Printers Private Limited, Fresh Mushroom,  Metal
King, Super Duper T.V. Private Limited, Lex  Property Development  Pvt.Ltd.,
Riverway Agro Production Private Limited, Fax Universal,  Meadow  Agro  Farm
Pvt. Limited,  Namay  Shivaya  Housing  Development,  Vigneshwara  Builders,
Laxmi Constructions,  Sea  Enclave,  Ayyappa  Property  Development  Private
Limited, Ocean  Construction,  Gopal  Promoters,  Green  Garden  Apartments,
Shakti Constructions, J. S. Housing Development, Ramraj Agro  Mills  Private
Limited.  Noticeably except Jaya Publications and Sasi  Enterprises,  A2  to
A4 and Lex Property Development Private Limited were  the  partners  of  the
other firms named above.



 
In this context, the Trial Court inter alia referred  to  the  decision  of
this Court in 
Kale Khan Mohammad Hanif Vs. C.I.T.
, (1963)  50  ITR  1  (SC),
wherein it was expounded  that the onus was on the assessee to  explain  the
nature and source  of  cash  credits  as  to  whether  those  stood  in  the
assessee's account or in the account of a third party and that the  assessee
had a legal obligation to explain the nature and source of  such  credit  by
proving prima facie the transaction(s) that had yielded  such  accruals   in
his books of account.




 The Trial Court held the view that the respondents in the case in hand  had
failed to offer any satisfactory explanation with  regard  to  the  enormous
unexplained credit/accumulations in their bank accounts.   It  rejected  the
confirmatory letter offered by  the  respondents  as  false  and  bogus  and
further held that the identity of the person who disclosed the  source,  had
also not been proved.  Further the transactions which  generated  such  cash
credits were also not established.  It rejected as well  the  balance  sheet
and the profit and loss statement claimed to  have  been  filed  before  the
income tax authorities and on which  the  respondents  primarily  relied  as
their defence, as not proved in accordance with law besides   being  not  in
conformity with the statutory  prescriptions.   It  discarded  as  well  the
evidence of the auditors examined by the respondents who,  as  the  evidence
on record testified, were not conversant with the true  facts  and  had  not
handled their accounts during the check period.   The Trial  Court  returned
the finding that the evidence on record cumulatively substantiated that  the
returns, the   balance   sheet and the profit and loss accounts were  framed
and fashioned to offer an explanation to the otherwise  titanic  unexplained
credits in their respective bank accounts.  The Trial Court thus  held  that
the respondents had failed to prove  their  defence,  when  tested   on  the
evidence adduced even by  the  standard  of  preponderance  of  probability.



 While observing that  mere  declaration  of  property  in  the  income  tax
returns  does not ipso facto  connote that the same had been  acquired  from
the known lawful sources of income, the Trial Court held the view  that  the
prosecution could successfully establish  that  the  respondents  and  their
firms/companies,  who posed to be income tax assessees, had  no  independent
or real source of income  and that  it  was  the  finance  of  A1  that  was
really in circulation and thus it could prove beyond reasonable  doubt  that
the only source of money the acquisition  of   large  assets  was  that   of
hers.



 The evidence of PW198 M. Jayaraman, a member of staff with A1 in her  house
at Poes Garden, at the relevant point of time,  admitting  remittances  into
various bank accounts through Mr. Vijayan on the  instructions  of  A2   was
referred to in particular.  That this witness had stated  that  A2  used  to
instruct him about the details of the bank to which the  deposit  ought   to
be credited  and that the amounts used to be dispatched in  suit  cases  and
bags through domestic servants was taken note of.    The  Trial  Court  took
into consideration his testimony that  he  used  to  fill  the  challans  as
directed by A2 which he identified in the course  of  his  examination.   He
identified too, the signatures of Mr. Vijayan on the challans.    The  Trial
Court also took note of the  evidence  of  PW  182  and  PW  201,  the  bank
officers who identified/proved  large  numbers  of  pay-in-slips   and  also
affirmed that those bore the  name of Mr. Vijayan as  the  person  remitting
the amounts mentioned.  These witnesses had stated  further,   as  noted  by
the Trial Court, that the pay orders and the demand drafts  issued  by  them
for the purpose of acquisition of  the  assets  as  involved   were  at  the
instance of the respondents.  That these demand drafts  or  the  pay  orders
could be directly related to the cheques or pay  orders  mentioned   in  the
various sales deeds  was recorded as well.  This too, as held by  the  Trial
Court, did establish the nexus of the funds of A1 with the investments  made
for the acquisition of such assets.    The Trial Court  thus  sustained  the
charge levelled by the  prosecution  that  all  the   assets  and  pecuniary
resources found to be possessed by A2 to A4 and  in  the  names  of  various
firms/companies actually  belonged to A1 and thus  she   in  fact  possessed
the assets  and pecuniary resources of the total  value  of  Rs.55,02,48,215
in her name and in the names of A2 to A4 and  of the firms/companies,   thus
establishing  the ingredients of the offence under Section 13(1)(e)  of  the
P. C. Act.  It held the view that A2 to A4  as  the  evidence  substantiated
had conspired  with A1 and had actively abetted  in collaboration with  each
other with the sole object of acquiring and holding properties   and  assets
disproportionate to the known sources of income of A1.



  This according to the  Trial  Court  stood  corroborated   by  the   large
number  of   accounts  opened  in  the  names  of  the  respondents  or   of
firms/companies and the disbursements to these accounts only  by  the  staff
of A1 on the instructions of A2 who was in-charge of her financial  affairs.
 The Trial Court also took cognizance of  the  fact  that  the  evidence  on
record  established  that except Super Duper T.V. Private  Limited,  neither
the respondents nor their firms  did  credit   any  amount  to  the  various
accounts standing in their names.  Rather,  all   these  firms   had  gained
deposits transferred to their accounts either from that of  Namadhu  MGR  or
Jaya  Publications.  Reiterating  the  rejection  of   the   plea   of   the
respondents, that large deposits  collected  from  various   subscribers  of
Namadhu MGR totalling Rs.15  crores had been credited  in  the  accounts  of
Namadhu MGR and Jaya Publications, the Trial Court   reaffirmed  that  these
deposits  in fact represented the un-explained wealth accumulated by A1.



 The Trial Court in  the  ultimate  analysis  summed  up  the  circumstances
gleaned  from  the  evidence  on  record  to  conclusively  hold  that   the
prosecution could  prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the  charges  levelled
against the respondents as framed.  While  enumerating  finally  the  facets
substantiating this determination, the Trial Court took  note  of  the  fact
that A1 had executed a general power of attorney (Ex. P-995)  in  favour  of
A2 in respect of Jaya Publications as A1, at  all  relevant  time,  was  the
partner of the said firm.  That such a power of attorney was  otherwise  not
necessary and that this authority was thus endowed on A2 so as to  lend  her
a free hand in the management of Jaya Publications so as to  facilitate  the
defence of A1 that she used to be a dormant partner and was unaware  of  the
transactions carried on by A2 was recorded.  The Trial  Court  however  held
the view that by the execution  of  such  power  of  attorney,  in  law,  A1
rendered herself liable for all acts and deeds of A2 pursuant to the  powers
so conferred.  It correlated the flow of funds  accumulated  by  A1  to  the
account of Jaya Publications and thereafter to branch out the same to  other
accounts to be eventually appropriated for the acquisition of  huge  assets.
The Trial Court thus rejected the stand of A1 that she was  unaware  of  the
activities of A2, her agent with regard to the transfer  of  the  funds  and
the mode of utilization thereof.



 The constitution of various firms during the  check  period  was  cited  as
well to  be  another  circumstance  to  prove  the  conspiracy  amongst  the
respondents.  The Trial Court re-counted that at  the  commencement  of  the
check period, A1 and A2 were involved in the two concerns  namely  M/s  Jaya
Publication and M/s Sasi Enterprises but during the check period as many  as
18/21 firms did come into existence.  The Trial Court  reiterated  that  the
evidence on record however proved that none of these  firms  either  carried
on business during the check period or contributed any share capital  to  or
receive any profit from these firms.  The fact that in a single day, ten  of
such firms have been constituted with  identical  features  was  reiterated.
The Trial Court did recall as well  that  not  only  A2  and  A3  did  start
independent  concerns  in  their  names,   even   defunct   companies   were
purchased/taken over by the respondents.  However, none of  these  firms  or
companies  did  actually  carry  on  any  business  except  acquiring   huge
properties.  Referring to the fact that at the time of opening of  the  bank
accounts  of  these  firms/companies,  none  of  these  entities   had   any
independent resources, the Trial Court deduced  that  these  firms/companies
were nothing but extensions of Namadhu MGR and Jaya  Publications  and  owed
their existence to the benevolence of A1 and A2  for  continued  sustenance.
It reiterated that the proved fact that large amount of funds were  diverted
to these accounts was a clear attestation of the fact that these firms  were
constituted to only siphon off the unlawful resources amassed  by  A1.   The
fact that these firms/companies did operate from the residence of A1  belied
the feigned ignorance of A1 about their activities, was  noted.   The  joint
residence of all the accused persons also could not be ignored as  a  factor
contributing to  the  charge  of  conspiracy  and  abetment   when  assessed
together with the attendant facts and  circumstances  reinforcing  the  said
imputations.  This also belied, according to the Trial Court,  the  specious
plea of A2 to A4 that each one of them  had  independent  business  and  own
source of income.  The fact that A2 to A4  did  combine  to  constitute  the
firms to acquire huge tracts of land out of the funds provided  by  A1  also
was a clear index  that  their  assemblage  in  the  house  of  A1  was  not
engendered by any philanthropic urge for  friends  and  their  relations  in
need, rather to frame and  further  the  criminal  conspiracy  to  hold  the
assets of A1.  The fact that the materials on record did evince that A1  had
not only advanced Rs.1 crore to Shasi Enterprises as a contribution  to  its
share capital for which she availed  loan,  but  also  that  she  did  issue
several cheques in favour of other accused  persons  and  filed  application
for availing loan for the benefit of the firms involved,  did  buttress  the
charge that she was wholly aware of the dealings of the co-accused  and  the
firms in their minutest details.  The free flow of money  from  one  account
to the other of the respondents,  the  firms/companies  also  proved  beyond
reasonable doubt that all the accused persons had actively  participated  in
the conspiracy to  launder  the  ill-gotten  wealth  of  A1  for  purchasing
properties in their names.  The fact that the assets and properties  of  the
six companies were attached pursuant to the provisions of the  Criminal  Law
Amendment Ordinance and that the applications for vacating  the  attachments
were not filed for more than two years therefrom did make it  apparent  that
no other person except the  accused  were  interested  therein.   The  Trial
Court rightly did mark as well, referring in particular to the  evidence  of
PW159 Sub-Registrar, North Beach, Sub  Registrar’s  Office  and  PW71  Radha
Krishnan, Horticulture Officer that they were called to Poes Garden  and  on
the instructions of higher officers,  they did oblige A1  even  by  relaxing
the rules in the  registration  of  large  number  of  documents  by  taking
personal interest and even overlooking that the properties were  undervalued
to hold a deep seated involvement  of  A1 in these transactions.   That  the
registering authorities had gone to the extent  of  permitting  registration
of six documents even without incorporating the  names  of  the  purchasers,
was referred to.  The Trial  Court  in  its  conclusion,  on  an  exhaustive
analysis of the evidence as a whole, held the following facts to  have  been
proved by the prosecution beyond all reasonable doubt.




|I)   |Total assets found in possession of A-1 as  | Rs.55,02,48,215     |
|     |on 30.4.1996                                |                     |
|II)  |Total expenditure incurred by the accused   |Rs. 8,49,06,833/-    |
|     |during the check period                     |                     |
|III) |Total of (I) and (II)                       |Rs. 63,51,55,048/-   |
|IV)  |Total income of accused from all sources as |Rs. 9,91,05,094/-    |
|     |determined above                            |                     |
|V)   |Value of disproportionate assets and        |Rs. 53,60,49,55,954/-|
|     |pecuniary resources found in possession of  |                     |
|     |accused as on 30.04.1996 which has not been |                     |
|     |satisfactorily accounted.                   |                     |





 In view of this, the Trial  Court  convicted  A1  for  the  offences  under

Section 13(1)(e)
 r/w 
Section 13(2)
 of the PC Act.  Further  A1  to  A4  were
convicted under 
Section 120-B
 IPC r/w 
Section 13(1)(e)
 r/w 
Section 13(2)
  of
the PC Act as well.  A2 to A4 were  additionally  convicted  under  
Sections
109
 IPC  r/w    13(1)(e)  r/w  13(2)  of  the  
PC  Act
  and  sentenced  them
accordingly as heretobefore mentioned.



 The Trial Court further ordered that necessary directions be issued to  the
concerned banks to remit the proceeds of the fixed  deposits  and  the  cash
balance standing to the credit of the respective accused  persons  in  their
bank accounts  to be appropriated and adjusted  towards  the  fine  amounts.
It was directed as well that if even after such adjustment, the amount  fell
short of the quantum of fine, the gold and  diamond  ornaments,  seized  and
produced before the court (after setting   apart  7040  gms.  of  gold  with
proportionate diamond jewellery) be sold to RBI or SBI or by public  auction
so as to meet the deficit. The rest of the gold and  diamond  jewellery  was
directed to be confiscated to the Government.



 It further ordered that all immovable properties registered  in  the  names
of Lex Property Developments Pvt. Ltd., Meadow Agro Firms  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Rama
Raj Agro Mills (P) Ltd., Signora Business Enterprises  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Riverway
Agro Production (P) Ltd. and Indo Doha  Chemicals  and  Pharmaceutical  Ltd.
which were under attachment  pursuant to GO Nos.  MS  120  and  1183,  above
referred to  be confiscated to the State Government.   It  ordered  as  well
that out of the fine amount recovered, a sum of Rs.5 crores   be  made  over
to the State of Karnataka towards reimbursement of expenses  for  the  trial
conducted thereat.



 As  many  as  34  companies/firms  fell  for  scrutiny  in  the  course  of
adjudication.  Out of these Jaya  Publications,  Sasi  Enterprises,  Signora
Business  Enterprises  Private  Limited,  Lex  Property   Development   Pvt.
Limited, Riverway Agro Production Private Limited,  Meadow  Agro  Firm  Pvt.
Limited, Indo Doha Chemical and Pharmaceutical  Limited, Ram Raj Agro  Mills
Limited   did  exist  from  before  the  check  period.   The  others   were
registered during the check period and notably, the date of registration  of
six of these had been 25.1.1994 and three bank accounts   of  five  of  them
had been opened on the same date i.e. 27.1.1994.  Further ten of such  firms
 had been registered on 15.2.1995 and their bank accounts  had  been  opened
on 23.3.1995.  To say the least, in the  context  of  the  charge  levelled,
this  co-incidence  also  is  conspicuously  abnormal  and   irreconcilable.
Another note worthy feature  is that in most of these firms, A2, A3  and  A4
are the partners with Lex Property Development Pvt.  Limited,  joining  them
in some.  There are firms as well where either A2 or A3  is  the  proprietor
and others are with the combination of A2, A3  and  A4.    As  the  evidence
with regard to the affairs of the six firms in whose names large tracts   of
properties had been purchased and  deposits  made,  has  been  dilated  upon
hereto before, the same does not warrant further elaboration.



  The unimpeded, frequent and spontaneous inflow of funds from  the  account
of A1 to those of the other co-accused  and  the  firms/companies  involved,
overwhelmingly  demonstrate  the  collective  culpable  involvement  of  the
respondents in the transactions in the face of  their  overall  orientations
so as to render the same to be masked  banking  exchanges  though  involving
several accounts but mostly of the same bank.  No other view is possible.



 Apart from the above, the demurral   of  unfairness  in  investigation  and
trial also cannot be sustained in  the  overall  factual  conspectus.   True
that in course of the investigation, some documents had  been  seized  which
were  not  adduced  in  evidence  being  construed  to  be  irrelevant   for
substantiating  the  charge,  but  it  did  not  certainly   tantamount   to
suppression thereof so as to afflict the trial with the vice  of  unfairness
and non-transparency as alleged.  Additionally, the courts did intervene  as
permissible in law wherever merited to ensure against any prejudice qua  the
parties.  The fact that the documents seized  but not  brought  on  evidence
by the prosecution  had  not  been  destroyed  and  were  available  to  the
respondents for their inspection, at all relevant  times,  is,  per  se,  an
index of fair and impartial  trial.   The defence as a matter of record  did
at some point of time close its side  of  evidence  by  examining  only  two
witnesses, whereafter following the inspection of the documents, as  desired
by the respondents, after A1 had returned  to power, examined as many as  99
witnesses.  Prior thereto, 76 prosecution witnesses  were  permitted  to  be
recalled for further cross-examination.  The  remonstrance  that  the  Trial
Court did not take into consideration  the  defence  evidence  is  also  not
borne out by the records.  As  would  be  evident  from  its  judgment,  the
testimony of several witnesses examined  by  the  respondents  received  in-
depth appreciation by the Trial Court  wherever  relevant.   The  contention
that the Trial Court had conducted the trial in a manner prejudicial to  the
respondents in the overall context, both factual and legal, thus  cannot  be
sustained.



 That the Trial Court was meticulous, sensitive, vigilant and judicious   in
appraisal, stands authenticated by the fact  that in valuing the assets,  as
warranted, it excluded a sum of Rs.32 lakhs  towards  the  price  of  sarees
and further reduced the value of gold and diamond  to  the  extent  of  Rs.2
crores. It also allowed reduction in the marriage expenses by more than  50%
and  further  discounted  the  value  of  constructions  by   permitting   a
depreciation of 20%.



 Apropos the off repeated grievance, of the defence  that  the  Trial  Court
had left out of consideration  material pieces of evidence  adduced  by  it,
suffice it to state that  the decision   rendered  by  it  proclaim  to  the
contrary.   In all the aspects  amongst  others    income,  expenditure  and
assets, the judgment of the Trial Court  reveals on a  plain  reading   that
the evidence adduced by the defence  as construed to be  relevant   had  not
only been taken note of  but also analysed and  applied   for  arriving   at
the conclusions   on the issues pertaining  to  the  adjudication.   Whereas
qua income,   reference  of  the  testimony  of  the  defence  witnesses  is
decipherable   amongst  others     pertaining  to   the  scrutiny  involving
Namadhu MGR, Super Duper T.V., gifts  offered  to  A1,  rental  income   and
income tax returns, the Trial Court did also  assess  the  defence  evidence
 while judging the case  on the issues of marriage of A3,   expenditure  and
as well as valuation of buildings.   The cavil to the contrary  thus  cannot
be entertained.  Further this plea though elaborated in  details  in  course
of  the  arguments  in  the  present  proceedings    was  not   taken   very
specifically before the High Court  by  the  respondents  while  challenging
their conviction.  Significantly, such a grievance has also  not  been  made
by them by laying a formal challenge to  such  purported  omissions  on  the
part of the Trial Court, before this Court, as  contemplated  in  law.    In
this  persuasive  backdrop,  we  are  thus  disinclined  to   sustain   this
contention. This is more so as in view of  the  appraisal  of  the  relevant
evidence as a whole, we are of the unhesitant  opinion   that  the  impugned
judgment and order  of the High Court suffers from manifest  errors  on  the
face of the record, both on facts and in law and is liable to be  set-aside.



 The Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944 (referred to as the  “Ordinance”
as well),  which was enforced w.e.f. 23.8.1944 is an yield  of the  exercise
of powers under 
Section 72
 of the Government  of  India  Act,  1935  and  is
directed to  prevent the disposal or concealment  of  property  procured  by
means of the offences enlisted in the Schedule thereto.   To   iterate,  for
the instant adjudication, paragraphs 4A and 5 of the Schedule are  extracted
hereinbelow for immediate reference:



4-A: an offence punishable under the 
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
;



5 : Any conspiracy to commit or any attempt to commit or  any  abetment   of
any of the offences  specified in item 2,3 and 4 and 4-A.

As the present appraisal does not involve the other offences  enumerated  in
the Schedule, those are not being dwelt upon.



 Clause 3 of the Ordinance  provides that  where the State Government or  as
the case may be, the Central Government  has  reason  to  believe  that  any
person has committed, whether after the commencement  of  the  Ordinance  or
not,  any  scheduled  offence  and  whether  or  not  any  court  has  taken
cognizance thereof, it may authorise the making of  an  application  to  the
District Judge within the local  limits  of  whose  jurisdiction,  the  said
person ordinarily resides or carries on business,   for  attachment  of  any
money or other property, believed to have been procured  by  means  of  such
offence.  It also permits that if such money or  property  cannot   for  any
reason be  attached, the prayer  in  the  application  may  be  extended  to
other property of the  said  person  of  the  value  as  nearly  as  may  be
equivalent  thereto.  The provisions did make  applicable  Order  XXVII   of
the First Schedule to 
the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908 to  the  proceedings
for an order of attachment under the Ordinance as  they  did  apply  to  the
suits by the Government.



 
Section  4
  contemplates  ad  interim  attachment  by  the  jurisdictional
District Judge, in the eventualities as mentioned therein  and  while  doing
so, he is required to issue to the person whose money or other property  was
being  attached,  a  notice  accompanied  by  copies  of  the   order,   the
application and affidavits and of the evidence, if recorded, asking  him  to
show cause on a date to be specified in the notice as to why  the  order  of
attachment should not be made absolute.  Clause  5   empowers  the  District
Judge to make the ad interim order of  attachment  absolute,  if  either  no
objection is filed by the person affected or  not  varied   after  necessary
enquiry  on a consideration of the objection if filed, and the  evidence  is
adduced.   In terms of clause 10 of the Ordinance, an  order  of  attachment
of property made shall unless it is withdrawn, continue to be in force,   in
a contingency where a court has taken cognizance  of  the  alleged  schedule
offence whether, before or after the time  when  the order was applied  for,
until  orders are passed by  the  District  Judge  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  of  the  Ordinance  after  the  termination  of   the   criminal
proceedings.  Clause 11 provides for appeals against  the  order(s)  of  the
District Judge, in the matter of attachment before the  jurisdictional  High
Court.  Whereas clause 12  makes  it  incumbent   on  the  court  trying   a
scheduled offence, when apprised of an order of attachment of  the  property
involved under the Ordinance, to record a finding, in  case  of  conviction,
as to the amount of money or  value  of  other  property  procured   by  the
accused by means of the offence, Clause 13 mandates the manner  of  disposal
of such attached property upon  termination  of  the  criminal  proceedings.
Thereunder, when the final judgment or order of the criminal  court  is  one
of conviction, the District Judge shall order that   from  the  property  of
the convicted person attached under the Ordinance or  out  of  the  security
given in lieu of such attachment, there shall  be  forfeited  to  Government
such amount or value as is  found  in the final  judgment or order   of  the
criminal court, to have been procured by  the convicted person, by means  of
the offence together with the costs  of  attachment  as  determined  by  the
District Judge.  Sub-clause 4 deals  with  a  situation  where  the  amounts
ordered to be forfeited  or recovered  exceed the value of the  property  of
the convicted person attached, thus permitting  in  that  eventuality,   the
steps to follow.  Sub-clause (6) ordains  that   every  sum  ordered  to  be
forfeited   in  connection  with  any  scheduled  offence  other  than   one
specified in item 1 of the schedule, would after deduction of  the  cost  of
attachment  as  determined  by  the  District  Judge,  be  credited  to  the
Government or the local authority to which the offence has  caused  loss  or
where there is more than one such government  or  local  authority,   to  be
distributed amongst them in the proportion to the loss sustained by each.



 Noticeably “termination of criminal proceedings”, as per  clause  2(2),  as
relevant for our present purpose, would be where this Court would  pass  its
final order in the present appeals.



 In the appeals, filed by the State of Karnataka pertaining to  the  release
of the properties recorded in  the  name  of  the  six  companies  involved,
consequent  upon  the  acquittal  of  the  respondents,  the   parties   are
essentially at issue on the applicability or otherwise  of  
Section  452
  of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 invoked by the  Trial  Court  to  order
confiscation/forfeiture of  the  properties  otherwise  attached  under  the
Ordinance. The other  facets  of  the  competing  assertions  being  largely
common and already addressed, are inessential for a fresh scrutiny.



 
Whereas it is urged on behalf of the State that having  regard to  the
scheme of the Act and the  mode of attachment of the property involved in  a
scheduled offence,  the  operation  of  
Section  452
  of  the  Code  is  not
excluded, the plea on behalf of the respondents is that the Ordinance  being
 a complete code  by  itself,  the  Trial  Court  was   patently   wrong  in
assuming to itself the power of disposal of the  property  under  attachment
by invoking the said provision of the Code.   It has been urged  in  essence
on behalf of the respondents that  at the most, the Trial Court  could  have
valued the property under  attachment  following  its  conclusion  of  guilt
against them, leaving it thereafter to the  forum  under  the  Ordinance  to
comply with the procedure prescribed therein and further the process to  its
logical end. This is more so, as has been urged for  the  respondents,  that
the appeals against the orders making the  ad  interim  attachment  absolute
are pending  before the High  Court  as  permissible  under  the  Ordinance.
Principally, reliance, amongst others  has been placed  by  the  respondents
on the decision of a Constitution Bench of this  Court   in  
State  of  West
Bengal Vs. S.K. Ghosh
, AIR 1963 SC 255.




 In our comprehension, the course adopted  by  the  Trial  Court  cannot  be
faulted with.  To reiterate, in terms of 
Section 5(6)
 of  the  Act,  it  was
authorised to exercise all powers and functions exercisable  by  a  District
Judge under the Ordinance.  The offences at the trial  were  under  
Sections
13(1)(e)
, 
13(2)
 of the Act, 
Sections 109
 and 
120B
 of the Indian  Penal  Code
encompassed within paragraphs 4A and 5 of the  Schedule  to  the  Ordinance.
These offences were  unimpeachably  within  the  contours  of  the  Act  and
triable by a special Judge thereunder.   Having  regard  to  the  frame  and
content of the Act and the limited modifications to the  provisions  of  the

Code of Criminal Procedure
, in their  applicability  as  occasioned  thereby
and the authorisation of the special Judge trying  the  offences  thereunder
to exercise all  the powers and functions invocable   by  a  District  Judge
under  the  Ordinance,  we  are  of  the   opinion   that   the   order   of
confiscation/forfeiture  of the properties  standing  in  the  name  of  six
companies, as involved, made by the Trial Court is unexceptionable.  In  any
view of  the  matter,  with  the  peremptory  termination  of  the  criminal
proceedings resultant on this  pronouncement, the  direction  of  the  Trial
Court  towards  confiscation/forfeiture  of  the   attached   property,   as
mentioned therein, is hereby restored and would be construed to be an  order
by this court as well.  The decisions  cited on behalf  of  the  respondents
on this issue, are distinguishable on facts and are of no avail to them.



 In Mirza Iqbal Hussain through Askari Begum Vs.  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh,
(1982) 3 SCC 516, two  fixed  deposit  receipts  and  the  cash  amount   of
Rs.5200/- seized from the house of the appellant  and   proved  to  be   the
subject-matter of charge  under  
Section  5(1)(e)
  of  the  1947  ACt,  were
ordered to be  confiscated to the State.  Responding  to the plea   of  want
of jurisdiction of the Special  Court  to  order  confiscation,  this  Court
referring to 
Section 4(2)
 of Cr.P.C.,   held  that  in  terms  thereof,  all
offences under any  law  other  than  the  
Indian  Penal  Code
  have  to  be
investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise  dealt  with  according  to
the provisions contained in the Code but subject to any  enactment  for  the
time being in  force  regulating  the  manner  or  place  of  investigation,
enquiry, trial or otherwise dealing with such offences.    It  was  observed
that none of the provisions of the 
Prevention  of  Corruption  Act
  provided
for confiscation or  prescribed the mode by which an order  of  confiscation
could be passed and thus, it was ruled that the order  of  confiscation   in
the facts of the case could not be held to be de  hors  jurisdiction.    The
invocation of Section 452 of the Code, in absence of any  provision  in  the

Prevention  of  Corruption  Act
,  excluding   its   operations   to   effect
confiscation of the property involved in any offence  thereunder,  was  thus
affirmed.



 After analyzing the facts and circumstances of this case and  after  taking
into consideration all the evidence placed before us and the  arguments  put
forward by all the parties, we  are  of  the  unhesitant  opinion  that  the
impugned judgment and order rendered by the High Court is untenable  and  is
thus set aside.  We have considered the  facts  of  this  case  and  in  our
opinion, the percentage of disproportionate assets as 8.12%  as computed  by
the High Court is based on completely  wrong  reading  of  the  evidence  on
record compounded by incorrect arithmetical calculations,   as  referred  to
herinabove. In view of the regnant evidence on record, unassailably  proving
the disproportionateness of the assets, as contemplated in 
Section  13(1)(e)

of 1988 Act, it is inessential as  well  to  resort  to  any  arithmetic  to
compute the percentage thereof. In any view of this matter, the decision  of
this Court in Krishnanand Agnihotri (supra) has no application in the  facts
of this case  and  therefore,  the  respondents  cannot  avail  any  benefit
therefrom.



 Both the Courts have construed all the assets, income  and  expenditure  of
all the accused collectively.  We  see  no  convincing  reason  to  adopt  a
different course which even otherwise, having regard to the charge,  is  not
warranted.



 Noticeably, the respondents accused accepted all the findings of  the  High
Court. We have analyzed the evidence adduced by the parties and we  come  to
the conclusion that  A1  to  A4  have  entered  into  a  conspiracy  and  in
furtherance of the same, A1 who was a public servant at  the  relevant  time
had come into possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources  of
her income during the check period and had got the  same  dispersed  in  the
names of A2 to A4 and the firms & companies involved to hold  these  on  her
behalf with a masked front. Furthermore, the the  charge  of  abetment  laid
against A2 to A4 in the commission of the offence by A1 also stands  proved.



 We have noticed that:

In 
State Through Central Bureau of Investigation,  New  Delhi  Vs.  Jitender
Kumar Singh
, reported in (2014) 11 SCC 724, this Court held  that  once  the
power has been exercised by the  Special  Judge  under  sub-section  (3)  of

Section 4
 of the P.C. Act to proceed against non-PC  offences  alongwith  PC
offences, the  mere fact  that  the  sole  public  servant  dies  after  the
exercise of powers under sub-section (3) of 
Section 4
, will not  divest  the
jurisdiction of the Special Judge or vitiate the proceedings pending  before
him.  Therefore, we hold that as the sole public servant has died  being  A1
in this matter,  in  our  opinion,  though  the  appeals  against  her  have
abated, even then A2 to A4 are liable to be convicted and sentenced  in  the
manner as has been held by the Trial Judge.




The Trial Court held that even private individuals could be  prosecuted  for
the offence under 
Section 109
 of I.P.C. and we find  that  the  Trial  Court
was right in coming to the conclusion relying on the decision  of  Nallammal
(supra), wherein it was  observed  that  acquisition  and  possession  by  a
public servant was  capable  of  being  abetted,  and  observed  that  Under

Section 3
 of the 1988 Act, the Special Judge had the power to  try  offences
punishing even abetment or conspiracy of the offences mentioned  in  the  
PC
Act
 and in our opinion, the Trial Court correctly held in this  matter  that
private individuals can be prosecuted by the Court on the ground  that  they
have abetted the act of criminal misconduct falling under  
Section  13(1)(e)

of the 1988 Act committed by the public servant.

Furthermore, the reasoning given by the Trial Court in respect  of  criminal
conspiracy and abetment, after scrutinizing the evidence of  this  case,  is
correct  in  the  face  of  the   overwhelming   evidence   indicating   the
circumstances of  active  abetment  and  conspiracy  by  A2  to  A4  in  the
commission of the above offences under 
Section 13(1)(e)
  of  the  1988  Act.
This would be evident from the following circumstances:-

A1 had executed a General Power of Attorney in favour of A2  in  respect  of
Jaya Publications marked as Ex.P-995.  The  circumstance  of  executing  the
power of attorney in favour of  A2  indicates  that  with  a  view  to  keep
herself secured from legal complications, A1  executed  the  said  power  of
attorney knowing fully well that under the said powers, A2 would be  dealing
with  her  funds   credited   to   her   account   in   Jaya   Publications.



Constitution  of  various  firms  during  the  check   period   is   another
circumstance establishing the conspiracy between the parties.  It  has  come
in evidence that 10 firms were constituted on a single day. In addition,  A2
and A3 started independent concerns and apart  from  buying  properties,  no
other business activity was undertaken by them. The circumstances proved  in
evidence undoubtedly establish that these firms are nothing  but  extentions
of Namadhu MGR and Jaya Publications and they owed their  existence  to  the
benevolence of A1 and A2

The aforesaid firms and companies were operating from the  residence  of  A1
and it cannot be accepted that she was unaware of the same even  though  she
feigned ignorance about the activities carried on by A2 to  A4.   They  were
residing   with   A1   without   any   blood    relation    between    them.



Although A2 to A4 claims to have independent sources of income but the  fact
of constitution of firms and acquisition of large tracts of land out of  the
funds provided by A1 indicate that,  all  the  accused  congregated  in  the
house  of  A1  neither  for  social  living  nor  A1   allowed   them   free
accommodation  out  of  humanitarian   concern,   rather   the   facts   and
circumstances proved in evidence undoubtedly point out that A2  to  A4  were
accommodated in the house of A1 pursuant to the criminal conspiracy  hatched
by them to hold the assets of A1.



Ex.D.61 reveals that before the Income Tax Authorities,  the  representative
of A1 himself had put forth an argument that Rs.1 crore was advanced  by  A1
to Sasi Enterprises towards share capital and further it was submitted  that
on the security of the said amount, loan was borrowed by A1,  and  thus  she
cannot claim non-involvement with the firms.



The flow of money from one account to the other proves  that  there  existed
active conspiracy to launder the ill-gotten  wealth  of  A1  for  purchasing
properties       in       the       names        of        the        firms.



The conspiracy among the accused persons is also proved by the  evidence  of
Sub-Registrar, North Beach, Sub-Registrar office-PW.159 and the evidence  of
PW.71 Radha Krishnan, Horticultural officer.



In our opinion, the Trial Court correctly came to  the  conclusion  on  such
reasoning and we hereby uphold the same.



  Accordingly,  in  view  of  the  reasoning  recorded  hereinabove  in  the
preceding paragraphs, we set aside the judgment and order of the High  Court
and affirm and restore the judgment of the Trial Court in  toto  against  A2
to A4. However, though in the process of scrutiny of the facts and  the  law
involved and the inextricable nexus of  A1 with A2 to A4, reference  to  her
role as well as the evidence pertaining to her had  been  made,  she  having
expired meanwhile, the appeals, so far as those relate to her stand  abated.
Nevertheless, to reiterate, having  regard  to  the  fact  that  the  charge
framed against A2 to A4 is proved,  the  conviction  and  sentence  recorded
against them  by  the  Trial  Court  is   restored  in  full  including  the
consequential directions.



 Respondents A2 to A4, in view of this determination and the restoration  of
their conviction and  sentence,  would  surrender  before  the  Trial  Court
forthwith. The Trial Court is hereby also ordered to  take  immediate  steps
to ensure that the respondents A2 to A4 serve out the remainder of  sentence
awarded them and take further steps  in  compliance  of  this  judgment,  in
accordance with law.



 The appeals are allowed in the above terms.

Amitava Roy, J.


A few disquieting thoughts that have lingered and languished  in  distressed
silence in mentation demand expression at the parting with a  pulpit  touch.
Hence, this supplement.



2.     The  attendant  facts  and  circumstances   encountered   as   above,
demonstrate a  deep  rooted  conspiratorial  design  to  amass  vast  assets
without any compunction and hold the same through shell  entities  to  cover
up the sinister trail of such illicit acquisitions and  deceive  and  delude
the process of law. Novelty  in  the  outrages  and  the  magnitude  of  the
nefarious gains as demonstrated by the revelations in the case are,  to  say
the least, startling.



3.           A  growing  impression  in  contemporary  existence  seems   to
acknowledge, the all pervading pestilent presence of  corruption  almost  in
every walk of life, as if to rest reconciled to  the  octopoid  stranglehold
of this malaise with helpless awe. The  common  day  experiences  indeed  do
introduce  one  with  unfailing   regularity,   the   variegated   cancerous
concoctions of corruption with fearless impunity gnawing into the frame  and
fabric of the nation’s essentia.  Emboldened  by  the  lucrative  yields  of
such malignant materialism, the perpetrators of this malady  have  tightened
their noose on the societal  psyche.   Individual  and  collective  pursuits
with curative interventions at all levels are thus indispensable to  deliver
the civil order from the asphyxiating snare of this escalating venality.



4.          In the above alarming backdrop of coeval  actuality,    judicial
adjudication of a charge based on an anti-corruption law  motivated  by  the
impelling  necessities  of  time,  has  to  be  informed  with  the  desired
responsibility and the legislative vision therefor.  Any  interpretation  of
the provisions of such law has to be essentially purposive,  in  furtherance
of its mission and not  in  retrogression  thereof.  Innovative  nuances  of
evidential  inadequacies,  processual   infirmities   and   interpretational
subtleties,  artfully  advanced  in  defence,   otherwise   intangible   and
inconsequential, ought to be conscientiously cast aside with moral  maturity
and singular sensitivity to uphold the statutory sanctity, lest the  coveted
cause of justice is a causality.



5.           Corruption  is  a  vice  of  insatiable   avarice   for   self-

aggrandizement by the unscrupulous, taking unfair advantage of  their  power
and  authority  and  those  in  public  office  also,  in  breach   of   the
institutional norms, mostly backed by minatory loyalists. Both  the  corrupt
and the corrupter are indictable and  answerable  to  the  society  and  the
country  as  a  whole.  This  is  more  particularly  in  re  the   peoples’
representatives in public life committed  by  the  oath  of  the  office  to
dedicate oneself to the unqualified welfare of the laity, by faithfully  and
conscientiously discharging their  duties  attached  thereto  in  accordance
with the Constitution, free from fear or favour or  affection  or  ill-will.
A  self-serving  conduct  in  defiance  of  such   solemn   undertaking   in
infringement of the community’s confidence reposed in them  is  therefore  a
betrayal of the promise of allegiance to the Constitution and a  condemnable
sacrilege. Not only such a  character  is  an  anathema  to  the  preambulor
promise  of  justice,  liberty,  equality,  fraternal  dignity,  unity   and
integrity of the country, which expectantly ought to animate  the  life  and
spirit of every citizen  of  this  country,  but  also  is  an  unpardonable
onslaught on the constitutional religion  that  forms  the  bedrock  of  our
democratic polity.



6.          This pernicious menace stemming from  moral  debasement  of  the
culpables, apart from destroying the sinews of the nation’s  structural  and
moral  set-up,  forges  an  unfair  advantage  of  the  dishonest  over  the
principled, widening as well the divide between the  haves  and  have  nots.
Not only this has a demoralising bearing on those who are  ethical,  honest,
upright and enterprising, it is visibly antithetical to  the  quintessential
spirit  of  the  fundamental  duty  of  every  citizen  to  strive   towards
excellence in all spheres of individual and  collective  activity  to  raise
the nation to higher levels of endeavour  and  achievement.   This  virulent
affliction triggers an imbalance in the society’s  existential  stratas  and
stalls constructive progress  in  the  overall  well-being  of  the  nation,
besides  disrupting  its  dynamics  of  fiscal  governance.  It   encourages
defiance of the rule of law and  the  propensities  for  easy  materialistic
harvests,  whereby  the  society’s  soul  stands   defiled,   devalued   and
denigrated.



7.          Such is the militant dominance  of  this  sprawling  evil,  that
majority of the sensible, rational and discreet constituents of the  society
imbued with moral values and groomed with disciplinal ethos find  themselves
in minority, besides estranged and resigned  by  practical  compulsions  and
are  left  dejected  and  disillusioned.   A   collective,   committed   and
courageous turnaround is thus the present day imperative to free  the  civil
order from the suffocative throttle of this deadly affliction.



8.          Every citizen has to be a partner in  this  sacrosanct  mission,
if we aspire for a stable, just and ideal social order as envisioned by  our
forefathers and fondly cherished by the numerous self-effacing crusaders  of
a free and independent  Bharat,  pledging  their  countless  sacrifices  and
selfless commitments for such cause.
