 ORAL JUDGMENT :


                  Rule. Rule is made returnable forthwith by consent of

 the parties and heard finally.





 2.               Since the issue involved is common, all these Petitions

 can be disposed of by a common order.





 3.               By these Petitions filed under 
Articles 226
 and 
227
 of

 the Constitution of India, the petitioners are challenging the

 judgment and order passed by the Presiding Officer, Labour Court

 No.1, Kolhapur, dated 20th March, 2015 in Reference (IDA) No.6

 of 2009.



                                                                                     4 of 15

 4.               For convenience, the facts in Writ Petition No. 11076

 of 2015 are referred.





 5.               The petitioner was working as a Core Maker from

 26/7/1983 with the respondents on monthly wages of Rs.3500/-.

 It is petitioner's case that he was made to forcibly resign with

 effect from 1/12/2002. Terminal dues were calculated in wrong

 manner and petitioner was illegally terminated from the services.

 According to petitioner, the said termination was effected on false

 pretext that the Company is going to close down. The petitioner's

 signature was obtained without explaining the terms, conditions

 and all that was written on the resignation letter. The petitioner

 also disputed the calculation of the amount of gratuity. According

 to petitioner, 15% illegal deduction was made from the amount

 that was paid to the petitioner as and by way of final settlement.

 The petitioner therefore approached the Conciliation Officer under

 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
 (hereinafter referred to as 'the said

 Act of 1947' for short) sometime in the year 2007. The

 Conciliation Officer referred the dispute to the Labour Court

 under 
Section 10(1)(c)
 read with 
Section 12 (5)
 and 
39
 of the


                                                                                     5 of 15

 said Act of 1947 for adjudication of dispute. The Labour Court by

 the impugned award dated 20th March, 2015 was pleased to reject

 the Reference on the ground that there is a delay of five years in

 approaching the authorities. The Reference is also rejected on

 merits in as much as according to the Labour Court, there was a

 settlement dated 12/7/2004 entered into by recognised Union

 under which all the employees had received benefits towards full

 and final settlement of their claims.





 
6.               Learned Counsel for the petitioners firstly urged that

 under 
Section 10(1)
 of the Act of 1947, an employee can

 approach the authorities under the Act of 1947 any time. No

 limitation is stipulated. He would submit that the resignations

 were obtained forcibly in the year 2002. Thereafter the settlement

 which is not binding on the petitioner was entered into by

 recognised Union on 12/7/2004. According to him, the Labour

 Court has wrongly considered the delay to be of five years. He

 submitted that the Labour Court has adopted a hyper technical

 approach while refusing to condone delay. Relying on the decision

 of the Apex Court in the case of 
Raghubir Singh vs. General



                                                                                     6 of 15

 Manager, Haryana Roadways, Hissar reported in (2014) 10

 SCC 301, learned Counsel would submit that the delay need not

 come in the way of the employees as in any case the ultimate

 reliefs can be moulded suitably. He would further submit that the

 settlement is not binding as the same is not in accordance with

 law. Learned Counsel, relying upon the judgment and order of the

 Industrial Court in respect of similar situate employees, would

 contend that the Labour Court having allowed the claim of similar

 situate employees in Reference (IDA) Nos.89 to 95, 97 to 122, 146

 and 148 of 2003, even these applications deserve to be allowed.


 7.               In the course of challenge raised by Management to

 the exparte award of Labour Court in respect of similar situated

 employees in this Court, it is pointed out that the Management

 entered in out of Court settlement with similar situate employees

 and paid the employees 50% of the back-wages as awarded by the

 Labour Court. He would therefore submit that even the petitioners

 are entitled to similar reliefs.





 
8.               Learned Counsel for respondents on the other hand

 would submit that the claim of the petitioners is hit by delay and


                                                                                     7 of 15

 laches. He would invite my attention to the statement of claim

 where the petitioner has come with the case that he resigned in

 the year 2002. Furthermore the settlement of the year 2004 is not

 a subject matter of the reference and therefore, according to him,

 the Labour Court is justified in calculating the delay from the year

 2002 onwards. He would submit that no doubt, limitation is not

 prescribed for making a claim, but nonetheless the employee

 concerned has to approach for redressal of his grievance within a

 reasonable time. Learned Counsel would rely upon the decision of

 the Apex Court in the case of 
Prabhakar vs. Joint Director,

 Secriculture Department
 & anr. reported in 2016 (1) ALL MR

 486 (S.C.), to contend the parameters to be kept in mind while

 considering the aspect of delay.






 9.               Learned Counsel would also rely upon the decision of

 the Apex Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh & ors. vs.

 Arvind Kumar Srivastava & ors. reported in (2015) 1 SCC 347

 in support of his submission that the petitioners have to be treated

 as fence-sitters, as they approached the Labour Court only after

 their counterparts succeeded in the efforts in a claim made by


                                                                                     8 of 15

 them before the Labour Court. According to learned Counsel, the

 present is a fit case where laches and delays, and/or the

 acquiescence, would be a valid ground to dismiss their claim. He

 would moreover submit that the evidence on record would clearly

 indicate that the petitioners have even received the provident fund

 dues on the premise that the petitioners have tendered

 resignations.





 10.              I have heard learned Counsel for the parties. I have

 gone through the Memo of Petition, annexures to the Petition and

 the impugned order.





 11.              It is the case of the petitioner that he tendered his

 resignation in December 2002. Thereafter, recognised Union

 entered into settlement in the year 2004 in terms of which the

 terminal dues of all the employees were settled. Some of the

 similar situate employees had approached the Labour Court in the

 year 2003 itself by filing Reference IDA Nos.89 to 95, 97 to 122,

 146 and 148 of 2003 for the similar reliefs as claimed by the

 petitioners. By a common award dated 28/2/2006 the claim of


                                                                                     9 of 15

 those workmen was allowed and the similar situate workmen

 were directed to be reinstated with continuity of service and with

 full back-wages. This according to the Management was an

 exparte award. The respondent - Company filed Miscellaneous

 Application for setting aside the exparte award. The same came to

 be rejected by the Labour Court on 27/2/2007. Thereafter, the

 Management filed Writ Petition No. 1708 of 2007 in this Court

 challenging the exparte order. In this Court a settlement was

 arrived at between the Management and the workers in the said

 Writ Petition No. 1708 of 2007 where the company agreed to pay

 50% back-wages awarded by the Labour Court.





 12.              It is thus apparent that it is only after the similar

 situate workers succeeded in the Reference before the Labour

 Court and after the application for setting aside the exparte order

 was rejected by the Labour Court, that the petitioners approached

 the Conciliation Officer only in the year 2007. In this view of the

 matter, this case would stand squarely covered by the decision of

 the Apex Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh & ors.

                  22.2. However, this principle is subject to well recognized
                  exceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as acquiescence.

                  Those persons who did not challenge the wrongful action in their
                  cases and acquiesced into the same and woke up after long delay only
                  because of the reason that their counterparts who had approached the
                  Court earlier in time succeeded in their efforts, then such employees
                  cannot claim that the benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of
                  similarly situated persons be extended to them. They would be treated
                  as fence-sitters and laches and delays, and/or the acquiescence, would
                  be a valid ground to dismiss their claim.





 13.              The petitioners in the statement of claim clearly made

 out a case that they resigned with effect from 2002. According to

 them, the resignation is forced. In my opinion, the fact that the

 petitioners approached the Labour Court raising the demand only

 after their counterparts succeeded in their efforts compels me to

 come to a conclusion that the reference suffered laches and delay

 which was valid ground to dismiss the petitioners' claim. It would

 also be pertinent to mention that though no limitation is

 prescribed for making a claim under the Act of 1947, this is a fit

 case to dismiss the claim raised by the petitioners on the ground

 of delay. The petitioners by not challenging the wrongful claim in

 their cases and having acquiesced into the same, woke up after

 long delay only because of the reason that their counterparts

 succeeded in their efforts, then these petitioners cannot claim the



                                                                                    11 of 15

 benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of similarly situated

 persons be extended to them.





 
14.              A profitable reference can be made to the observations

 of the Apex Court in the case of 
Prabhakar
 (supra) in paragraph

 26 which reads thus :-




                    26.    The aforesaid case law depicts the following :

                          (a)      Law of limitation does not apply to the proceedings
                          under the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
.

                          (b)      The words 'at any time' used in 
Section 10
 would
                          support that there is no period of limitation in making an order
                          of reference.

                          (c)      At the same time, the appropriate Government has to
                          keep in mind as to whether the dispute is still existing or live
                          dispute and has not become a stale claim and if that is so, the
                          reference can be refused.

                          (d)      Whether dispute is alive or it has become stale/non-

                          existent at the time when the workman approaches the
                          appropriate Government is an aspect which would depend
                          upon the facts and circumstances of each case and there
                          cannot be any hard and fast rule regarding the time for making
                          the order of reference."





 15.              It would also be material to refer to paragraph 38 of

 
the said decision
 which reads thus :



                  38.      Likewise, if a party having a right stands by and sees another
                  acting in a manner inconsistent with that right and makes no objection
                  while the act is in progress he cannot afterwards complain. This
                  principle is based on the doctrine of acquiescence implying that in
                  such a case party who did not make any objection acquiesced into the
                  alleged wrongful act of the other party and, therefore, has no right to
                  complain against that alleged wrong."



                                                                                    12 of 15

 16.              In my opinion the view of the Labour Court in

 rejecting the claim on the ground of delay, laches and

 acquiescence cannot be said to be perverse or erroneous.




 17.              Though learned Counsel for the petitioners would

 contend that the Labour Court was not justified in calculating the

 delay from 2002 onwards as the settlement is of the year 2004, I

 find from the statement of claim that the petitioners themselves

 have made a claim for reinstatement on the basis of the

 resignation which is submitted in December, 2002 which

 according to the petitioners was obtained by force and

 misrepresentation. In the statement of claim there is no challenge

 to the settlement of the year 2004 nor is the Reference made on

 the basis of the settlement of 2004.





 18.              In this view of the matter, I do not find any reason to

 interfere with the impugned order.





 19.              Even before the matter was heard I had put it to the

 learned Counsel for the respondents if some ex-gratia amount


                                                                                    13 of 15

 could be offered to each of the petitioner in view of the fact that

 they had entered into a settlement with the petitioners'

 counterparts. Learned Counsel for respondents, on instructions,

 stated that the respondents are willing to pay an ex-gratia amount

 of Rs.25,000/- to each of the petitioner. Learned Counsel for the

 petitioners then rejected this offer and proceeded to argue on

 merits.





 20.              After the order was dictated, learned Counsel for the

 petitioners, on instructions, pleaded that they are willing to settle

 the matter and that they would accept Rs.50,000/- each towards

 full and final settlement of their claim. Learned Counsel for the

 respondents in all fairness submits that despite dismissal of these

 Petitions, he is still willing to stand by his earlier offer of

 Rs.25,000/-. Learned Counsel for the respondents in his usual

 fairness submitted that though he has no instructions to increase

 the offer, he would leave it to this Court to determine the ex-

 gratia amount payable to the petitioners which he assures the

 respondents would abide by. In the interest of justice I am inclined

 to accept the proposal made by the learned Counsel for the

 gratia amount of Rs.50,000/- payable to each of the petitioner by

 the respondents is towards full and final settlement of their claim.
