                                                                                         WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  issued G.O. (Ms) No. 181, School Education (C2) Department 15.11.2011, in

                  which the Teachers Recruitment Board (in short, “the TRB”) was designated as

                  the Nodal Agency for conducting the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) in the

                  State of Tamil Nadu. Subsquently, another G.O., viz., G.O. (Ms) No. 90,

                  School Education (Q) Department 28.03.2012, came to be passed, to the

                  following effect:



                            "....In the G.O. (Ms) No. 181, School Education (C2) Department, dated
                            15.11.2011, the Government has changed the recruitment policy for
                            recruitment of Secondary Grade Teachers and Graduate Assistants.
                            Henceforth, the recruitment will be based on written examination, namely,
                            Teacher Eligibility Test in accordance with the guidelines issued by the
                            National Council for Teacher Education. The qualifying candidates of the
                            Teacher Eligibility Test will be recruited based on marks, communal rotation
                            and certificate verification.



                            2.However, with respect to the recruitment of Secondary Grade Teachers, the
                            state-wide seniority in employment exchange registration will continue till the
                            disposal of the Special Leave Petition filed in the Supreme Court."



                  Subsequently, in GO. Ms. No. 244 School Education [EE(3)2] Department

                  dated 30.11.2013, it was clarified that the Government has examined the

                  matter and directed the Teachers Recruitment Board to follow the procedure for

                  selection of Secondary Grade Teachers also on the basis of the marks obtained

                  in TET.





                  4.              Thus, as per the G.Os. referred to above, possessing TET

                  qualification has become essential and mandatory for the teaching faculties

                  from 23.08.2010 (subsequently extended by NCTE notification to 29.07.2011)

                  in the State.



                  5.              The Nodal Agency (TRB) in the State of Tamil Nadu, has conducted

                  TET examination for the first time on 12.07.2012 from which it could be

                  inferred that no person, who had passed the TET, would have been available to

                  be appointed during the period from 23.08.2010 to 12.07.2012 as a teacher. It

                  is in that backdrop that the first and second proviso to clause (2) of 
Section 23


                  of the RTE Act enable those teachers, who were appointed during that period,

                  to pass the TET by 31.03.2019 for their continuance in the post.


                  6.              Though there is a requirement in the Notification No.76-4/2010

                  /NCTE/Acad dated 11.02.2011 published by the NCTE that the TET should be

                  conducted atleast once in every year and there will be no restriction on the

                  number of attempts a person can take for acquiring a TET Certificate and a

                  person who has qualified the TET may also appear again for improving his/her

                  score, it has been brought to notice that the TET has not been conducted

                  annually in the State of Tamil Nadu except on 14.10.2012, 17.08.2013,

                  18.08.2013, 29.04.2017, 30.04.2017, 08.06.2019 and 09.06.2019. Thus,

                  taking this situation that TET had not been conducted in the years 2014, 2015,

                  2016 and 2018, the persons appointed during the period from 23.08.2010 to

                  12.07.2012 have claimed exemption from passing TET, particularly when it is

                  not in dispute that the TET has been conducted during the years 2012, 2013

                  and 2017 and they have had sufficient opportunity to prepare and appear for

                  the TET during the said period. 
In this context, the Division Bench of this

                  Court in 
State of Tamil Nadu v. R.Arivazhagan (Order
 dated 24.01.2017 in

                  W.A. No. 1126 of 2016 etc., batch) had taken note of those aspects of the

                  matter and held as follows:




                            "42.Accordingly, to meet the ends of justice, the writ appeals and the writ
                            petitions are disposed with the following directions:

                            (i)The Teachers herein, who have been appointed subsequent to the
                            issuance of the Government Order, are granted one opportunity to appear
                            for the Teacher Eligibility Test to be conducted by the Teachers Recruitment
                            Board and in the event of their passing in the Teacher Eligibility Test, their
                            appointments shall be approved else, they have no other option but to quit
                            the service/ousted from service;

                            (ii)Till the results are published, the Government shall pay the salary to the
                            Teachers, who are in service of the aided institutions, for the service
                            rendered by them and in the cases where salary was not paid the same
                            shall be paid along with arrears, if any, forthwith;

                            (iii)Learned Advocate General submitted that salary has been paid to most
                            of the Teachers and only a few were not paid, for want of particulars. In
                            such a case, the Teachers whose salary have not been paid for want of
                            particulars, they shall furnish the requisite particulars immediately, so as
                            to enable the Government pay the salary immediately.

                            (iv)Insofar as W.P. No. 7953 of 2015 is concerned, though the writ
                            petitioner has qualified with a pass in Teacher Eligibility Test during 2013,
                            she has not been paid the difference of salary from the date of
                            appointment, till the date of passing of the Teacher Eligibility Test. In view
                            of the discussions aforesaid, the Government is directed to pay the
                            difference of salary within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt
                            of a copy of this order; and

                            (v)The Teachers Recruitment Board is directed to take note of the above
                            observations and to issue notification for conducting Teacher Eligibility
                            Test on or before the end of February 2017, indicating the date of exam to

                  appeals as well as the writ petitions are required to be dealt with,

                  independently. The pleadings have been arranged for narration on the basis of

                  the issues that arise for consideration as referred to at the first instance, Issue

                  No. (i) being covered by W.A.No. 2795/2022, W.P. Nos.3364 & 3368 of 2023,

                  8.              W.A. No. 2795 of 2022


                  8.1.            The appellants are aggrieved by the order dated 20.10.2012 passed

                  by the learned Judge in WP No. 19587 of 2022 filed by them.

                  8.2.            The appellants have filed WP No. 19587 of 2022 praying to quash

                  the order dated 11.07.2022 of the second respondent insofar as it relates to

                  postponing of the promotion counselling scheduled to be held on 14.07.2022

                  and 15.07.2022 for the post of B.T. Assistant from among the Secondary

                  Grade Teachers and after quashing the said order dated 11.07.2022, sought for

                  a consequential direction to the second respondent to instruct all the Chief

                  Educational Officers to conduct the promotion counselling for the post of B.T.

                  Assistant in High Schools and Higher Secondary Schools from the post of

                  Secondary Grade Teachers, within a time frame.



                  8.3.            Even though the learned Judge allowed the writ petition and quashed

                  24/134

                                                                              WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  the order dated 11.07.2022 of the second respondent with a further direction to

                  conduct promotion counselling, the appellants are aggrieved by the observation

                  made by the learned Judge to the effect that teachers without TET are not

                  entitled to continue in service in the schools/educational institutions and are not

                  entitled for promotion to BT Assistants from the cadre of secondary grade

                  teachers unless they qualify for TET.



                  8.4.            According to the appellants, the learned Judge went beyond the

                  scope of the writ petition and issued such directions which had adversely

                  affected their right to continue in service. The appellants have filed the writ

                  petition only against the postponement of the promotion counselling inasmuch

                  as they are continuing in the post of Secondary Grade Teachers without being

                  promoted to the post of B.T. Assistant by citing the non-possession of TET.

                  When the appellants sought for a direction to the respondents to expeditiously

                  conduct the promotion counselling, the learned Judge overstepped and held

                  that those who did not possess TET are not entitled to promotion and continue

                  in service. Such finding will have a cascading effect in their continuing in

                  service. The appellants further stated that they were appointed from 1991 to

                  2011 on various dates and they are continuing in service without promotion.

                  On the other hand, those who were appointed after the appellants have climbed

                  the promotion ladder and are holding higher posts. It is also stated by the

                  appellants that they are not required to pass TET at all inasmuch as they were

                  appointed much prior to the issuance of G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011 as

                  well as the conduct of TET for the first time in the State; and that, this

                  Honourable Court had passed several orders holding that pass in TET is

                  compulsory only for direct recruitment to the post of B.T. Assistants and not

                  for those who are seeking promotion to the said post. The appellants further

                  stated that there was no condition imposed in their order of appointment.

                  However, by virtue of the notification dated 23.08.2010, they are required to

                  pass TET as a condition precedent for promoting them to higher post. Such a

                  condition is conspicuously absent in the order of appointment issued to the

                  appellants and therefore, they cannot be directed to complete TET as a

                  condition precedent for conferment of promotion or for the purpose of

                  continuing in service. In any event, when there are several orders cited on

                  behalf of the appellants and the learned Judge did not agree with the decisions

                  rendered by this Court in the earlier orders, judicial discipline demands that the

                  matter ought to have been referred to a Division Bench. Instead, the learned

                  Judge observed that those who did not possess TET has to be shown the exit

                  door and they are not having any right to remain in service. Such an

                  observation made by the learned Judge is legally not sustainable. Further, the

                  Government issued G.O. (Ms.) No. 13, School Education [S.E 3(1)]

                  Department dated 30.01.2020 whereby the Special Rules for the Tamil Nadu

                  School Educational Subordinate Service, was published. Even in the said

                  Government Order, it was only stated that TET is necessary for appointment of

                  a graduate teacher, however, it cannot be insisted in the case of promotion to

                  the post of B.T. Assistant. The said Government Order in G.O. (Ms.) No.13,

                  School Education Department dated 30.01.2020 was not challenged and

                  therefore also, the order passed by the learned Judge required to be interfered

                  with by this Court. Accordingly, the appellants prayed for allowing this appeal.

                  8.5.            The learned counsel appearing for the appellants in W.A.No.2795 of

                  2022 would contend that the appellants were appointed as Secondary Grade

                  Teachers between 1991 and 2011 on various dates and they have rendered

                  more than two decades of service without any promotion. However, during the

                  course of their service, NCTE has made TET qualification mandatory for all

                  appointments from the date of the notification on 23.08.2010. It was also made

                  clear that for appointments made prior to the notification, possessing TET is

                  not required.

                  the Special Rules for the Tamilnadu School Educational Subordinate Service

                  issued in G.O. Ms. No.13, School Education Department dated 30.01.2020

                  insofar as it prescribes "a pass in TET only for direct recruitment for the post of

                  BT Assistant and not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in Rule


                  6)" is illegal being ultra vires the 
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory

 and the Rules framed thereunder and the NCTE

                  notifications dated 23.08.2010 and 29.07.2011.



                  9.2.            According to the petitioner in WP No.3364 of 2023, it is a registered

                  association and they have been espousing the cause of candidates who have

                  passed TET. It is stated that NCTE issued the notification dated 23.08.2010

                  prescribing minimum qualification for being appointed as a Teacher for

                  imparting teaching to students studying Classes I to V (secondary grade

                  teachers) and Classes VI to VIII (B.T. Assistants). As per the notification dated

                  23.08.2010, the teachers appointed prior to the notification need not pass TET.

                  However, by a subsequent notification dated 29.07.2011, amendments were

                  made to the notification dated 23.08.2010 in which also, the requirement to

                  pass TET has become necessary for the purpose of appointment. The

                  Government also issued G.O. Ms. No.173, dated 08.11.2011 framing the Tamil

                  Nadu Right of Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011 followed by

                  another order in G.O. (Ms.) No.181 dated 15.11.2011 appointing TRB as the

                  nodal agency to conduct TET exam. As per the orders of the Government,

                  passing TET is mandatory for all secondary grade teachers as well as BT

                  Assistants in the State.



                  9.3.            It is further stated by the petitioners that pursuant to the orders of the

                  Government, TRB has conducted several TET exams and the results declared

                  in those examinations were the subject matter of various litigations before this

                  Court. However, it is clear that no selection shall be made to the post of

                  Secondary Grade Teachers and BT Assistants without the TET qualification

                  and no approval for any appointment was given by the educational agency in

                  favour of those who do not pass TET.



                  9.4.            The petitioners, in unison, would state that the Government of Tamil

                  Nadu has now framed Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Elementary Education

                  Subordinate Service in GO Ms. No.12, School Education [EE1(1)] Department

                  Department dated 30.01.2020. In the aforesaid Government Orders, while

                  prescribing qualification for the post of Graduate Teacher (BT Assistant) in

                  Annexure I (as referred to in Rule 6) of the Special Rules, it was specified that

                  "a pass in TET" is mandatory only for direct recruitment. As far as the mode of

                  appointment, it was stated that the post of BT Assistant/Graduate Teacher can

                  be filled by way of transfer, promotion or direct recruitment, meaning thereby,

                  for transfer and promotion, the in-service candidates in the post of Secondary

                  Grade Teachers can be considered even without TET qualification for

                  promotion to the post of BT Assistant.



                  9.5.            The grievance of the writ petitioners is that such a prescription to

                  promote the in-service candidates to the higher post without TET qualification

                  is against the spirit of 
RTE Act
 and the Rules made thereunder. Therefore,

                  challenging G.O. Ms. No.12, School Education Department dated 30.01.2020,

                  the petitioner Association has earlier filed WP (MD) No. 9707 of 2022 before

                  this Court. Similarly, another writ petition in WP (MD) No. 9708 of 2022 was

                  filed by one K. Rajasekaran. Both the writ petitions were taken up for hearing

                  on 11.05.2020 and an interim order was granted to the effect that any

                  promotion order passed by the official respondents will be subject to the

                  outcome of the final order to be passed in the writ petitions.

                  9.6.            During the pendency of the writ petitions, the Commissioner of

                  School Education has passed an order dated 30.06.2022 directing all the Chief

                  Educational Officers to prepare a panel in the category of Secondary Grade

                  Teacher for promotion to the post of BT Assistant. Challenging the said order

                  dated 30.06.2022, the petitioner in WP No. 3368 of 2023 has earlier filed WP

                  No. 17895 of 2022 to quash the proceedings dated 30.06.2022 of the

                  Commissioner of School Education, Chennai, insofar as it relates to promotion

                  to the post of B.T. Assistant from those unqualified candidates without passing

                  TET by conducting promotion counselling. In connection with the same

                  dispute, some of the in-service candidates have also filed WP No. 19587 of

                  2022 challenging the order dated 11.07.2022 of the Commissioner of School

                  Education, Chennai postponing the promotion counselling scheduled to be held

                  on 14.07.2022 and 15.07.2022 for the post of B.T. Assistant from the post of

                  Secondary Grade Teacher as per the proceedings dated 30.06.2022 and to

                  direct the Commissioner of School Education to instruct all the Chief

                  Educational Officers to conduct promotion counselling for promotion to the

                  post of B.T. Assistant. Both the WP No.17895 of 2022 and WP No. 19587 of

                  2022 were taken up for hearing and by order dated 20.10.2022, WP No. 17895

                  of 2022 filed by the TET passed candidate Sakthivel was allowed and WP No.

                  19587 of 2022 was dismissed.



                  9.7.            As against the common order dated 20.10.2022, the petitioners in

                  WP No. 19587 of 2022 have filed Writ Appeal No. 2795 of 2022 before this

                  Court, wherein the petitioner in WP No. 3364 of 2023 impleaded themselves as

                  party respondent and opposed the writ appeal by stating that in-service

                  candidates, who do not possess TET qualification cannot be conferred with

                  further promotion. According to the writ petitioners, number of in-service

                  candidates do not possess TET qualification, however, they are asserting a right

                  for promotion to the post of B.T. Assistant. If promotion to the post of B.T.

                  Assistant is made from among unqualified secondary grade teachers, who do

                  not pass TET, the qualified persons, who have passed TET, will be deprived of

                  their legitimate right of appointment and promotion. The unqualified in-service

                  candidates solely rely upon G.O. Ms. Nos. 12 and 13 dated 30.01.2020 for

                  conferment of promotion to the post of B.T. Assistant without possession of

                  TET and therefore, challenging the aforesaid orders of the Government, these

                  writ petitions in WP Nos. 3364 & 3368 of 2023 have been filed.

                  9.8.            A counter affidavit has been filed in WP No. 3368 of 2023 by the

                  Joint Director (Personnel), Commissioner of School Education, Chennai

                  contending inter alia that number of candidates, who do not possess the

                  mandatory TET, have been appointed in Government aided school and

                  therefore, their appointments are not approved by the Department. However,

                  on the basis of interim order passed by this Court in the writ petitions filed by

                  such candidates, they continue to remain in service and on the basis of such

                  orders, temporary appointments have been given by the Department to the

                  nonqualified teachers. It is stated in the counter affidavit that the nodal agency

                  namely TRB has conducted TET examination on 03.06.2012 in which

                  3,05,405 candidates appeared, but only 1735 passed the examination.

                  Subsequently, TET examination was conducted on various dates in which very

                  few have passed the examination. It is further stated that the State Government

                  strictly adheres to the provisions of 
RTE Act, 2009
 which made it mandatory

                  for all those teachers, both secondary grade teachers as well as B.T. Assistant

                  appointed on or after 01.04.2020 to acquire TET qualification. As far as

                  Government Schools are concerned, only those candidates, who passed TET,

                  alone are appointed after the coming into force of the said Act. The teachers

                  appointed in the minority aided schools claim that they need not acquire TET

                  in view of the order passed by the Constitutional Bench of the Honourable

                  Supreme Court in 
Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust and others v.

                  Union of India
 [(2014) 8 SCC 1]. However, the issue that was dealt with 
in

                  that case
 relates to reservation of 25% of seats in the schools for the children

                  belonging to weaker and disadvantaged sections of the society and 
the said

                  decision
 has no application to their case.




                  9.9.            With reference to the Judgment passed in W.A.(MD)No.859 of 2019

                  passed TET. However, this Court, by an order dated 16.05.2019, granted

                  interim injunction restraining the Educational authorities from terminating the

                  teachers pending disposal of the writ appeals. Thus, according to the

                  respondent authorities, the prayer made in the writ petitions is devoid of merits

                  and is liable to be rejected.





                  10.             Writ Appeal Nos. 313 and 833 of 2022

                  10.1.           These appeals arise out of the common order dated 29.07.2021

                  passed by the learned Judge in WP Nos. 23999 and 24003 of 2019.

                  10.2.           Both the aforesaid writ petitions have been filed for issuing a Writ of

                  Mandamus forbearing the respondents therein from insisting passing of TET

                  and to direct the respondents to continue to make salary, including annual

                  increment, incentive increment and other service benefits to them.

                  10.3.           According to the writ petitioners, they were appointed as B.T.

                  Assistant on 15.06.2011 and 29.07.2011 respectively and their appointment

                  has also been approved by the educational agency. While so, after their

                  appointment, the Government issued G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education

                  Department dated 15.11.2011 appointing TRB as nodal agency to conduct

                  TET. Therefore, the writ petitioners who were appointed prior to the issuance

                  of G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011, are not required to complete TET or the

                  acquisition of TET qualification cannot be put against them for the purpose of

                  conferment of annual increment, incentive and other service benefits. However,

                  the school, where they were employed, are refusing to pay salary and other

                  monetary benefits to them by citing non-possession of TET.



                  10.4.           The learned Judge, on considering the rival submissions, held that

                  the petitioners, who were appointed on 15.06.2011 and 29.07.2011, cannot be

                  insisted to possess TET qualification as prescribed by NCTE. The learned

                  Judge also, by placing reliance on the order dated 30.07.2020 passed by this

                  The State of Tamil Nadu, Department of School Education and others, held

                  that the writ petitioners were appointed prior to issuance of G.O. Ms. No.181

                  dated 15.11.2011 and they are not required to pass TET as a condition

                  precedent for payment of salary and other monetary benefits. Accordingly, a

                  direction was issued to the respondents therein to pay the salary, including

                  annual increment and other incentives payable to the writ petitioners within a

                  period of eight weeks. Aggrieved by the common order dated 29.07.2021

                  passed by the learned Judge in WP Nos. 23999 and 24003 of 2019, the present

                  contended by the appellants that the appointment of the writ petitioners

                  without possession of TET would be considered as without adequate

                  qualification and it is against the prescription of minimum qualification under

                  the 
RTE Act, 2009
. The learned Judge, while allowing the writ petitions, did

                  not consider that sufficient and adequate time has been given to the teachers

                  like the writ petitioners to acquire TET, however, they did not possess such

                  qualification. After coming into force of the 
RTE Act, 2009
, acquisition of TET

                  qualification is mandatory for appointment as teachers. Even though the writ

                  petitioners were appointed in the year 2011, till this date, they have not chosen

                  to acquire such qualification and therefore, it shall be deemed that they are

                  continuing in service as B.T. Assistant without the mandatory qualification

                  prescribed under the 
RTE Act, 2009
. While so, the order passed by the learned

                  Judge, directing the appellants to pay the writ petitioners their salary, annual

                  increments and other incentives is not proper and hence, prayed for setting

                  aside the same by allowing the writ appeals.

                  to issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the appellants to sanction annual

                  increment to her in the post of B.T. Assistant (Science-Zoology) in the second

                  respondent school from the year 2016 without reference to passing TET with

                  all consequential benefits.



                  11.3.           According to the writ petitioner, she was appointed as B.T. Assistant

                  in Sri Sarada Vidyalaya Higher Secondary School for Girls, Fairlands, Salem

                  on 19.03.2011 and her appointment was also approved by the educational

                  authorities on 24.05.2011. In the meanwhile, based on G.O. Ms. No.181 dated

                  15.11.2011, making TET qualification mandatory, the writ petitioner has not

                  been paid annual increments payable to her. The writ petitioner further stated

                  that she was appointed on 19.03.2011, prior to issuing G.O. Ms. No.181 dated

                  15.11.2011 and therefore insisting her to pass TET. as a condition precedent

                  for payment of annual increment and other benefits. is illegal.

Section 23
 of the RTE Act, a teacher, who did not possess the minimum

                  qualification shall acquire it within a period of five years, however,

                  consequences of not obtaining such qualification has neither been prescribed in

                  as the petitioner was working as a teacher, she is entitled to all the benefits that

                  are available to the regular teachers as per the Rules.

                  11.5.           Assailing the order dated 22.10.2021 passed in WP No. 22221 of

                  2021, it is contended on behalf of the appellants that minimum qualification to

                  be possessed by a Teacher has been laid down by NCTE in exercise of powers

                  conferred under 
Section 23(1)
 of The Right of Children to Free and

                  Compulsory Education Act, 2009. The writ petitioner admittedly did not

                  possess the minimum qualification prescribed by NCTE within five years from

                  the date of commencement of the Act in the year 2009. Even the Government

                  has passed the order in G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education Department dated

                  15.11.2011 to the effect that teachers to be recruited in future for the

                  elementary segment must have passed TET. Therefore, as per the order of the

                  Government, it is mandatory for the writ petitioner to possess TET and she

                  cannot be permitted to state that her appointment was made prior to the

                  issuance of the Government Order. Even the five years time limit prescribed

                  under 
Section 23 (2)
 has lapsed but the writ petitioner did not acquire TET

                  qualification. When the continuance of the writ petitioner in service itself is

                  illegal, the learned Judge ought not to have issued a Mandamus directing the

                  appellants herein to confer her all the consequential monetary benefits such as

                  annual increment etc. 
In this context, the appellants have relied on the order

                                                                                 WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch


                  dated 24.03.2022 passed by this Court in WP No. 28284 of 2021 etc., in

                  
K. Vasudevan v. The Principal Secretary, School Education Department and

                  others
, wherein it was held that merely because the writ petitioners'

                  appointment was made prior to the issuance of the Government Order and their

                  appointments were also ratified by the educational authorities, it will not confer

                  them the right to get annual increment etc. Thus, according to the appellants,

                  when the writ petitioner did not possess the requisite mandatory qualification,

                  she is not entitled to annual increment and other incentives and hence, the

                  order of the learned Judge dated 22.10..2021 made in WP.No.22221 of 2021

                  will have to be set aside by allowing this appeal.






                  12.             W.A. No. 2050 of 2022


                  12.1.           This appeal arises out of the order dated 29.09.2021 passed by the

                  learned Judge in WP No. 20911 of 2021.



                  12.2.           The aforesaid writ petition has been filed praying to issue a Writ of

                  Mandamus directing the appellants to sanction annual increment to the writ

                  petitioner in the post of B.T. Assistant (Maths) from the year 2018 and also to

                  pay incentive increment for having acquired M.Sc., Mathematics without

                  reference to passing of TET.

                                                                                  WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  on 12.09.2011 and he joined the said post on 12.12.2011 and that, his

                  appointment was also approved by the educational authorities. It was further

                  stated that after his appointment as B.T. Assistant, on 12.09.2011, the

                  Government issued G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011 making it mandatory

                  for the Secondary Grade Teachers and B.T. Assistant to possess TET. In any

                  event, when he was appointed much earlier to the passing of the Government

                  Order, the writ petitioner cannot be insisted to pass TET as a condition

                  precedent for continuing in service or payment of his annual increment and

                  other incentives.



                  12.4.           The learned Judge, on consideration of the rival submissions, held

                  that 
Section 23
 of the RTE Act makes it clear that a Teacher, who, at the

                  commencement of the Act did not possess the minimum qualification, shall

                  acquire such qualification within five years. However, the consequences of not

                  obtaining such qualification has neither been prescribed in the Act nor in the

                  Rules or the Government Orders. As long as the writ petitioner continues to

                  work as a Teacher, he is entitled for his salary and other incentives.

                  Accordingly, the learned Judge allowed the writ petition No. 20911 of 2021 on

                  29.09.2021. Aggrieved by the same, W.A. No. 2050 of 2022 is filed by the

                  appellants.



                  12.5.           In the grounds of writ appeal, it is stated that the learned Judge did

                  not consider the fact that adequate time has been granted to the candidates,

                  including the writ petitioner, to acquire TET qualification. The writ petitioner,

                  who joined services on 12.09.2011, did not pass TET till the date of filing the

                  writ petition. When a statute prescribes a particular qualification as a minimum

                  qualification for holding a post, the writ petitioner cannot be given any

                  exemption from possessing such qualification. In any event, the appointment of

                  the writ petitioner or continuance of his service without the mandatory TET

                  qualification cannot be countenanced. In such circumstances, the learned Judge

                  ought not to have directed the appellants to confer all the monetary benefits

                  payable to the writ petitioner. Therefore, the appellants sought to allow this

                  writ appeal.



                  13.             W.A. No. 2082 of 2022


                  13.1.           This appeal arises out of the order dated 29.09.2021 passed by the

                  learned Judge in WP No. 20913 of 2021.



                  13.2.           The aforesaid writ petition has been filed praying to issue a Writ of

                  Mandamus directing the appellants to sanction annual increment to the writ

                  petitioner in the post of B.T. Assistant (Maths) from the year 2018 and also to

                  pay incentive increment for having acquired M.Sc., Mathematics without

                  reference to passing of TET.

                  on 08.09.2011 and his appointment was also duly approved by the educational

                  authorities on 27.12.2011. However, just prior to his appointment on

                  08.09.2011, the NCTE has issued the notification dated 27.09.2011, amending

                  the earlier notification dated 28.08.2010. As per the notification dated

                  27.09.2011, passing of TET is considered as one of the eligibilities for

                  appointment to the post of teacher taking classes from Standards I to VIII. It is

                  the stand of the writ petitioner that after his appointment to the post of B.T.

                  Assistant, the notification dated 27.09.2011 has been issued by NCTE and

                  therefore, he is not required to pass TET.



                  13.4.           The learned Judge allowed the writ petition by stating that as long as

                  the writ petitioner is in service, he is entitled for all the monetary benefits

                  attached to the post and he cannot be deprived of the same. Therefore, the

                  learned Judge allowed the writ petition and directed the appellants to confer all

                  the monetary benefits to the writ petitioner.



                  13.5.           Assailing the order passed by the learned Judge, it is contended on

                  behalf of the appellants that adequate time has been granted to the candidates

                  including the writ petitioner, to acquire TET qualification. The writ petitioner

                  who joined the service during the year 2011, did not pass TET till the date of

                  filing the writ petition. When a statute prescribes a particular qualification as a

                  minimum qualification for holding a post, the writ petitioner cannot be given

                  any exemption from possessing such qualification. In any event, the

                  appointment of the writ petitioner or continuance in service without the

                  mandatory TET qualification cannot be countenanced. In such circumstances,

                  the learned Judge ought not to have directed the appellants to confer all the

                  monetary benefits payable to the writ petitioner and hence, prayed for quashing

                  the same.

                  14.1.           The appellants are aggrieved by the order dated 28.04.2022 passed

                  by the learned Judge, dismissing their writ petition No. 35487 of 2019.

                  14.2.           The appellants have filed the aforesaid writ petition praying to issue

                  a Writ of Mandamus forbearing the respondents from insisting passing of TET

                  for their appointment in the fifth respondent school on 10.12.2010 and

                  22.01.2011 respectively prior to G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education

                  Department dated 15.11.2011 and consequently direct the respondents to

                  continue to make payment of salary, including other service benefits with

                  annual increment.



                  14.3.           Before the learned Judge, on behalf of the writ petitioners-appellants,

                  it was contended that the Government of Tamil Nadu issued G.O. (Ms.)

                  No.244, School Education (EE3(2)) Department dated 30.11.2013 in

                  compliance with the order passed by the Honourable Supreme Court and

                  therefore, they are not required to pass TET as a condition precedent for

                  continuing in the post to which they are appointed. However, the learned Judge

                  refused to accept such a plea by holding that the writ petitioners were

                  appointed in an Aided School, which is receiving aid from the State

                  Government. On the other hand, the order passed by the Honourable Supreme

                  Court confers certain protection to the teachers appointed through the TRB in

                  Government Schools. It was further held that TET has become mandatory to be

                  acquired and the writ petitioners cannot claim exemption on any ground. The

                  appointment of the writ petitioners as teachers in the fifth respondent school

                  has been made on 10.12.2010, 10.12.2010 and 22.01.2011 respectively, after

                  the notification dated 23.08.2010 was issued by the NCTE under 
Section 23

                  (1)
 of the RTE Act. Therefore, the writ petitioners cannot be granted exemption

                  from passing TET and they are equally governed by the mandate contained in

                  clause 5 (a) of the notification dated 23.08.2010 issued by the NCTE. Further,

                  the writ petitioners have not passed the TET till the extended time on

                  31.03.2019 or on 08.06.2019 and 09.06.2019. Therefore, the learned Judge

                  dismissed the writ petition filed by the writ petitioners/appellants.

                  14.4.           According to the appellants, they were appointed in accordance with

                  the Special Rules which was in force, without reference to TET. The

                  appointment of the writ petitioners were also approved by the educational

                  authority. The appellants have also received salary and other monetary benefits,

                  as applicable till December 2019. However, the fourth respondent orally

                  intimated the writ petitioners that they will not be paid the monetary benefits

                  attached to the post due to non-passing of TET. The notification issued by

                  NCTE on 11.02.2011 specifically states in Clause 9 that the Government

                  should give weightage to the TET scores in the recruitment process, meaning

                  thereby, passing of TET is mandatory during the selection for recruitment of

                  the post and it is not applicable to those who were already appointed, like the

                  writ petitioners-appellants. Therefore, the qualification prescribed under

                  
Section 23 (1)
 cannot be put against the writ petitioners who were appointed

                  much prior to the conduct of TET by the nodal agency for the first time in the

                  State. Even thereafter, the Government issued G.O. Ms. No.90 dated

                  28.03.2012 changing the policy for recruitment of secondary grade teacher and

                  Graduate Assistant by stating that "henceforth the recruitment will be based

                  on written examination in TET in accordance with guidelines framed by

                  NCTE." Thus it is evident that the notification issued by the NCTE as well as

                  the Government would indicate that TET cannot be insisted against those

                  candidates like the writ petitioners-appellants, who were appointed much prior

                  to G.O. Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011, G.O. Ms. No.90 dated 28.03.2012 and

                  petitioners- appellants are not required to pass TET.

                  14.5.           On behalf of the appellants, reference was made to the earlier orders

                  passed by this Court in WP No. 1126 of 2016 dated 24.01.2017 wherein it was

                  held that TET cannot be insisted to those candidates who were appointed much

                  after the issuance of G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011. Further, the

                  Honourable Supreme Court passed an order protecting those teachers

                  appointed prior to G.O. Ms. No.181 dated 15.11.2011 and therefore, the

                  learned Judge ought to have allowed the writ petition filed by the writ

                  petitioners-appellants.

                  School, Vettuvankeni, Chennai - 600 115, is one among the several schools

                  founded and administered by Congregation of the Sisters of St. Anne,

                  Tiruchirapalli. The said school, which is a minority educational institution, was

                  established in the year 1978 and presently it is imparting education to children

                  from Standards VI to XII. It was further stated that there are 31 teachers viz., 1

                  Headmistress, 2 Tamil Pandits, 10 BT Assistants, 15 Secondary Grade

                  Teachers, 2 Physical Education Teachers and 1 Sewing Mistress working in the

                  school. The teaching staff working in the school is in accordance with the

                  student strength and staff fixation done during the academic year 2019-2020.

                  While so, due to retirement of the teaching staff, they have appointed four

                  teaching staff in the sanctioned post and upon their appointment, necessary

                  proposal was sent for ratification of their appointment. While so, the District

                  Educational Officer, St. Thomas Mount returned the proposal submitted by the

                  petitioner School by citing an interim order dated 09.04.2019 passed by the

                  to the writ petitioner, the reliance made to the interim order dated 09.04.2019

                  15.4.           The learned Judge, upon hearing the counsel for both sides, placing

                  reliance on the earlier order dated 31.03.2021 in WA (MD) No. 76 of 2019,

                  allowed the writ petitions filed by the Writ Petitioner School by a common

                  order dated 22.10.2021. Aggrieved by the same, the present intra-court appeals

                  are filed.





15.5.           The appellants would state that the learned Judge allowed the writ

                  petitions on the ground that G.O. Ms. No.165, School Education Department

                  dated 17.09.2019 was ordered to be in-operative by the judgment dated

                  30.03.2021 in W.A. (MD) No. 76 of 2019 etc. batch. However, the

                  Government has filed Special Leave Petition before the Honourable Supreme

                  Court in which an order of interim stay was granted on 14.03.2022. Even

                  otherwise, the teachers appointed by the writ petitioner/School did not possess

                  TET qualification when they were appointed during the year 2020-2021. When

                  the minimum educational qualification prescribed for a teaching faculty is a

                  pass in TET and it is being adopted at the national level, the writ petitioner

                  cannot seek to dispense with such mandatory qualification to be possessed by

                  the teaching faculty. It is in those circumstances, the District Educational

                  Officer, St. Thomas Mount has rightly returned the proposals sent by the writ

                  15.6.           The appellants would further state that this Court, in the order dated

                  07.04.2022 made in WP No. 28284 of 2021 referred to the decision of

                  Honourable Supreme Court in 
Unaided Private School of Rajasthan v. Union

                  of India
 [2012 (6) Supreme Court Cases 1] wherein it was held that the

                  
Rights of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
 is

                  constitutionally valid. 
The Act
 is applicable to the writ petitioner school and the

                  appointment of the teachers without the mandatory TET qualification cannot be

                  ratified by the educational authorities. Therefore, the appellants would pray for

                  setting aside the common order dated 22.10.2021 passed by the learned Judge

                  in the writ petitions.

                  Subordinate Service. While so, after two decades of the appointment of the

                  appellants, on 26.08.2009, Parliament has passed the

                  compulsory education to all children of the age 6 to 14 year. 
The Act
 received

                  the assent of the President on 26.08.2009. Thereafter, on 23.08.2010, in

                  exercise of powers conferred under 
Section 23(1)
 of the RTE Act, the NCTE

                  issued a notification dated 23.08.2010 prescribing minimum educational

                  qualification for appointment of teacher to impart classes to students studying

                  in Classes I to VIII. However, even as per the NCTE Regulations which was in

                  force in the year 2001, TET was not mandatory.



                  16.2.           In line with the enactment of the 
RTE Act
, the Government of Tamil

                  Nadu issued G.O. Ms. No.181, School Education Department dated

                  15.11.2011 making TET mandatory for appointment of teacher. It is in those

                  circumstances, when Civil Appeal Nos. 6186 to 6187 of 2008 were taken up

                  for hearing by the Honourable Supreme Court on 05.09.2013, it was held that

                  "the Teachers who were appointed prior to G.O. dated 15.11.2011 will remain

                  protected". Thus, all the teachers appointed prior to 15.11.2011 are protected

                  and their services shall not be terminated for not passing TET as per the order

                  passed by the Honourable Supreme Court.



                  16.3.           Notwithstanding the above position, the Directorate of School

                  Education issued a notification dated 01.10.2014 stating that TET is

                  compulsory for all the teachers in service and directed that within five years of

                  their appointment as BT Assistant, they should pass TET. According to the

                  learned Senior counsel for the appellants, TET can be insisted to those who are

                  directly recruited to a teaching post and it cannot be insisted on the appellants

                  who have been appointed between 1991 to 2011 and had completed two

                  decades of service. While so, the observation made by the learned Judge in the

                  order dated 20.10.2022, which is impugned in Writ Appeal No. 2795 of 2022

                  that the teachers who do not possess the minimum qualification of pass in TET

                  are not entitled to continue in service in the schools/educational institutions is

                  legally not sustainable.



                  16.4.           The learned Senior counsel for the appellants further referred to the

                  order dated 05.09.2013 passed by the Honourable Supreme Court in Civil

                  Appeal Nos.6186 and 6187 of 2008 (State of Tamil Nadu and another v.

                  Unemployed Sec. Grade Teach. Welfare Association and others) wherein it

                  was held as follows:



                           "That the teachers who were appointed prior to the G.O. dated 15.11.2011
                           will remain protected and as far as the transfers sought by the teachers
                           outside their Districts are concerned, it is for them to apply to the authority
                           concerned and the authority concerned will consider their applications in
                           accordance with law.



                  16.5.           According to the learned Senior counsel, in the light of the above

                  observations made by the Honourable Supreme Court, the Teachers, who did

                  not pass TET and who were appointed prior to 15.11.2011 are protected and

                  that, insisting them to pass TET as a condition precedent for conferring

                  promotion to higher post is unjustified.



                  16.6.           The learned Senior counsel also placed reliance on the decision of the

                  Division Bench of this Court in The Secretary to Government, Government of

                  Tamil Nadu, Education Department, Fort St. George and others v. S.

                  Jeyalakshmi and others [(2016) 4 Law Weekly 841] wherein it was

                  categorically held in para No.55 that when once a person is appointed as

                  teacher after being found eligible as on the date of his or her appointment, he

                  cannot be expected to write an examination and to qualify himself in such

                  examination at a later point of time. The Division Bench also directed the

                  Government to seek necessary clarification from the NCTE in the light of such

                  observation made inter alia as to whether the prescription of minimum

                  qualification of TET can be made applicable prospectively for the Teachers who

                  were appointed subsequent to the date of the issue of Government Order in

                  both non-minority and minority institutions so as to benefit the Teachers who

                  have been serving for quite a long time. This observation of the Division Bench

                  of this Court would make it very clear that insisting TET for those who were

                  appointed long back, prior to the advent of 
RTE Act
 or to deny them the

                  legitimate promotion, is uncalled for.

                  for acquiring the TET qualification is 27.09.2011 and the teachers who were

                  appointed prior to that date need not pass TET. Even in the case of teachers

                  who were appointed after that date, if the advertisement to initiate the process

                  of appointment of teachers was made prior to that date, then their

                  appointments can also be in accordance with NCTE Regulations, 2001 and

                  they need not acquire the TET qualification. Thus, the learned senior counsel

                  sought to quash the order of the learned Judge by allowing this writ appeal.



                  17.1.           Ms. N. Kavitha Rameshwar, learned counsel appearing for the TET

                  passed Candidates Welfare Association/Petitioners in WP Nos. 3364 and 3368

                  of 2023, as also the impleaded respondents in W.A.No. 2795 of 2022, would

                  contend that a BT Assistant or a Graduate Teacher could be appointed either by

                  direct recruitment or by transfer or by promotion. Adding further, the learned

                  counsel submitted that the necessary qualification for the post of BT Assistant

                  is an Under graduation and B.Ed. degree and a pass in TET. The Tamilnadu

                  government has now framed Special Rules for Tamilnadu Elementary

                  (S.E3(1)) Department dated 30.01.2020. The said Rules while prescribing

                  qualifications for Graduate Teacher (BT Assistant) in its Annexure I (as

                  referred to in Rule 6) of the Special Rules specifies “a pass in TET” only for

                  direct recruitment. However, the mode of appointment to the said post of BT

                  Assistant/ Graduate Teacher is mentioned as transfer, promotion or direct

                  recruitment. This would mean that for transfer and promotion, the Government

                  is open to promoting Secondary Grade Teachers without TET qualification as

                  BT Assistants. The same is against the 
RTE Act
 and the Rules framed

                  thereunder and the notifications issued by the respondents 2 and 3 from time to

                  time apart from being unconstitutional.



 
17.2.           The learned counsel also submitted that as the NCTE Notifications

                  prescribing the qualifications did not mention or make any distinction in the

                  qualifications on the basis of the mode/channel of appointment, the State

                  Government cannot make such an artificial distinction and that, it would be

                  beyond the competence of the State Legislature to do the same as the field is

                  already occupied by Parliamentary legislation under Entry 66 of the Union

                  List. In this context, the learned counsel contended that when once the field is

                  occupied by Parliamentary legislation and the subject relates to an entry falling

                  within the exclusive domain of the Parliament under the Union List, the State

                  Legislature has intended to legislate on a subject in respect of which it has no

                  legislative competence, and thus the doctrine of colorable legislation is

                  attracted to the present case. The learned counsel relied on the Constitution

                  Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in 
K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo and

                  Ors. v. State of Orissa
 [(1954) 1 SCR 1], to substantiate her argument that

                  once a legislature does not have competence to enact law on a particular

                  subject, it cannot do indirectly what cannot be done directly. She further

                  submitted that the impugned Rules are illegal and ultravires the 
RTE Act
 and

                  the Rules framed thereunder and also the notifications dated 23.08.2010 &

                  29.07.2011, issued by the NCTE which prescribe TET as a mandatory

                  eligibility criteria for the post of BT Assistant and that, the impugned

                  provisions while prescribing the mode of appointment to the post of Graduate

                  Teacher as either by transfer, promotion or by direct recruitment, cannot

                  restrict TET as an essential eligibility criteria only for direct recruitment, when

                  the NCTE notifications issued under the 
RTE Act
 make TET mandatory for

                  appointment to the post of BT Assistant/Graduate Teacher.

                  17.3.           The learned counsel would further contend that the impugned Rules

                  are a colourable exercise of legislative power to the extent that it prescribes “a

                  pass in Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)” only for direct recruitment for the post

                  of BT Assistant and not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in

Education Act
 2009 and the Rules framed thereunder and the NCTE

                  Notification dated 23.08.2010 & 29.07.2011, and hence violative of 
Articles 14


                  and 
16
 of the Constitution of India. 
Section 23
 of the RTE Act makes it

                  mandatory that the minimum qualification prescribed by the academic

                  authority is necessary for being appointed as teacher to teach classes 1 to 8. A

                  graduate Teacher to teach classes 6 to 8 must also possess the necessary

                  qualification prescribed by the academic authority. The NCTE, the academic

                  authority had prescribed TET as minimum qualification for being appointed as

                  teacher. The impugned provisions are directly contrary to the above legal

                  provisions and hence, liable to be declared as illegal.

                  17.4.           The learned counsel also placed reliance on the NCTE Regulations

                  2001 to buttress her case that even earlier the NCTE has intended to follow the

                  qualifications for the respective posts in cases where there is movement from a

                  lower to a higher or next level post in cases of already appointed persons.

                  Further, a perusal of the Rules made by various States on the basis of the

                  NCTE Notifications prescribing qualifications, including a pass in TET, would

                  show that the said qualifications have been applied to both direct recruitment

                  as well as to promotion to the post of BT Assistants. Also, the Order in Special

                  Appeal No.737/2018, (Allahabad High Court) dated 04.09.2018 has been

                  pressed in to service by the learned counsel to contend that the very same

                  question arose before the Allahabad High Court and the Court has affirmed

                  that the qualifications prescribed by the NCTE including a pass in TET apply

                  to all appointments made after the cutoff date, i.e. 29.07.2011, including to

                  promotion to BT Assistant/Graduate Teacher.




                  17.5.           The learned counsel submitted that the impugned Rules would create

                  a situation where those appointed by direct recruitment to the post of BT

                  Assistant would be TET qualified while those appointed through promotion

                  would be unqualified in respect of TET, thereby defeating the provisions of the

                  
RTE Act
 that seeks to uniformly increase the standard of teaching and

                  education while ensuring the right to education under 
Article 21-A
 of the

                  Constitution of India.



                  17.6.           Lastly, the learned counsel would contend that though all the

                  members of the petitioner Association aspire for direct recruitment and the

                  Rules contemplate 50 percent of appointments to BT Assistant through direct

                  recruitment and 48 percent through promotion and the remaining 2 per cent by

                  transfer from among categories mentioned therein, the writ petitioners and

                  others are aggrieved by the impugned Rules on account of the fact that while

                  the Government has not made any direct recruitment for a decade, it keeps

                  filling up all vacant positions of BT/Graduate Assistants through promotion

                  from among candidates not possessing a pass in TET and that, the Government

                  has not maintained the requisite quota for direct recruits, thereby meaning that

                  unqualified candidates are being promoted while qualified candidates are

                  waiting in the queue endlessly without employment and thus, the challenge is

                  to the Rules relating to promotion.



                  17.7.           That apart, Ms. Kavitha Rameshwar, learned counsel for the writ

                  petitioners, placed reliance on several judgments with regard to the issue

                  relating to the maintainability of the writ petition filed by a registered

                  Association. It is her contention that the Association represents the unemployed

                  teachers who are eligible and qualified and cannot be expected to individually

                  knock the doors of the Court as they suffer from financial disability and the

                  nature of their grievances are the same.





                  18.1.           Mr. Silambannan, learned Additional Advocate General appearing for

                  the State would contend that after the advent of 
RTE Act
 and appointment of

                  TRB as nodal agency to conduct TET in the State, the teachers were required to

                  pass the examination conducted by TRB within five years from 01.04.2010 to

                  31.03.2015. However, the deadline to pass the TET has been extended until

                  31.03.2019. Thus, nine years’ time was given to the teachers to acquire the

                  qualification, but several teachers have not acquired the TET qualification. He

                  would also submit that without such qualification, appointments were made in

                  Government Aided Schools and therefore, the educational agency did not

                  approve their appointment. But, those teachers whose appointments have not

                  been approved or who were not paid the monetary benefits such as annual

                  increment etc., have approached this Court with various writ petitions and

                  obtained orders in their favour.



                  18.2.           According to the learned Additional Advocate General, the State

                  Government scrupulously adheres to the provisions of 
RTE Act
 and insists the

                  teaching faculty to pass TET as mandated under the 
RTE Act
. So far as the

                  Government Schools are concerned, only the TET passed teachers are

                  appointed through TRB after the coming into force of the 
RTE Act
. At the same

                  time, the learned Additional Advocate General made reference to clauses 4 and

                  5 of the notification dated 23.08.2010 issued by NCTE stating that those

                  teachers appointed on or after 3rd September 2001 i.e., the date on which the

                  NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualification for Recruitment of Teachers

                  in Schools) Regulations, 2001 (as amended from time to time) came into force

                  in accordance with that Regulation.



                  18.3.           The learned Additional Advocate General further submitted that

                  promotion to the teachers in Government Schools is governed by the relevant

                  Service Rules namely Tamil Nadu School Education Subordinate Service Rules

                  or Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary Educational Service Rules. In none of the

                  aforesaid Rules it was prescribed that passing of TET for promotion of teachers

                  to other categories is mandatory. Therefore, the teachers appointed before

                  01.04.2010 were exempted from passing TET. At the same time, those who are

                  recruited directly to the post of B.T. Assistant after the said date must have

                  passed TET. It is further submitted by the learned Additional Advocate General

                  that whenever a new legislation or rule is introduced, it will only have

                  prospective effect unless otherwise specifically notified that it will come into

                  force from a particular date. In the present case, the 
RTE Act
 was enacted on

                  and from 01.04.2010. Therefore, the teachers appointed much prior to the

                  coming into force of the said Act are not required to clear TET and they are

                  exempted from passing the TET.



                  18.4.           With respect to promotion, it is submitted by the learned Additional

                  Advocate General that once a teacher has been directly recruited under the

                  governing Service Rules, his or her promotion or career prospects have to be

                  decided only based on the Rules which were in force on the date of his or her

                  appointment. As such, those who were appointed much prior to the coming

                  into force of the Act are exempted from passing TET and consequently, they

                  are entitled for further promotion based on their seniority and merits.

                  in W.A. No. 2617 of 2022 submitted that the appellants were appointed on

                  10.12.2010, 10.12.2010 and 22.01.2011 in the fifth respondent school. They

                  were appointed in the vacancies that arose on 01.06.2009 due to retirement of

                  teachers. The fifth respondent school, upon obtaining permission during

                  September 2010 and on 28.12.2010 respectively appointed the appellants. The

                  appointment of the appellants were also approved by the educational

                  authorities on 24.02.2011. Thus, the appellants were appointed in accordance

                  with the Special Rules without reference to TET. In the orders of appointment

                  issued to the appellants, there was no pre-condition imposed to pass TET.

                  While so, in the year 2019, the appellants were orally informed that they will

                  not be eligible for payment of annual increment etc., for not passing TET.

                  19.2.           The learned Senior counsel for the appellants invited the attention of

                  this Court to the notifications dated 23.08.2010 and 11.02.2011 issued by

                  NCTE and submitted that the directions contained therein can be made

                  applicable only to the appointments to be made and not to those who were

                  already appointed. He had drawn the attention of this Court to clause 9 of the

                  notification dated 11.02.2011 of the NCTE wherein it was stated that the

                  Government should give weightage to the TET scores in the recruitment

                  process, meaning thereby, TET can be insisted only to those who are newly

                  recruited or appointed. Even the State Government in G.O. Ms. No. 90, School

                  Education Department dated 28.03.2012 has directed that "henceforth, the

                  recruitment will be based on written examination, namely TET in accordance

                  with the guidelines issued by NCTE." The words "henceforth" employed in

                  G.O. (Ms) No. 90, dated 28.03.2012 will make it amply clear that TET can be

                  insisted only for the appointments to be made by resorting to a recruitment

                  process and not to those who were already recruited and are in service.

                  However, the learned Judge had concluded that the appointment of the

                  appellants is after 23.08.2010, the date on which the NCTE issued the

                  notification prescribing minimum educational qualification to be possessed by

                  the Teachers in Classes I to VIII. The learned Judge further held that the

                  process of appointment was initiated after 23.08.2010 and therefore, the

                  appellants will not fall under the exempted category of cases. However, the

                  learned Judge did not take note of the fact that as on 23.08.2010, the TRB has

                  not conducted any TET examination and there are no qualified person available

                  with TET qualification to be appointed as Teacher. While so, the learned Senior

                  counsel submits that the appellants will come under the exempted category and

                  consequently, passing of TET cannot be insisted against them.



                  19.3.           
In support of his contention, the learned Senior counsel invited the

                  attention of this Court to the decision of this Court dated 30.07.2020 passed in

                  WP (MD) No. 8313 of 2020 etc., in the case of 
D.Raja Malar v. State of

                  Tamil Nadu and others
, where, in similar circumstances, this Court held as

                  follows:




                            "15.Therefore, it has become quite clear that the appointment of the
                            petitioners as on 17.09.2010, 20.06.2011 and 20.06.2011 having been
                            approved by the third respondent through the said approval order, the
                            applicability of the prescription made by NCTE to have such qualification,
                            insofar as the petitioners are concerned, cannot be made or applied.
                            Therefore, the said reason cited in the impugned order by the third
                            respondent, in the considered opinion of this Court, may not hold good.
                            Therefore, on that reason, the petitioners service benefit like annual
                            increment cannot be denied.



                            16.Moreover, once the appointments are approved by the authority and the
                            same still holds good, the petitioners have been brought under regular time
                            scale of pay. When that being the position, the annual increment is part and
                            parcel of the time scale of pay system being adopted for government
                            employees/Teachers of the Government is concerned and when such is the
                            position, the third respondent cannot insist upon any Government Order,
                            which cannot be created by the petitioners.



                            17.Moreover, if at all any such request is made by the petitioners for annual
                            increment, that should have been decided by the respondents by taking into
                            account the relevant Rule position, Service Law and the Government Order,
                            if any available with the respondents, instead, off late, it has become a
                            practice that some of the officials/authorities would raise a question that, in
                            order to get the benefit sought for by the employees/Teacher/incumbent,
                            whether any Government Order is available in their favour.



                  19.4.           The learned Senior counsel also placed reliance on the order dated

                  29.09.2021 passed in WP No. 20911 of 2021 as well as the order dated


                  20.12.2021 passed in WP No. 25138 of 2021, wherein this Court issued a

                  Mandamus directing the respondents therein to continue to pay the annual

                  increment and other monetary benefits to the petitioners therein without

                  insisting TET.

                  19.5.           The learned Senior counsel for the appellants further relied on the

                  order passed by the Madurai bench of this Court in WP (MD) Nos. 5626 to

                  5630 of 2017 etc., batch. According to the learned Senior counsel, the common

                  prayer sought for in those writ petitions is to issue a Writ of Mandamus to

                  forbear the official respondents from insisting the writ petitioners to pass TET

                  for continuing their service as B.T. Assistant in the respondents schools. All the

                  writ petitioners in those cases were admittedly appointed before issuance of

                  notification and their appointments were also approved by the Educational

                  Authorities. While so, it was contended on their behalf that when their

                  appointment is proper, they cannot be compelled to write TET as a condition

                  precedent for continuing in their service. This Court, upon examining the fact

                  as to whether the writ petitioners, who were appointed before the cutoff date

                  are entitled to get exemption from passing TET, after an in-depth analysis of

                  the same, held that the writ petitioners are entitled to seek exemption from

                  passing TET, as they were appointed prior to the cutoff date and the

                  respondents were directed not to insist TET certificate from the writ petitioners

                  as a condition precedent for their continuance in service as B.T. Assistants.

                  19.6.           Reliance was also placed on the decision of the Division Bench of

                  this Court in 
The Secretary to Government, Government of Tamil Nadu,

                  Education Department and others v. S. Jeyalakshmi and another
 [2016 (4)

                  64/134

                                                                                         WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch


                  Law Weekly 841]. In that case, this Court had an occasion to consider as to

                  whether the teachers, who were appointed prior to the Government Order

                  introducing TET as a condition, are required to acquire TET qualification

                  within a period of five years so as to continue in their service. The Division

                  Bench of this Court, in Para Nos. 55 to 58 held as follows:


                            "55. A reading of the qualifications extracted above would clearly show that
                            the B.T. Assistants are being appointed only if they are qualified and
                            possessed with Teachers Training Certificate. As per G.O. Ms. No.181
                            dated 18.11.2011, Secondary Grade Teachers are being appointed only if
                            they are qualified and possessed with Diploma in Teachers Education. Thus,
                            it is evident that the persons who underwent either Teachers Training course
                            or Diploma in Teachers Education alone are eligible for appointment either
                            as B.T. Assistants or Secondary Grade Teachers as the case may be.
                            Therefore, there cannot be an iota of doubt as to their eligibility for
                            appointment as Teachers. Once they are appointed as Teachers after having
                            been found eligible as on the said date of their appointment, they cannot be
                            expected to write an examination and to qualify in such examination at a
                            much later point of time.



                            56. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the Government may seek
                            a clarification from the NCTE, in the light of what is stated in the preceding
                            paragraph, whether the prescription of minimum qualification of TET can
                            be made applicable prospectively for the Teachers who were appointed
                            subsequent to the date of the issue of G.O., in both non-minority and
                            minority institutions and not retrospectively as the same would cause undue
                            hardship to the Teachers who have been serving for a quite a long time.



                            57. In case of NCTE clarifying that G.O. can be given prospective effect, the
                            Government, in its wisdom, may think of conducting refresher course for the
                            Teachers who were appointed prior to the issue of G.O., during the annual
                            vacation, instead of insisting for qualifying in TET, since the Teachers have
                            already undergone either Teachers Training Course or Diploma in Teachers
                            Education, as the case may be, as per the 
Education Act
 of the State.
                            Moreover, we are of the opinion that asking the Teachers who have been
                            appointed after having found eligible and working for quite a long time, to
                            undergo TET examination and to pass the same at this stage, would be
                            nothing but imposing upon them a task, which they have already achieved
                            by passing the requisite tests for getting appointed. Further, an uncertainty
                            also would get created in the minds of the Teachers that lest they pass the

                                                                                         WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                            TET examination, their career would be hanging in balance as the
                            Damocles Sword. Keeping the above in mind, the Government may, in
                            consultation with NCTE, formulate a scheme for conducting refresher
                            course for those Teachers who were appointed prior to the issue of G.O., as
                            this would set at rest the uncertainty that would otherwise get created in the
                            minds of the persons already in employment.



                            58. In our opinion, non qualifying in TET by the Teachers already in service
                            should not defeat the object of the Government to provide quality and
                            standard education and therefore, the Government may, in the alternative,
                            conduct a refresher course and also some interactive sessions during
                            annual vacation, in order to ensure and enhance the quality of education."



                  19.7.           By placing reliance on the aforesaid decision, the learned Senior

                  counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants are governed by the

                  conditions imposed or the Rule prevailing as on the date of their appointment

                  and hence, they cannot be compelled to pass TET which was introduced much

                  after their appointment. With these submissions, the learned Senior counsel

                  prayed for allowing this appeal.



                  20.             Mr. V. Ashok Kumar, learned Central Government Counsel

                  appearing for the first respondent in WP Nos. 3364 and 3368 of 2023 would

                  submit that the 
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009


(Amendment Act, 2012
) which represents the consequential legislation

                  envisaged under 
Article 21-A
 of the Constitution of India came into force on

                  01.04.2010. Subsequently, the Central Government formulated the Central

                  RTE Rules, 2010 which could be adopted by the Union Territories not having

                  the legislative Assembly. The Government of India also formulated the model

                  RTE Rules, which were to be adopted by the concerned State based on the

                  ground realities prevailing in the particular State. 
Section 23
 of the RTE Act,

                  prescribes the qualification for appointment and the terms and conditions of

                  service of teachers. 
Section 23 (2)
 confers relaxation for teachers who were

                  appointed or in position as on 31st March 2015, which means that this clause

                  applies on those teachers who are in-service as on 31st March 2015. Further,

                  as per 
Section 23 (2)
, the relaxation can be given only in academic

                  qualifications in a case where a State does not have adequate institutions

                  offering course or training in Teachers Education. Even such relaxation can be

                  conferred till 31st March 2019 and not thereafter. He would further submit that

                  TET is mandated by NCTE and therefore, the question of relaxation in TET is

                  not covered under the above mentioned sections of the 
RTE Act
. The Central

                  Government has authorised the NCTE to lay down certain minimum

                  qualification to be possessed by a person to become eligible for appointment of

                  a teacher. Accordingly, the NCTE issued a notification dated 23.08.2010 and

                  one of the essential qualifications for a person to be eligible for appointment as

                  a teacher is that he or she should pass TET which will be conducted by the

                  appropriate Government. In effect, the learned Central Government Counsel

                  submitted that the recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers

                  are primarily in the domain of respective State Governments and Union

                  Territory Administrations. As per the 
RTE Act
, it is for the appropriate

                  Government to take a decision on employment of teachers in accordance with

                  the provisions of the 
RTE Act, 2017
.



                  21.             Mr. Karthikeyan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in

                  CMP Nos. 6050 and 6349 of 2023, which were filed to implead themselves as

                  party respondents in W.A. No. 2795 of 2022, would contend that the

                  petitioners were appointed as Teachers during 1995 to 2001 on various dates

                  and they cannot be brought within the fold of TET. The petitioners are working

                  as such for more than 25 years and are waiting for their legitimate promotion

                  to the post of B.T. Assistant. However, by citing the non-passing of TET, they

                  are deprived of their legitimate promotion, which is unjustified. The provisions

                  contained under the 
RTE Act
 or the notifications issued by NCTE prescribing

                  minimum educational qualification vis-a-vis a pass in TET cannot be put

                  against the petitioners to deny them their legitimate promotion. He placed

                  reliance on the order passed by the Government in G.O. Ms. No.171, School

                  Education Department dated 18.08.2008 and contends that if the petitioners

                  are given promotion from the post of Secondary Grade Teacher to B.T.

                  Assistant, the post which they have held (Secondary Grade Teacher) will

                  automatically be converted as B.T. Assistant in which event no one will be

                  prejudiced. The learned counsel therefore prayed for allowing the impleading

                  petitions and to direct the Government to conduct the promotion counselling to

                  the petitioners to the post of B.T. Assistant without insisting TET.


                  22.             We have heard the learned counsel appearing for all the parties at

                  length and also perused the materials placed on record.




                  III.            DISCUSSION & FINDINGS

                  A.              W.A. No. 2795/2022 & W.P. Nos. 3364 and 3368/2023


                  23.             The writ appeal arises out of the order of the Learned Judge wherein

                  it has been held that the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) shall be an essential

                  eligibility criteria for those aspiring to be promoted as Graduate Teachers/ BT

                  Assistants from the post of Secondary Grade Teachers. Apart from the various

                  submissions made by the appellants, who were the writ petitioners originally,

                  seeking promotion to the post of BT Assistant from the post of Secondary

                  Grade teacher without insistence on TET, it is pertinent to mention that under

                  the Special Rules for the Tamil Nadu School Educational Subordinate Service

                  issued vide GO. Ms. No. 13 School Education [S.E.3 (1)] dated 30.01.2020, it

                  has been stipulated that for the post of Graduate Teacher/ B.T. Assistant, a pass

                  in Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is mandatory only for direct recruitment as

                  mentioned in Annexure I to the Special Rules, as referred to in Rule 6 of the

                  said Rules. The said Rules have been made by the State Government under

                  
Article 309
 of the Constitution.

                  24.             It is also pertinent to mention that while heavy reliance has been

                  placed by the appellants on the said Rules which lends assistance to the sheet

                  anchor of their case that TET as an eligibility criteria is required to be fulfilled

                  only in the case of direct recruitment to the post of BT Assistant, the Learned

                  Judge has, even in the face of the said Special Rules, adopted the view that it is

                  mandatory even for promotion to the post of BT Assistant from the category of

                  secondary grade teacher after the coming into force of the 
RTE Act, 2009
 and

                  the NCTE notifications issued pursuant thereto. In the light of the operation of

                  the Special Rules as stated above, stating that a pass in TET is required only

                  for direct recruitment to the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant, the natural

                  outcome should be that in the absence of a challenge to the Rules, the position

                  stated in the Rules would have to be applied. However, while the said Rules

                  had not been subject to challenge before the Learned Judge, the said Rules

                  have now been challenged by way of two writ petitions and therefore, the moot

                  question would now be on the validity or otherwise of the said Special Rules.

                  The entire issue therefore now narrows down to the validity or otherwise of the

                  said Special Rules which have now been challenged before us. Once we

                  pronounce upon the validity of the said rules, all the issues including the

                  correctness of the order passed by the Learned Judge in the present writ

                  appeal, would stand settled.



                  25.             The essential question therefore relates to the determination of the

                  validity of the Special Rules (hereinafter referred to as “the impugned Rules”)

                  by which it has been prescribed that for the post of Graduate Teacher/BT

                  Assistant, a pass in Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) is mandatory for direct

                  recruitment alone. Two writ petitions have been filed challenging the vires of

                  the said Rules, one of them being by a registered Association that espouses the

                  cause of all candidates who have passed TET, and the other petition by an

                  individual who is an aspirant for the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant, by

                  direct recruitment.

                  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA


                  26.             
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009


                  was passed with the avowed objective of ensuring free and compulsory

                  education to all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years, pursuant to 
Article

                  21-A
 inserted by the Constitution (86th amendment) 2002 which provides for

                  free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years

                  as a fundamental right. 
The RTE Act
 also aimed at raising the standard of

                  education, and came into force on 01.04.2010. 
Under the Act
, the term ‘school’

                  is defined as follows:

                                  “2(n) “School” means any recognized school imparting elementary
                                  education and includes –

                                  Government or a local authority;

                                  appropriate Government or the local authority.”



                  27.             At the commencement of the Act, under 
Section 23
 of the Act, it has

                  been stated as follows:



                                  “23. Qualifications for appointment and terms and conditions of service
                                  of teachers.—
                                  (1) Any person possessing such minimum qualifications, as 
laid down by

                                  an academic authority, authorised by the Central Government, by
                                  notification, shall be eligible for appointment as a teacher.
                                  (2) Where a State does not have adequate institutions offering courses or
                                  training in teacher education, or teachers possessing minimum
                                  qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1) are not available in
                                  sufficient numbers, the Central Government may, if it deems necessary, by
                                  notification, relax the minimum qualifications required for appointment
                                  as a teacher, for such period, not exceeding five years, as may be
                                  specified in that notification:

                                  Provided that a teacher who, at the commencement of this Act, does not
                                  possess minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1), shall
                                  acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of five years.”


                  28.             Thereafter, by Notification dated 31.03.2010, the 1st respondent

                  appointed the 2nd respondent NCTE as the academic authority to lay down the

                  minimum qualifications for a person to be eligible to be appointed as a teacher.

                  On 08.10.2010, the 1st respondent by virtue of powers conferred under 
Section

                  38
 of the Act, framed Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education

                  Teacher Education (NCTE) issued a notification dated 23.08.2010 prescribing

                  the minimum qualifications for teachers from Classes I to V- ‘Secondary Grade

                  Teachers’ as well as for Classes VI to VIII- ‘BT Assistant’. Apart from

                  prescribing the minimum educational qualifications, the important eligibility

                  criteria added by way of the notification is – “Pass in Teacher Eligibility Test

                  (TET)”. This notification stated under paragraph 4 that teachers appointed

                  prior to the date of this notification need not acquire the minimum qualification

                  prescribed by the notifications. Under para 5 it has been stated that those

                  teachers appointed after date of this notification, but in whose case the process

                  of appointment was initiated prior to the date of this notification would also be

                  exempt from acquiring the minimum qualifications including Teacher Eligibility

                  Test (TET) as prescribed under Para 1 of the notification. The said Para 5 of

                  the notification dated 23.08.2010 came to be amended by the notification of

                  the NCTE dated 29.07.2011 whereby Para 5 was substituted by Para 5(a) with

                  the same provision while shifting the cut off date from 23.08.2010 to

                  29.07.2011, meaning thereby that where the Government, Local Authority or

                  School issued the advertisement to initiate the process of appointment prior to

                  the date of this notification i.e., 29.07.2011, such appointments may also be

                  made in accordance with the NCTE Regulations 2001 i.e., exempting them

                  from acquiring TET for appointment as the teacher. The NCTE Notification

                  dated 11.02.2011 issued guidelines relating to conduct of TET. In Para 3 of the

                  said Guidelines (though subsequently amended in notification dated

                  29.07.2011 and the reason for same is not understood), the rationale for

                  including the TET as minimum qualification can be seen, and the same is

                  reproduced:



                                  “3. The rationale for including the TET as a minimum qualification for a
                                  person to be eligible to be appointed as a teacher is as under:

                                  (i) It would bring national standards and benchmark of teacher quality in the
                                  recruitment process;

                                  (ii) It would induce teacher education institutions and students from these
                                  institutions to further improve their performance standards;

                                  (iii) It would send a positive signal to all stakeholders that the Government lays
                                  special emphasis on teacher quality.”


                  29.             Thereafter, the State Government framed the Tamil Nadu Right of

                  Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011 vide GO. Ms. No.

                  173 dated 08.11.2011. The State Government issued GO.Ms.No. 181 dated

                  15.11.2011, appointing Teachers Recruitment Board (hereinafter called ‘TRB’)

                  as the nodal agency to conduct TET exams. The said GO makes it very clear in

                  categorical terms that passing of TET is mandatory for all Secondary Grade

                  Teachers and BT Assistants in Tamil Nadu.

                  of the writ petition by an Association, it is only appropriate that we deal with

                  the said issue first. The issue whether a writ petition is maintainable at the

                  instance of an Association is now no longer res integra and the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court has made authoritative pronouncements laying down broad

                  guidelines on the said issue in various judgements, most of which have been

                  relied upon by the counsel for the petitioner in the writ petition impugning the

                  Special Rules. The following judgments have been referred to by the Learned

                  law 
laid down in
 
State Bank of Bikaner
's case (cited above) by this court,

                  succinctly states as follows:




                                  “8.Before the learned single Judge, several contentions were raised, one
                                  with respect to the defence of party, the other with respect to the nature of
                                  the relief and the third with respect to any right of the members of the writ
                                  petitioner-Association to claim anything in the name of interest beyond
                                  what had been stipulated under 
Regulation 12
 aforesaid. Learned Single
                                  Judge has held :

                                      "Keeping in trend with the pronouncements of the Supreme Court, it
                                      is not possible to throw out the writ petition at the threshold itself on
                                      the sole ground that it has been filed by an association of
                                      employees, without going into the merits of the other contentions.
                                      Even otherwise, the second petitioner is an individual employees
                                      and he must be deemed to be directly interested in and affected by
                                      the proposed action of the respondents. Besides, the first petitioner
                                      is a registered trade union, and it is stated that it has got
                                      membership of about 5,000, who are all employees of the second
                                      respondent all over India. It cannot be stated that the rights of its
                                      members would not be affected by the proposed action of the
                                      respondent. The writ laid by the first petitioner, as representing a
                                      large body of employees of the second respondent whose rights and
                                      interest are likely to be affected, must be held to be competent.
                                      Representative actions even in Writ jurisdiction cannot be thrown
                                      out on the simple ground that the body which represents the cause
                                      of its members on roll is not by itself affected. It would suffice the
                                      purpose if the rights of its members are affected; and then, as
                                      observed by the Supreme Court, collective proceedings are
                                      permissible instead of driving each individual employee affected to
                                      file an independent writ, which would result only in plurality of

                                      litigation on the common question. The Supreme Court was
                                      prepared to countenance a non-recognised association maintaining
                                      a writ petition. As observed earlier, the first petitioner is a
                                      Registered trade union and it can legitimately, as representing its
                                      member, employees of the second respondent, give vent to their
                                      grievance and seek redress and relief, as representing their cause."

 
For us to say, if at all it is necessary, that, this is the most correct view is
                                  not a mere formality. Learned single Judge has not come to the said
                                  conclusion without examining the scope of the writ action by a body of
                                  individual members, who together joined as an Association for such
                                  action, which is in the interest of all the members. He has rightly
                                  distinguished the cases of 
N.A. District Pawn Brokers' Association v.

                                  Judgment dated August 11, 1980) and relied upon the statement of law in
                                  the case of F.C.K.U. (Registered).

                                  the subject has been candidly stated by the Supreme Court in the last of
                                  them that MANU/SC/0058/1980 : (1981) I LLJ 209 SC at 230" a technical
                                  point of this kind has to be overruled for the reasons that a large body of
                                  persons with a common grievance can always approach the Court on
                                  principle, "our current procedural jurisdiction is not of individualistic
                                  Anglo-Indian mould. It is broad-based and people-oriented and envisions
                                  access to justice through 'class actions,' 'public interest litigation' and
                                  'representative proceedings'. Indeed, little Indians in large numbers
                                  seeking remedies in Court through collective proceedings; instead of being
                                  driven to an expensive plurality of litigations, is an affirmation of
                                  participative justice in our democracy. We have no hesitation in holding
                                  that the narrow concept of 'cause of action', and 'person aggrieved' and
                                  individual litigation is becoming obsolescent in some jurisdictions. It must
                                  fairly be stated that the learned Attorney General has taken no objection to
                                  a non-recognised association maintaining the writ petitions." In the instant
                                  case, the Association is a recognised body as a trade union of the
                                  employees.”

                  Thus, the principle that emerges from the above is that a body of individuals,

                  who have a common grievance and by reason of some disability, or incapacity,

                  are not in a position to approach the court individually, a writ petition is

                  certainly maintainable by an association.

                  32.             In the present case, the writ petition has been filed by an association

                  which espouses the cause of its members who are all persons who have cleared

                  the teacher eligibility test and have been unemployed while waiting for direct

                  recruitment to the post of BT Assistant for more than a decade now. It has also

                  been mentioned in the affidavit that it is one of the most prominent associations

                  whose members are qualified persons eligible to be appointed as teachers and

                  who possess a pass in TET. When the grievance of all the members of the

                  petitioner Association is common, it would be to stand on technicality to say

                  that each one of those members and each one of the members of the public

                  who have a common grievance should have approached the court individually,

                  and that the Association cannot represent its members in a case of this nature.

                  Such a hyper technical approach would amount to a negation of justice and this

                  Court is clearly not in favour of such an approach, especially in the light of the

                  pronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard.


                  33.             With respect to the other writ petition filed by an individual who is

                  an aspirant for direct recruitment to the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant,

                  the objection raised by the State Government was that as the Rules stipulate a

                  quota of 50% for direct recruitment and the remaining for appointment by

                  promotion and transfer, the petitioner cannot have any grievance with respect

                  78/134

                                                                             WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  to the manner in which appointment is made by promotion from the post of

                  Secondary Grade Teacher to the post of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant. In this

                  regard, the counsel for the petitioner had stated that while the Rules specify a

                  quota of 50% for direct recruitment, it is a fact that in the state of Tamil Nadu,

                  as admitted by the state government, direct recruitment to the post of Graduate

                  Teachers/BT Assistants, after the coming into force of the 
RTE Act
 and NCTE

                  notifications, has not been made after 2013. The state government also has not

                  come out with a clear picture as to the number of vacancies available in the

                  post of Graduate teachers and the number of posts for direct recruitment as

                  against the number of posts/vacancies available for promotion. It is the case of

                  the petitioner that while the state government is wanting to promote more and

                  more secondary grade teachers as graduate teachers without insistence on TET,

                  while also filling up several vacancies by temporary appointments without

                  insistence on TET, the posts which are supposed to be earmarked for direct

                  recruitment to the post of graduate teachers are also being taken up, and by

                  reason of their being qualified and yet being unemployed for the past 10 years

                  and more, and inspite of which, when the impugned Rules stipulate that TET is

                  an essential criterion for appointment only for direct recruitment and not for

                  promotion or other modes of appointment, it will definitely affect their rights.

                  After giving our anxious consideration to the grievances expressed by the

                  79/134

                  petitioners in the writ petitions, this court is convinced that the writ by an

                  association which is espousing the common grievances of all similarly placed

                  persons who are qualified and unemployed, as well as the writ petitioner in WP

                  No.3368 of 2023, is maintainable and the said writ petitions cannot be thrown

                  out at the threshold on the ground of non-maintainability. Besides, the right to

                  equality of opportunity in public employment under 
Article 16
 as a facet of

                  
Article 14
, is a cherished fundamental right that furthers the solemn ideals of

                  equality and justice as envisaged in our Constitution. This Court while dealing

                  with a matter of public employment under 
Article 16
, cannot reject the petitions

                  on hyper technical ground of non-maintainability.





                  VALIDITY OF THE IMPUGNED RULES


                  34.             Coming to the merits of the case, the validity of the impugned Rules

                  has to be tested on the anvil of the legislative competence of the State

                  Legislature to issue them in the teeth of the parliamentary legislation, viz. the

                  
RTE Act
 2009 and the NCTE notifications prescribing the minimum eligibility

                  requirement for the post of Graduate Teacher, the NCTE being the designated

                  academic authority under the Act. It is seen that under Entry 66 of List I in

                  Schedule VII to the Constitution, the legislative head mentioned is –

                  ‘Coordination and determination of standards in institution for higher

                  80/134

                                                                              WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  education or research and scientific and technical institutions’. Also,

                  ‘Education, including technical education, medical education and universities,

                  subject to the provisions of entries 63,64,65 and 66 of List I; vocational and

                  technical training of labour’, as a head of legislation is found in Entry 25 of

                  List III (Concurrent list) under Schedule VII to the Constitution of India. Entry

                  66 of List I deals with coordination and determination of standards of higher

                  education. Teacher education has been legislated upon by the Union

                  government by way of parliamentary legislation by virtue of the 
RTE Act
 2009.

                  
Under the Act
, the NCTE which has been designated as the academic authority,

                  has issued notifications prescribing the minimum eligibility criteria for the post

                  of Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant and the same is binding on all state

                  governments unless the law to the contrary has been made by the state

                  government in accordance with 
Article 254
 of the Constitution. Here again, the

                  legislative head as stated in Entry 25 of List III, has been made subject to Entry

                  66, List I and hence, the area available for the State to legislate in the arena of

                  teacher education is diminished to the point of non-availability. In the present

                  case, it is seen that the state of Tamil Nadu is not governed by any specific

                  legislation or statute dealing with teacher education and therefore, the further

                  question of the same being either contrary or repugnant to the provisions of the

                  
RTE Act
 and the consequential or pursuant subordinate legislation does not

                  arise. In other words, the parliamentary legislation as well as the subordinate

                  legislation made pursuant thereto are binding on the state government in the

                  absence of a plenary legislation made by the state legislature pursuant to its

                  power under the Concurrent List, which again is subject to the parliamentary

                  legislation made under Entry 66, List I. It is in this background that one will

                  have to test the validity of the impugned Rules. A perusal of the NCTE

                  notification made pursuant to the 
RTE Act
 would make it clear that the NCTE

                  has prescribed eligibility criteria in terms of educational qualification as also a

                  pass in the teacher eligibility test for appointment to the post of graduate

                  teacher. As pointed out rightly by the counsel for the petitioners in the writ

                  petitions challenging the vires of the impugned Rules, the mode of appointment

                  or the channel of appointment whether by direct recruitment or promotion or

                  transfer has not been specified in any of the prescribed qualifications made by

                  the NCTE. What has been prescribed by the NCTE is the eligibility criteria for

                  appointment by whatever means/mode to the posts of Graduate Teacher/BT

                  Assistant. On the contrary, it is seen that the impugned Rules while apparently

                  adopting the eligibility criteria as mentioned by the NCTE, has now attempted

                  to restrict the eligibility criteria of passing the teacher eligibility test only to

                  direct recruitment. The very same impugned Rules also specify that 50% of the

                  appointments to the postgraduate teacher are to be made by direct recruitment,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis



                  82/134

                                                                                           WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  while 48% is to be made by promotion and the remaining 2% by transfer from

                  other posts as specified in the Rules made therein. When the Academic

                  Authority designated under the parliamentary legislation has not made

                  distinction in the eligibility criteria on the basis of the channel or mode of

                  appointment, it is not legally permissible for the state government to prescribe

                  or make modifications which are contrary to what has been prescribed by

                  subordinate legislation made pursuant to the parliamentary legislation which

                  holds the field.



                  35.             
In this context, the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Union

                  of India (UOI) and Ors. v. Shah Goverdhan L. Kabra Teachers College


                  [(23.10.2002 - SC) : MANU/SC/0882/2002], where the issue was one related

                  to legislative competence of the State to alter or dilute the parliamentary

                  legislative provisions in teacher education, is of relevance and is extracted

                  hereunder for easy reference:




                                  “6. In view of the rival submissions at the bar, the question that arises for
                                  consideration is whether the impugned legislation can be held to be a law
                                  dealing with coordinated development of education system within Entry 66
                                  of the List I of the Seventh Schedule or it is a law dealing with the service
                                  conditions of an employee under the State Government. The power to
                                  legislate is engrafted under 
Article 246
 of the Constitution and the various
                                  entries for the three lists of the Seventh Schedule are the "fields of
                                  legislation". The different entries being legislative heads are all of
                                  enabling character and are designed to define and delimit the respective
                                  areas of legislative competence of the Union and the State legislature.
                                  They neither impose any restrictions on the legislative powers nor
                                  prescribe any duty for exercise of the legislative power in any particular
                                  manner. It has been a cardinal principle of construction that the language
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis   of the entries should be given the widest scope of which their meaning is


                  83/134

                                                                                           WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                  fairly capable and while interpreting an entry of any List it would not be
                                  reasonable to import any limitation therein. The rule of widest
                                  construction, however, would not enable the legislature to make a law
                                  relating to a matter which has no rational connection with the subject
                                  matter of an entry. When the vires of enactment is challenged, the court
                                  primarily presumes the constitutionality of the statute by putting the most
                                  liberal construction upon the relevant legislative entry so that it may have
                                  the widest amplitude and the substance of the legislation will have to be
                                  looked into. The Court sometimes is duty bound to guard against
                                  extending the meaning of the words beyond their reasonable connotation
                                  in anxiety to preserve the power of the legislature.

                                  7. It is further a well-settled principle that entries in the different lists
                                  should be read together without giving a narrow meaning to any of them.

                                  Power of the Parliament as well as the State legislature are expressed in
                                  precise and definite terms. While an entry is to be given its widest meaning
                                  but it cannot be so interpreted as to over-ride another entry or make
                                  another entry meaningless and in case of an apparent conflict between
                                  different entries, it is the duty of the court to reconcile them. When it
                                  appears to the Court that there is apparent overlapping between the two
                                  entries the doctrine of "pith and substance" has to be applied to find out
                                  the true nature of a legislation and the entry with which it would fall. In
                                  case of conflict between entries in List I and List II, the same has to be
                                  decided by application of the principle of "pith and substance". The
                                  doctrine of "pith and substance" means that if an enactment substantially
                                  falls within the powers expressly conferred by the Constitution upon the
                                  legislature which enacted it, it cannot be held to be invalid, merely because
                                  it incidentally encroaches on matters assigned to another legislature.
                                  When a law is impugned as being ultra-vires of the legislative competence,
                                  what is required to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation.
                                  If on such an examination it is found that the legislation is in substance
                                  one on a matter assigned to the legislature then it must be held to be valid
                                  in its entirety even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are
                                  beyond its competence. In order to examine the true character of the
                                  enactment, the entire Act, its object and scope and effect, is required to be
                                  gone into. The question of invasion into the territory of another legislation
                                  is to be determined not by degree but by substance. The doctrine of "pith
                                  and substance' has to be applied not only in cases of conflict between the
                                  powers of two legislatures but in any case where the question arises
                                  whether a legislation is covered by particular legislative power in exercise
                                  of which it is purported to be made.



                                  8. Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles of rule of construction if the
                                  provisions of the impugned statute, namely, the 
National Council of
                                  Teacher Education Act, 1993
 are examined and more particularly 
Section
                                  17(4)
 thereof which we have already extracted, the conclusion is
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis   irresistible that the statute is one squarely dealing with coordination and


                  84/134

                                                                                          WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                  determination of standards in institutions for higher education within the
                                  meaning of Entry 66 of List I of the Seventh Schedule. Both Entries 65 and
                                  66 of List I empower the Central Legislature to secure the standards of
                                  research and the standards of higher education. The object behind being
                                  that the same standards are not lowered at the hands of the particular
                                  State or States to the detriment of the national progress and the power of
                                  the State legislature must be so exercised as not to directly encroach upon
                                  power of Union under Entry 66. The power to coordinate does not mean
                                  merely the power to evaluate but it means to harmonics or secure
                                  relationship for concerted action. A legislation made for the purpose of
                                  coordination of standards of higher education is essentially a legislation
                                  by the Central legislature in exercise of its competence under Entry 66 of
                                  List I of the Seventh Schedule and Sub-section (4) of 
Section 17
 merely
                                  provides the consequences if an institution offers a course or training in
                                  teacher education in contravention of the Act though the ultimate
                                  consequences under Sub-section (4) of 
Section 17
 may be that unqualified
                                  teacher will not be entitled to get an employment under the State or
                                  Central Government or in a university or in a college. But by no stretch of
                                  imagination the said provision can be construed to mean a law dealing
                                  with employment as has been held by the High Court in the impugned
                                  judgment.



                                  9. In our considered opinion, the High Court committed gross error in
                                  construing the provisions of Sub-section (4) of 
Section 17
 of the Act to
                                  mean that it is a legislation dealing with recruitment and conditions of
                                  services of persons in the State service within the meaning of Proviso to
                                  
Article 309
 of the Constitution. The High Court committed the aforesaid
                                  error by examining the provisions of Sub-section (4) on its plain terms
                                  without trying to examine the true character of the enactment which has to
                                  be done by examining the enactment as a whole, its object and scope and
                                  effect of the provisions. Even, the High Court does not appear to have
                                  applied the doctrine of "pith and substance" and, thus, committed the
                                  error in interpreting the provisions of Sub-section (4) of 
Section 17
 to
                                  mean to be a provision dealing with conditions of service of an employee
                                  under the State Government.



                                  10. In the aforesaid premises, the conclusion of the High Court that
                                  
Section 17(4)
 is ultra-vires being beyond the competence of the Union
                                  legislature cannot be sustained and the said conclusion is accordingly set
                                  aside. On examining the statute as a whole and on scrutiny of the object
                                  and scope of the statute, we have no manner of doubt that even Sub-
                                  section (4) of 
Section 17
 is very much a law dealing with the coordination
                                  and determination of standards in institution for higher education coming
                                  within Entry 66 of the List III of the Seventh Schedule and, thus, the Union
                                  legislature did have the competence for enacting the said provision.

                                  11. We are also of the further opinion that the de-recognition of the B.Ed
                                  (Vacation Course) cannot be nullified on the ground of failure to comply
                                  with the principle of natural justice. In the judgment under challenge, the
                                  High Court has held also that when the institution is imparting the B.Ed.
                                  (Vacation Course) then National Council for Teacher Education could not
                                  have refused to recognise the said course. We are unable to accept this
                                  reasoning inasmuch as the NCTE is an expert body created under the
                                  provisions of the National Council for 
Teacher Education Act, 1993
 and
                                  the Parliament has imposed upon such expert body the duty to maintain
                                  the standards of education, particularly, in relation to the teachers
                                  education. Education is the backbone of every democracy and any
                                  deterioration in the Standard of teaching in the B.Ed course would
                                  ultimately produce sub-standard prospective teachers who would be
                                  teaching in schools and colleges throughout the country and on whose
                                  efficiency the future of the country depends. Inasmuch as the teacher
                                  himself has received a sub-standard education it is difficult to expect from
                                  him a higher standard of teaching to the students of the schools or other
                                  institutions. It is from this perspective, the conclusion of an expert body
                                  should not be lightly tinkered with by court of law without giving due
                                  weightage to the conclusion arrived at by such expert body. From this
                                  standpoint, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court
                                  committed error in holding that there was no reasonable justification for
                                  not recognising the B.Ed (Vacation course) which was being imparted by
                                  the institution of Shah Goverdhan Lal Kabra Teachers College. In the
                                  aforesaid premises, we set aside the impugned Judgment of High Court
                                  and allow this appeal.”

State of Maharashtra v. Sant Dyaneshwar Shikshan

                  Shastra            Mahavidyalaya           and       Ors.

                  MANU/SC/1756/2006], it has been stated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as

                  follows:



 
“20. The learned Counsel for various colleges supported Mr. Raju
                                  Ramachandran on interpretation and application of the provisions of the
                                  Act and final decision of the High Court. They, however, had taken other
                                  contentions as well. According to them, the State has no locus standi to
                                  challenge the decision of NCTE. The State cannot be said to be "person
                                  aggrieved" or "aggrieved party" so as to challenge the decision of NCTE.
                                  If the decision is against the college, it is only the college which has
                                  'standing' to impugn 
the said decision
. The High Court, therefore, in the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
                                  submission of the learned Counsel for colleges, ought to have dismissed


                  86/134

                                                                                           WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                  the petition filed by the State as not maintainable without entering into the
                                  merits of the matter. It was also submitted that under the scheme of the
                                  Constitution, particularly 
Articles 245
, 246
, 248
 and 
254
 read with
                                  Schedule VII thereof, only Parliament has power of co-ordination and
                                  determination of standards in institutions for higher education or
                                  research, scientific and technical institutions. State Legislatures have no
                                  authority to enact any law in the field covered by Entry 66 of List I of
                                  Schedule VII. Obviously, therefore, State Government has no authority to
                                  take a policy decision in respect of the subjects covered by Entry 66 of List
                                  I of Schedule VII for which a specific enactment has been made by
                                  Parliament and under the said Act authority has been granted to NCTE to
                                  take an action. As to Regulations and Guidelines, it was submitted that
                                  under the Act power has been conferred on NCTE. It is, therefore, only
                                  NCTE, which can consider the question and take appropriate decision
                                  under the Act and it is not open to NCTE to make Regulations or frame
                                  Guidelines empowering the State Government to undertake such exercise.
                                  According to the counsel, therefore, even if Regulations are framed or
                                  Guidelines made, they are not in consonance with the Act and there is
                                  abdication of power by NCTE in favour of State Government which is hit
                                  by the doctrine of impermissible and excessive delegation. Regulations
                                  permitting such excessive / impermissible delegation must be declared
                                  inconsistent with the parent Act as also ultra vires and unconstitutional.
                                  The counsel also submitted that so-called policy decision of the State
                                  Government is arbitrary and unreasonable and would be hit by Clause (g)
                                  of 
Article 19(1)
 of the Constitution which allows all citizens to have the
                                  right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or
                                  business, otherwise legal and lawful. 
Article 19(6)
 cannot be invoked by
                                  the State as total prohibition to open B.Ed. college can never be said to be
                                  in the interest of general public and would not fall within "reasonable
                                  restriction" permissible under the said provision. It is also violative of
                                  
Article 21A
 as inserted by the 
Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act,
                                  2002
. Over and above constitutional inhibitions, the order dated 28th
                                  December, 2004 is arbitrary and unreasonable inasmuch as
                                  considerations which weighed with the State Government relating to
                                  employment of B.Ed. teachers were totally irrelevant and extraneous.
                                  Taking education and getting employment are two different things. The
                                  colleges are not claiming any grant or financial aid from the State, nor do
                                  they give any assurance or guarantee to students admitted to B.Ed.
                                  colleges that the State will give them employment. It is, therefore, not
                                  open to the State Government to refuse to grant NOC because the State is
                                  not able to give employment to teachers after they get B.Ed. degree. There
                                  are several Arts, Commerce and Science colleges in the State in which
                                  students take education and get degrees of B.A., B.Com. or B.Sc. It is not
                                  even the case of the State that all those students got employment at one or
                                  the other place. Thus, the so-called policy decision of the State

                                  was also submitted by the respondents that they had made huge
                                  investments and if at this stage they will be refused permission,
                                  irreparable injury and loss would be caused to them. Finally, it was
                                  submitted that since the decision of NCTE is legal, lawful and in
                                  consonance with the provisions of the Act as also consistent with the law
                                  
laid down by
 this Court in several judgments, the order passed by the
                                  High Court deserves to be upheld by allowing the institutions to open
                                  B.Ed. colleges from the year 2005-06 as has been done by NCTE. If this
                                  Court considers it appropriate, specific direction may be issued to the
                                  respondents to conduct extra classes/lectures and to hold
                                  supplementary/additional examination. Once the action of NCTE is found
                                  to be lawful and the decision of the State Government bad, no prejudice
                                  should be caused to the institutions.




                                  21. Before we deal with the contentions of the parties, it would be
                                  appropriate if we refer to the relevant provisions of law. Part XI of the
                                  Constitution deals with relations between Union and States. Chapter I
                                  thereof relates to legislative relations and distribution of legislative
                                  powers. 
Article 245
 enables Parliament to make laws for the whole or any
                                  part of territory of India. Similarly, a Legislature of a State has power to
                                  make laws for the whole or any part of the State. 
Article 246
 provides for
                                  distribution of legislative power between Parliament and Legislatures of
                                  States and reads thus:

                                       246. Subject-matter of laws by Parliament and by the Legislatures
                                       of States-(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3),
                                       Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any
                                       of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this
                                       Constitution referred to as the "Union List").

                                       (2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament and,
                                       subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power
                                       to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List
                                       III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the
                                       "Concurrent List").

                                       (3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has
                                       exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof
                                       with respect to any of the mattes enumerated in List II in the
                                       Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the 'State
                                       List').

                                       (4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter
                                       for any part of the territory of India not included [in a State]
                                       notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the
                                       State List.

                                       Whereas 
Article 248
 provides for residuary power of Legislature,
                                       
Article 254
 covers cases of inconsistency between laws made by
                                       Parliament and by Legislatures of States.

                                  22. Schedule VII to the Constitution comprises of three Lists: (i) Union
                                  List, (ii) State List and (iii) Concurrent List. While exclusive power to
                                  enact laws lies with Parliament under List I, the power to enact laws
                                  under List II is with the State Legislatures. In respect of subjects falling
                                  under List III, it is open to Parliament as well as State Legislatures to
                                  enact laws subject to the provisions of 
Articles 254.


                                  22.1 Entries 63 to 66 of List I of Schedule VII relate to higher education.
                                  Entry 66 which is relevant reads thus:



                                    66. Co-ordination with determination of standards in institutions for
                                    higher education or research and scientific and technical intuitions

                                  22.2 Entry 11 of List II inter alia included university education. It was
                                  omitted by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976 and became part
                                  of Entry 25 of List III (Concurrent List). Entry 25, as originally stood
                                  read as under:

                                  25. The vocational and technical training of labour.
                                  After the amendment of 1976, the Entry as it stands now reads thus:

                                  25. Education, including technical education medical education and
                                  universities, subject to the provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List
                                  I; vocational and technical training of labour.



                                  23. The National Council for Teacher Training Act, 1993 has been
                                  enacted by Parliament and deals with teacher's education. It came into
                                  force with effect from July 1, 1995. The Preamble of the Act is relevant
                                  and reads thus:

 
An Act

                                      Teacher Education with a view to achieving planned and co-
                                      ordinated development of the teacher education system throughout
                                      the country, the regulation and proper maintenance of norms and
                                      standards in the teacher education system and for matters
                                      connected therewith.



                                  24. 
Section 2

                                  defined. "Council" is defined as the National Council for Teacher's

In 
Maa Vaishno Devi Mahila Mahavidyalaya v. State of U.P. and

                  Ors.
 [(13.12.2012 - SC) : MANU/SC/1102/2012], it has been held by the

                  Hon'ble Supreme Court that

                                  “43.Now, we may examine some of the judgments of this Court which
                                  have dealt with these aspects. In the case of State of Tamil Nadu and Anr.


                                  v. Adhiyaman Educational and Research Institute and Ors.
                                  MANU/SC/0709/1995 : (1995) 4 SCC 104, the Supreme Court while
                                  discussing various aspects in regard to constitutional validity of 
Tamil
                                  Nadu Private College Regulation Act, 1976
 and the provisions of the All
                                  India Council for Technical Education Act clearly spelled out the
                                  preferential role of the Council as under:



 
22. The aforesaid provisions of the Act including its preamble
                                      make it abundantly clear that the Council has been established
                                      under the Act for coordinated and integrated development of the
                                      technical education system at all levels throughout the country and
                                      is enjoined to promote qualitative improvement of such education
                                      in relation to planned quantitative growth. The Council is also
                                      required to regulate and ensure proper maintenance of norms and
                                      standards in the technical education system. The Council is
                                      further to evolve suitable performance appraisal system
                                      incorporating such norms and mechanisms in enforcing their
                                      accountability. It is also required to provide guidelines for
                                      admission of students and has power to withhold or discontinue
                                      grants and to de-recognise the institutions where norms and
                                      standards 
laid down by
 it and directions given by it from time to
                                      time are not followed. This duty and responsibility cast on the
                                      Council implies that the norms and standards to be set should be
                                      such as would prevent a lopsided or an isolated development of
                                      technical education in the country.


 
...It is necessary to bear this aspect of the norms and standards to
                                      be prescribed in mind, for a major debate before us centered
                                      around the right of the States to prescribe standards higher than
                                      the one 
laid down by
 the Council. What is further necessary to
                                      remember is that the Council has on it representatives not only of
                                      the States but also of the State Universities. They have, therefore,
                                      a say in the matter of laying down the norms and standards which
                                      may be prescribed by the Council for such education from time to
                                      time. The Council has further the Regional Committees, at
                                      present, at least, in four major geographical zones and the
                                      constitution and functions of the Committees are to be prescribed
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis       by the Regulations to be made by the Council. Since the Council

                                                                                           WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                      has the representation of the States and the provisional bodies on
                                      it which have also representation from different States and
                                      regions, they have a say in the constitution and functions of these
                                      Committees as well....




                                  44. Further, the Court, while noticing the inconsistency between the
                                  Central and State statutes or the State authorities acting contrary to the
                                  Central statute, held as under:



 
41. (vi) However, when the situations/seats are available and the
                                      State authorities deny an applicant the same on the ground that
                                      the applicant is not qualified according to its standards or
                                      qualifications, as the case may be, although the applicant satisfies
                                      the standards or qualifications 
laid down by
 the Central law, they
                                      act unconstitutionally.
 So also when the State authorities de-

 
recognise or disaffiliate an institution for not satisfying the
                                      standards or requirement 
laid down by
 them, although it satisfied
                                      the norms and requirements 
laid down by
 the Central authority,
                                      the State authorities act illegally.


                                      XXX


                                      43. As a result, as has been pointed out earlier, the provisions of
                                      the Central statute on the one hand and of the State statutes on the
                                      other, being inconsistent and, therefore, repugnant with each
                                      other, the Central statute will prevail and the de-recognition by the
                                      State Government or the disaffiliation by the State University on
                                      grounds which are inconsistent with those enumerated in the
                                      Central statute will be inoperative.

 :


                                  (2000) 5 SCC 231, the Court reiterating the above principle, held as
                                  under:



 
22. As held in the 
Tamil Nadu
 case AIR 1995 SCW 2179, the
                                     Central Act of 1987 and; in particular, 
Section 10(K)
 occupied the
                                     field relating the `grant of approvals' for establishing technical
                                     institutions and the provisions of the Central Act alone were to be
                                     complied with. So far as the provisions of the 
Mahatma Gandhi
                                     University Act
 or its statutes were concerned and in particular
                                     statute 9(7), they merely required the University to obtain the
                                     `views' of the State Government. That could not be characterised
                                     as requiring the "approval" of the State Government. If, needed,
                                     the University statute could be so interpreted, such a provision
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis      requiring approval of the State Government would be repugnant to

                                                                                          WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                     the provisions of 
Section 10(K)
 of the AICTE Act, 1987 and would
                                     again be void.
 
As pointed out in the 
Tamil Nadu
 case there were
                                     enough provisions in the Central Act for consultation by the
                                     Council of the AICTE with various agencies, including the State
                                     Governments and the Universities concerned. The State Level
                                     Committee and the Central Regional Committees contained
                                     various experts and State representatives. In case of difference of
                                     opinion as between the various consultees, the AICTE would have
                                     to go by the views of the Central Task Force. These were sufficient
                                     safeguards for ascertaining the views of the State Governments
                                     and the Universities.
 
No doubt the question of affiliation was a
                                     different matter and was not covered by the Central Act but in the
                                     
Tamil Nadu
 case, it was held that the University could not impose
                                     any conditions inconsistent with the 
AICTE Act
 or its Regulation
                                     or the conditions imposed by the AICTE. Therefore, the procedure
                                     for obtaining the affiliation and any conditions which could be
                                     imposed by the University, could not be inconsistent with the
                                     provisions of the Central Act. The University could not, therefore,
                                     in any event have sought for `approval' of the State Government.




 
46. This view of the Supreme Court was reiterated with approval by a
                                  larger Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of 
State of Maharashtra v.
                                  Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya and Ors.
                                  MANU/SC/1756/2006
 : (2006) 9 SCC 1. While discussing in detail the
                                  various legal issues in relation to grant of affiliation/ recognition to the
                                  institution and permission to start a new college, the Court held as under:


                                      53. The Court then considered the argument put forward on behalf
                                      of the State that while it would be open for the Council to lay down
                                      minimum standards and requirements, it did not preclude the State
                                      from prescribing higher standards and requirements.



 
54. Negativing the contention, the Court quoted with approval the
                                      following observations of B.N. Rau, J. in 
G.P. Stewart v. Brojendra
                                      Kishore Roy Chaudhury (MANU/WB/0202/1939
 : AIR 1939 Cal.
                                      628 : 43 CWN 913):




                                      It is sometimes said that two laws cannot be said to be properly
                                      repugnant unless there is direct conflict between them, as when one
                                      says `do' and the other 'don't', there is no true repugnancy,
                                      according to this view, if it is possible to obey both the laws. For
                                      reasons which we shall set forth presently, we think that this is too
                                      narrow a test; there may well be cases of repugnancy where both
                                      laws say `don't' but in different ways. For example, one law may
                                      say `no person shall sell liquor by retail, that is, in quantities of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis       less than five gallons at a time' and another law may say, 'no

                                                                                             WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                      person shall sell liquor by retail, that is, in quantities of less than
                                      ten gallons at a time'. Here, it is obviously possible to obey both
                                      laws, by obeying the more stringent of the two, namely, the second
                                      one; yet it is equally obvious that the two laws are repugnant, for
                                      to the extent to which a citizen is compelled to obey one of them,
                                      the other, though not actually disobeyed, is nullified.

                                      64. Even otherwise, in our opinion, the High Court was fully
                                      justified in negativing the argument of the State Government that
                                      permission could be refused by the State Government on "policy
                                      consideration". As already observed earlier, policy consideration
                                      was negatived by this Court in Thirumuruga Kirupananda Variyar
                                      Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Educational and
                                      Charitable Trust v. State of Tamil Nadu MANU/SC/0601/1996 :

                                      1996 DGLS (soft) 327 : 1996 (3) SCC 15 : JT 1996 (2) SC. 692 as
                                      also in Jaya Gokul Educational Trust.

                                      XXX

                                      74. It is thus clear that the Central Government has considered the
                                      subject of secondary education and higher education at the
                                      national level. 
The Act
 of 1993 also requires Parliament to
                                      consider teacher-education system "throughout the country".

                                      NCTE, therefore, in our opinion, is expected to deal with
                                      applications for establishing new Bed colleges or allowing increase
                                      in intake capacity, keeping in view the 1993 Act and planned and
                                      coordinated development of teacher-education system in the
                                      country. It is neither open to the State Government nor to a
                                      university to consider the local conditions or apply "State policy"

                                      to refuse such permission. In fact, as held by this Court in cases
                                      referred to hereinabove, the State Government has no power to
                                      reject the prayer of an institution or to overrule the decision of
                                      NCTE. The action of the State Government, therefore, was
                                      contrary to law and has rightly been set aside by the High Court.



                                  47. The above enunciated principles clearly show that the Council is the
                                  authority constituted under the Central Act with the responsibility of
                                  maintaining education of standards and judging upon the infra-structure
                                  and facilities available for imparting such professional education. Its
                                  opinion is of utmost importance and shall take precedence over the views
                                  of the State as well as that of the University. The concerned Department
                                  of the State and the affiliating University have a role to play but it is
                                  limited in its application. They cannot lay down any guideline or policy
                                  which would be in conflict with the Central statute or the standards laid
                                  down by the Central body. State can frame its policy for admission to
                                  such professional courses but such policy again has to be in conformity
                                  with the directives issued by the Central body. In the present cases, there
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis   is not much conflict on this issue, but it needs to be clarified that while the


                  93/134

                                                                                          WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                  State grants its approval, and University its affiliation, for increased
                                  intake of seats or commencement of a new course/college, its directions
                                  should not offend and be repugnant to what has been laid down in the
                                  conditions for approval granted by the Central authority or Council.
                                  What is most important is that all these authorities have to work ad idem
                                  as they all have a common object to achieve i.e. of imparting of education
                                  properly and ensuring maintenance of proper standards of education,
                                  examination and infrastructure for betterment of educational system.
                                  Only if all these authorities work in a coordinated manner and with
                                  cooperation, will they be able to achieve the very object for which all
                                  these entities exist.



                                  48. 
The NCTE Act
 has been enacted by the Parliament with reference to
                                  Entry 66 of List I of Schedule VII of the Constitution. There is no such
                                  specific power vested in the State Legislature under List II of the Seventh
                                  Schedule. Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh Schedule is the other Entry
                                  that provides the field for legislation both to the State and the Centre, in
                                  relation to education, including technical education, medical education
                                  and Universities; vocational and technical training and labour. The field
                                  is primarily covered by the Union List and thus, the State can exercise
                                  any legislative power under Entry 25, List III but such law cannot be
                                  repugnant to the Central law. Wherever the State law is irreconcilable
                                  with the Central law, the State Law must give way in favour of the Central
                                  law to the extent of repugnancy. This will show the supremacy of the
                                  Central law in relation to professional education, including the teacher
                                  training programmes. In the case of Medical Council of India v. State of
                                  Karnataka MANU/SC/0424/1998 : (1998) 6 SCC 131, the Court had the
                                  occasion to discuss this conflict as follows:

                                       27. The State Acts, namely, the Karnataka Universities Act and
                                       the Karnataka Capitation Fee Act must give way to the Central
                                       Act, namely, the 
Indian Medical Council Act, 1956
. The
                                       Karnataka Capitation Fee Act was enacted for the sole purpose of
                                       Regulation in collection of capitation fee by colleges and for that,
                                       the State Government is empowered to fix the maximum number
                                       of students that can be admitted but that number cannot be over
                                       and above that fixed by the Medical Council as per the
                                       Regulations. 
Chapter IX of the Karnataka Universities Act
, which
                                       contains provision for affiliation of colleges and recognition of
                                       institutions, applies to all types of colleges and not necessarily to
                                       professional colleges like medical colleges. Sub-section (10) of
                                       Section 53, falling in Chapter IX of this Act, provides for
                                       maximum number of students to be admitted to courses for
                                       studies in a college and that number shall not exceed the intake
                                       fixed by the university or the Government. But this provision has
                                       again to be read subject to the intake fixed by the Medical Council
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis        under its Regulations. It is the Medical Council which is


                  94/134

                                                                                      WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                                  primarily responsible for fixing standards of medical education
                                  and overseeing that these standards are maintained. It is the
                                  Medical Council which is the principal body to lay down
                                  conditions for recognition of medical colleges which would
                                  include the fixing of intake for admission to a medical college. We
                                  have already seen in the beginning of this judgment various
                                  provisions of the 
Medical Council Act
. It is, therefore, the Medical
                                  Council which in effect grants recognition and also withdraws the
                                  same. Regulations under 
Section 33
 of the Medical Council Act,
                                  which were made in 1977, prescribe the accommodation in the
                                  college and its associated teaching hospitals and teaching and
                                  technical staff and equipment in various departments in the
                                  college and in the hospitals. These Regulations are in
                                  considerable detail. Teacher-student ratio prescribed is 1 to 10,
                                  exclusive of the Professor or Head of the Department.

                                  Regulations further prescribe, apart from other things, that the
                                  number of teaching beds in the attached hospitals will have to be
                                  in the ratio of 7 beds per student admitted. Regulations of the
                                  Medical Council, which were approved by the Central
                                  Government in 1971, provide for the qualification requirements
                                  for appointments of persons to the posts of teachers and visiting
                                  physicians/surgeons of medical colleges and attached hospitals.

                                  29. A medical student requires gruelling study and that can be
                                  done only if proper facilities are available in a medical college
                                  and the hospital attached to it has to be well equipped and the
                                  teaching faculty and doctors have to be competent enough that
                                  when a medical student comes out, he is perfect in the science of
                                  treatment of human beings and is not found wanting in any way.
                                  The country does not want half-baked medical professionals
                                  coming out of medical colleges when they did not have full
                                  facilities of teaching and were not exposed to the patients and
                                  their ailments during the course of their study. The Medical
                                  Council, in all fairness, does not wish to invalidate the
                                  admissions made in excess of that fixed by it and does not wish to
                                  take any action of withdrawing recognition of the medical
                                  colleges violating the Regulation. Henceforth, however, these
                                  medical colleges must restrict the number of admissions fixed by
                                  the Medical Council. After the insertion of Sections 10A, 10B and
                                  10C in the 
Medical Council Act
, the Medical Council has framed
                                  Regulations with the previous approval of the Central
                                  Government which were published in the Gazette of India dated
                                  29-9-1993 (though the notification is dated 20-9-1993). Any
                                  medical college or institution which wishes to increase the
                                  admission capacity in MBBS/higher courses (including

                                       Council. Only the medical college or institution which is
                                       recognised by the Medical Council can so apply.

 
49. A Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of 
Dr. Preeti Srivastava
                                  and Anr. v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. MANU/SC/1021/1999
 :


                                  (1999) 7 SCC 120, while dealing with the provisions of the Medial
                                  Council of India Act and referring to Entry 25 of List III and Entry 66 of
                                  List I with reference to the 
Articles 245
, 246
, 254
 and 
15(4)
 of the
                                  Constitution, spelled out the supremacy of the Council and the provisions
                                  of the Central Act, particularly in relation to the control and Regulation
                                  of higher education. It also discussed providing of the eligibility
                                  conditions and qualifications and determining the standards to be
                                  maintained by the Institutions. The Court in paragraph 36 of the
                                  judgment held as under:

                                      36. It would not be correct to say that the norms for admission
                                      have no connection with the standard of education, or that the
                                      rules for admission are covered only by Entry 25 of List III.

                                      Norms of admission can have a direct impact on the standards of
                                      education. of course, there can be rules for admission which are
                                      consistent with or do not affect adversely the standards of
                                      education prescribed by the Union in exercise of powers under
                                      Entry 66 of List I. For example, a State may, for admission to the
                                      postgraduate medical courses, lay down qualifications in addition
                                      to those prescribed under Entry 66 of List I. This would be
                                      consistent with promoting higher standards for admission to the
                                      higher educational courses. But any lowering of the norms laid
                                      down can and does have an adverse effect on the standards of
                                      education in the institutes of higher education. Standards of
                                      education in an institution or college depend on various factors.
                                      Some of these are:



                                     (1) the calibre of the teaching staff;

                                     (2) a proper syllabus designed to achieve a high level of
                                     education in the given span of time;

                                     (3) the student-teacher ratio;

                                     (4) the ratio between the students and the hospital beds available
                                     to each student;

                                     (5) the calibre of the students admitted to the institution;
                                     (6) equipment and laboratory facilities, or hospital facilities for
                                     training in the case of medical colleges;

                                     (7) adequate accommodation for the college and the attached
                                     hospital; and
                                     (8) the standard of examinations held including the manner in

                                    performance is judged.”


                  38.             As such, the principle that the field of teacher education is the

                  exclusive preserve of Parliamentary legislation, has been stressed upon in all

                  cases where the NCTE act has been considered, and it has been held that all

                  issues pertaining to teacher education will fall within Entry 66 of List I and

                  hence, within the legislative competence of Parliament. In the present case, the

                  issue relates to school education where the NCTE has been designated as the

                  authority to prescribe the essential eligibility criteria for appointment to the

                  post of graduate teachers. In this context, the judgement of the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court cited supra is relevant to point out that the essential eligibility

                  criteria prescribed by the designated authority under the 
RTE Act
 cannot be

                  treated as one that deals with the recruitment and conditions of service of

                  persons in a State under 
Article 309
 of the Constitution, but is one which is

                  made in exercise of the powers conferred upon the NCTE by a parliamentary

                  legislation in the subject of teacher education which falls within Entry 66 of

                  List I. The above judgement thus squarely covers the issue and once, it is

                  established that the subject matter is one that falls within the legislative head of

                  ‘education’ as well as ‘higher education’, and when Parliament has made a law

                  governing the said field, it is not open to the State government in exercise of its

                  powers under 
Article 309
 to issue Rules that alter, modify, or dilute the

                  standards or in any manner tamper with the same except in accordance with

                  the provisions relating to the constitutional provisions governing the

                  overcoming of repugnancy between Parliamentary and State legislation, which

                  again is open only in cases where the legislative head falls under the

                  Concurrent List. In the present case, as the subject – ‘Teacher Education’ falls

                  within the domain of parliamentary legislation, seeking to set uniformly high

                  standards for all teachers throughout the country, under the 
RTE Act, 2009
, the

                  further question of the State coming up with a repugnant law will not arise.



 
39.             Further, we find force in the submissions of the counsel for the writ

                  petitioner that the impugned Rules are a piece of colourable legislation to the

                  extent that they seek to tweak the mandate of the NCTE Regulations that

                  applies the minimum eligibility criteria to all appointments to BT Assistants,

                  irrespective of the mode of appointment. The doctrine of Colourable Legislation

                  came to be examined by a Constitution Bench of this Court in 
K.C. Gajapati

                  Narayan Deo and Ors. v. State of Orissa
 [(1954) 1 SCR 1], in which, it was

                  held that the doctrine of colourable legislation does not involve any question of

                  'bona fides' or 'mala fides' on the part of the Legislature. The whole doctrine

                  revolves around the question of competence of a particular Legislature to enact

                  a particular law. If the Legislature is competent to pass a particular law, the

                  motives, which impelled it to act, are really irrelevant. On the other hand, if the

                  98/134

                                                                              WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  Legislature lacks competency, the question of motive does not arise at all.




                  Whether a statute is constitutional or not, is thus always a question of power

                  (Vide Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol. 1, p. 379). The crucial question

                  to be asked is whether there has been a transgression of legislative authority as

                  conferred by the Constitution which is the source of all powers as also the

                  separation of powers. A legislative transgression may be patent, manifest or

                  direct or may also be disguised, covert and indirect. It is to this latter class of

                  cases that the expression 'colourable legislation' has been applied in certain

                  judicial pronouncements. The expression 'colourable legislation' means that

                  although apparently a Legislature in passing a statute which purports to act

                  within the limits of its powers, yet, in substance and in reality, it transgresses

                  those powers, the transgression being veiled by what appears, on proper

                  examination, to be a mere pretence or disguise. The discerning test is to find

                  out the substance of the act and not merely the form or outward appearance. If

                  the subject matter in substance is something which is beyond the legislative

                  power, the form in which the law is clothed, would not save it from

                  condemnation. The constitutional prohibitions cannot be allowed to be violated

                  by employing indirect methods. To test the true nature and character of the

                  challenged legislation, the investigation by the Court should be directed

                  towards examining (i) the effect of the legislation; and             (ii) its object,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis



                  99/134

                                                                              WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  purpose or design. While doing so, the Court cannot enter into investigating the

                  motives, which induced the Legislature to exercise its power.




 
40.             The abovesaid view was reiterated by Larger Bench (Seven Judges)

                  in 
R.S. Joshi, S.T.O. v. Ajit Mills Ltd.
 [(1978) 1 SCR 338], and by

                  Constitution Bench in 
Naga People's Movement of Human Rights v. Union

                  of India
 [AIR 1998 SC 465] and has been the law applied in a catena of

                  decisions thereafter.




                  41.             In order to further support her case, the learned counsel for the

                  petitioners also relied upon the NCTE Regulations of the year 2001 which

                  make it rather clear that even for movement from one level to a higher level

                  post, the minimum qualifications as given or prescribed in the concerned

                  promotional level post would also require to be fulfilled. If there was any doubt

                  on this score, the said Regulations bring out the intention of the NCTE in this

                  regard and the said principle applied in consonance with the NCTE

                  Regulations, 2010, prescribing qualifications and eligibility criteria for

                  Graduate Assistants, without making any distinction in the qualifications so

                  prescribed on the basis of mode/channel of appointment, will lead to the

                  inevitable conclusion that as on date, any person aspiring to be appointed as a

                  Graduate Assistant/BT Assistant, by whatever mode of appointment, be it by

                  direct recruitment, promotion or transfer, would have to necessarily fulfil the

                  eligibility criteria as prescribed by the NCTE Regulations, 2010, under which a

                  pass in TET is clearly mandatory. It is also seen from the additional documents

                  filed in the writ petition impugning the Special Rules that in several other

                  States where the NCTE notifications have been adopted, the essential eligibility

                  criteria of passing TET has been stressed upon in all appointments irrespective

                  of the channel of appointment that is by direct recruitment or by promotion.

                  Further, in an identical case before the Division Bench of the Allahabad High

                  Court in Subedar Yadav and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors. [Special Appeal

                  no. 737 of 2018 dated 04.09.2018], it has been pleased to hold that the

                  requirement of passing TET is mandatory for selection, promotion or for any

                  other mode of appointment and it is not only confined to selection from open

                  42.             The reliance of the appellants on the order passed by the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court in C. A. Nos. 6186-6187 of 2008 dated 05.09.2013 that the

                  teachers who were appointed prior to G.O. Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011 will

                  remain protected, is misplaced in the context of the present issue. As rightly

                  held by the Learned Judge in the order under appeal, the said appeals before

                  the Hon'ble Supreme Court arose out of different facts and circumstances,

                  where essentially the question was with respect to the initial methods of

                  recruitment and the zone of consideration for appointment, that is, whether

                  there should be a state-wide selection or district-wise selection and it is in those

                  circumstances that after the coming into force of the 
RTE Act
, the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court while disposing of the said appeals, had held that those who

                  had already been appointed prior to the coming into force of          G.O. Ms. No.

                  181 dated 15.11.2011 shall remain protected. This observation/ direction of the

                  Hon’ble Supreme Court cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be deemed to be

                  understood as meaning that all those appointed prior to the date of the said

                  G.O. Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011 would not have to pass the Teacher

                  Eligibility Test even if they aspire for a promotion to the higher post of

                  Graduate Teacher, when at present the qualifications prescribed by the NCTE

                  require a pass in TET, apart from the other essential educational qualifications.

                  As such, the contention that the observation in the civil appeals would exempt

                  the writ appellants from passing the teacher eligibility test while seeking for

                  promotion to the postgraduate teacher, is hereby negatived.


                  43.             At the risk of repetition, it must be stated that while the NCTE

                  notifications had clearly protected those who had already been appointed prior

                  to the date of the notification from passing TET, there is nothing in the said

                  notification which affords an exemption from passing TET when they aspire for

                  fresh appointments by way of direct recruitment, promotion or otherwise to the

                  post of Graduate Teacher. The principle of interpretation that when the

                  language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is not for the courts to

                  substitute their opinion or inject their philosophy into the provisions, is trite

                  law and the same is to be applied. The principle of literal interpretation would

                  lead to the inevitable conclusion that only those who have been appointed prior

                  to the date of issuance of the NCTE notifications are protected and exempted

                  from passing TET for continuance in the respective posts against which they

                  have been appointed. Hence, we conclude that those appointed prior to

                  29.07.2011 and in order to extend the benefit to the date of passing of G.O.

                  Ms. No. 181 dated 15.11.2011, those appointed prior to that date,

                  Teacher/BT Assistant are exempted from passing TET for continuance in the

                  said posts. However, for promotion to the post of Graduate Teacher from the

                  post of Secondary Grade teacher or appointment to the post of Secondary

                  Grade teacher or Graduate teacher/BT Assistant by any channel or mode of

                  appointment by either direct recruitment or promotion or by transfer, a pass in

                  45.             The next question relates to whether those already in service prior to

                  the commencement of the Act are obliged to acquire a pass in TET for

                  continuance in service as Secondary Grade Teachers without seeking any

                  further promotion. Here, a reading of 
Section 23
 of the RTE Act would reveal

                  the following:



                            (a) The sub-clause (1) to 
Section 23
 of the Act provides that any person
                            would be eligible “for appointment” as a teacher provided he possesses

                                                                                 WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                            minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority authorized
                            by the central government namely NCTE. As a matter of fact, pursuant
                            to 
Section 23
 of the Act, a notification was issued by NCTE dated
                            23.08.2010 that teachers shall be eligible for appointment from among
                            those who have passed Teachers Eligibility Test (TET).

                            (b) The expression “for appointment” employed in Subsection (1) to
                            
Section 23
 of the Act is indicative of the fact that the provision was
                            intended to impose conditions for appointments of teachers to be
                            appointed subsequent to the introduction of the Act and notification.

                            (c) Subsection (2) to 
Section 23
 of the Act provides for certain relaxation
                            in cases of States where there are no adequate institutions offering
                            courses or training in teacher education or States where there are no
                            adequate number of teachers possessing minimum qualification as laid
                            down in subsection (1) to 
section 23
 viz., TET. In such cases the central
                            government may by notification relax the minimum qualifications
                            required for appointment as a teacher for a period not exceeding five
                            years.

                            (d) It is important to note that Subsection (2) to 
Section 23
 of the Act
                            also governs future appointments and does not intend to touch upon the
                            rights of teachers or impair the rights of teachers who are already in
                            service to continue in service.



                  46.             Reliance was sought to be placed on the proviso to sub section (2) to

                  
Section 23
 of the Act to suggest that the qualification test is not only with

                  reference to teachers who are to be appointed but also teachers who were

                  already in service ought to pass TET test to remain in service. This is in view of

                  the fact that the proviso “a teacher who had at the commencement of this Act

                  does not possess minimum qualification would be required to acquire the

                  minimum qualification within a period of five years”. The expression “teacher”

                  here would not include those, who are already in service but is meant to cover

                  candidates who intend or who desire to be appointed as teachers. This would

                  be evident from a reading of sub section (2) to 
Section 23
 of the Act which

                  provides that “teachers possessing minimum qualification” which qualifies the

                  expression “for appointment” as a teacher. It is thus clear that the expression

                  “teacher” employed in 
Section 23
 of the Act does not cover teachers who are

                  already in appointment/in service but those who intend or desire to be

                  appointed as teachers.



                  47.             Secondly, a proviso is normally only a carve out or an exception to

                  the main provision and there is no reason to take a different view. There is

                  consistency between the proviso and sub section (2) to 
section 23
 inasmuch as

                  both look to a period of five years for the purpose of acquiring a qualification

                  viz., passing the TET test within a period of five years, under the circumstances

                  set-out therein.



                  48.             Any doubt as to whether the first proviso would govern teachers who

                  are already in service is put to rest through the proviso introduced by the 
Right

                  of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2017

                  reads as under;



                                  “Provided further that every teacher appointed or in position as on the
                                  31st March, 2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as laid
                                  down under sub-section (1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications
                                  within a period of four years from the date of commencement of the 
Right
                                  of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2017

                                  (24 of 2017)”


                  49.             A reading of the above proviso would make it clear that every teacher

                  appointed or in position as on 31.04.2015 and not possessing the minimum

                  qualification shall acquire such minimum qualification within a period of four

                  years from 2017. The expression “for appointment” employed in sub sections

                  (1) and (2) to 
Section 23
 when contrasted with every teacher “appointed”

                  would clearly indicate the fact that when the provisions were first introduced in

                  2010 they were only looking at future appointments. However, the proviso

                  introduced in the year 2017 also looks to teachers “who are already in

                  service”. The expression “for appointment” is indicative of the fact that the

                  teachers shall qualify for appointment which is to be made in future and

                  therefore it has to be prospective. If so, sub section (2) to 
Section 23
 of the Act

                  having found to cover appointments made after the introduction, the proviso

                  must also apply only to the said class of candidates/teachers covered by sub

                  section (2) to 
Section 23
 of the Act.



                  50.             
Section 23
 of the Act would make it clear that the intention of the

                  Legislature to prescribe minimum qualifications for teachers was made while

                  being alive to the fact that there may be certain States which do not have

                  adequate institutions offering courses or training in teacher education, or where

                  teachers possessing minimum qualifications are not available in sufficient

                  numbers. It is in this context that the Proviso to 
Section 23(2)
 states that a

                  teacher who, at the commencement of this Act (understood to mean those

                  appointed after the commencement of the Act), does not possess minimum

                  qualifications as laid down under sub section (1), shall acquire such minimum

                  qualification from five years. The legislature therefore has made it mandatory

                  for every teacher who at the time of commencement of the Act does not possess

                  minimum qualifications as prescribed under the Act, to acquire the said

                  minimum qualifications within a period of 5 years. The emphasis is on the

                  words “at the commencement of this Act” and hence, it needs to be examined

                  whether the legislature intended to apply the new qualifications to teachers

                  who are already in service at the commencement of the Act, or only to those to

                  be appointed after the commencement of the Act. Pursuant to the provisions of

                  the Act, the National Council Teacher Education (NCTE) issued a notification

                  dated 23.08.2010 prescribing the minimum qualifications for teachers from

                  Classes I to V- ‘Secondary Grade Teachers’ as well as for Classes VI to VIII-

                  ‘BT Assistant’. Apart from prescribing the minimum educational qualifications,

                  the important eligibility criteria added by way of the notification is – “Pass in

                  Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)”. This notification stated under paragraph 4 that

                  teachers appointed prior to the date of this notification need not acquire the

                  minimum qualification prescribed by the notifications. Under para 5 it has been

                  stated that those teachers appointed after date of this notification but in whose

                  case the process of appointment was initiated prior to the date of this

                  notification would also be exempt from acquiring the minimum qualifications

                  including Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) as prescribed under Para 1 of the

                  notification. The said Para 5 of the notification dated 23.08.2010 came to be

                  amended by the notification of the NCTE dated 29.07.2011 whereby Para 5

                  was substituted by Para 5(a) with the same provision while shifting the cut off

                  date from 23.08.2010 to 29.07.2011, meaning thereby that where the

                  Government, Local Authority or School issued the advertisement to initiate the

                  process of appointment prior to the date of this notification i.e., 29.07.2011

                  such appointments may also be made in accordance with the NCTE

                  Regulations 2001 i.e., exempting them from acquiring TET for appointment as

                  Public employment in a sovereign socialist secular Democratic Republic has to

                  be a set down by the Constitution and the laws made under the constitution

                  vis-à-vis the employment by the government and its instrumentalities on the

                  basis of procedure established on that behalf.



 
53.             The expression employment or appointment covers not only the

                  initial appointment but also attributes of service like promotion and age of

                  superannuation etc. The expression ‘matters relating to employment’ used in

                  
Article 16
 is not confined to initial matters prior to the act of employment but

                  to cover all matters in relation to employment both prior and subsequent. It

                  would cover salary, leave, gratuity, pension, superannuation, promotion and

                  54.             
In 
Union Public Service Commission v. Girish Jayanti Lal

                  Vaghela
 [(2006) 2 SCC 482], the Apex court observed that:


                                  “12. 
Article 16
 which finds place in Part III of the Constitution relating
                                  to fundamental rights provides that there shall be equality of opportunity
                                  for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any
                                  office under the State. The main object of 
Article 16
 is to create a
                                  constitutional right to equality of opportunity and employment in public
                                  offices. The words ‘employment’ or ‘appointment’ cover not merely the
                                  initial appointment but also other attributes of service like promotion and
                                  age of superannuation, etc. The appointment to any post under the State
                                  can only be made after a proper advertisement has been made inviting
                                  applications from eligible candidates and holding of selection by a body
                                  of experts or a specially constituted committee whose members are fair
                                  and impartial through a written examination or interview or some other
                                  rational criteria for judging the inter se merit of candidates who have
                                  applied in response to the advertisement made. A regular appointment to
                                  a post under the State or Union cannot be made without issuing
                                  advertisement in the prescribed manner which may in some cases include
                                  inviting applications from the employment exchange where eligible
                                  candidates get their names registered. Any regular appointment made on
                                  a post under the State or Union without issuing advertisement inviting
                                  applications from eligible candidates and without holding a proper
                                  selection where all eligible candidates get a fair chance to compete would
                                  violate the guarantee enshrined under 
Article 16
 of the Constitution.”


                  State Employment is not mere contract


                  55.             The employment in the state is not only a contract, but also a status

                  acquired by the employee. The salary and duration of work by the government

                  servant are governed by statute or statutory rules which may be framed by the

                  Government. In this context, the following decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme

(
i) Dinesh Chandra Sangma v. State of Assam
 [(1977) 4 SCC 441]

                                  ”The above is a special provision which deals with a special situation
                                  where a contract is entered into between the Government and a person
                                  appointed under the Constitution to hold a civil post. But simply because
                                  there may be, in a given case, a contractual employment, as envisaged
                                  under 
Article 310(2)
 of the Constitution, the relationship of all other
                                  government servants, as a class, and the Government, cannot be said to
                                  be contractual. It is well-settled that except in the case of a person who
                                  has been appointed under a written contract, employment under the
                                  Government is a matter of status and not of contract even though it may
                                  be said to have started, initially, by a contract in the sense that the offer
                                  of appointment is accepted by the employee.”


 
(
ii) Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India
 [(1968) 1 SCR 185]

                                  “It is true that the origin of Government service is contractual. There is
                                  an offer and acceptance in every case. But once appointed to his post or
                                  office the Government servant acquires a status and his rights and
                                  obligations are no longer determined by consent of both parties, but by
                                  statute or statutory rules which may be framed and altered unilaterally by
                                  the Government. In other words, the legal position of a Government
                                  servant is more one of status than of contract. The hallmark of status is
                                  the attachment to a legal relationship of rights and duties imposed by the
                                  public law and not by mere agreement of the parties. The emolument of
                                  the Government servant and his terms of service are governed by statute
                                  or statutory rules which may be unilaterally altered by the Government
                                  without the consent of the employee. It is true that 
Article 311
 imposes
                                  constitutional restrictions upon the power of removal granted to the
                                  President and the Governor under 
Article 310.
 But it is obvious that the
                                  relationship between the Government and its servant is not like an
                                  ordinary contract of service between a master and servant. The legal
                                  relationship is something entirely different, something in the nature of
                                  status. It is much more than a purely contractual relationship voluntarily
                                  entered into between the parties. The duties of status are fixed by the law
                                  and in the enforcement of these duties society has an interest. In the
                                  language of jurisprudence status is a condition of membership of a group
                                  of which powers and duties are exclusively determined by law and not by
                                  agreement between the parties concerned. The matter is clearly stated by
                                  Salmond and Williams on Contracts as follows:

                                               “So we may find both contractual and status-obligations
                                     produced by the same transaction. The one transaction may result
                                     in the creation not only of obligations defined by the parties and
                                     so pertaining to the sphere of contract but also and concurrently
                                     of obligations defined by the law itself, and so pertaining to the
                                     sphere of status. A contract of service between employer and
                                     employee, while for the most part pertaining exclusively to the
                                     sphere of contract, pertains also to that of status so far as the law
                                     itself has seen fit to attach to this relation compulsory incidents,
                                     such as liability to pay compensation for accidents. The extent to
                                     which the law is content to leave matters within the domain of
                                     contract to be determined by the exercise of the autonomous
                                     authority of the parties themselves, or thinks fit to bring the
                                     matter within the sphere of status by authoritatively determining
                                     for itself the contents of the relationship, is a matter depending on
                                     considerations of public policy. In such contracts as those of
                                     service the tendency in modern times is to withdraw the matter
                                     more and more from the domain of contract into that of status.”
                                                   (Salmond and Williams on Contracts, 2nd Edn. p. 12).



 
(
iii) State of H.P. v. Raj Kumar
 [(2023) 3 SCC 773]

                                  “26. Though the relationship between the employee and the State
                                  originates in contract, but by virtue of the constitutional constraint,
                                  coupled with the legislative and executive rules governing the service, the
                                  relation attains a unique position.
 Identifying such a relationship as
                                  being a “status”, as against a contract, this Court in Roshan Lal Tandon
                                  v. Union of India [Roshan Lal Tandon v. Union of India, (1968) 1 SCR
                                  185 : AIR 1967 SC 1889], explained what such a “status” constitutes.

                                  We have extracted hereinbelow the exposition of the concept of “status”
                                  as explained by the Constitution Bench for ready reference. .......It is true
                                  that the origin of government service is contractual. There is an offer and
                                  acceptance in every case. But once appointed to his post or office the
                                  government servant acquires a status and his rights and obligations are
                                  no longer determined by consent of both parties, but by statute or
                                  statutory rules which may be framed and altered unilaterally by the
                                  Government. In other words, the legal position of a government servant
                                  is more one of status than of contract. The hallmark of status is the
                                  attachment to a legal relationship of rights and duties imposed by the
                                  public law and not by mere of the parties. The emolument of the

                                  relationship between the Government and its servant is not like an

                  State as a Model Employer


 
56.             The Government being an employer, must act in accordance with the

                  rules and regulations framed by it. It should respond the legitimate aspirations

                  of the employees and create trustworthiness to them. The Hon'ble Supreme

                  Court in 
Bhupendra Nath Hazarika v. State of Assam
 [(2013) 2 SCC 516]

                  pointed out the same in the following ways:




                                  “State is a model employer and it is required to act fairly giving due
                                  regard and respect to the rules framed by it. We have stated the role of
                                  the State as a model employer with the fond hope that in future a
                                  deliberate disregard is not taken recourse to and deviancy of such
                                  magnitude is not adopted to frustrate the claims of the employees. It
                                  should always be borne in mind that legitimate aspirations of the
                                  employees are not guillotined and a situation is not created where hopes
                                  end in despair. Hope for everyone is gloriously precious and a model
                                  employer should not convert it to be deceitful and treacherous by playing
                                  a game of chess with their seniority. A sense of calm sensibility and
                                  concerned sincerity should be reflected in every step. An atmosphere of
                                  trust has to prevail and when the employees are absolutely sure that their
                                  trust shall not be betrayed and they shall be treated with dignified
                                  fairness then only the concept of good governance can be concretised.
                                  That public employment is a facet of right to equality envisaged under
                                  
Article 16
 of the Constitution of India and that the recruitment rules are
                                  framed with a view to give equal opportunity to all the citizens of India
                                  entitled for being considered for recruitment in the vacant posts. As a
                                  model employer the Government must conduct itself with high probity
                                  and candour with its employees, The main concern of the court in such
                                  matters is to ensure the rule of law and to see that the Executive acts
                                  fairly and gives a fair deal to its employees consistent with the
                                  requirements of 
Articles 14
 and 16.”

                  Rule against retrospectivity


 
57.             It would be evident that the teachers who were appointed on the

                  basis of eligibility criteria set out during their employment prior to the

                  introduction of the Act and having secured employment and having been in the

                  employment for decades cannot now be required to satisfy the eligibility

                  criterion which is introduced in the year 2010. Any attempt to do so would

                  result in giving retrospective effect to the Act. This would warrant an

                  examination, whether the provisions under consideration can be given

                  retrospective operation, when it does not expressly provide for the same. There

                  is a presumption of prospectivity articulated in the legal maxima Nova

                  Constitutio Futuris Formam Imponere Debet, Non Praeteritis that is “a new

                  law ought to regulate what is to follow, not the past”. It is trite law that any

                  provision or statute dealing with substantive rights is prospective unless it is

                  expressly or by necessary implication made to have retrospective operation as

                  held in

                                  statutory provisions creating substantive rights or taking away
                                  substantive rights are ordinarily prospective; they are retrospective only if
                                  by express words or by necessary implication the legislature has made
                                  them retrospective; and the retrospective operation will be limited only to
                                  the extent to which it has been so made by express words, or necessary
                                  implication. The second rule is that the intention of the legislature has
                                  always to be gathered from the words used by it, giving to the words their
                                  plain, normal, grammatical meaning. The third rule is that if in any
                                  legislation, the general object of which is to benefit a particular class of
                                  persons, any provision is ambiguous so that it is capable of two
                                  meanings, one which would preserve the benefit and another which would
                                  take it away, the meaning which preserves it should be adopted. The
                                  fourth rule is that if the strict grammatical interpretation gives rise to an
                                  absurdity or inconsistency such interpretation should be discarded and an
                                  interpretation which will give effect to the purpose the Legislature may
                                  reasonably be considered to have had will be put on the words, if
                                  necessary even by modification of the language used.”


 
(
ii) CIT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd.
 [(2015) 1 SCC 1 at page 21]

                                  “28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted,
                                  one established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a
                                  legislation is presumed not to be intended to have a retrospective
                                  operation. The idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern
                                  current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of the past.


                                  If we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today and in
                                  force and not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the
                                  nature of the law is founded on the bedrock that every human being is
                                  entitled to arrange his affairs by relying on the existing law and should not
                                  find that his plans have been retrospectively upset. This principle of law is
                                  known as lex prospicit non respicit: law looks forward not backward. As
                                  was observed in Phillips v. Eyre [(1870) LR 6 QB 1] , a retrospective
                                  legislation is contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the
                                  conduct of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for the first time to
                                  deal with future acts ought not to change the character of past
                                  transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.”


                  58.             Thus, it could be inferred from the above that when Parliament in its

                  wisdom has made the provisions of the Act only prospective, it would not be

                  open through a process of interpretation by courts or on the basis of

                  interpretation/understanding by the executive or a subordinate legislation to

                  give a retrospective effect though the plenary legislation does not either

                  expressly or by necessary implication provide for retrospective operation of its

                  provisions.



                  Subordinate legislation to be in conformity with plenary legislation


                  59.             Any attempt to suggest that the subordinate legislation must be

                  understood as imposing a condition which requires the teachers who were in

                  service to clear the test despite the fact that plenary legislation in the form of

                  
RTE Act
 does not provide for the same would render the subordinate legislation

                  bad for it is settled principle that any subordinate legislation ought to be in

                  confirmity with the parent Act as well as other plenary legislation. The

                  decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to below explained the same.

 [(1990) 3 SCC 223)]

                                  “45. Power delegated by statute is limited by its terms and subordinate to
                                  its objects. The delegate must act in good faith, reasonably, intra vires the
                                  power granted, and on relevant consideration of material facts. All his

                                  judicial, must be in harmony with the Constitution and other laws of the
                                  land. They must be "reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling
                                  legislation".

                                  “12. There is a presumption in favour of constitutionality or validity of a
                                  sub-ordinate Legislation and the burden is upon him who attacks it to
                                  show that it is invalid. It is also well recognized that a sub-ordinate
                                  legislation can be challenged under any of the following grounds:-


                                  a) Lack of legislative competence to make the sub-ordinate legislation.



                                  b) Violation of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution of
                                  India.



                                  c) Violation of any provision of the Constitution of India.



                                  d) Failure to conform to the Statute under which it is made or exceeding
                                  the limits of authority conferred by the enabling Act.



                                  e) Repugnancy to the laws of the land, that is, any enactment.



                                  f) Manifest arbitrariness/unreasonableness (to an extent where court
                                  might well say that Legislature never intended to give authority to make
                                  such Rules).



                  60.             The court considering the validity of a subordinate Legislation, will

                  have to consider the nature, object and scheme of the enabling Act, and also the

                  area over which power has been delegated under the Act and then decide

                  whether the subordinate Legislation conforms to the parent Statute. Where a

                  Rule is directly inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the Statute, then, of

                  course, the task of the court is simple and easy. But where the contention is

                  that the inconsistency or non-conformity of the Rule is not with reference to

                  any specific provision of the enabling Act, but with the object and scheme of

                  the 
Parent Act
, the court should proceed with caution before declaring

                  invalidity.

                  absurd results to be adopted


                  61.             It may be relevant to note that parliament would make laws which

                  are just and reasonable, and that, there is also a presumption that Parliament

                  would frame laws which are constitutionally valid. To assume that the

                  provisions of 
Section 23
 of the Act are effective retrospectively, would result in

                  rendering the provision vulnerable to challenge as offending 
Article 14
 of the

                  Constitution. 
In this regard, it may be useful to note that manifest arbitrariness

                  by itself is a ground to invalidate even plenary legislation as held in 
Shayara

                  Bano v. Union of India
, [(2017) 9 SCC 1], the relevant passage of which is

                  usefully extracted below:




                                  “95...In particular, which stated that legislation can be struck down on the
                                  ground that it is “arbitrary” under 
Article 14
, went on to conclude that
                                  “arbitrariness” when applied to legislation cannot be used loosely.
                                  Instead, it broad based the test, stating that if a constitutional infirmity is
                                  found, 
Article 14
 will interdict such infirmity. And a constitutional
                                  infirmity is found in 
Article 14
 itself whenever legislation is “manifestly
                                  arbitrary” i.e. when it is not fair, not reasonable, discriminatory, not
                                  transparent, capricious, biased, with favouritism or nepotism and not in
                                  pursuit of promotion of healthy competition and equitable treatment.
                                  Positively speaking, it should conform to norms which are rational,
                                  informed with reason and guided by public interest, etc.,”


                  Hardship, inconvenience, injustice, absurdity and anomaly to be avoided


                  62.             The Court will adopt that which is just, reasonable and sensible

                  rather than what is none of those things.

                  construction that results in hardship, serious inconvenience, injustice, absurdity

                  or anomaly or which leads to inconsistency or uncertainty and friction in the

                  system which the statute purports to regulate has to be rejected and preference

                  should be given to that construction which avoids such results. This rule has no

                  application, when the words are susceptible to only one meaning and no

                  alternative construction is reasonably open.




 
63.             In selecting out of different interpretations ‘the court will adopt that

                  which is just, reasonable and sensible rather than that which is none of those

                  things’ as it may be presumed that 'the legislature should have used the word in

                  that interpretation which least offends our sense of justice’. If the grammatical

                  construction leads to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with

                  the rest of the instrument, it may be departed from so as to avoid that

                  absurdity, and inconsistency. Similarly, a construction giving rise to anomalies

                  should be avoided as noted by the Supreme Court in 
N.T. Veluswami Thevar

                  v. G. Raja Nainar
 [1959 Supp (1) SCR 623]

                                  “12.…… It is no doubt true that if on its true construction, a statute leads
                                  to anomalous results, the courts have no option but to give effect to it and
                                  leave it to the legislature to amend and alter the law. But when on a
                                  construction of a statute, two views are possible, one which results in an
                                  anomaly and the other, not, it is our duty to adopt the latter and not the
                                  former, seeking consolation in the thought that the law bristles with
                                  anomalies. Anomalies will disappear, and the law will be found to be
                                  simple and logical, if it is understood that when a question is raised in an
                                  election petition as to the propriety of the rejection of a nomination paper,
                                  the point to be decided is about the propriety of the nomination and not

                                     of the apparent purpose of the enactment, or to some
                                     inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, presumably not
                                     intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies the
                                     meaning of the words, and even the structure of the sentence”.
                                     (Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Edn., p. 229). Reading
                                     the proviso along with clause (b) thereto, and construing it in its
                                     setting in the section, we are of opinion that notwithstanding the
                                     wideness of the language used, the proviso contemplates notice
                                     only to persons who are not parties to the petition.”


 
64.             Legislature must be presumed to enact laws that are just, fair and

                  reasonable and in society's interest, unless it is explicitly intended to result in

                  any harsh or ridiculous effect. The words of K.S. Hedge, J. as held in 
Bhudan

                  Singh v. Nabi Bux
, [(1969) 2 SCC 481 at page 485], reads as under:


                            “9.Before considering the meaning of the word “held” in 
Section 9
, it is
                            necessary to mention that it is proper to assume that the law makers who are
                            the representatives of the people enact laws which the society considers as
                            honest, fair and equitable. The object of every legislation is to advance public
                            welfare. In other words as observed by Crawford in his book on “Statutory
                            Constructions” that the entire legislative process is influenced by
                            considerations of justice and reason. Justice and reason constitute the great
                            general legislative intent in every peace of legislation. Consequently where the
                            suggested construction operates harshly, ridiculously or in any other manner
                            contrary to prevailing conceptions of justice and reason, in most instance, it
                            would seem that the apparent or suggested meaning of the statute, was not the
                            one intended by the law makers. In the absence of some other indication that
                            the harsh or ridiculous effect was actually intended by the legislature, there is
                            little reason to believe that it represents the legislative intent.”

                  Any interpretation that would lead to absurdity has to be avoided, according to

                  the rules of interpretation (Central India Spg., Wvg. & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v.



                  Municipal Committee, 1958 SCR 1102). Therefore, a construction resulting in

                  have cleared resulting in an overall average of 3.95 percentage. The

                  consequence of treating the passing of TET exams as mandatory even to

                  continue in service apart from rendering the provision as being arbitrary,

                  produces results which are absurd / obnoxious in as much as it could result in

                  more than a lakh of teachers being unemployed. It would also have the ripple

                  effect of affecting the careers of students inasmuch as it is impossible to find

                  adequate alternate hands to impart education. Inasmuch as applying the above

                  data, it would require at least 30,00,000 people to take part in TET exams to

                  have a lakh of teachers clearing TET thereby qualifying for appointment.


 
66.             It is also relevant to note that the legislature is presumed to

                  understand and appreciate the needs of its own people and that its laws are

                  directed towards problems realized through experience [Refer: 
Ram Krishna

                  Dalmia v. SR Tendolkar
, 1959 SCR 279 para 11]. It cannot be

                  overemphasized that experience is also important and Parliament must be

                  imputed with the wisdom that experience is relevant and therefore the

                  legislature ensured that the provisions are only prospective and not

                  retrospective, if we bear the above data in mind, the consequences that could

                  possibly result in treating TET examinations as applying even in respect of

                  teachers who are already in services at the time of introduction of TET, would

                  produce results which are absurd and obnoxious something which ought to be

                  avoided.
 
In this regard it may be useful to refer to the judgment of the Supreme

                  Court in 
Sirsi Municipality v. Cecelia Kom Francis Tellis
, [(1973) 1 SCC

                  409], to understand what is their nature of appointment and the consequences

                  Hardship to those in employment to be avoided


                  67.             The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Girjesh Shrivastava v. State of M.P.

                  [(2010) 10 SCC 707] found that cancellation of appointment after long period

                  which would result in large number of people being unemployed is arbitrary

                  and undesirable also in view of the fact that they would have left their previous

                  employment and would have reached an age where the prospects of them

                  finding another job are rather dim and all this if taken into account

                  cumulatively would indicate that the provisions of the Act in the first place is

                  only prospective on a plain reading of the provisions and any attempt to

                  suggest that it must be given retrospective effect ought to be rejected for it

                  would fall foul of 
Article 14
, 16
 and 
19 (1)(g)
 of the Constitution. The relevant

                  paragraph of the said decision is profitably reproduced as under:


                                  “31. More importantly, in deciding these issues, the High Court should
                                  have been mindful of the fact that an order for cancellation of
                                  appointment would render most of the appellants unemployed. Most of
                                  them were earlier teaching in non-formal education centres, from where
                                  they had resigned to apply in response to the advertisement. They had left
                                  their previous employment in view of the fact that for their three-year
                                  long teaching experiences, the interview process in the present selection
                                  was awarding them grace marks of 25%. It had also given them a
                                  relaxation of 8 years with respect to their age. Now, if they lose their jobs

                                  as a result of the High Court's order, they would be effectively
                                  unemployed as they cannot even revert to their earlier jobs in the non-
                                  formal education centres, which have been abolished since then. This
                                  would severely affect the economic security of many families. Most of
                                  them are between the age group of 35-45 years, and the prospects for
                                  them of finding another job are rather dim. Some of them were in fact
                                  awaiting their salary raise at the time of quashing of their appointment by
                                  the High Court.”



                  68.             Reverting to the present case, pursuant to the said Act as well as

                  notification issued by the NCTE the State Government issued G.O.Ms.No.181

                  School Education (C2) Department dated 15.11.2011, wherein, in paragraph 3,

                  it has been mentioned as follows:



                                  “3.The said section clearly specifies that teachers who at the
                                  commencement of this Act, do not possess minimum qualifications as
                                  prescribed by the academic authority authorized by the central
                                  government shall acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of
                                  5 years. Hence, the “Teacher Eligibility Test (TET)” would have to be
                                  conducted for recruiting teachers for the primary and upper primary
                                  classes. The teachers working in unaided private schools are required to
                                  pass teacher Eligibility Test within 5 years. In the State of Tamil Nadu,
                                  Secondary Grade teachers (those teaching classes I to V) are required to
                                  have minimum qualifications of D.T.Ed. and graduate Assistants (BT
                                  Assistant) (those teaching classes VI to VIII) are required to have
                                  minimum qualifications of B.Ed. they should also pass Teacher Eligibility
                                  Test forthwith.”




                  69.             A reading of the provisions of the Act read with the NCTE

                  Notifications as stated above would make it clear that all those appointed prior

                  to the notification dated 29.07.2011 can continue in service as Secondary

                  Grade Teachers or BT Assistants as the case may be, without acquiring TET.

                  extent, the language employed in G.O.(Ms.)No.181 dated 15.11.2011 is to be

                  read and understood to the effect that for continuance in service without

                  promotional prospects, TET is not mandatory. The time-limit granted for

                  acquiring a pass in TET is applicable only for those who have been appointed

                  after the commencement of the Act, and who for the reasons stated in 
Section

                  23(2)
 of the Act, were appointed without qualifying in TET. The amendment to

                  the 
RTE Act
 on 09.08.2017 by Act No. 24 of 2017 with effect from 01.04.2015

                  by inserting the following Second proviso to the 
Section 23(2)
 of the RTE Act,

                  reads as follows:



                                  “23(2) …
                                  Provided further that every teacher appointed or in position as on the
                                  31st March 2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as laid
                                  down under sub-section(1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications
                                  within a period of four years from the date of commencement of the
                                  
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act,
                                  2017

The aforesaid proviso is also to be read in the same manner as being applicable

                  only for those who have been appointed after the commencement of the Act,

                  and who for the reasons stated in 
Section 23(2)
 of the Act, were appointed

                  without qualifying in TET. The words “every teacher appointed or in position

                  as on the 31st March 2015” would clear any semblance of doubt as to the

                  category of persons whom it refers to, meaning thereby that every teacher

                  (.i.e., Act 24 of 2017) to the 
RTE Act
 w.e.f 01.04.2015. It is to be seen that the

                  question whether teachers appointed prior to the notification of the NCTE

                  dated 29.07.2011 would require to pass the TET for continuing in service came

                  up for consideration in 
M.Maharani v. The State of Tamilnadu and Ors
.




                  [MANU/TN/0608/2019] wherein it has been held as follows:



                                  “….

                                  10. However, there is no cut-off date specified in the said G.O. Ms. No.
                                  181, with regard to acquiring the qualification of pass TET to continue in
                                  service as B.T. Assistants /Secondary Grade Teachers, who are working as
                                  such in the respondent Schools. In this regard, a cursory glance at Clause
                                  (5) of the notification dated 23.08.2010 and its amended notification dated
                                  29.07.2011 issued by the NCTE, the contents of which are reproduced at
                                  paragraph nos. 8.2 and 8.4 above, would reveal that if the process of
                                  appointment of teachers was initiated prior to the date of notification by
                                  issuing advertisement, such appointments have to be made in accordance
                                  with NCTE (Determination of Minimum Qualifications for Recruitment of
                                  Teachers in Schools) Regulations, 2001 and the same was amended with
                                  effect from 29.07.2011. As per the said NCTE Regulations 2001, there is
                                  no qualification prescribed with regard to possession of TET certificate,
                                  for appointment to the post of B.T Assistant and Secondary Grade
                                  Teachers. The qualification of passing TET was first introduced by the
                                  notification dated 23.08.2010 and it was amended vide notification dated
                                  27.09.2011. Thus, it could be inferred that the cut-off date for acquiring
                                  the TET qualification is 27.09.2011 and the teachers, who were appointed
                                  prior to that date need not pass TET and even in the case of the teachers
                                  who were appointed after that date, if the advertisement to initiate the
                                  process of appointment of teachers was made prior to that date, then,
                                  their appointments also can be in accordance with the NCTE Regulations
                                  2001 and they need not acquire the TET qualification.



                                  12. In the ultimate analysis, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the
                                  petitioners are entitled to seek exemption from passing TET, as they were
                                  appointed prior to the cut-off date and the respondents are directed not to
                                  insist TET certificate from the petitioners as a pre-condition for their

70.             The aforesaid judgment was also followed in 
V.Fathima Riswana

                  and others v The Chief Educational Officer, Tirunelveli and Others


                  [MANU/TN/4852/2020 dated 13.08.2020].






                  71.             In line with above reasoning, the orders of the learned Judge holding

                  that even those appointed prior to the commencement of the Act must acquire a

                  pass in TET is liable to be set aside. The Secondary Grade Teachers only

                  seeking continuance in service with increments, are fundamentally a different

                  class of persons from those seeking promotion to B.T.Assistant from Secondary

                  Grade Teacher.

71.1.           A perusal of the orders impugned in the writ petitions leading to

                  these writ appeals would indicate that the fact that the teachers, in respect

                  of whom approval of appointment was sought for by the school, did not

                  possess TET pass eligibility was not a ground for refusal for grant of

                  appointment approval, nor was it an issued raised before the Learned

                  Single Judge at the time of disposal of the writ petitions. Only in the writ

                  appeals, the State Government has raised an additional ground that the

                  teachers whose appointment approval was sought for, did not possess TET.

                  128/134

                                                                             WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  Notwithstanding the same, it is hereby clarified that by virtue of the

                  judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in

                  
Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust & Ors. v. Union of India
, [(2014) 8

                  SCC 1], wherein it was held that the 
RTE Act, 2009
 insofar as it applies to

                  minority schools, aided or unaided, covered under 
Article 30(1)
 is

                  ultravires the Constitution, meaning thereby that the 2009 Act will not

                  apply to minority schools, the eligibility of TET pass as required for

                  appointment of teachers in non-minority schools, will not apply to minority

                  schools. In other words, the approval of appointment of teachers in

                  minority schools, both aided and unaided, cannot be refused or rejected on

                  the ground that they do not possess a pass in TET. Further this specific

                  issue is also pending consideration before the Supreme Court and the law

                  
laid down by
 the Supreme Court in Pramati Educational and Cultural

                  Trust, cited supra, holds the field as on today. For these reasons, the order

                  of the Learned Judge in the writ petitions is affirmed and the above four

                  writ appeals are dismissed.




                  72.             In the light of the above narration, taking note of the factual

                  background, the legal provisions spelling out the intention of the legislature

                  and the effect of the subordinate legislation pursuant thereto, the inescapable

                  conclusion of this court would be that every teacher whether Secondary Grade

                  129/134

                                                                                  WA. No. 313 of 2022 etc batch

                  or BT Assistant, whether appointed by direct recruitment or promotion in the

                  case of BT Assistant, after the coming into force of the 
RTE Act
 and the NCTE

                  notifications must necessarily possess/acquire the eligibility of a pass in TET.

                  Therefore, the claim that Secondary Grade Teachers appointed prior to the

                  commencement of the Act and notifications will now be eligible for promotion

                  to the post of BT Assistant without passing TET, cannot be countenanced. For

                  any fresh appointments, whether by direct recruitment in the case of Secondary

                  Grade Teachers, or by either direct recruitment or promotion or transfer in the

                  Graduate Assistants/BT Assistants, a pass in TET is an essential eligibility

                  criteria to be fulfilled.



                  73.             Further, it is made clear that all those appointed prior to 29.07.2011

                  are exempt from passing TET only for the purpose of continuance in the post of

                  secondary grade teacher or BT Assistant without promotional prospects. Any

                  appointments whether by direct recruitment or promotion or transfer made

                  after 29.07.2011, will have to necessarily adhere to the minimum eligibility

                  criteria of passing TET. *The principles 
laid down in
 this judgment will not

                  have application to minority schools, both aided and unaided as explained

                  in paragraph no.71.1.

                  74.             For the sake of clarity and ease of reference, the upshot of the above

                  discussion is as under:



                                  (a) Any teacher appointed as Secondary Grade Teacher or Graduate

                  Teacher/BT Assistant prior to 29.07.2011 shall continue in service and also

                  receive increments and incentives, even if they do not possess/acquire a pass in

                  TET. At the same time, for future promotional prospects like promotion from

                  secondary grade teacher to B.T. Assistant as well as for promotion to

                  Headmasters, etc., irrespective of their dates of original appointment, they must

                  necessarily possess TET, failing which they will not be eligible for promotion.



                                  (b) Any appointment made to the post of Secondary Grade Teacher

                  after 29.07.2011 must necessarily possess TET.



                                  (c) Any appointment made to Graduate Teacher/BT Assistant, after

                  29.07.2011, whether by direct recruitment or promotion from the post of

                  Secondary Grade Teacher, or transfer, must necessarily possess TET. *The

                  principles 
laid down in
 this judgment will not have application to minority

                  schools, both aided and unaided as explained in paragraph no.71.1.

                  and not for promotion thereto in Annexure-I (referred to in Rule 6) is struck

                  down, thereby meaning that TET is mandatory/essential eligibility criterion for

                  appointment to the post of BT Assistant even by promotion from Secondary

                  Grade Teachers.





                                  (e) The language employed in G.O. (Ms) No. 181 dated 15.11.2011

                  is to be read and understood to the effect that for continuance in service

                  without promotional prospects, TET is not mandatory.


                  75.             The narration of facts which propelled this case would indicate that

                  the teachers have not been appointed for the last ten years inspite of being

                  qualified with a pass in TET. On the basis of the above findings and

                  observations made, the State Government is directed to conduct TET

                  periodically and make direct recruitment of teachers and promotion from

                  among TET qualified candidates at the earliest.



                  76.             With these observations, Writ Petition Nos.3364 and 3368 of 2023

                  are allowed, Writ Appeal Nos. 313, 833, 1891, 2050, 2082, 2795 of 2022 &

                  Writ Appeal Nos.19, 31, 32, 36 of 2023 are dismissed. WA.No.2617/2022 is

                  allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
