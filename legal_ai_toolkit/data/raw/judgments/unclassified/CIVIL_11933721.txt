                      9.    The respondent on 19th July 2011 filed an application before the
                      Learned ADJ, Gurgaon for termination of the mandate of the Learned
                      Arbitrator under

                      SUBMISSIONS
                      (On behalf of the petitioner)


                      10.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Learned Sole
                      Arbitrator went beyond the scope of reference and the jurisdiction while
                      ascertaining that the agreement is determinable in nature and therefore
                      not enforceable.

                      11.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Learned Sole
                      Arbitrator rejected the claim of the petitioner for specific performance of
                      sale of immovable property by applying 
Section 14(1)(c)
 of Specific
                      Relief Act, 1963 and concept of per se determinability of the Contract. It
                      is further submitted that the dispute was not even referred to the
                      Arbitration in the Statement of Defence and that the Learned Sole
                      Arbitrator committed error of jurisdiction by going beyond the scope of
                      Contract.

                      12.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the impugned
                      Award suffers from patent illegality and is liable to be set aside to the
                      extent it has been challenged for being in clear contravention of 
Section
                      28(3)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation, 1996. Learned counsel for the
                      petitioner submitted that option to terminate was only with the petitioner
                      under Clause 9 but the Contract was neither terminated by the petitioner
                      and nor by the respondent either before or after the Contract was put to
                      enforcement.

                      13.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that impugned Award
                      suffers from inherent contradictions because on one hand it was held that
                      on exercise of option to purchase the agreement transforms into an
                      agreement to sell, which as per Clause 6 is enforceable and on the other
                      hand even upon an option vested with the petitioner to terminate having
                      not being exercised in terms of clause 9, on hypothetical and academic
                      basis it has been held that contract is determinable therefore not
                      enforceable.

                      14.     Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that 
Section 14(1)(c)

                      of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is not applicable in the facts of the case
                      and instead 
Section 10
 is applicable. It is further submitted that all the
                      judgments relied upon by the Learned Arbitrator to hold that 
Section
                      14(1) (c)
 is applicable pertained to movable goods or contract of services
                      in which the contract had been terminated and party aggrieved was
                      seeking injunction or performance. Thus, in these circumstances it was
                      held that determinable contracts cannot be enforced. These are
                      inapplicable to the terms of contract in present case and facts of present
                      case.

                      15.     In view of the aforesaid, the impugned Award dated 4th October
                      2018 to the extent that the registered Agreement dated 23rd March 2001
                      for sale of immovable property has been held to be determinable in nature
                      and therefore not enforceable, be set aside.

                      (On behalf of the respondent)

                      16.     Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent
                      through various communications had categorically intimated the
                      petitioner that the property could not be transferred. It further submitted
                      that the Contract became unenforceable and determinable due to various
                      breaches committed by the petitioner. Moreover, it is submitted that the
                      Learned Sole Arbitrator went beyond the terms of the Contract by
                      granting compensation which was never sought by the petitioner.

                      17.     Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the Lease Deed
                      became revocable and determinable under the law as well as 
Section
                      28(3)
 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and by violating the
                      terms of the Deed, the petitioner cannot seek recourse to the Clauses of
                      the Deed. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the
                      impugned Award is completely based on the interpretation of the Lease
                      Deed.

                      18.     Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the Award to the
                      extent it has been impugned in question, is neither patently illegal or in
                      contravention of fundamental policy of India because it has held the Deed
                      to be determinable, revocable and unenforceable. Moreover, it is also
                      submitted that the same is well reasoned on substantive law. Learned
                      counsel for the respondent submitted that if compensation is the remedy
                      available for breach of a Contract, then the same should be availed before

                      the remedy becomes unavailable under 
Section 21
 of the Specific Relief
                      Act, 1963.

                      19.   Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the judgments
                      relied by the Learned Sole Arbitrator are relevant to the case at hand and
                      that every judgment is different but the ratio is what is to be gathered
                      from the judgment.

                      20.   Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the whole of the
                      
Specific Relief Act
 is applicable to the case and that the Deed was
                      determinable and unenforceable from inception.

                      21.   Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that no rights or
                      interest could have vested in the petitioner and the building can be bought
                      back by the respondent under the buyback Clause in the Deed and the
                      respondent is ready and willing to do so.

                      22.   Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the respondent
                      had the right to terminate the Agreement and the same was rightly done
                      so and no right could have been vested in favour of petitioner as no right
                      could be transferred under the prevailing and current HUDA laws.

                      23.   Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that no Agreement
                      can be irrevocable, non-determinable even if either party commits a
                      breach of the Contract, and such a Contract would itself be void ab initio.

                      24.   Learned counsel for respondent submitted that the Lease Deed has
                      been terminated by the respondent and struck down by the Learned
                      Arbitral Tribunal. It is also submitted that the Lease Deed has not become
                      Agreement to Sell due to illegal acts and ill deeds of the petitioner.

                      25.   Learned counsel for respondent submitted that the compensation
                      was never sought by the petitioner and therefore, that part of the

                      impugned Award is bad in law and the respondent has filed a petition
                      under 
Section 34
 of the Act of 1996 to that effect.

                      26.   Therefore, in view of the aforesaid it is submitted that the instant
                      petition being devoid of merits is liable to be dismissed.



                      QUESTION FOR ADJUDICATION

                      27.   Heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the record.

                      28.   The present petition filed under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration and
                      Conciliation Act, 1996, seeks to challenge the impugned Award dated 4 th
                      October 2018 to the extent that registered agreement dated 23.03.2001 for
                      sale of immovable property has been held to be "determinable in nature
                      therefore not enforceable". It is the petitioner's averment that only on that
                      basis the claim of the petitioner for specific enforcement of agreement of
                      sale of immovable property has been rejected.

                      29.   Therefore, the only question before this Court is to adjudicate that
                      whether the registered agreement dated 23.03.2001 for sale of immovable
                      property has rightly been held to be "determinable in nature therefore not
                      enforceable", and hence the dismissal of claim of the petitioner for
                      specific enforcement of agreement of sale of immovable property was
                      just and proper.

                      Spirit of the Arbitration Act

                      30.   Before adjudicating upon the merits of the case, it is essential to
                      recapitulate the idea, purpose, goal and objective of the 
Arbitration Act
 as
                      well as 
Section 34
 of the Act to understand the implications the
                      provisions therein have on the powers and jurisdiction of this Court.

                      31.   
The Arbitration Act
 was enacted for providing a mechanism to the
                      public to resolve their disputes in a process less rigorous, technical and
                      formal than that of a litigation. It has proven to be easier, more accessible,
                      efficient and even cost effective for the parties involved, whether at an
                      individual level or at the level of a business or corporation. The
                      alternative dispute mechanism is not only advantageous for the people
                      involved in disputes but has also been aiding the effective disposal and
                      release of burden on the Courts of the Country. The parties have a more
                      hands-on involvement in an Arbitration process and play an active role in
                      the adjudication process.

 
32.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Union of India vs. Varindera
                      Constructions Ltd.
, (2018) 7 SCC 794, while discussing the object of
                      arbitration held as under:-


                            ―12. The primary object of the arbitration is to reach a final
                            disposition in a speedy, effective, inexpensive and expeditious
                            manner. In order to regulate the law regarding arbitration,
                            legislature came up with legislation which is known as
                            
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
. In order to make
                            arbitration process more effective, the legislature restricted
                            the role of courts in case where matter is subject to the
                            arbitration. 
Section 5
 of the Act specifically restricted the
                            interference of the courts to some extent. In other words, it is
                            only in exceptional circumstances, as provided by this Act,
                            the court is entitled to intervene in the dispute which is the
                            subject-matter of arbitration. Such intervention may be
                            before, at or after the arbitration proceeding, as the case
                            may be. In short, court shall not intervene with the subject-
                            matter of arbitration unless injustice is caused to either of the
                            parties.‖

                      33.   Therefore, expeditious and effective disposal of matters are most
                      certainly considered the primary objectives of the enactment of the
                      
Arbitration Act
. To fulfil the objective of introducing the 
Arbitration Act
,
                      it has been deemed necessary by the legislature as well as the Hon'ble
                      Supreme Court to limit interference by the Courts in the process of
                      arbitration, whether before, during or after the conclusion of the
                      proceedings.

                      34.   The petitioner before this Court has invoked 
Section 34
 of the
                      Arbitration Act to challenge the impugned Award. The relevant portion
                      of the said provision is reproduced hereunder for perusal and
                      consideration:-



                            ―34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.--

                            (1) Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be
                            made only by an application for setting aside such award in
                            accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
                            (2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if--

                                     (a) the party making the application establishes on the
                                     basis of the record of the arbitral tribunal that--

                                           (i) a party was under some incapacity, or

                                           (ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under
                                           the law to which the parties have subjected it or,
                                           failing any indication thereon, under the law for
                                           the time being in force; or

                                           (iii) the party making the application was not
                                           given proper notice of the appointment of an
                                           arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was
                                           otherwise unable to present his case; or

                                           (iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not
                                           contemplated by or not falling within the terms

                                       capable of settlement by arbitration under the

                      35.   The contents of the provision clearly show that the intention of
                      legislature while enacting the 
Arbitration Act
, as well as while carrying
                      out amendments to the same, was that there should be limited
                      intervention of the Courts in arbitral proceedings, especially after the
                      proceedings have been concluded and an Award thereto has been made
                      by the concerned Arbitral Tribunal. Any claim brought forth a Court of
                      law under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act shall be in accordance with
                      the principle of the provisions laid down under the 
Arbitration Act
 as well
                      as interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

                      36.   The Law Commission of India in its 246 th Report has also
                      elaborated upon the background of introducing 
Section 34
 of the
                      Arbitration Act and laid down as under:-



                            ―3. 
The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
 (hereinafter
                            "the Act") is based on the UNCITRAL Model law on
                            International Commercial Arbitration, 1985 and the
                            UNCITRAL Conciliation Rules, 1980. 
The Act
 has now been
                            in force for almost two decades, and in this period of time,
                            although arbitration has fast emerged as a frequently chosen
                            alternative to litigation, it has come to be afflicted with
                            various problems including those of high costs and delays,

                           making it no better than either the earlier regime which it
                           was intended to replace; or to litigation, to which it intends
                           to provide an alternative. Delays are inherent in the
                           arbitration process, and costs of arbitration can be
                           tremendous. Even though courts play a pivotal role in giving
                           finality to certain issues which arise before, after and even
                           during an arbitration, there exists a serious threat of
                           arbitration related litigation getting caught up in the huge
                           list of pending cases before the courts. After the award, a
                           challenge under 
Section 34
 makes the award inexecutable
                           and such petitions remain pending for several years. The
                           object of quick alternative disputes resolution frequently
                           stands frustrated.

                           4. There is, therefore, an urgent need to revise certain
                           provisions of the Act to deal with these problems that
                           frequently arise in the arbitral process. The purpose of this
                           Chapter is to lay down the foundation for the changes
                           suggested in the Report of the Commission. The suggested
                           amendments address a variety of issues that plague the
                           present regime of arbitration in India and, therefore, before
                           setting out the amendments, it would be useful to identify the
                           problems that the suggested amendments are intended to
                           remedy and the context in which the said problems arise and
                           hence the context in which their solutions must be seen.

                           25. Similarly, the Commission has found that challenges to
                           arbitration awards under 
Sections 34
 and 
48
 are similarly
                           kept pending for many years. In this context, the Commission
                           proposes the addition of 
Sections 34(5)
 and 
48(4)
 which
                           would require that an application under those sections shall
                           be disposed of expeditiously and in any event within a period
                           of one year from the date of service of notice. In the case of
                           applications under 
Section 48
 of the Act, the Commission has
                           further provided a time-limit under 
Section 48(3)
, which
                           mirrors the time-limits set out in 
Section 34(3)
, and is aimed
                           at ensuring that parties take their remedies under this section
                           seriously and approach a judicial forum expeditiously, and
                           not by way of an afterthought.‖

                      37.   With the repeal of 
Arbitration Act
 of 1940 by way of 
Arbitration
                      Act, 1996
, the legislature sought to achieve the objective of reducing the
                      supervisory role of courts in arbitration proceedings. The amendment of
                      
Section 34
 was also to have the Courts readily and expeditiously
                      adjudicate upon any proceedings arising out of arbitration proceedings.
                      The challenge to an Award also must be disposed of as expeditiously
                      possible by the Courts.

                      38.   It is clear that the speed and efficiency of disposal of disputes
                      between parties are few of the substantial and key purposes of the
                      introduction, development and promotion of resolving disputes by way of
                      alternate mechanisms of dispute resolution.

                      39.   Hence, the objective, goal and purpose of the Act as well as the
                      intention of the legislature have to be given due consideration while
                      adjudicating a petition under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act.



                      Scope of Powers of Arbitrator & Intervention of Courts

                      40.   The Arbitrator, who in his wisdom, passes an Award, upon
                      conducting the arbitration proceedings with the participation of parties to
                      the dispute, considering the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defence
                      presented by and on behalf of the parties, the relevant documents placed
                      on record by the parties, is considered a Court for the purposes of
                      adjudicating the dispute before him. An unfettered intervention in his
                      functioning would defeat the spirit and purpose of the 
Arbitration Act
, as
                      discussed in the foregoing paragraphs.

                      41.   An Arbitrator has wide powers while adjudicating arbitration
                      proceedings. There is, undoubtedly, a scrutiny on the Arbitrator and the

                      Awards passed by him, which has been stipulated under the 
Arbitration
                      Act
. However, there is a deemed privilege of limited intervention from
                      the Courts which the Arbitrators have. The same has been reiterated by
                      the Hon'ble Supreme Court time and again.

                      42.   There is an extent to the accountability put upon an Arbitrator
                      while passing an Award. This is evident from the fact that with the
                      enforcement of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
, an Arbitrator
                      needs only to adhere to and fulfil the requirements under 
Section 31
 of
                      the Act. The limited requirements under 
Section 31
 are reproduced
                      hereunder:-

                            ―Form and contents of arbitral award. -

                            (1) An arbitral award shall be made in writing and shall be
                            signed by the members of the arbitral tribunal.
                            (2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), in arbitral
                            proceedings with more than one arbitrator, the signatures of
                            the majority of all the members of the arbitral tribunal shall
                            be sufficient so long as the reason for any omitted signature
                            is stated.

                            (3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons upon which it
                            is based, unless--

                                    (a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be
                                    given, or

                                    (b) the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms
                                    under 
section 30
                            (4)
 The arbitral award shall state its date and the place of
                            arbitration as determined in accordance with 
section 20
 and
                            the award shall be deemed to have been made at that place.
                            (5) After the arbitral award is made, a signed copy shall be
                            delivered to each party.

                            with respect to which it may make a final arbitral award. ...‖

                      43.   In addition to the requirements laid down under the provision, an
                      Arbitrator, although acting in accordance with the requirements of the
                      
Arbitration Act
, need not act as a formal Court while adjudicating a
                      dispute and pass an Award which is lengthy, detailed or speaking. The
                      Hon'ble Supreme Court has reiterated that an Award which is not
                      speaking shall be set aside by the Court only in exceptional cases.

In 
Anand Brothers (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors.
, (2014) 9
                      SCC 212, the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the question of a reasoned or
                      speaking Award observed and held as under:-




                            ―7. Before we examine whether the expression ''finding"

 
appearing in Clause 70 would include reasons in support of
                            the conclusion drawn by the arbitrator, we consider it
                            appropriate to refer to the Constitution Bench decision of this
                            Court in 
Raipur Development Authority v. Chokhamal
                            Contractors
 wherein this Court was examining whether an
                            award without giving reasons can be remitted or set aside by
                            the Court in the absence of any stipulation in the arbitral
                            agreement obliging the arbitrator to record his reasons.
                            Answering the question in the negative, this Court held that a
                            nonspeaking award cannot be set aside except in cases where
                            the parties stipulate that the arbitrator shall furnish reasons
                            for his award. This Court held: (SCC pp. 750-51, para 33)
                                   ―33 . ... When the parties to the dispute insist upon
                                   reasons being given, the arbitrator is, as already
                                   observed earlier, under an obligation to give reasons.
                                   But there may be many arbitrations in which parties to
                                   the dispute may not relish the disclosure of the reasons
                                   for the awards. In the circumstances and particularly
                                   having regard to the various reasons given by the

                                  Government to introduce an amendment in the Act
                                  requiring the arbitrators to give reasons for their
                                  awards we feel that it may not be appropriate to take
                                  the view that all awards which do not contain reasons
                                  should either be remitted or set aside.‖
                            Having said that, this Court declared that the Government
                            and their instrumentalities should-as a matter of policy and
                            public interest-if not as a compulsion of law, ensure that
                            whenever they enter into an agreement for resolution of
                            disputes by way of private arbitrations, the requirement of
                            speaking awards is expressly stipulated and ensured. Any
                            laxity in that behalf might lend itself to and, perhaps justify
                            the legitimate criticism, that the Government failed to
                            provide against possible prejudice to public interest.


 
8. The following passage is in this regard apposite: (
Raipur
                            Development Authority
 case, SCC pp. 752-53, para 37)
                                  ―37. There is, however, one aspect of non-speaking
                                  awards in non-statutory arbitrations to which
                                  Government and governmental authorities are parties
                                  that compel attention. The trappings of a body which
                                  discharges judicial functions and is required to act in
                                  accordance with law with their concomitant
                                  obligations for reasoned decisions, are not attracted to
                                  a private adjudication of the nature of arbitration as
                                  the latter, as we have noticed earlier, is not supposed
                                  to exert the State's sovereign judicial power. But
                                  arbitral awards in disputes to which the State and its
                                  instrumentalities are parties affect public interest and
                                  the matter of the manner in which Government and its
                                  instrumentalities allow their interest to be affected by
                                  such arbitral adjudications involve larger questions of
                                  policy and public interest. Government and its
                                  instrumentalities cannot simply allow large financial
                                  interests of the State to be prejudicially affected by
                                  non-reviewable---except in the limited way allowed by
                                  the statute-non-speaking arbitral awards. Indeed, this
                                  branch of the system of dispute resolution has, of late,

                                  acquired a certain degree of notoriety by the manner
                                  in which in many cases the financial interests of
                                  Government have come to suffer by awards which
                                  have raised eyebrows by doubts as to their rectitude
                                  and propriety. It will not be justifiable for
                                  Governments or their instrumentalities to enter into
                                  arbitration agreements which do not expressly
                                  stipulate the rendering of reasoned and speaking
                                  awards. Governments and their instrumentalities
                                  should, as a matter of policy and public interest-if not
                                  as a compulsion of law-ensure that wherever they
                                  enter into agreements for resolution of disputes by
                                  resort to private arbitrations, the requirement of
                                  speaking awards is expressly stipulated and ensured. It
                                  is for Governments and their instrumentalities to
                                  ensure in future this requirement as a matter of policy
                                  in the larger public interest. Any lapse in that behalf
                                  might lend itself to and perhaps justify, the legitimate
                                  criticism that Government failed to provide against
                                  possible prejudice to public interest.‖


                            9. Reference may also be made to the 
Arbitration and
                            Conciliation Act, 1996
 which has repealed the 
Arbitration
                            Act, 1940
 and which seeks to achieve the twin objectives of
                            obliging the Arbitral Tribunal to give reasons for its arbitral
                            award and reducing the supervisory role of courts in
                            arbitration proceedings. 
Section 31(3)
 of the said Act obliges
                            the Arbitral Tribunal to state the reasons upon which it is
                            based unless the parties have agreed that no reasons be
                            given or the arbitral award is based on consent of the
                            parties. There is, therefore, a paradigm shift in the legal
                            position under the new Act which prescribes a uniform
                            requirement for the arbitrators to give reasons except in the
                            two situations mentioned above. The change in the legal
                            approach towards arbitration as an alternative dispute
                            resolution mechanism is perceptible both in regard to the
                            requirement of giving reasons and the scope of interference
                            by the court with arbitral awards. While in regard to
                            requirement of giving reasons the law has brought in

                            dimensions not found under the old Act, the scope of
                            interference appears to be shrinking in its amplitude, no
                            matter judicial pronouncements at time appear to be heading
                            towards a more expansive approach that may appear to some
                            to be opening up areas for judicial review on newer grounds
                            falling under the caption ―public policy‖ appearing in
                            
Section 34
 of the Act. We are referring to these developments
                            for it is one of the well-known canons of interpretation of
                            statutes that when an earlier enactment is truly ambiguous in
                            that it is equally open to diverse meanings, the later
                            enactment may in certain circumstances serve as the
                            parliamentary exposition of the former.

                            14. It is trite that a finding can be both: a finding of fact or a
                            finding of law. It may even be a finding on a mixed question
                            of law and fact. In the case of a finding on a legal issue the
                            arbitrator may on facts that are proved or admitted explore
                            his options and lay bare the process by which he arrives at
                            any such finding. It is only when the conclusion is supported
                            by reasons on which it is based that one can logically
                            describe the process as tantamount to recording a finding. It
                            is immaterial whether the reasons given in support of the
                            conclusion are sound or erroneous. That is because a
                            conclusion supported by reasons would constitute a "finding"

                            no matter the conclusion or the reasons in support of the
                            same may themselves be erroneous on facts or in law. It may
                            then be an erroneous finding but it would nonetheless be a
                            finding. What is important is that a finding presupposes
                            application of mind. Application of mind is best
                            demonstrated by disclosure of the mind; mind in turn is best
                            disclosed by recording reasons. That is the soul of every
                            adjudicatory process which affects the rights of the
                            parties....‖

                      45.   Therefore, while considering a challenge to an Arbitral Award
                      where private parties are involved, the Court need not examine the
                      validity of the findings or the reasoning behind the findings given by an
                      Arbitrator. The extent to which a Court may exercise supervisory powers

                      conclusion drawn therein is supported by findings and not whether the
                      findings themselves are erroneous or sound.

                      46.   It has also been reiterated that, while adjudicating a challenge
                      under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act, the Courts must limit themselves
                      to examining the Award itself and not the facts of the case. A Court shall
                      not conduct a roving enquiry into the facts and evidence of the matter and
                      neither shall the Court sit in appeal against the Award of the Arbitrator.

In 
UHL Power Co. Ltd. vs. State of Himachal Pradesh
, (2022) 4
                      SCC 116, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the narrow scope under
                      
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act and held as under:-




                            ―16. As it is, the jurisdiction conferred on courts under
                            
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act is fairly narrow, when it
                            comes to the scope of an appeal under 
Section 37
 of the
                            Arbitration Act, the jurisdiction of an appellate court in
                            examining an order, setting aside or refusing to set aside an
                            award, is all the more circumscribed.

Section 34

                                   ―11. As far as 
Section 34
 is concerned, the position is
                                   well-settled by now that the Court does not sit in
                                   appeal over the arbitral award and may interfere on
                                   merits on the limited ground provided under

                                   patent illegality in the arbitral award. Additionally, the
                                   concept of the "fundamental policy of Indian law"


                                   would cover compliance with statutes and judicial

17. A similar view, as stated above, has been taken by this
                            Court in 
K. Sugumar v. Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.
 7,
                            wherein it has been observed as follows: (SCC p. 540, para


                            2)
                                   ―2. The contours of the power of the Court under
                                   
Section 34
 of the Act are too well established to
                                   require any reiteration. Even a bare reading of 
Section
                                   34
 of the Act indicates the highly constricted power of
                                   the civil court to interfere with an arbitral award. The
                                   reason for this is obvious. When parties have chosen to
                                   avail an alternate mechanism for dispute resolution,
                                   they must be left to reconcile themselves to the wisdom
                                   of the decision of the arbitrator and the role of the
                                   court should be restricted to the bare minimum.

                                   Interference will be justified only in cases of
                                   commission of misconduct by the arbitrator which can
                                   find manifestation in different forms including exercise
                                   of legal perversity by the arbitrator.‖

                            reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to a
                            conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter,

State of Jharkhand vs. HSS Integrated DSN

                      than one plausible views and the Arbitrator, in his wisdom, adopts one of
                      them, having given reasons for his findings, the Courts shall not interfere
                      with such an Award. It was observed as under:-


                            ―6.1. In Progressive-MVR3, after considering the catena of
                            decisions of this Court on the scope and ambit of the
                            proceedings under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act, this
                            Court has observed and held that even when the view taken
                            by the arbitrator is a plausible view, and/or when two views
                            are possible, a particular view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal
                            which is also reasonable should not be interfered with in a
                            proceeding under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act.
                            6.2. In Datar Switchgear Ltd., this Court has observed and
                            held that the Arbitral Tribunal is the master of evidence and
                            the findings of fact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on
                            the basis of the evidence on record are not to be scrutinised

                            judgment, it is observed and held as under: (SCC pp. 169-70)
                                   ―51. ..... The proposition of law that the Arbitral

                      50.   Hence, the law which has been settled by the Hon'ble Supreme
                      Court is that the scope of interference with an Arbitral Award under
                      
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act is fairly limited and narrow. The Courts
                      shall not sit in an appeal while adjudicating a challenge to an Award
                      which is passed by an Arbitrator, the master of evidence, after due
                      consideration after facts, circumstances, evidence and material before
                      him. Therefore, it is clear that this Court shall also limit itself to the
                      Award in question and not re-appreciate evidence and all material before
                      the Arbitrator.

                      ANALYSIS

                      51.   Upon perusal of the pleadings and hearing the parties at length, this
                      Court opines that the controversy between the parties qua the impugned
                      Award may be narrowed down to adjudicate the following issues:

                                i.   Whether the Learned Sole Arbitrator went beyond its
                                     jurisdiction by holding that the Agreement dated 23rd March
                                     2001 is a Determinable Agreement.

                               ii.   Whether the impugned Award is patently illegal and in
                                     conflict with the Public Policy of India.
                      Issue no. 1

                      52.   The impugned findings of Arbitrator on the question of agreement

                           plea of the learned counsel for the Claimant that 
Section
                           14(1)(c)
 is not at all attracted to the facts of the case.

                           48. In order to appreciate the contentions of learned counsel for
                           the parties, it will be necessary to extract clauses 9.1 and 9.2 of
                           the agreement:



                                 9.1 At the Option of the Lessee

                                 The Lessee may any time during the term hereof
                                 terminate this agreement at its sole option by a 60-day
                                 written notice.



                                 The Lessee shall not be liable to pay or incur any
                                 charges, costs or expenses or for any incidental,
                                 consequential, direct. or indirect damages including
                                 loss of opportunity or anticipated profits.



                                 9.2 Termination due to default of Lessor

                                  The Lessee may terminate this agreement by a 30 day
                                  written notice due to failure of the Lessor to adhere to
                                  any of its obligations under this Agreement. In such an
                                  event the Lessee shall not be liable to pay or incur any
                                  payment; compensation charges, costs of expenses or
                                  for any incidental, consequential, direct or indirect
                                  damages including loss of opportunity of anticipated
                                  profits.

                                  In the event this Agreement is terminated in terms of
                                  either clauses 9.1. or 9.2 the Lessor undertakes to
                                  buyback the Building at the book value from the
                                  Lessee.

                           49. As is evident from the aforesaid clauses the agreement is
                           terminable at the option of the Lessee. Question that arises for
                           consideration is whether such an agreement which is
                           determinable can be enforced. The answer to the question lies
                           in 
Section 14
 of the Act...

                           50. According to sub-
section 1
 of 
Section 14
, agreements that
                           fall within the ambit of any of its sub-clauses cannot be

                            enforced. In the instant proceeding the Claimant seeks an
                            award in its favour and against the Respondent for specific
                            performance of the agreement to sell land admeasuring 1200
                            Sq. Meters and a three storied Building standing thereon shorn
                            of details the Claimant seeks specific performance of a
                            determinable contract. Since the agreement is determinable it
                            attracts clause c of sub 
section 1
 of 
section 14
. This being so, as
                            per the mandate of the provision, the agreement cannot be
                            specifically enforced.‖


                      53.   Upon a bare perusal of the impugned Arbitral Award, this Court is
                      of the opinion that the Learned Sole Arbitrator has correctly deduced its
                      findings while passing the Arbitral Award and has correctly interpreted
                      the terms of Agreement dated 23rd March 2001.

                      54.   In any case, 
Section 14(1)
 of the Act prior to amendment and as
                      applicable to the instant case, clearly delineates the contracts which
                      cannot be specifically enforced, and under 
Section 14(1)(c)
, specific
                      performance cannot be granted in a contract which is determinable in
                      nature.

                      55.   As rightly observed by the Learned Arbitrator and in view of
                      clauses 9.1 and 9.2 of the Agreement, the same is determinable at the
                      option of the lessee. Therefore, the findings of the learned arbitrator on
                      the question of agreement being determinable do not suffer from any
                      illegality whatsoever.

                      56.   Issue No. 1 stands adjudicated accordingly.

                      suffers from patent illegality, contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian
                      Law. The law regarding patent illegality and public policy of India is no
                      more res integra and has been authoritatively clarified by the Hon'ble
                      Supreme Court in a number of judicial pronouncements.

                      58.   Since, it has been settled that the scope of interference under
                      
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act is limited, it is now pertinent to see the
                      considerations that are to be considered while adjudicating upon a
                      challenge and in what circumstances may an Award may be set aside.

                      59.   On a bare reading of the invoked provision 
Section 34
 of the
                      Arbitration Act as quoted above, it has become evident the words used
                      therein are that "An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if",
                      which signifies the intent of limiting the scope of interference by Courts
                      in an Arbitral Award, passed after thorough procedure, involvement of
                      parties, and appreciation of facts, evidence and law, "only" in the event of
                      the circumstances delineated in the provision being met. The limited
                      grounds which may invite the intervention and action thereupon by the
                      Courts are explicitly laid down under the provision. What is to be seen by
                      a Court exercising jurisdiction under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act is
                      that an Award passed by an Arbitral Tribunal may only be set aside if it is
                      patently illegal, against the public policy of India, based on no evidence
                      and delineates no reason for passing the Award.

                      60.   The petitioner has raised the ground of patent illegality as well as
                      contravention to public policy while impugning the Award dated 4th
                      October 2018.

                           ―90. The validity of Rule 6.2.4 as amended can be examined
                           also from the standpoint of its being opposed to "public
                           policy". But for doing so we need to first examine what is
                           meant by "public policy" as it is understood in legal
                           parlance. The expression has been used in 
Section 23
 of the
                           Contract Act, 1872 and in 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration and
                           Conciliation Act, 1996 and host of other statutes but has not
                           been given any precise definition primarily because the
                           expression represents a dynamic concept and is, therefore,
                           incapable of any straitjacket definition, meaning or
                           explanation. That has not, however, deterred jurists and
                           courts from explaining the expression from very early times.

 
91. Mathew, J. speaking for the Court in 
Murlidhar
                           Aggarwal v. State of U.P.
 27 referred to Winfield's definition
                           in Public Policy in English Common Law 42 Harvard Law
                           Review 76 to declare that: (SCC p. 482, para 31)
                                 ―31. Public policy does not remain static in any given
                                 community. It may vary from generation to generation
                                 and even in the same generation. Public policy would
                                 be almost useless if it were to remain in fixed moulds
                                 for all time.‖


                           92. The Court then grappled with the problem of ascertaining
                           public policy if the same is variable and depends on the
                           welfare of the community and observed: (Murlidhar
                           Aggarwal case27 , SCC pp. 482-83, para 32)
                                 ―3 2. If it is variable, if it depends on the welfare of the
                                 community at any given time, how are the courts to
                                 ascertain it? The Judges are more to be trusted as
                                 interpreters of the law than as expounders of public
                                 policy. However, there is no alternative under our
                                 system but to vest this power with Judges. The
                                 difficulty of discovering what public policy is at any
                                 given moment certainly does not absolve the Judges
                                 from the duty of doing so. In conducting an enquiry, as
                                 already stated, Judges are not hidebound by
                                 precedent. The Judges must look beyond the narrow
                                 field of past precedents, though this still leaves open

                                  the question, in which direction they must cast their
                                  gaze. The Judges are to base their decisions on the
                                  opinions of men of the world, as distinguished from
                                  opinions based on legal learning. In other words, the
                                  Judges will have to look beyond the jurisprudence and
                                  that in so doing, they must consult not their own
                                  personal standards or predilections but those of the
                                  dominant opinion at a given moment, or what has been
                                  termed customary morality. The Judges must consider
                                  the social consequences of the rule propounded,
                                  especially in the light of the factual evidence available
                                  as to its probable results. Of course, it is not to be
                                  expected that men of the world are to be subpoenaed
                                  as expert witnesses in the trial of every action raising
                                  a question of public policy. It is not open to the Judges
                                  to make a sort of referendum or hear evidence or
                                  conduct an inquiry as to the prevailing moral concept.

                                  Such an extended extra-judicial enquiry is wholly
                                  outside the tradition of courts where the tendency is to
                                  'trust the Judge to be a typical representative of his
                                  day and generation'. Our law relies, on the implied
                                  insight of the Judge on such matters. It is the Judges
                                  themselves, assisted by the Bar, who here represent the
                                  highest common factor of public sentiment and
                                  intelligence. No doubt, there is no assurance that
                                  Judges will interpret the mores* of their day more
                                  wisely and truly than other men. But this is beside the
                                  point. The point is rather that this power must be
                                  lodged somewhere and under our Constitution and
                                  laws, it has been lodged in the Judges and if they have
                                  to fulfil their function as Judges, it could hardly be
                                  lodged elsewhere.‖

                            18, para 92)
                                  ―92. . . . Public policy, however, is not the policy of a
                                  particular Government. It connotes some matter which
                                  concerns the public good and the public interest. The
                                  concept of what is for the public good or in the public
                                  interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the
                                  public good or the public interest has varied from time
                                  to time. As new concepts take the place of old,
                                  transactions which were once considered against
                                  public policy are now being upheld by the courts and
                                  similarly where there has been a well recognised head
                                  of public policy, the courts have not shirked from
                                  extending it to new transactions and changed
                                  circumstances and have at times not even flinched
                                  from inventing a new head of public policy ....
                                  It is thus clear that the principles governing public
                                  policy must be and are capable, on proper occasion, of
                                  expansion or modification. Practices which were
                                  considered perfectly normal at one time have today
                                  become obnoxious and oppressive to public
                                  conscience. If there is no head of public policy which
                                  covers a case, then the court must in consonance with
                                  public conscience and in keeping with public good and
                                  public interest declare such practice to be opposed to
                                  public policy. Above all, in deciding any case which
                                  may not be covered by authority our courts have
                                  before them the beacon light of the Preamble to the
                                  Constitution. Lacking precedent, the court can always
                                  be guided by that light and the principles underlying
                                  the fundamental rights and the directive principles
                                  enshrined in our Constitution.‖

                            94. We may also refer to the decision of this Court in ONGC
                            Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd., wherein this Court was considering

                            India" as a ground for setting aside an arbitral award.

                            "public policy of India" appearing in the Act aforementioned
                            must be given a liberal meaning for otherwise resolution of
                            disputes by resort to arbitration proceedings will get
                            frustrated because patently illegal awards would remain
                            immune to court's interference. This Court declared that
                            what was against public good and public interest cannot be
                            held to be consistent with public policy. The following
                            passage aptly summed up the approach to be adopted in the
                            matter: (Saw Pipes Ltd. case, SCC pp. 727-28, para 31)
                                  ―31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase 'public policy
                                  of India' used in 
Section 34
 in context is required to be
                                  given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the
                                  concept of public policy connotes some matter which
                                  concerns public good and the public interest. What is
                                  for public good or in public interest or what would be
                                  injurious or harmful to the public good or public
                                  interest has varied from time to time. However, the
                                  award which is, on the face of it, patently in violation
                                  of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public
                                  interest. Such award/judgment/decision is likely to
                                  adversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in
                                  our view in addition to narrower meaning given to the
                                  term 'public policy' in Renusagar case it is required to
                                  be held that the award could be set aside if it is
                                  patently illegal. The result would be-award could be
                                  set aside if it is contrary to:

                                  (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or

                                  (b) the interest of India; or

                                  (c) justice or morality, or

                                  (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.

                                  Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the
                                  illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that
                                  award is against the public policy. Award could also
                                  be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it
                                  shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is

                            95. In ONGC Ltd. v. Western GECO International Ltd., this
                            Court was examining the meaning of "fundamental policy of
                            Indian law", an expression used by this Court in Saw Pipes
                            case. Extending the frontiers of what will constitute "public
                            policy of India" this Court observed: (Western GECO
                            International Ltd. case , SCC pp. 278-80, paras 35 & 38-39)
                                  ―35. What then would constitute the 'fundamental
                                  policy of Indian law' is the question. The decision in
                                  ONGC does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the
                                  expression must, in our opinion, include all such
                                  fundamental principles as providing a basis for
                                  administration of justice a and enforcement of law in
                                  this country. Without meaning to exhaustively
                                  enumerate the purport of the expression 'fundamental
                                  policy of Indian law', we may refer to three distinct
                                  and fundamental juristic principles that must
                                  necessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the
                                  fundamental policy of Indian law. The first and
                                  foremost is the principle that in every determination
                                  whether by a court or other authority that affects the
                                  rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences,
                                  the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt
                                  what is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach'
                                  in the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach
                                  arises from the very nature of the power exercised by
                                  the court or the authority does not have to be
                                  separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora
                                  concerned. What must be remembered is that the
                                  importance of a judicial approach in judicial and
                                  quasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so
                                  long as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising
                                  powers that affect the rights or obligations of the
                                  parties before them shows fidelity to judicial
                                  approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious
                                  or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that
                                  the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject

                                 in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its
                                 decision is not actuated by any extraneous
                                 consideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as
                                 a check against flaws and faults that can render the
                                 decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to
                                 challenge.

                                 38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the
                                 policy of Indian law is the principle that a court and so
                                 also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining
                                 the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in
                                 accordance with the principles of natural justice.
                                 Besides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of
                                 the facets of the principles of natural justice is that the
                                 court/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind
                                 to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a
                                 view one way or the other. Non-application of mind is
                                 a defect that is fatal to any adjudication. Application
                                 of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind
                                 and disclosure of mind is best done by recording
                                 reasons in support of the decision which the court or
                                 authority is taking. The requirement that an
                                 adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that
                                 view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it
                                 can be described as a fundamental policy of Indian
                                 law.

                                 39. No less important is the principle now recognised
                                 as a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative
                                 law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational
                                 that no reasonable person would have arrived at the
                                 same will not be sustained in a court of law. Perversity
                                 or irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone
                                 of Wednesbury Principle of reasonableness. Decisions
                                 that fall short of the standards of reasonableness are
                                 open to challenge in a court of law often in writ
                                 jurisdiction of the superior courts but no less in

                            96. To sum up: public policy is not a static concept. It varies
                            with times and from generation to generation. But what is in
                            public good and public interest cannot be opposed to public
                            policy and vice versa. Fundamental Policy of Law would also
                            constitute a facet of public policy. This would imply that all
                            those principles of law that ensure justice, fair play and
                            bring transparency and objectivity and promote probity in
                            the discharge of public functions would also constitute public
                            policy. Conversely, any deviation, abrogation, frustration or
                            negation of the salutary principles of justice, fairness, good
                            conscience, equity and objectivity will be opposed to public
                            policy. It follows that any rule, contract or arrangement that
                            actually defeats or tends to defeat the high ideals of fairness
                            and objectivity in the discharge of public functions no matter
                            by a private non-governmental body will be opposed to
                            public policy. ....‖

 
62.   While discussing the fundamentals of patent illegality, the Hon'ble

State of Chhattisgarh vs. Sal Udyog (P) Ltd.
, (2022) 2

―14. The law on interference in matters of awards under the
                            1996 Act has been circumscribed with the object of
                            minimising interference by courts in arbitration matters. One
                            of the grounds on which an award may be set aside is "patent
                            illegality". What would constitute "patent illegality" has been
                            elaborated in 
Associate Builders v. DDA
, where "patent
                            illegality" that broadly falls under the head of "Public
                            Policy", has been divided into three sub-heads in the
                            following words: (SCC p. 81, para 42)
                                  ―42. In the 1996 Act, this principle is substituted by
                                  the "patent illegality" principle which, in turn,
                                  contains three sub-heads:


                                  42.1. (a) A contravention of the substantive law of
                                  India would result in the death knell of an arbitral
                                  award. This must be understood in the sense that such
                                  illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot

                                 be of a trivial nature. This again is really a
                                 contravention of 
Section 28
(1 )(a) of the Act, which
                                 reads as under:

                                       Where the place of arbitration is situated in
                                       lndia,-

                                       (a) in an arbitration other than an international
                                       commercial arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal
                                       shall decide the dispute submitted to arbitration
                                       in accordance with the substantive law for the

                                 42.2. (b) A contravention of the 
Arbitration Act
 itself
                                 would be regarded as a patent illegality - for example
                                 if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in
                                 contravention of 
Section 31 (3)
 of the Act, such award
                                 will be liable to be set aside.

                                 42.3. (c) Equally, the third sub-head of patent illegality
                                 is really a contravention of 
Section 28
( 3) of the
                                 
Arbitration Act
, which reads as under:

                                       '28. Rules applicable to substance of dispute.-

                                       of the trade applicable to the transaction.'

                           15. In Ssangyong Engg. & Construction Co. Ltd. v. NHAJ9,
                           speaking for the Bench, R.F. Nariman, J. has spelt out the
                           contours of the limited scope of judicial interference in
                           reviewing the arbitral awards under the 1996 Act and
                           observed thus: (SCC pp. 169-71, paras 34-41)
                                 "34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression
                                 "public policy of India", whether contained in 
Section
                                 34
 or in 
Section 48
, would now mean the "fundamental
                                 policy of Indian law" as explained in paras 18 and 27
                                 of Associate Builders8 i.e. the fundamental policy of

                                 Indian law would be relegated to "Renusagar"

                                 understanding of this expression. This would
                                 necessarily mean that Western Geco expansion has
                                 been done away with. In short, Western Geco, as
                                 explained in paras 28 and 29 of Associate Builders,
                                 would no longer obtain, as under the guise of
                                 interfering with an award on the ground that the
                                 arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the
                                 Court's intervention would be on the merits of the
                                 award, which cannot be permitted post amendment.
                                 However, insofar as principles of natural justice are
                                 concerned, as contained in 
Sections 18
 and
                                 
34(2)(a)(iii)
 of the 1996 Act, these continue to be
                                 grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in
                                 para 30 of Associate Builders.

                                 35. It is important to notice that the ground for
                                 interference insofar as it concerns "interest of India"

                                 has since been deleted, and therefore, no longer
                                 obtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the
                                 basis that the award is in conflict with justice or
                                 morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the
                                 "most basic notions of morality or justice". This again
                                 would be in line with paras 36 to 39 of Associate
                                 Builders , as it is only such arbitral awards that shock
                                 the conscience of the court that can be set aside on this
                                 ground.

                                 36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now
                                 constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is
                                 contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as
                                 understood in paras 18 and 27 of Associate Builders,
                                 or secondly, that such award is against basic notions
                                 of justice or morality as understood in paras 36 to 39
                                 of Associate Builders8. Explanation 2 to

                                 was added by the Amendment Act only so that Western

                                 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away with.

                                 37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are
                                 concerned, an additional ground is now available
                                 under sub-section (2-A), added by the Amendment Act,
                                 2015, to 
Section 34
. Here, there must be patent
                                 illegality appearing on the face of the award, which
                                 refers to such illegality as goes to the root of the
                                 matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous
                                 application of the law. In short, what is not subsumed
                                 within "the fundamental policy of Indian law", namely,
                                 the contravention of a statute not linked to public
                                 policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the
                                 backdoor when it comes to setting aside an award on
                                 the ground of patent illegality.

                                 38. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation
                                 of evidence, which is what an appellate court is
                                 permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground
                                 of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award.

                                 39. To elucidate, para 42.1 of Associate Builders,
                                 namely, a mere contravention of the substantive law of
                                 India, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set
                                 aside an arbitral award. Para 42.2 of Associate
                                 Builders8, however, would remain, for if an arbitrator
                                 gives no reasons for an award and contravenes 
Section
                                 31(3)
 of the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to a
                                 patent illegality on the face of the award.

                                 40. The change made in 
Section 28
( 3) by the
                                 Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paras
                                 42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders, namely, that the
                                 construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for
                                 an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes
                                 the contract in a manner that no fair-minded or
                                 reasonable person would; in short, that the arbitrator's
                                 view is not even a possible view to take. Also, if the
                                 arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with
                                 matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of
                                 jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now fall
                                 within the new ground added under 
Section 34
(2-A).

                                 41. What is important to note is that a decision which
                                 is perverse, as understood in paras 31 and 32 of
                                 Associate Builders8, while no longer being a ground
                                 for challenge under "public policy of India", would
                                 certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on
                                 the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no
                                 evidence at all or an award which ignores vital
                                 evidence in arriving at its decision would be perverse
                                 and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent
                                 illegality. Additionally, a finding based on documents
                                 taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator
                                 would also qualify as a decision based on no evidence
                                 inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led
                                 by the parties, and therefore, would also have to be
                                 characterised as perverse."

                           16. In Delhi Airport Metro Express (P) Ltd. referring to the
                           facets of patent illegality, this Court has held as under: (SCC
                           p. 150, para 29)
                                 "29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to
                                 the root of the matter. In other words, every error of
                                 law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would not fall
                                 within the expression "patent illegality". Likewise,
                                 erroneous application of law cannot be categorised as
                                 patent illegality. In addition, contravention of law not
                                 linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the
                                 scope of the expression "patent illegality". What is
                                 prohibited is for Courts to reappreciate evidence to
                                 conclude that the award suffers from patent illegality
                                 appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do not
                                 sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The
                                 permissible grounds for interference with a domestic
                                 award under 
Section 34
(2-A) on the ground of patent
                                 illegality is when the arbitrator takes a view which is
                                 not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the
                                 contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or
                                 reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits
                                 an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the

                                 An arbitral award stating no reasons for its findings
                                 would make itself susceptible to challenge on this
                                 account. The conclusions of the arbitrator which are
                                 based on no evidence or have been arrived at by
                                 ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be set
                                 aside on the ground of patent illegality. Also,
                                 consideration of documents which are not supplied to
                                 the other party is a facet of perversity falling within the
                                 expression "patent illegality".‖

                      63.   The abovementioned precedents have settled the position of a
                      challenge to an Arbitral Award. The facets under 
Section 34
 of the
                      Arbitration Act, specifically under Sub-
section 2
, provide the limited
                      purview of such a challenge.

                      64.   In order to set aside an Award under 
Section 34
 the petitioner must
                      show that illegality which has been alleged goes to the root of the matter
                      and is not an illegality of trivial nature. In failure of the same the
                      impugned Award cannot be held to be against the public policy. Award
                      could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the
                      conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is
                      required to be adjudged void.

                      65.   To argue that the impugned Award before this Court is liable to set
                      aside in the instant petition it has been argued that the findings of the
                      learned Arbitrator are patently illegal and against the fundamental policy
                      of India. As stipulated by the aforementioned precedents, the words are
                      not to be construed in their plain meaning, but the essence to be
                      appreciated while adjudicating a challenge under 
Section 34
 of the
                      Arbitration Act is that the illegalities or deficiencies are such that they are
                      apparent on the face of record and/or shock the conscience of the Court
                      and can in no manner be sustained. In the case at hand, the petitioner has

                      not been able to show that the impugned Award suffers from such
                      illegality that is apparent on the face of record and upholding the same
                      would be against the law.

                      66.   A clear reading of the precedents cited proves that under the
                      limited scope of 
Section 34
, the present case does not warrant the
                      interference of this Court, as the grounds stated by the petitioner in the
                      instant petition do not meet the scope of this section. Accordingly, with
                      reference to the aforesaid judgments and the impugned Arbitral Award,
                      the Petitioner cannot have the benefit of the "ground of patent illegality"

                      to assail the impugned Arbitral Award under 
Section 34
 of the Act, 1996.

                      67.   Reiterating as previously observed, "patent illegality" is an
                      illegality that goes to the root of the matter but excludes the erroneous
                      application of the law by an arbitral tribunal or re-appreciation of
                      evidence by an appellate court. In this instant case, the Arbitral Award
                      was a well-reasoned award, with the findings being clearly arrived at
                      based on all the documents/evidence on record.

                      68.   The learned Arbitrator has clearly considered Statement of Claim
                      relevant Clauses of the Terms of the Agreement to Sell dated 23 rd March
                      2001 and the ground that the Learned Sole Arbitrator has passed the
                      Arbitral Award which is beyond the scope of its jurisdiction does not
                      stand validated as per the submissions of the Petitioner and under the
                      observation of the Court. The impugned Award is in no way in
                      contravention of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
, to reason
                      that the Award is patently illegal.

                      69.   Therefore, as regards to Issue No. II, this Court is of the considered
                      view that the petitioner has not been able to show that the grounds laid

                      under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act for setting aside the impugned
                      Award are made out on behalf of the petitioner. None of the impugned
                      findings of the learned Arbitrator is such that it shows that the impugned
                      Award is patently illegal to shock the conscience of the Court, against
                      public policy or fundamental policy of India or falls under the grounds
                      laid down in 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act.
                      CONCLUSION

                      70.    In the lights of facts, submissions and contentions in the pleadings,
                      this Court find that the petitioner has failed to substantiate its grounds for
                      setting aside the impugned Arbitral Award on the ground that the Learned
                      Sole Arbitrator went beyond its jurisdiction by holding that the
                      Agreement is a Determinable Agreement and is patently illegal. The
                      Court is of the view that the Learned Sole Arbitrator was well within its
                      jurisdiction to declare the Agreement dated 23rd March 2001 as
                      Determinable Agreement in the view of Statement of Claim of the
                      respondent and Terms of the said Agreement.

                      71.    It is settled law that the ground of Patent illegality gives way to
                      setting aside an Arbitral Award with a very minimal scope of
                      intervention. A party cannot simply raise an objection on the ground of
                      patent illegality if the Award is simply against them. Patent illegality
                      requires a distinct transgression of law, the clear lack of which thereof
                      makes the petition simply a pointless effort of objection towards an
                      Award made by a competent Arbitral Tribunal. Further, the petitioner has
                      not been able to prove that the impugned Arbitral Award is patently
                      illegal, and contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian Law, and hence
                      is liable to be set aside.

                      72.   Therefore, after consideration of the material on record, including
                      the impugned Arbitral Award, submissions on behalf of the parties this
                      Court is of the view that there is no finding or conclusion reached by the
                      learned Arbitrator which warrants interference of this Court. The
                      petitioner has not been able to substantiate her case for setting aside of
                      the impugned Award.

                      73.   Accordingly, the instant petition is dismissed since there is no
                      cogent reason to set aside the impugned Award.

                      74.   Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.

                      75.   The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.
