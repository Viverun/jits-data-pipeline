                                        And
             In Re : Amiyo Biswas & Anr.                        ........ petitioners

                   Mr. Amanul Islam
                   Mr. Sourav Mukherjee
                                              ...... for the petitioners
                   Mr. Arijit Ganguly
                   Ms. Yantika Roy
                                          ...... for the State
                   Mr. Kalyan Kr. Bhattacharjee
                   Ms. Sahina Khatun
                                          ...... for the de facto complainant


                1.
 Petitioners are in custody for 57 days. There is delay in

             lodging FIR. They pray for bail.



                2. Learned lawyer for the State and the de facto complainant

             oppose the bail prayer.



                3. We have considered the materials on record. Statement of the

             victim implicates petitioner no. 2 in the offence of attempting to

             rape her. Hence, we are not inclined to grant bail to him.


                4. Allegations against petitioner no. 1-husband are general and

             omnibus. Keeping in mind the extent of complicity of petitioner no.

             1 in the crime, we are inclined to grant bail to him.


                5. Accordingly, the petitioner no. 1 viz. Amiyo Biswas be

             released on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000/- with two

             sureties of like amount each, one of whom must be local to the

             satisfaction of the learned CJM Nadia at Krishnagar on condition

             that the petitioner no. 1 shall appear before the trial court on every

                                     2





date of hearing and shall not intimidate witnesses or tamper with

evidence in any manner whatsoever.



   6. In the event he fails to appear before the trial court without

justifiable cause, the trial court shall be at liberty to cancel his bail

automatically without reference to this court.


   7. The application being CRM (DB) 568 of 2024 is disposed of.
