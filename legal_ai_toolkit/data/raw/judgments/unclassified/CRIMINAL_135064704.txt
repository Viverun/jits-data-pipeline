                          SANJEEV NARULA, J.:



                          1.       This application under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha
                          Sanhita, 20231 seeks regular bail in case FIR No. 564/2023 registered under

                          2.       The case of the prosecution, in brief, is as follows:

                          2.1.     The marriage between the Applicant and the deceased Shivani was
                          solemnized on 08th December, 2022. On 03rd June, 2023, information was

                           received from Dr. BSA Hospital that Shivani had been brought dead with an
                          alleged history of hanging.

                          2.2.   Proceedings under 
Section 176
 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
                          19733 were conducted by the executive magistrate. In the course of these
                          proceedings, Shivani's father alleged that the Applicant and his family
                          subjected her to dowry-related cruelty, which drove her to commit suicide.
                          On this basis, the present FIR came to be registered.

                          2.3.   The complainant handed over certain photographs and an audio clip
                          purportedly sent by the deceased, in which she is stated to have complained
                          of harassment and beatings by the Applicant.

                          2.4.   The Applicant was arrested on 06th June, 2023. All the co-accused
                          have been granted anticipatory bail. Investigation in the case stands
                          concluded and chargesheet has been filed.

                          SUBMISSIONS

                          3.     Mr. Manoj Kumar Duggal, counsel for the Applicant submits that the
                          Applicant has been falsely implicated. It is contended that the material relied
                          upon by the prosecution, including the audio recording and photographs
                          attributed to the deceased, does not disclose any specific demand for dowry
                          and, at best, indicates ordinary marital discord or allegations of quarrels and
                          beatings. On this basis, it is urged that the foundational requirements of
                          
Sections 304B
 and 
498A
 IPC are not met, as there is no material to establish
                          a proximate or live link between any alleged acts of cruelty and the death in
                          question. It is further submitted that the Applicant has remained in custody
                          for more than two years; the investigation stands concluded; chargesheet has
                          already been filed; and no further custodial interrogation is required. Thus,

                           continued incarceration of the Applicant would be unjustified in these
                          circumstances. It is also emphasised that all co-accused family members
                          have been granted anticipatory bail.

                          4.         Mr. Yudhvir Singh Chauhan, APP for the State, opposes the
                          application. He submits that the case concerns the unnatural death of a
                          young woman within the first seven years of marriage, attracting the rigours
                          of 
Sections 304B
 and 
498A
 IPC. He points out that the prosecution material,
                          including the voice recording and photographs, depicts sustained harassment
                          and physical violence, and that the complainant has made categorical
                          allegations of dowry demands by the Applicant and his family members. On
                          this basis, it is urged that the ingredients of the aforesaid offences are prima
                          facie satisfied. He further submits that the co-accused who have been
                          granted anticipatory bail are not similarly situated, as they are in-laws,
                          whereas the Applicant is the husband of the deceased and the central figure
                          in the allegations. Mr. Chauhan also raises a concern that if released, the
                          Applicant may attempt to threaten or intimidate the complainant or the
                          family of the deceased out of anger or a sense of reprisal, thereby posing a
                          risk to their safety and to the fairness of the trial.

                          ANALYSIS

                          5.         This Court has considered the rival submissions and examined the
                          material placed on record, including the transcript of the audio recording
                          relied upon by the prosecution. The Applicant stands charged, inter alia,
                          under 
Section 304B
 IPC, which creates a distinct offence of 'dowry death'
                          and is complemented by the statutory presumption under Section 113B of

                           the 
Indian Evidence Act, 1872
.4 For this presumption to operate, the
                          prosecution must establish, at least prima facie, that: (i) the death of a
                          woman occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances; (ii) such death
                          took place within seven years of marriage; and (iii) soon before her death,
                          she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives,
                          in connection with any demand for dowry. Once these foundational facts are
                          established, the law permits a presumption that the husband or his relatives
                          caused the dowry death.

                          6.        In the present case, the first two elements are, at this stage, not in
                          dispute. The marriage took place on 8th December 2022 and the death
                          occurred on 3rd June 2023, in circumstances recorded as an alleged case of
                          hanging. The real controversy, even at the threshold, concerns the third
                          requirement, namely whether there is material to suggest that the deceased
                          was subjected to cruelty or harassment 'soon before her death' in connection
                          with any dowry demand.

                          7.        The prosecution places reliance on (i) the statement of the deceased's
                          father recorded during inquest proceedings under 
Section 176
 Cr.P.C., and

                          (ii) certain photographs and an audio clip said to have been sent by the
                          deceased. At this stage, the Court refrains from commenting on the
                          evidentiary weight of this material. However, on a prima facie reading of the
                          transcript of the audio clip, as also acknowledged by the prosecution, does
                          not reveal dowry related demands. The transcript reflects quarrels and
                          allegations of beatings, but it does not contain any clear or specific reference
                          to dowry demand by the Applicant. There is also no prior complaint or
                          report lodged with the police or any other authority regarding dowry demand

                           before the inquest statement was recorded. Thus, whether the general
                          allegations of cruelty or harassment adverted to by the complainant and the
                          material relied upon by the prosecution meet the statutory threshold of
                          'cruelty in connection with dowry' and 'soon before her death' for the
                          purposes of 
Sections 304B
 and 
498A
 IPC is a matter that will require full-
                          fledged evidence and cross-examination at trial. At the stage of considering
                          bail, the Court is not expected to conduct a mini-trial or render any
                          conclusive finding on the applicability of the presumption under 
Section
                          113B
 of the Evidence Act.

                          8.    As per the nominal roll, as on 1st October 2025, the Applicant has
                          remained in custody for approximately two years and five months. The
                          investigation stands completed and a chargesheet has already been filed.
                          There is nothing on record in the present proceedings to indicate that the
                          Applicant has any previous criminal history or that he has attempted to
                          abscond or interfere with the process of law during the period of
                          investigation. The trial is yet to conclude and, having regard to the nature of
                          the offence and the pendency of such matters, it is reasonable to expect that
                          it will take some time before it reaches finality. Prolonged pre-trial
                          incarceration, particularly once the investigation is over and the accused is
                          no longer required for custodial interrogation, has been consistently viewed
                          with caution by the Supreme Court.

                          9.    The co-accused, who are family members of the Applicant and
                          against whom allegations also stand levelled, have been granted anticipatory
                          bail. It is correct that the Applicant, being the husband, is placed somewhat
                          differently from the in-laws and the principle of parity cannot be applied
                          mechanically. However, whether the prosecution ultimately establishes the

                           essential ingredients of the offences is a matter that will fall for appreciation
                          on the basis of the evidence, parties shall adduce at trial and cannot be pre-
                          judged at the bail stage.

                          10.      The general principles governing the grant of bail are well settled.
                          Bail is not to be withheld as a form of pre-trial punishment, and the primary
                          purpose of bail is to secure the presence of the accused at trial.5 In
                          considering a bail application, due regard must be given to the nature and
                          gravity of the accusation, the severity of the punishment in the event of
                          conviction, the prima facie evaluation of the material, the likelihood of the
                          accused fleeing from justice, and the possibility of tampering with evidence
                          or influencing witnesses.

                          11.      Having regard to the totality of circumstances, including the duration
                          of custody, the stage of the proceedings, the nature of the material on record,
                          and the settled principles governing grant of bail, this Court is of the view
                          that the Applicant has made out a case for being released on bail. The
                          apprehensions expressed by the State that the Applicant may threaten or
                          intimidate the complainant or other witnesses can be addressed by imposing
                          strict and enforceable conditions.

                          12.      Accordingly, the Applicant is directed to be released on bail on
                          furnishing a personal bond for a sum of ₹25,000/- with two sureties of the
                          like amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/Duty MM, on the
                          following conditions:

                          a.       The Applicant shall cooperate in any further investigation as and
                          when directed by the concerned IO;
