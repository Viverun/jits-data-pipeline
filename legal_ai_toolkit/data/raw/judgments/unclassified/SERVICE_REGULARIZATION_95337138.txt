                                SUBMISSIONS

4.     Per contra, respondents have contested the claim of applicant by
filing written statement, wherein they have submitted that the husband of
the applicant initially appointed in year 1982 casual labour and granted
temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000.

 
1.8.2000. The husband of the applicant while
working as temporary status stood retired
                                  retired on 30.06.2018. The husband of
the applicant could not be regularized due to limited number of vacancies to
extend of 25 percent of total vacancies. The applicant stood retired while
working as temporary status without regularization of services in re
                                                                  regular
                                                                    gular
cadre. Hence not entitled to receive pension and
                                              nd pensionary benefits
accordance with Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1972 ( Now Civil
Services (Pension) Rules 2021). The applicant retired as temporary status
paid from contingencies fund and as per Rule 2 (b) & (c) of Pension Rules,
1972 said rules not applicable to applicant
                                  applicant.. The Central Civil Services
(Temporary Service) Rules 1965 (in short
                                   short-Rules 1965) also not applicable
to applicant. So also in similar case of 
Union of India versus Bhikhanii
Devi, CWJV No.
 15420 of 2019 decided on 14.10.2019 by Hon'ble High
Court Patna. The Hon'ble Court Patna in above case set aside order dated
27.3.2018 of the Tribunal and allowed the writ application.


5.     The rejoinder has been filed by the applicant specifically
                                                             ally denying
the contentions of respondents made in the written statement has stated that
poor casual labourer was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and
rendered eighteen years and five months in Temporary Status. The
applicant cannot be made to suffer for lapses on part of respondents for

                             3                            OA 1109/2019




not being regularized. The applicant's husband services deserves to be
treated regularized and services be counted as qualifying service
                                                          service.. The
temporary employee entitled for at par benefits of Group 'D' employee on
regular basis. So also applicant case is squarely covered by law 
laid down
in
 similar facts and issue in O.A. No. 143/2018 
Awadhesh Prasad Singh
Vs Union of India & Ors
 decided on 28.10.2021 and affirm by Hon'ble
High Court Patna.


6.    Shri S.K. Tiwary, Learned Counsel appearing for applicant argued
that applicant husband was initially appointed in year 1982 as Casual
labour. Since 1.8.2000 Temporary Status conferred accordance with
statutory scheme, Department of Posts, G
statutory                              Govt. of India. The Para 8 of
Scheme dated 12.04.1991 and policy dated 30.11.1992 Department of
Posts, Govt. of India provides after rendering three years of continuous
service with temporary status the casual labour shall be treated at par with
temporary Group 'D' employee of the Department
                                     epartment of Posts and entitled to
such benefits as are admissible to Group D employees on regular basis. So
also contended that the applicant
                        applicant is temporary Group 'D' employee quasi
permanent status of Department of Post after three years from date of gr
                                                                      grant
                                                                        ant
of temporary status.

             statu The scheme dated 12.04.1991 and policy dated
30.11.1992 Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021 is
enforceable in law and vested legal enforceable right accrued to applicant
entitled for benefits at par of regular Group 'D' employee of the
Department of the Post Government of India. So also Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case Jagrit Mazdoor Union Vers
                                   Versus
                                       us Mahanagar Telephone
Nigam Ltd
      Ltd reported in 1990 Supp SCC 113 dated 29.11.1989 issued
directions in compliance thereof the of Department of Post, Government of
India issued Policy and Scheme known as casual Labourers (Grant
                                                          Grant of
Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme and it provides that after
rendering three years of continuous service as temporary status be treated at
par with Group 'D' employee regular basis and entitled to such benefits as
are admissible to regular Group 'D' employee of the department of posts.
Hence applicant is entitled to relief claimed accordance with schemes, Rule
                                                                         le
of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972 ((Now Central Civil Services
Pension Rules 2021).

 
2021 . So also law 
laid down by
 Hon'ble High Court Patna
in similar case of 
Union of India & ors vs Meena Devi @ Meena
Kunwar
 was       2003 (1) PLJR 506 decided on 8.12.2022 with all
consequential benefits. The right accrues to the applicant as per Rule 10 of

                              4                          OA 1109/2019




Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021 hence present OA deserves
to be allowed. .


7.     Shri H.P.Singh, Learned CGSC alongwith Shri Deepak Kumar,,
Learned Additional Standing
                       ding Counsel appearing for the respondents
argued that applicant husband had retired on 30.06.2018 after completing
60 years of age as temporary status casual labour and never had been
followed by regular appointment in the cadre. So also the scheme dated
12.04.1991 and policy dated 30.11.1992 issued by Department of Posts had
to be construed that there is no automatic appointment of temporarily status
after three years to a regular Group D Post. The appli
                                                 applicant
                                                      cant husband never
been absorbed and not appointed on any substantive post in the regular
cadre accordance with scheme. So also Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Secretary, State of Karnataka Versus Uma Devi, (2006) 4 SCC 1 held that
"merely
 merely because a temporary
                  temporary employee, casual wage worker could not
claim to be made permanent on the ground because continued for a long
time".. So also contended that applicant not entitled for any benefits under
Pension Rules 1972, Rules 1965 and in case of Union of India Verses
Bhikha Devi,, CWJC No. 15420 of 2019, Hon'ble High Court Patna on
Bhikhani
similar facts decided on 14.10.2019 allowed writ application filed by
respondents and set-aside order dated 27.3.2018 passed by this Tribunal.
Hence the present OA deserves to be dismissed.

                                    dismissed.

8.     No other point is pressed at the Bar by the learned counsel appearing
for both the parties.

9.     This Tribunal has bestowed anxious considerations on the rival
contentions of the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the
material placed on record.

10.    The admitted fact are that husband of the applicant initially
appointed in year 1982 as casual
                          casual labourer and conferred temporary status
with effect from 1.8.2000. On completing age of sixty years retired from
service on 30.06.2018. Since 1982 to 1.8.2000 worked as casual labourer
and since 1.8.2000 to 30.06.2018 served as temporary status not appointed
                                                                     nted
on substantive appointment and left the world on 28.05.2022.

11.    The dispute in the present case is that respondents have taken stand
that the husband of applicant worked in the Department
                                             epartment of Posts, Govt. of
India as casual labourer from year 1982 to 1.8.2000.. Thereafter as per
statutory scheme and policy of Department of Posts, Govt. of India
conferred temporary status with effect from 01.8.2000 vide order dated

                               5                                  OA 1109/2019




26.4.2001 (Annexure A-1).. The husband of applicant also rendered services
as temporary status
             status from 1.8.2000 to 31.6.2018 and retired on 31.06.2018
as temporary status employee. The further stand of the respondent
                                                       respondent--

department is that till retirement applicant was not regularized in services of
regular cadre and was not holding substantive appointment on any post in
the regular service cadre. Hence in absence of regularization of services in
regular cadre till time of retirement on 31.06.2018. The husband of the
applicant not eligible for pension,
                           pension, family pension and othe
                                                       otherr pensionary
benefits as qualifying services of ten years can only be counted under CCS
Pension Rules provided temporary services is followed by uninterrupted
                                                                 upted

service all his active life till retired

before this Tribunal for determination is:-

                                       is:-



            " Whether deceased employee who was appointed as a casual
            lobourer and thereafter conferred the status of temporary employee

               conferment of Temporary Status. Such increment will be taken into
               account after every one year of service subject to performance of duty for

       service        of     moree       than       eighteen         years       was        in   quasi--
       permanent/temporary The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held :-

       permanent/temporary."

                     " 3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
                     the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the
                     appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of
                     quasi-permanent
                            permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was
                     necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.

                            It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was
                     in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary
                     benefits.

                            There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant
                     was not made permanent even when he had served the Government
                     for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is
                     denied the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not
                     a permanent employee of the government
                                                       government. The appellant having
                     served the government for almost-two two decades it would be unfair to
                     treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.

                                                    permanent.

                 Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we hold
                 that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent after
                 he served the Government for or such a long period. The services of the
                 appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he shall
                 be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set aside
                 the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to treat the
                 appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980 after
                 serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of
                 permanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be
                 finalized within six months from the receipt of this order. The
                 appellant shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date
                 of retirement.

                                                                        eld

                                                                       [Emphasis supplied]


(iv)    The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical case in
        facts and legal issue in case of 
Union of India versus Smt Ram
        Kali Devi, DWJC No.
 11435 of 2017 decided on 11.9.2017
                                                     11.9.2017. Their
        Lordships were seisin with similar issue as involved in the present
        case. The Union of India, Department of Posts had challenged order
        dated 22.3.2017 passed in O.A. No. 664/2015 (Patna) by this
        Tribunal to pay family pension, retiral dues to widow of deceased
        employee.




               Their Lordships observed that husband of petitioner granted
        temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992
        and he died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more

                           11                            OA 1109/2019




      than 25 years of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in
      temporary status begets
                         gets the benefits of pension. Failure on part of
      postal department not to regularize services of husband of private
      respondents cannot be appreciated. Their Lordships decided
                                                            ided in
      favour of temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'
      employee and upheld order dated 22.3.2017 in similar OA No.
      664/2015 (Patna). So also observed that in similar and identical
      cases adjudicated in favour of employees in OA No. 113/2006
      decided
           ed on 21.9.2006, affirmed by Patna High Court vide order
      dated 7.11.2007 in CWJC No. 4475/2007 and order of the High
      Court Patna has been affirmed by Hon'ble Apex Court on 4.12.2009.
      So also similar cases travelled from O.A. No. 900/2012 (CAT Patna)
      in CWJC
            C No. 10978 of 2017 and Division Bench vide order dated
      4.9.2017 had upheld directions by this Tribunal extending benefits of
      pension as employee was granted temporary status at part with
      Group 'D' employee.                                 [Emphasis supplied]

                                        ed in the present case
      interpreted rules applicable in the present OA in hand.

      retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of service in the

       observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs
       are entitled
            ntitled to family pension in light of Rule 10(2) of Temporary
                                                                 emporary

         deceased
             ased employee on lapses on railways could not be considered
         for regularization".. The Hon'ble High Court considered the fact that
         employee himself was not at fault for such lack of regularization,
         never called for regularization purposes. The Hon'ble High C
                                                                    Court

15.      In the other similar and identical situation, The Central
Administrative Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of
original applicants on similar facts and legal issue as involved in the
present OA in hand and some of them are cited as under :-



 
(a) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018
         
Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors

         decided on 28.10.2021. The said O.A. was ffiled
                                                    iled by Night Guard

         with GID (3) below Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
 
The
         learned Tribunal observed that as per judgement by The Hon'ble
         Supreme Court in 
Uma Devi
's case,          Department of Posts hass
         circulated policy in June/July 2014 for regularization of casual
         labours having worked for ten years or more and vide judgement

                            14                                     OA 1109/2019




   dated 13.11.2017 Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.
   12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the policy. The applicant
   Awadhesh Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984
   Awadhesh
   on daily wages, conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and
   retired on October, 2019 after 35 years of total service as temporary
   status and not been regularized.


          The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of clause
   5 of Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66
                                                            66-9/91-SPB.

 
SPB. I
   dated 30th November, 1992- benefits to a casual labour on completion of
   three years service in Temporary status become entitled to be treated at par
   with temporary Group 'D' employees of the Department of Posts and
   would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are aadmissible
                                                       dmissible to Group 'D'
   employees on regular basis such as counting of service for purposes of
   pension and terminal benefits as in the case of temporary employees
   appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and retirement
   benefits after the regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of order
   relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court
   in case of 
Prem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others

   reported in (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under ::-


                  "35. There are some of the employees who have not been
        regularized in spite of having rendered the services for 3030-40 or more
        years whereas they have been superannuated. As they have worked in
        work-charged
              charged establishment, not against any particular project, their
        services oughtt to have been regularized under the Government
        instructions and even as per the decision of this Court in Secretary,
        State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court in the
        said decision has laid down that in case services have been render
                                                                         rendered
        for more than ten years without the cover of the Court's order, as one
        time measure, the services be regularized of such employees. In the
        facts of the case, those employees who have worked for ten years or
        more should have been regularized. It would no not be proper to regulate
        them for consideration of regularisation as others have been
        regularised, we direct that their services be treated as a regular one.
        However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to claiming any
        dues of difference in wages    es had they been continued in service
        regularly before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall be
        entitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the regular
        establishment and the services rendered by them right from the day
        they entered the work-charged
                                   charged establishment shall be counted as
        qualifying service for purpose of pension.

                  36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement
        Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work    work-
        charged establishment shall be treated
                                           reated as qualifying service under the
        aforesaid rule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be
        confined to three years only before the date of the order. Let the
        admissible benefits be paid accordingly within three months.
        Resultantly, the appeals
                              eals filed by the employees are allowed and filed
        by the State are dismissed."

(b) In the similar and identical situation the learned Coordinate Bench
   Chandigarh of the Tribunal recently in October 2023 adjudicated in

      Union of India & ors allowed OA directing to grant family pension
      and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee. The learned
      Tribunal dealt     issue   "whether

      regularized by the respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2) of the
      CCS Pension Rules, 1972 is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal
      has considered the matter and examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS
      Pension Rules, 1972 and observed that provisions are pari materia to
      Ru 75- Family Pension Scheme for Railway servants, 1954. 
So
      Rule
      also held that case is covered by judgement in case of 
Alka Sharma
      vs Union of India & ors
 2017 (2) SCT (P&H) (DB
                                                 (DB) passed by
      Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana
                                  Haryana.

      Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram
 in CWP.


No.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of

      covered by judgement of Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh
      in matter of 
Union of India vs Meena Devi
 in CWP No. 34 of
      2014 decided on 23.7.2018.




16.    In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue "whether
                                                                whether

entitled to pension/family pension and pensionar
                                       pensionary benefits. "



17.    Admittedly, the husband of the applicant was initially engaged as
       Admittedly,
Casual Labourer in year 1982. The department of posts vide instruction
dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all daily wagers working in post offices are to
be treated as casual labourers. The department of posts has made Scheme

               S Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as
extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes
temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules
                                                               ules

years service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated
30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and

no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge his duties
and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with
Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension,,
family pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status
of deceased employee was at par with regular employee on long
continuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory
Rules 1965 read with Pension
                     Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy
decision.

legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously
                                     harmoniously.. The Rules 1965 and
the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status in
department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly
acquired temporary status
                   status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and
pensioner benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement
pensionery

justice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is
substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state as an ideal

Union of India and state government and their instrumentalities should take
steps to regularize as one time measure

appointed who are duly qualified persons in terms of rules and worked for
ten years or more. The contention of respondents is that in view of law laid
down in case of Uma Devi (supra) applicant casual labour continued for
long period can not claim to be made permanent is contrary to direction of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 44 as one time measure to consider for
regularization . The respondents have not discharged their duties as model
employer and did not even consider
                                er applicant in light of policy for
regularization as one time measure, framed pursuant to directions in case of
