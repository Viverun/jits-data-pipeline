                                              ORDER



        Hon'ble Mr. Rajinder Kashyap, Member (A): -



        By way of the present O.A., filed under 
Section 19
 of the
      Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, the applicants (13 in
      number), in Para 8 of the O.A., have prayed for the following
      reliefs: -



                   "a) Quashing and setting aside of OIC-Estt. Branch-PHQ
                   upload    memo       no.    F.18(26)/Estt./PHQ/2025/CDNo.

                   3799530/2947 dated 25.04.2025 with annexed thereto
                   advertisement notice-2025 [Annexure A-1];



                   b) As usual continuation of the contractual employments of the
                   Applicants with all consequential reliefs and benefits,
                   including pay and allowances for the intermittent period i.e.
                   01.04.2025 to till rejoining of the Applicants;



                   Any other or further order or direction to grant complete relief
                   to the applicants."



      2.           Pursuant to notice, the respondents have filed their
      counter affidavit opposing the claim of the applicant and have
      prayed for dismissal of the present Original Application.



        FACTS OF THE CASE


      3.           The Delhi Prisons/Respondent No. 2 presently comprises
      16 Central Jails situated across three Prison Complexes, namely
      Tihar, Rohini, and Mandoli. 
Section 6
 of the Delhi Prisons Act,
      2000 mandates that every Central Jail shall have, inter alia, a
      Law Officer. The relevant statutory provision reads as under:



                   "6. For every prison there shall be a Superintendent, a Deputy
                   Prisons Superintendent, a Medical Officer, a Law Officer, a Welfare
                   Officer, and such other officers as the Government thinks it
                   necessary."



 
3.1 It is submitted that although the statute requires a Law Officer
      for each prison, there has been only one sanctioned post of Law
      Officer in Delhi Prisons since its creation in 1993. With the
      number of Central Jails having increased to 16, this statutory

                                          5

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                 OA No. 1549/2025




      mandate remained unfulfilled. Consequently, a Public Interest
      Litigation     (W.P.   (C)   No.       4173/2019,   
Amit   Sahni      Vs.
      Government of NCT of Delhi & Anr.
) was filed. By order
      dated 27.09.2019, the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court, noting the
      submissions of the Respondents therein (i.e., GNCTD through its
      Home Department and Delhi Prisons) that the "steps for creation
      of posts of Law Officers for each Jail are under process",
      disposed of the petition. The matter was released from monitoring
      with a direction to the Respondents to complete the appointment
      process at the earliest, preferably within 12 weeks from receipt of
      the order.




      3.2 Pursuant thereto, Respondent No. 2 sought permission to
      engage Law Officers on a contractual basis, making it clear that
      such contractual appointments were to be purely temporary,
      initially for one year, and extendable only until the posts were
      created and filled on a regular basis, so as to comply with the
      directions of the Hon‟ble High Court. In compliance, 14 posts of
      Law Officer (Contractual) were publicly advertised, carrying
      emoluments of ₹35,400 + Dearness Allowance. A Selection Board
      was constituted, and after following due process, including
      interview, recommendation, offer of appointment, medical
      examination, police verification, and issuance of appointment
      orders, the applicants herein, along with one other candidate,
      were appointed as Law Officers (Contractual) for an initial period
      of one year.

      3.4           It is further stated that since there was no compliance
      within the stipulated time, a Contempt Petition [Cont. Cas. (C)
      No. 5/2020] came to be filed. During its pendency, the aforesaid
      contractual appointments were made. Thereafter, by order dated
      21.12.2021, the Hon‟ble Delhi High Court disposed of the
      contempt petition after recording the compliance/submissions
      made          by   the   Respondents.        The   Applicant   Law Officers
      (Contractual),           upon   their       appointment,   started     serving
      individually in different Central Jails under Delhi Prisons.



      3.5          Subsequently, upon perusal of the proposal dated
      16.12.2021 filed by the Respondents along with their status report
      dated 20.12.2021 in the aforesaid contempt case, it transpired that
      pending creation of the required 15 posts of Law Officer, the
      applicants‟ contractual appointments as Law Officers were
      actually made against one sanctioned post of Assistant Law
      Officer and thirteen sanctioned posts of Legal Assistant, both
      carrying identical pay scales. Consequently, the applicants
      were/are being paid only the minimum of Level-6 (₹35,400 +
      static DA) instead of their lawful entitlement as Law Officers i.e.

                                           7

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                     OA No. 1549/2025




      the minimum of Level-7 (₹44,900 + applicable DA) under the 7th
      
CPC
. Furthermore, though admissible, no other allowances or
      service-related facilities have been extended to them. The
      applicants repeatedly took up the issue with the Respondents,
      pointing out the anomaly/illegality and invoking the settled
      principle of "Equal Pay for Equal Work", i.e., entitlement to the
      pay of the post on which they were appointed/working. However,
      except for plain assurances that the matter would be resolved
      upon creation of posts and arrears would then be paid, no relief
      was granted. Despite the lapse of nearly five years, and even
      though 3,241 new posts of different designations were created in
      Delhi Prisons on 06.09.2024, no new post of Law Officer was
      sanctioned.



      3.6      On    09.07.2024,    the       applicants   submitted     a    joint
      representation highlighting the aforesaid anomaly and illegality,
      and specifically seeking: (i) equal pay for equal work, (ii) salary of
      the post of Law Officer on which they were appointed/working,
      and (iii) clarification regarding leave entitlement. No action was
      taken thereon. It is relevant to submit that under law and rules,
      the applicants are entitled to the same facilities and benefits as
      other         contractual    employees        working     in       different
      Departments/Establishments under the Government of NCT of
      Delhi. However, for reasons best known to the respondents, they
      are being denied such entitlements. It is further submitted that
      from the very beginning, the contractual appointments of the
      applicants were extended from time to time, including through ex
      post facto extensions, and for that purpose their work and conduct
      reports were regularly sought from the concerned controlling
      officers. However, for the tenure expiring on 31.03.2025, no such
      work and conduct reports were called. Instead, the applicants
      were orally informed that since they had raised the demand for

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                    OA No. 1549/2025




      Having no other remedy, the applicants submitted a detailed joint
      representation dated 17.03.2025, requesting the respondents to
      seek their work and conduct reports from the controlling officers
      for extension of service, and also to address non-compliance with
      the law governing contractual employment with respect to
      benefits such as Earned Leave Accumulation and Encashment,
      LTC, HRA, DA, Children Education Allowance, DGHS Medical
      Card, EPF, Gratuity, and other admissible facilities. The said
      representation was not replied to.



 
3.7           The applicants were, therefore, constrained to approach
      this Tribunal by filing O.A. No. 1100/2025 titled 
Sourabh
      Luthra & Ors. Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors.
, wherein,
      by order dated 26.03.2025, this Tribunal, with the consent of
      learned counsel for the parties, disposed of the O.A. directing the
      competent authority to consider and dispose of the applicants‟
      representation by passing a reasoned and speaking order within
      six weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of the
      Tribunal‟s order. Despite the said directions, the Respondents did
      not extend the applicants‟ services, and their last extended
      contractual tenure expired on 31.03.2025. Thereafter, the
      Respondents issued an advisory to their officers not to permit the
      applicants‟ entry into the prison premises.




      3.8 It is submitted that the respondents, acting in a vindictive
      manner and with the intent to defeat the rights and interests of
      the          applicants,   instead   of   extending   their    contractual
      appointments, issued an advertisement notice in 2025 inviting
      applications for 14 posts of Law Officers (Contractual) for a period
      up to 31.03.2026, within 15 days of its publication in the
      newspapers, i.e., on 26.04.2025. The said advertisement and
      conduct of the Respondents constitute a colourable exercise of
      power and are in direct violation of the well-settled legal principle
      that "a contractual employee cannot be replaced by another

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                    OA No. 1549/2025




      contractual employee." The attempt of the respondents is
      evidently to replace the applicants with another set of contractual
      Law Officers, which is impermissible in law.

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                     OA No. 1549/2025




          v.       That as per the 
Employees Provident Funds and
                   Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952
, every establishment
                   having 20 or more employees on any day in preceding year
                   is to mandatorily adopt and the employees are entitled to
                   subscribe towards, avail benefits of Employees Provident
                   Fund Scheme and as per 
Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972

                   each and every establishment having 10 or more employees
                   on any day in preceding year is mandatorily liable to pay to
                   its employees and the employees are entitled to receive
                   Gratuity from its employer. Despite that been the statutory
                   position, the applicants are not being allowed the benefits
                   of the aforesaid beneficial legislation. The State been a
                   model employer, there's no reason as to why the benefits of
                   said Acts shouldn't apply to its contractual employees
                   including   the   Applicants.   
Worthwhile   to     add     that
                   Directorate of Education, „GNCTD‟ complying with the
                   judgment dated 03.08.2021 as passed by this Hon'ble High
                   Court in Writ Petition (Civil) no. 11154/2019 titled
                   
Janardan Sharma Vs. Government of N.C.T.
                   Delhi
, vide its order dated 13.12.2022 has allowed
                   payment of gratuity to its Part Time Vocational Teachers
                   engaged on consolidated salary.




 
4.2 It is well settled principle of law that one set of contract
      employees cannot be replaced by another set of contract
      employees in view of the order/judgment dated 12.08.1992 of
      Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of 
State of Haryana & Ors.
      Vs. Piara Singh & Others
, reported in (1992) 2 SCC 118, and
      therefore, the inviting the applications from fresh appointment on
      contract basis for the same post on which the applicant was
      working only to replace the applicant is totally illegal, arbitrary
      and discriminatory in the eyes of law.

      REPLY OF THE RESPONDENTS


      5.           By drawing our attention to the counter reply filed by
      respondents on 05.08.2025 wherein they have submitted that

                                         13

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                               OA No. 1549/2025




      Delhi Prisons vide its letter dated26.09.2019 requested Home
      Department, GNCTD to grant permission for engagement of 16
      Law Officers on contract basis, as per appropriate rules and
      regulations, initially for a period of one year extendable for the
      period till these posts are filled on regular basis after post creation
      so as to enable Delhi Prisons to comply the direction of Hon'ble
      High Court at Delhi at the earliest. However, Hon'ble Lieutenant
      General granted approval for filling up the 14 vacant post of Law
      Officer on contract basis against the 13 sanctioned vacant posts of
      Legal Assistant and 01 post of Assistant Law Officer initially for a
      period of01 year. This tenure was later extended by Hon'ble
      Lieutenant General upto 31.03.2025. The details of extensions are
      as below:-



                   Sl. Period for which tenure Authority/Order vide
                   No. extended                 which tenure was
                                                extended

                   1.  01.09.2021 to 31.08.2022 Letter dated 25.11.2021

                   2.  01.09.2022 to 31.03.2023 Letter dated 29.12.2022

                   3.  01.04.2023 to 31.03.2024 Letter dated 21.04.2023

                   4.  01.04.2024 to 31.03.2025 Letter dated 02.04.2024



      5.2          It is further submitted that the scope of duties of Law
      Officers (contract) is not similar with the duties of Law Officers
      mentioned in Delhi Prisons Rules 2018. A mere nomenclature
      designating a person as Law Officer is not enough to come to
      conclusion that he is doing the some work as any Law Officer in
      regular service. Therefore, the principle of „Equal pay for equal
      work‟ does not apply in this case. It is submitted that there
      presentations of the Law Officers (Contractual) were disposed off
      by issuing a speaking order dated 15.05.2025.



 
5.3          It is submitted that the ruling of Hon‟ble Apex court in
      
State of Haryana & Ors. Vs Piara Singh & Ors.
, reported
      in 1992 AIR 1230, was in case of adhoc or temporary
      appointments and not in case of contractual employees. The
      statement in verbatim is as under:-


                                               14


Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                            OA No. 1549/2025




                   "an ad hoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by
                   another ad hoc or temporary employee."



 
5.4          The Apex court has observed in 
Yogesh Mahajan Vs.
      Prof. R. C. Deka, Director and All India Institute of
      Medical Sciences
 and 
Punjab State Electricity Board Vs.
      Jagjiwan Ram
 that adhoc service is often viewed as a
      substantive vacancy that can lead to regularization, whereas
      contract service is typically temporary and does not guarantee
      renewal or extension. Contractual employees do not have an
      inherent right to have their contracts renewed.




      5.5          As a matter of fact, no equality before the law is being
      denied to the applicants. However, 
Article 16 (1)
 of the
      Constitution of India envisages:



                   "Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.-(1) There
                   shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to
                   employment or appointment to any office under the State."



      5.6 Delhi Prisons has published the advertisement for filling up of
      these posts in newspaper of four languages i.e. English, Hindi,
      Punjabi and Urdu inviting applications from eligible candidates.
      The applicants who have worked upto 31.03.2025as per contract
      were not bared from applying and they could also apply for these
      posts subject to satisfying eligibility criteria. In addition, 
Article
      311
 of the Constitution of India lays down the procedure and
      safeguards to be followed before a government employee
      (member of a civil service of the Union or an all India service or a
      civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a
      State).



 
5.7 Learned counsel for the respondents places reliance on the
      order/judgment dated 28.08.2020 of the Hon‟ble High Court of
      Delhi in W.P. (C) 2935/2020 in the matter of 
Ms. Sonalika
      Bhargava Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Ors
.




      6. We have perused the pleadings available on record and
      considered the submissions made by the learned counsels for the

                                               15

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                          OA No. 1549/2025




      parties and have also gone through the Orders/Judgments
      referred to and relied upon by the learned counsels for the
      respective parties carefully.



      7. Office order dated 25.04.2025 (Annexure-A/1) reads as under:-



                   "Sub: Uploading the Advertisement Notice-2025 for the
                   post of LAW OFFICER on Contractual Basis in Delhi
                   Prison Department, GNCTD.



                   With reference to the aforementioned subject, it is to inform that the
                   Delhi Prisons Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi invites
                   applications for filling up the 01 vacant post of Law Officer purely
                   on Contractual basis initially for period upto 31.03.2026.



                   In this context, please find enclosed herewith the Advertisement
                   Notice-2025 alongwith terms and conditions and
                   application performa (Annexure-I) with the request to
                   upload the same on Department Website."



 
8. On replacement of contractual employees, the law 
laid down in


Piara Singh
 (supra) is clear that while ad-hoc employees do not
      have a right to regularization, they cannot be arbitrarily replaced
      by another set of ad-hoc employees, except through a process of
      regular recruitment.
 
This principle has been followed in
      subsequent decisions including 
Parveen Khan
 (supra).In the
      present case, the respondents seek to fill the same posts by
      engaging another set of contractual Law Officers, without
      initiating any process of regular recruitment.
 
Such action, in our
      considered view, is in violation to the ratio in 
Piara Singh

      (supra) and is arbitrary.




 
9. The reliance placed by the applicant on 
Piara Singh
 (supra) is
      well-founded as the Hon‟ble Supreme Court therein held that
      adhoc or temporary employees cannot be replaced by another set
      of adhoc or temporary employees, and such replacement is
      deemed arbitrary unless justified by exceptional circumstances.
      For facility of reference, the relevant portion of 
the said judgment

      reads as under:-


                                            16


Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                       OA No. 1549/2025




                   "25. Before parting with this case, we think it appropriate to
                   say a few words concerning the issue of regularisation of
                   adhoc/temporary employees in government service.



                   The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through
                   the prescribed agency but exigencies of administration may
                   sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary appointment to
                   be made. In such a situation, effort should always be to
                   replace such an adhoc/temporary employee by a regularly
                   selected employee as early as possible. Such a temporary
                   employee may also compete along with others for such
                   regular selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and
                   good, but if he does not, he must give way to the regularly
                   selected candidate. The appointment of the regularly
                   selected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance
                   for the sake of such an adhoc/temporary employee.



                   Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be
                   replaced by another adhoc or temporary employee; he must
                   be replaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is
                   necessary to avoid arbitrary action on the part of the
                   appointing authority.



                   Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is
                   necessitated on account of the exigencies of administration,
                   he should ordinarily be drawn from the employment
                   exchange unless it cannot brook delay in which case the
                   pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no candidate is
                   available or is not sponsored by the employment exchange,
                   some appropriate method consistent with the requirements
                   of 
Article 16
 should be followed. In other words, there must
                   be a notice published in the appropriate manner calling for
                   applications and all those who apply in response thereto
                   should be considered fairly.



                   An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when
                   qualified persons are not available through the above
                   processes.



                   If for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is
                   continued for a fairly long spell, the authorities must
                   consider his case for regularisation provided he is eligible
                   and qualified according to rules and his service record is
                   satisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the
                   reservation policy of the State.



                   The proper course would be that each States prepares a
                   scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation of
                   such employees consistent with its reservation policy and if
                   a scheme is already framed, the same way be made
                   consistent with our observations herein so as to reduce

                                             17

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                         OA No. 1549/2025




                   avoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person
                   is regularised he should be placed immediately below the
                   last regularly appointed employee in that category, class or
                   service, as the case may be.



                   So far as the work-charged employees and casual labour
                   are concerned, the effort must be to regularise them as far
                   as possible and as early as possible subject to their fulfilling
                   the qualifications, if any, prescribed for the post and subject
                   also to availability of work. If a casual labourer is continued
                   for a fairly long spell - say two or three years - a
                   presumption may arise that there is regular need for his
                   services. In such a situation, it becomes obligatory for the
                   concerned authority to examine the feasibility of his
                   regularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought to
                   adopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the
                   person. As has been repeatedly stressed by this court,
                   security of tenure is necessary for an employee to give his
                   best to the job. In this behalf, we do commend the orders of
                   the Government of Haryana (contained in its letter dated
                   6.4.90 referred to hereinbefore) both in relation to work-
                   charged employees as well as casual labour.



                   We must also say that the orders issued by the Governments
                   of Punjab and Haryana providing for regularisation of
                   adhoc/temporary employees who have put in two years/one
                   year of service are quite generous and leave no room for
                   any legitimate grievance by any one.



                   These are but a few observations which we thought it
                   necessary to make, impelled by the facts of this case, and the
                   spate of litigation by such employees. They are not
                   exhaustive nor can they be understood as immutable. Each
                   Government or authority has to devise its own criteria or
                   principles for regularisation having regard to all the
                   relevant circumstances, but while doing so, it should bear in
                   mind the observations made herein.



                   26. So far as the employees and workmen employed by
                   Statutory/Public Corporations are concerned, it may be
                   noted that they have not issued any orders akin to those
                   issued by the Punjab and Haryana Government. Even so, it
                   is but appropriate that they adopt as far as possible,
                   keeping the exigencies and requirements of their
                   administration in view, the criteria and principles
                   underlying the orders issued by their Government in the
                   matter of regularisation and pass appropriate orders. In
                   short, the Statutory/Public Corporations in Haryana will
                   follow the orders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990
                   
referred to above
, as supplemented by the orders in the
                   Notification dated 28.2.1991, where as the Statutory/Public

                   Secretary to the Government of Punjab, Department of
                   Personnel referred to in para 22 above. These directions
                   shall not, however, apply to these Statutory/Public
                   Corporations functioning within these States as are under
                   the control of the Government of India. These Corporations
                   will do well to evolve an appropriate policy of
                   regularisation, in the light of this judgment, if they have not
                   already evolved one, or make their existing policy consistent
                   with this judgment to avoid litigation.



                   27. For the above reasons, all the appeals are allowed and
                   the orders under appeal are set aside. The directions given

              8. CONTENTIONS ON BEAHLF OF THE PETITIONERS:-



              (A) The advertisement along with General Instructions dated
              08.06.2021 is per se illegal and has been published with an intent
              to oust the Petitioners. Petitioners were appointed on contract
              basis and from time to time their contracts were renewed.

              Petitioners fulfill all requisite criteria and qualifications under
              the RRs of posts and were appointed against sanctioned posts,
              after following the due process of selection and not de hors the
              RRs.



 
(B) It is a settled law that a contractual employee cannot be
              replaced by another contractual employee. This law was
              propounded by the Supreme Court in 
State of Haryana and
              Others v. Piara Singh and Others
, (1992) 4 SCC 118, and has been
              consistently followed in several judgments.
 
The Division Bench of
              this Court in 
Narender Singh Ahuja and Ors. v. The Secretary,
              Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ors.
, 2014 SCC
              OnLine Del 2243, has held that employer cannot discontinue the
              services of contractual, employee by replacing existing
              employees with another set of contractual employees. This
              position has been consistently reiterated in a number of
              judgments by the Supreme Court, this Court and the Central
              Administrative Tribunal, wherein contractual appointees have
              been protected.
 
It is urged that the action of replacing
              contractual employees with contractual employees like the

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                          OA No. 1549/2025




              Petitioners, who have continuously worked for long periods, is
              prohibited by the binding dictum of the Supreme Court in
              
Secretary, State of Karnataka and Others v. Uma Devi
 (3) and
              Others, (2006) 4 SCC 1 and Kamlesh Kumar Vyas and Anr. v.
              State of Rajasthan and Ors.




              (C) Contracts of the Petitioners have been renewed from time to
              time and Petitioners cannot be removed without any plausible or
              just reason or without any cause for complaint, at the whims and
              fancies of the University, oblivious of the fact that Petitioners will
              lose their only source of livelihood. In Commissioner, Kendriya
              Vidyalaya Sangathan and Others v. Anil Kumar Singh and
              Others, (2003) 10 SCC 284, the Supreme Court ruled that
              contractual employees can only be replaced with regular
              employees, as and when the regular process of recruitment starts
              and culminates. It is an undisputed position in the present case
              that the impugned advertisement is for employing a fresh set of
              employees on contract basis and is not for regular appointments.
              Petitioners have clearly stated in the writ petition that they are
              not seeking regularization and their contracts be renewed till
              they are replaced with regular appointees. It is an obligation of
              the State under 
Article 39-A
 of the Constitution of India to ensure
              that all citizens have equal rights to adequate needs of livelihood.
              Constitution guarantees social justice to all individuals and the
              impugned action of the University/DTTE will inevitably result in
              the Petitioners being replaced by contractual employees and loss
              of their livelihood at this stage of life, where they have no
              alternate source of income.



              9. CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY:-



              (A) The impugned Notification does not not in in any any
              manner prevent or preclude the Petitioners from applying to
              secure appointment as Master Trainers and in fact, pursuant to
              the liberty granted by the Court on 25.06.2021, they have applied
              and their results have been kept in a sealed cover.



              (B) Contention of the Petitioners that they are being replaced by
              another set of contractual employees, is factually incorrect and a
              misconception. University has invited applications from the
              public at large and every application will be considered on its
              own merit to select most suitable persons and there is no intent
              to oust the Petitioners, who will be given an equal chance to
              compete with other applicants. 
Article 14
 of the Constitution
              demands that there is an open advertisement giving equal
              chance to all those who apply and participate in a selection
              process and this would enable the University to get the best
              talent as Master Trainers.



              (C) There cannot be any debate on the proposition that one set of
              contractual employees cannot be replaced by another set of

                                            21

Item No. 21/C-II

              contractual employees, but this is not the situation in the present
              case as contracts of Petitioners have expired and in between, the
              University was incorporated in the year 2019. 
Insofar as
              reliance on the judgment in 
Narender Singh Ahuja
 (supra) is
              concerned, no doubt, the Special Leave Petition filed against 
the
              said judgment
 was dismissed on 26.03.2015, however, question
              of law was kept open. It is a settled law that wherein a lis the
              question of law is kept open by the Supreme Court, the
              underlying judgment losses its precedential value.
 The judgment
              in Kamlesh Kumar Vyas (supra) has been wrongly relied upon
              by the Petitioners as the said judgment was passed on a
              statement/concession by the counsel for the Respondent therein
              and cannot be considered as a binding judgment under 
Article
              141
 of the Constitution of India. 
Insofar as reliance on 
Uma Devi

              (supra) is concerned, the same is misplaced, since far from
              helping the case of the Petitioners, it is an authority for the
              proposition that when a person enters a temporary employment
              or gets engagement as a contractual or casual worker, he is
              aware of the consequences of the nature of appointment and
              cannot invoke the theory of legitimate expectation for
              confirmation in the post. It was further observed that in such a
              case, it cannot be held that State has held out any promise while
              engaging these persons, either to continue them or make them
              permanent. None of the other judgments also help the Petitioners
              for the same reason.




 
(D) While the petition is drafted in a manner that it gives an
              impression that Petitioners are not seeking regularization but
              only renewal of the contracts, but the real motivation is to seek
              regularization and it is a settled law that law does not permit a
              person, to do indirectly something that cannot be done directly.
              The contractual appointments of the Petitioners have come to an
              end by afflux of time and any further direction to renew the
              contracts by the Court would be to enforce the contract of
              service, which cannot be be done by a writ Court and/or would
              amount to granting regularization, which would be in the teeth
              of the several judgments of the of the Supreme Court, including
              the celebrated judgment of 
Uma Devi
 (supra).




 
(E) Reliance is placed by the Petitioners on the judgment of the
              Supreme Court in 
Piara Singh
 (supra), overlooking the fact that
              in the judgment itself, the Supreme Court has observed that each
              Government and Authority has to devise its own criteria or
              principle for regularization having regard to all relevant
              circumstances and no case can be the same.
 
In 
State of
              Jharkhand and Another v. Harihar Yadav and Others
, (2014) 2
              SCC 114, the obiter observations of the Supreme Court are not
              dispositive of the questions of law arising in the present writ
              petition. The present case is a different case on facts as, here the
              contractual employees are not being replaced nor were the
              Petitioners appointed for a project, which is continuing as are the

              facts in the cases where the Courts have passed directions not to
              replace one contractual employee with the other.




 
(F) Reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in 
Shri Bhoop
              Singh & Ors. v. Chairman-cum-Managing Director North
              Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd. & Anr., W.P. (C) Nos
.
              6483/2014 and 4484/2014, decided on 19.05.2015, wherein this
              Court declined to grant relief to the Petitioners who were
              appointed as security guards by North Eastern Electric Power
              Corporation Limited, for taking them back into service and for
              quashing the orders of the Respondent declining to extend their
              contractual employments. Court declined relief on the ground
              that Petitioners were not employed against a project and they
              were employed under a fixed term, which contracts had come to
              an end by afflux of time Court held that this was not the case
              where one set of contractual employees were being replaced by
              another set of employees and neither was it the case where it was
              an appointment for a project and the project was continuing.


Judgment in the case of 
Narender Singh Ahuja
 (supra) is sought
              to be distinguished on the same argument.




 
(G) Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Division Bench
              of this Court in 
Union of India & Anr. v. Satish Joshi
, 2013 SCC
              OnLine Del 3161, for the proposition that no employee has a
              vested right to continue in employment, if the contract of
              employment has come to an end by afflux of time and cannot
              urge that his services are liable to be continued de hors the
              contract which he had voluntarily signed.




              11. I have heard learned counsels for the parties and examined
              their rival contentions.



              12. It is an undisputed fact between the parties that the
              Petitioners were appointed as Master Trainers on contractual
              basis between 2015 to 2018 and their contracts were renewed
              from time to time, without any break. The appointments were on
              consolidated remuneration at the WCSCs. It is equally
              undisputed that 20.19 Act came to be notified on 26.05.2020 and
              DTTE vide Notification dated 20.09.2021 published the approval
              granted by the GNETD for integration of 6 WCSCs into the
              University for academic and certification purposes. Petitioners
              have also put forth that the said Notification categorically
              provided that 58 posts existing in the 6 WCSCs were en-masse
              shifted to the University and significantly this, Notification was
              published by DTTE under the aegis of which the University
              functions, both administratively and financially This fact is also
              fortified by the Notice dated 28.01.2021 issued by DEFE notifying
              the integration of WCSCs into the University including that of the
              movable assets as also the 58 sanctioned posts, on existing terms
              and conditions and at the initial stages, all members of WCSCs
              including the Petitioners were invited to a joint meeting.

15. Indisputably, the impugned advertisement dated 08.06.2021
              was published for inviting applications, for contractual
              employments in various disciplines in the post of Masters
              Trainers. It is not the case of the Respondents that the
              advertisement is for making regular appointments. Therefore, by
              virtue of this advertisement, the Respondents are seeking to fill
              the post of Master Trainers on 'contract' basis. The law on this
              issue is far too well-settled to even call for a discussion or debate
              In 
Piara Singh
 (supra), the Supreme Court held as follows:-




                   "45. The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through
                   the prescribed agency but exigencies of administration may
                   sometimes call for an ad hoc or temporary appointment to be
                   made. In such a situation, effort should always be to replace
                   such an ad hoc/temporary employee by a regularly selected
                   employee as early as possible such a temporary employee may
                   also compete along with others for such regular
                   selection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good, but if
                   he does not, he must give way to the regularly selected
                   candidate. The appointment of the regularly selected
                   candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake
                   of such an ad hoc/temporary employee.

                   46. Secondly, an ad hoc or temporary employee should not be
                   replaced by another ad hoc or temporary employee; he must
                   be replaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is
                   necessary to avoid arbitrary action on the part of the
                   appointing authority.

                   xxxx

                   50. The proper course would be that each State prepares a
                   scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation of
                   such employees consistent with its reservation policy and if a
                   scheme is already framed, the same may be made consistent
                   with our observations herein so as to reduce avoidable
                   litigation in this behalf. If and when such person is regularised
                   he should be placed immediately below the last regularly
                   appointed employee in that category, class or service as the
                   case may be.



              16. In Hargurpratap Singh v. State of Punjab and Another,
              (2007) 13 SCC 292, the Supreme Court held as follows:-



                   "3. We have carefully looked into the judgment of the High
                   Court and other pleadings that have been put forth before this
                   Court. It is clear that though the appellants may not be entitled
                   to regular appointment as such it cannot be said that they will
                   not be entitled to the minimum of the pay scale nor that they
                   should not be continued till regular incumbents are appointed.

Item No. 21/C-II

                   The course adopted by the High Court is to displace one ad hoc
                   arrangement by another ad hoc arrangement which is not at
                   all appropriate for these persons who have gained experience
                   which will be more beneficial and useful to the colleges
                   concerned rather than to appoint persons afresh on ad hoc
                   basis. Therefore, we set aside the orders made by the High
                   Court to the extent the same deny the claim of the appellants of
                   minimum pay scale and continuation in service till regular
                   incumbents are appointed. We direct that they shall be
                   continued in service till regular appointments are made on
                   minimum of the pay scale. The appeals shall stand allowed in
                   part accordingly."



              17. In Mohd. Abdul Kadir and Another'. Director General of
              Police, Assam and Others, (2009) 6-SCC 611, the Supreme Court
              held as follows:-



                   "17. When the ad hoc appointment is under a scheme and is in
                   accordance with the selection process prescribed by the
                   scheme, there is no reason why those appointed under the
                   scheme should not be continued as long as the scheme
                   continues. Ad hoc appointments under schemes are normally
                   coterminous with the scheme (subject of course to earlier
                   termination either on medical or disciplinary grounds, or for
                   unsatisfactory service or on attainment of normal age of
                   retirement). Irrespective of the length of their ad hoc service or
                   the scheme, they will not be entitled to regularisation nor to
                   the security of tenure and service benefits available to the
                   regular employees. In this background, particularly in view of
                   the continuing Scheme, the ex-serviceman emplayed after
                   undergoing the selection process, need not be subjected to the
                   agony, anxiety, humiliation and vicissitudes of annual
                   termination and re-engagement, merely because their
                   appointment is termed as ad hoc appointments.



                   18. We are therefore of the view that the learned Single Judge
                   was justified in observing that the process of termination and
                   reappointment every year should be avoided and the
                   appellants should be continued as long as the Scheme
                   continues, but purely on ad hoc and temporary basis,
                   coterminous with the Scheme. The Circular dated 17-3-1995
                   directing artificial breaks by annual terminations followed by
                   fresh appointment, being contrary to the PIF Additional
                   Scheme and contrary to the principles of service jurisprudence,
                   is liable to be quashed."

              Court in

              (through its Registrar), 1999 SCC OnLine P&H 1181, where the
              Petitioner was appointed as a Public Relations Officer on ad-hoc
              basis for six months or till the filling up of the post on regular

              basis, whichever was earlier. Subsequently, an advertisement
              was issued for the post of Public Relations Officer along with
              other posts for filling up the post on regular basis. Petitioner also
              applied for the post and in the meantime, the terms of ad-hoc
              appointment of the Petitioner was extended by a period of six
              months. Petitioner had some grievance with the advertisement
              regarding the qualifications, which according to him, were tailor
              made to suit certain candidates. Petitioner also urged that his
              ad-hoc appointment should continue till regular appointment
              was made and the order by which his services were terminated
              be quashed. The High Court allowed the writ petition partly and
              the action of the University in curtailing the extension of the term
              was set aside with a direction to allow the Petitioner to continue
              on ad-hoc/temporary basis till the regular selection was made to
              the post of Public Relations Officer. Relevant part is as under:-




 
"6. The other prayer made in the writ petition is for quashing the
              order by which the services of the petitioner were terminated and
              the term of his extension curtailed till 31 December 1998. We find
              merit in this grievance of the petitioner. It has time and again
              been 
laid down by
 this Court that the services of an
              adhoc/temporary employee can be terminated only on account
              of unsatisfactory work or if the post is not available or when a
              regularly selected candidate becomes available for appointment.
              The services of an ad hoc employee cannot be terminated without
              any reason when the post continues to exist and the University
              itself has readvertised the same to fill it up on regular basis. An
              ad hoc employee cannot be allowed to be replaced by another ad
              hoc employee or by some one on officiating basis as that would
              smack of arbitrariness. Some good reason has to be stated for
              terminating the services of ad hoc temporary employee The
              University being a statutory body is a "State" for purposes of 
Art.
              12
 of the Constitution and every action of it should be guided by
              public interest and if it is shown that the exercise of power
              arbitrary, unhurt or unfair, the some will have to be struck
              down. We see no reason why the service of the petitioner should
              have been terminated when the post war available and the
              University having granted extension to hit tenure had to curtail
              the same when the Syndicate decided in the same very meeting
              that the post be filled up and it constituted a selection committee
              for the purpose. In the circumstances, the petitioner has a right
              to continue as a Public Relations Officer on ad hoc temporary
              basis till the University makes a regular selection Since the
              services of the petitioner were terminated without assigning any
              valid reason the same is held to be illegal and arbitrary and is
              hereby quashed.
 
The view that we have taken finds support from
              the judgments of this Court in the Rajni Bala case (
vide supra),
              and Balwan Singh
 case (vide supra)."

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                       OA No. 1549/2025




              a controversy raised by the Petitioners that they were appointed
              for a period of 11 months on contractual/ad-hoc-basis and
              therefore, till such time the regularly selected candidates are
              available, their services ought not to be terminated by other
              Assistant Professors/Lecturers on contractual/ad-hoc basis on
              the same terms and conditions. Challenge was also made to a
              Wesh advertisement issued by the State for appointment of ad
              hoc Assistant Professors/Lecturers for a period of 11 months. It is
              also urged that Petitioners were holding requisite qualifications
              and there was no justification for the State Government to issue
              fresh advertisement for recruiting ad-hoc or contractual
              appointees against the posts occupied by the Petitioners.
              Relevant paras of the judgment are as follows:-




 
"33. This Court has carefully perused the judgments in the case of
              
Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (2) (Supra.)
 
and
              
Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3) (Supra.)
 as well as
              the judgment in Official Liquidator v Dayanand (Supra.) 
and
              
Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation v. Casterihe
              Rajya Parivahan Karmchari Sanghatana (Supra.
).
 
In the case of
              
Secretary, State of Karnataku v. Umadevi
 (2) (Supra), a
              reference was made se a Larger Bench of the Supreme Court
              regarding the issue whether employees appointed by the State or
              as Instrumentalities on temporary or casual bosis, or on daily
              wage, have a right to approach the High Court for issuance of a
              Writ of Mandamus directing that they may be made pernement
              or absorbed in the ports on which they are working.
 
In
              paragraph 26 of 
Secretary, State of Karnataka v Umadevi
 (3)
              (Spa), the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court did not
              approve of the principles of law 
laid down in
 paragraph 50 of
              
State of Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra
), to the extent that
              direction send to the States to prepare a scheme for
              regularization of the temporary or casual or daily wage
              workers.
 
The reference to the Constitution Bench wax regarding
              regularisation of such employees and to that extent the principles
              of law 
laid down in
 
State of Haryana v Piara Singh (Supra
),
              have been overruled by 
Secretary, State of Karnataka v Umadevi

              (3) (Supra).
 
In paragraph 50 regarding touching upon the
              regularization of temporary/casual workers and daily wagers
              have been averruled However, the principle of law enunciated in
              the judgment of 
State of Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra
.), that
              adhoc employees should not be replaced by another adhoc
              employees has not been overruled. The judgment of State of
              Haryana.
 
Piara Singh
 (Supra), as a whole, has not been
              overruled and the principles of law laid down to the effect that
              adhoc employees should not be replaced by other adhoc
              employees still holds good.


              xxxx                     xxxx             xxx

 
36. The principles settled in the decision of 
Secretary, State of
              Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3) (Supra), are those pertaining to
              regularization of temporary/casual/daily wage workers.

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                        OA No. 1549/2025




              Having regard to the above, this Court is inclined to agree with
              the submissions advanced by learned Senior Counsel for the
              petitioners that ime principle of law 
laid down in
 
State of
              Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra
), that adhoc employees ought not
              to be replaced by another set of adhoc employees, but only by
              regularly selected candidates, has not been diluted and still holds
              good.


              xxxx                       xxxx             xxx

 
38. It appears from the submissions made on behalf of the GPSC
              that the requisition for filling up regular posts has come from the
              State Government on 07.08.2013. The procedure for regular
              recruitment is still underway and, as per the submissions made
              by Mr. D. G. Shukla, learned Advocate for the GPSC, it may take
              another 10 to 12 months to complete the same. It may be true
              that the petitioners do not have any permanent right to the posts
              that they are occupying on adhoc basis; however, it is difficult to
              understand what rational purpose would be served in
              terminating the services of the petitioners and engaging fresh
              adhoc persons for eleven months. Such action would be in
              contradiction to the principle of law 
laid down in
 the case of
              
State of Haryana v. Piara Singh (Supra
.)
 
as quoted in the
              judgment of 
Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3)
              (Supra). Moreover, it would lead to multifarious litigation, as is
              already the case.


              39. As has been submitted on behalf of the petitioners, the
              challenge in the present petitions is limited only to the extent of
              the termination of the services of the petitioner to make way for
              another set of adhoc employees. It does not extend to those
              Assistant Professors/Lecturers, who may have been appointed in
              the Government Engineering Colleges and Government
              Polytechnics, pursuant to the advertisement dated 15.08.2013, or
              to any other vacant posts.



              40. Accordingly, as a cumulative effect of the above discussion
              and for reasons stated hereinabove, and in view of the judgment
              of the Division Bench dated 07.09.2011 passed in Letters Patent
              Appeal No. 2986/2010 and connected matters, the petitions are
              partly allowed to the extent that the services of the petitioners as
              Assistant Professors/Lecturers on temporary/contractual basis
              in Government Engineering Colleges and Government
              Polytechnics shall not be terminated, till regularly selected
              candidates by the GPSC are available. It is clarified that this
              judgment shall not confer any right upon the petitioners to the
              posts on which they are working, after the regularly selected
              candidates through the GPSC are available."



 
21. Counsel for the Petitioner has relied on several judgments, of
              this Court and the Central Administrative Tribunals, wherein
              reliefs have been granted to contractual employees, following the
              principle elucidated by the Supreme Court in 
Piara Singh

              (supra), however, this Court does not find the necessity to refer

                                            29

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                        OA No. 1549/2025




              to all of them and burden this judgment as the principle is well
              settled in 
Piara Singh
 (supra).
 
Relevant would it be to refer to the
              judgment judgment in 
Harihar Yadav
 (supra), wherein the
              Supreme Court held that both States and Corporations have
              conveniently ostracized the concept of 'model employer' and that
              it would not be wrong to say that they have done so with pacific
              calmness, sans vision, shorn of responsibility and oblivious of
              their role in such a situation. Neither have the States nor the
              Corporations thought even for a moment of the livelihood of
              these employees. It is imperative for justice that a contractual
              employee be not replaced by another contractual employee
              leading the former in a despicable and abandoned state.


              22. The crucial fact that needs to be highlighted in the present
              case is that at the time when the Petitioners came to be
              appointed, no regularly selected candidates were available
              and/or appointed to the post of Master Trainer and additionally,
              even today the advertisement impugned herein is not for
              appointment on regular basis and significantly, Respondents
              through the impugned advertisement seek appointment of
              Master Trainers only on contract basis. Therefore, it is not the
              case where Respondents have decided to replace the Petitioners
              with regular set of employees and the advertisement clearly
              reflects that it is to replace Petitioners with another set of
              contractual employees on the same terms and conditions as the
              Petitioners and concerned posts have been transferred en-masse
              from the WCSCs to the University. While there cannot be a
              quarrel with the proposition that being contractual employees,
              Petitioners cannot claim a permanent right to the posts and as
              and when regular appointment process is initiated, at best, they
              would be entitled to a right to apply and consideration as per
              law, given that they are otherwise eligible. Petitioners have
              averred at several places in the writ petition that they are not
              seeking regularization but only seek to continue till they are
              replaced by regular appointees and this position was reiterated
              by counsel for the Petitioners during the course of hearing. The
              scope of the present writ petition is, therefore, in a narrow
              compass as noted above, as to whether their services can be
              replaced by another set of contract employees, which the
              Respondents seek to do through the impugned advertisement and
              the answer can only be an emphatic 'No'. 
In view of the binding
              dictum of the Supreme ctum of the Supreme Court in 
Piara Singh

              (supra), in my view, the action of the Respondents to replace the
              Petitioners is totally untenable and unsustainable in law.




 
23. Much was argued by counsel for the Respondents that the
              judgment in 
Uma Devi
 (supra) supports the case of the
              Respondents and rules against the contentions of the Petitioners.
              This contention, in my view, merits rejection.
 
The principle
              settled in the decision of 
Uma Devi
 (supra) was primarily with
              respect to regularization of temporary/casual/daily wager
              employees and does not deal with the principle of law settled by

                                            30

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                        OA No. 1549/2025




              the Supreme Court in 
Piara Singh
 (supra) i.e. contract/ad-hoc
              employees cannot be replaced by another set of contract/ad-hoc
              employees but only by regularly selected candidates and this
              principle has not been diluted in 
Uma Devi
 (supra) or thus far by
              any other judgment of the Supreme Court or a Bench of equal or
              larger strength and still holds good.
 
Counsel for the Respondents
              has tried to distinguish the judgment in the 
Narender Singh
              Ahuja
 (supra) of the Division Bench of this Court by urging that
              the judgment was carried in appeal to the Supreme Court and
              while the SLP was dismissed in limine, the question of law was
              left open and therefore, it is no longer open for the Petitioners to
              rely on the judgment which has lost its precedential välue.
 
The
              argument does not any way inure to the advantage of the
              Respondents since the case of the Petitioners is based on the
              binding dictum of the Supreme Court in 
Piara Singh
 (supra) and
              therefore, even if the question of law is kept open, Respondents
              have been unable to show any judgment of the Supreme Court
              which lays the law contrary to the one propounded in 
Piara
              Singh
 (supra) In Vidyavardhaka Sangha (supra), the Supreme
              Court has held that appointments made for a specified period of
              time come to an end by afflux of time and persons holding the
              posts cannot have any right to continue. The question that arises
              in the present petition of replacement of a contract employee
              with another contract employee was not the issue arising for
              consideration in the said case and the judgment is thus
              distinguishable on the facts.
 
The judgment in 
Shri Bhoop Singh

              (supra) was on a different conspectus of facts. In the said case,
              the Petitioners were sought to be replaced by outsourcing the
              work of security to an outside agency and the Court held that
              while there is no dispute to the proposition of law that one set of
              contract employees cannot be replaced by another set of contract
              employees, however, it is different where the employer changes
              the method of security by giving the responsibility to a security
              agency specialized in the field and where the terms of
              engagement of the new employees are wholly different.
 
A bare
              reading of the facts in 
Satish Jeshi
 (supra) shows that the
              question for consideration before the Division Bench of this Court
              was whether the Respondent therein had a vested right in
              continuing with his employment once the contract came to an
              end by afflux of time and the issue that arises in the present case
              was not even remotely the question before the Division Bench i.e.
              replacement of a contract employee by another contract
              employee.




              24. Accordingly, it is directed that the Petitioners shall be re-
              engaged by the Respondents by renewing their contracts and
              their services shall not be dispensed with till regularly selected
              candidates join the posts in question. It is made clear that this
              judgment does not confer any rights upon the Petitioners to
              continue after the regularly selected candidates are appointed
              and nor should the observations of the Court be construed to

                                              31

Item No. 21/C-II

              mean or connote that the Court has conferred the status of
              regular employees on the Petitioners."

                   "13. The petitioners except petitioners No.4 and 7 are

                   that work is available and petitioners are working on contract
                   basis. The petitioners are not claiming regularisation or pay
                   scale at par with permanent or regular employees. The limited
                   prayer of the petitioners is that they may be permitted to

13. The said judgment dated 3.11.2014 of the Hon'ble High
                   Court of Delhi in 
Narinder Singh Ahuja
's case (supra) was
                   challenged by the Union of India before the Hon'ble Supreme
                   Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court has dismissed the Special
                   Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8706/2018 vide Order/Judgment
                   dated 27.3.2015 (Annexure A/7).
 
In 
Shikha Jain
's case (supra),
                   the applicants, eight in numbers, who had been working as
                   Programme Assistant on contract basis in the National Aids
                   Control Organization of Ministry of Health and Family
                   Welfare, Govt. of India, have approached this Tribunal vide
                   OA No.2149/2016. The grievance of the applicants therein was
                   that the respondents have not been extending their respective
                   contract beyond 30.6.2016 mainly on the ground that the
                   respondents 16 OA No-2112 of 2020 have decided to hire the
                   support staff from the domestic budgetary support through an
                   outsource agency.
 
After considering various decisions of the
                   Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as the judgement of the Hon'ble
                   Delhi High Court in 
Narinder Singh Ahuja
's case (supra), this
                   Tribunal held in paragraphs 9 and 12 of the Order/judgment
                   dated 12.8.2016 (Annexure A/8) as under:-




                         "9. Admittedly, it is not the case of the respondents that
                         there is no work available after 30.06.2016. On the

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                                            OA No. 1549/2025




                         other hand, it is specifically stated that they will hire the
                         support staff through an outsourced agency. That
                         means that the respondents are intending to replace the
                         applicants, who are working on contract basis, for the
                         last few years, with another set of contract employees,
                         may be, through outsourced agencies. The said action of
                         replacing one set of contract employees with another set
                         of contract employees is clearly against to the settled
                         principles of law. Even the aforesaid decision of the
                         Hon'ble High Court is to the same effect."



                         "12. In the circumstances and for the aforesaid reasons
                         the OA is partly allowed and accordingly, the
                         respondents are directed to continue the applicants on
                         the same terms and conditions as long as there is work
                         or till the vacancies are filled up on regular basis. No
                         order as to costs."



 
15. From the law 
laid down by
 the Hon ble Apex Court in 
Piara
                   Singh
's case (supra) and that by the Hon ble High Court of
                   Delhi in Narinder Singh Ahuja's 19 OA No-2112 of 2020 case
                   (
supra) and Shikha Jain
's case (supra), it is evident that
                   replacement of a contract employee(s) by fresher(s), junior(s)
                   or even a staff from an outsource agency is prohibited. No
                   statutory provision has been brought to our notice by the
                   respondents, which takes away the right of preferential
                   treatment to the daily wager or contractual employees, who
                   are already engaged and are working for continuation on
                   contract to junior(s), fresher(s) or the person(s) to be engaged
                   through outsourcing agency to be taken away.




                   16. 
In view of the facts as noted hereinabove and law as 
laid
                   down by
 the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and Hon'ble High
                   Court of Delhi, referred to hereinabove, we are of the
                   considered view that action of the respondents of not
                   continuing the engagement of the applicants as Driver on
                   contract basis and their action of replacing them by another
                   set of contractual employees through outsourcing is not
                   tenable in the eyes of law.




                   17. In the result, for the foregoing reasons, the present OA is
                   partly allowed and the respondents are 20 OA No-2112 of
                   2020 directed to continue the applicants on the same terms
                   and conditions of on contract basis as long as there is work
                   available with the respondents and/or till the vacancies are
                   filled up on regular basis. The respondents are further directed
                   to issue consequential order as expeditiously as possible and in
                   any case within four weeks of receipt of a copy of this Order.
                   No costs."

        10.4 Judgment of this Tribunal dated 23.01.2020 in OA No.

        2302 of 2019 in the matter of 
Kavita Vs. Govt. of Nctd
.




        Paras 14 and 15 of the judgment reads as under:



 
" 14. From the facts and circumstances of the case, it is clear
                   that though the applicants were engaged as per the offer of
                   appointment letters under the alleged scheme and policy
                   
referred to above
, on part time hourly basis and though the
                   respondents have submitted that the applicants can work in
                   the remaining time after 32 hours per week anywhere else, but
                   however, in view of the monthly biometric attendance sheet
                   shown to us, it is clear that the applicants are actually working
                   regularly for 7 to 9 hours a day and moreover as per paras 6 &


 
11 of the terms and condition of offer of appointment extracted
                   above, their original certificates were kept with the
                   respondents as such practically they are not allowed to work
                   for any other employer, we are of the view that engagements
                   of the applicants are nothing but a new device of engagement
                   to deprive the applicants the status of contract engagement so
                   as to deny them the benefit of even continuity of engagement,
                   in accordance with the law 
laid down by
 the Hon'ble Supreme
                   Court in catena of cases right from 1992 in the above said
                   
Piara Singh
's case (supra) and in 
Uma Devi
's case (supra)
                   which has been emphatically stated in the above extracted
                   portion of the judgment in Sheo Narain case (supra), until
                   regular appointments are made to the said posts and,
                   therefore, the action of the respondents including the above
                   extracted scheme and policy are against the principles of law
                   laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above referred
                   cases and also against the principles underlying 
Article 14
, 16

                   of the Constitution of India as stated in the above said case of
                   Sheo Narain and are in contravention of the duty enjoined on
                   the respondent-state under 
Article 37
 read with 
Article 39 (d)

                   and (e) of the Constitution of India and also in view of the
                   experience gained by the applicants for having worked with
                   the respondents from the academic year 2017-2018, the
                   respondents are bound by the law laid down by the Hon'ble
                   Supreme Court referred to and extracted above to continue the
                   applicants until the respondents make regular appointments
                   as per Recruitment Rules.




                   15. Accordingly the OA is partly allowed with a direction to the
                   respondents to continue the engagement of applicants in the
                   posts kept vacant in view of the interim order dated 22.11.2019
                   until the making of regular appointments as per Recruitment
                   Rules. No order as to costs."

        10.5 Judgment of the Hon‟ble High Court of Delhi dated

        03.11.2014 in WP(C) No. 1741/2014 in the matter of Narinder

        Singh Ahuja and ors. Vs. The Secretary, Ministry of

        Health. Paras 15 to 17 of the judgment reads as under:



                   "15. In the opinion of this Court, since the respondents nowhere
                   dispute that there is need for the performance of the work that
                   the petitioners were discharging all along and there is also no
                   dispute that the project and funding (for the project) would
                   continue till 2017, the decision to discontinue the petitioners'
                   engagement is based only on the policy to outsource the
                   contractual employment to a third party. The petitioners are
                   not insisting on regularization, given the nature of the
                   employment or engagement, which is project based. However
                   apart from the decision to "outsource" engagement, of contract
                   employment to a third agency, there is no rationale to
                   discontinue the petitioners contracts. The justification that the
                   employees engaged through the contractor are paid lower
                   wages is arbitrary, because the "outsourced" or outsourcing
                   agency would have to be paid its service charges. The lower
                   wages paid, therefore, is, in effect, because of the charges/fees
                   paid to the contractor/outsourced agency. The facts of this
                   case clearly reveal that even though the work is to be
                   performed by contractual employees, the reason for
                   discontinuance of the petitioners' employment is not their
                   replacement with regular appointees, but instead, with
                   another set of contractual employees. The state/respondents
                   cannot, in the circumstances of this case, say that
                   discontinuance of such employment cannot be gone into by the
                   Court because the petitioners were aware that their contracts
                   ended.



                   W.P.(C) 1741/2014 Page 15


                   16. For the above reasons, this court is of opinion that the CAT
                   erred in law, in holding that the petitioners could not complain
                   against the discontinuance of their contractual employment.
                   Accordingly, a direction is issued to the respondents to
                   continue the petitioners in contractual employment on annual
                   renewal basis, till the currency of the RNTCP scheme/project
                   in 2017. An appropriate consequential order shall be issued by
                   the respondents within eight weeks from today.



                   17. The impugned order of the CAT is accordingly set aside, the
                   writ petition is allowed in terms of the above directions."

        Para 5 of the judgment reads as under:



 
"5. The issue is thus well settled on the basis of the judicial
                   precedents cited above that a set a contractual employees shall
                   not be replaced by another set of contractual employees except

                   of contractual employees has not been dealt with, therefore,
                   that judgment is distinguishable.




                   24. In view of above, let this matter be placed before the
                   Hon'ble Chairman on administrative side for constituting a
                   Full Bench to decide the issue authoritatively whether one set
                   of contractual employees can be replaced by others when
                   process for regular selection has already been initiated."



 
10.8 Judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court dated 07.09.2003

        in the matter of 
Hargurpratap Singh Vs. State of Punjab

        and others
 in Civil Appeal No. 8745/2003. Para 3 of the

        judgment reads as under:




                   "3. We have carefully looked into the judgment of the High Court
                   and other pleadings that have been put forth before this Court. It is
                   clear that though the appellants may not be entitled to regular
                   appointment as such it cannot be said that they will not be entitled
                   to the minimum of the pay scale nor that they should not be
                   continued till regular incumbents are appointed. The course
                   adopted by the High Court is to displace one ad hoc arrangement
                   by another ad hoc arrangement which is not at all appropriate for
                   these persons who have gained experience which will be more

                   beneficial and useful to the colleges concerned rather than to
                   appoint persons afresh on ad hoc basis. Therefore, we set aside the
                   orders made by the High Court to the extent the same deny the
                   claim of the appellants of minimum pay scale and continuation in
                   service till regular incumbents are appointed. We direct that they
                   shall be continued in service till regular appointments are made on
                   minimum of the pay scale. The appeals shall stand allowed in part
                   accordingly."



        10.9 Judgment of the the Hon‟ble Supreme Court decided on

        06.12.2000 in the matter of Commissioner, Kendriya

        Vidyalya Sangathan & ors. Vs. Anil Kumar Singh &

        Ors. in Civil Appeal No. 11785/1996. Paras 1 and 2 of the

        judgment reads as under:



                   "1. The employer Commissioner, Kendriya Vidyalaya
                   Sangathan is in appeal against the judgment of the Madhya
                   Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 782 of 1995 which
                   was upheld in appeal by the Division Bench. The respondents
                   had been appointed on contractual basis and just before the
                   expiry of the contractual period, they approached the High
                   Court with the prayer that their services should not be
                   terminated until the posts are filled up by a process of regular
                   recruitment. The learned Single Judge by his order dated 6-4-
                   1995 disposed of the writ petition following an earlier
                   judgment of be allowed to continue till the posts are filled up
                   by process of regular recruitment, and those petitioners should
                   be allowed to compete with other candidates if they apply for
                   selection and if they are otherwise not disqualified. The High
                   Court also took additional care by indicating that the writ
                   petitioners cannot claim any additional advantage by virtue of
                   their experience by working for the contractual period. 
In the
                   aforesaid premises, we do not find any infirmity with 
the said
                   judgment
 of the High Court to be interfered with by this Court.
                   The expression "if they are otherwise not disqualified" would
                   obviously mean they must have the necessary qualifications,
                   as required, under the relevant rules for being appointed as a
                   teacher and then they have to compete along with others for
                   adjudication of their merit for being appointed. The
                   apprehension of the employer that the impugned judgment
                   directs condonation of the age is wholly unfounded.




                   2. In the aforesaid premises, we do not find any justification
                   for interference with the direction given by the High Court.
                   Civil appeals are accordingly dismissed."

Item No. 21/C-II

                                                             OA No. 1549/2025


 
11. On equal pay for equal work, the applicants are discharging
      duties similar to those of regular Law Officers. The Hon‟ble
      Supreme Court in 
Jagjit Singh
 (supra) held that temporary
      employees performing the same duties as regular employees
      cannot be paid less than the minimum of the pay scale of regular
      employees, subject to differences in qualifications and recruitment
      process.




 
12. Keeping in view the law 
laid down by
 the Hon‟ble Courts and
      this Tribunal in the judgments 
referred above
, we hold that the
      applicants are entitled to wages at least equivalent to the
      minimum of the pay scale attached to the post of Law Officer in
      Delhi Prisons. However, parity in allowances such as LTC,
      gratuity, etc., which are service benefits attached to regular
      employment, cannot be extended in absence of statutory rules or
      scheme.




      13. On claim for service benefits, while applicants‟ grievance about
      denial of leave, HRA, EPF etc. is understandable, grant of such
      benefits is a matter of policy. 
In 
Secretary, State of
      Karnataka & Ors. Vs. Umadevi & Ors.
, (2006) 4 SCC 1, the
      Hon‟bleSupreme Court cautioned against judicial directions
      amounting to creation of service conditions for contractual staff.
      Therefore, beyond wages at par with regulars, applicants cannot
      claim parity in other allowances. However, statutory benefits like
      EPF and ESI, if applicable under law, must be extended.




      14. On legality of recruitment notice, in view of our finding, the
      advertisement seeking to engage another set of contractual Law
      Officers to replace the applicants cannot be sustained and is liable
      to be quashed. The respondents, however, remain at liberty to
      initiate a process for regular recruitment under applicable rules.



      15. For the foregoing reasons, the O.A. is partly allowed with the
      following directions:-

                                          39

         i.    The recruitment notice issued by the respondents of OIC-

               Estt.     Branch-PHQ           upload     memo        no.       F.18

               25.04.2025 (Annexure A-1) proposing to engage fresh
               contractual Law Officers is quashed.

        ii.    The applicants shall not be replaced by another set of
               contractual appointees. However, respondents are at liberty
               to initiate regular recruitment, in which case applicants
               shall also be free to apply subject to eligibility.
       iii.    The applicants shall be entitled to wages equivalent to the
               minimum of the pay scale of regular Law Officers from the
               date of joining the services of the respondents, but shall not
               be entitled to parity in allowances such as LTC, gratuity,
               etc., except statutory benefits like EPF/ESI wherever
               applicable.

       iv.     The respondents shall comply with these directions within a
               period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of
               this order.



      16. Pending MA (s), if any, shall also stand disposed of
      accordingly.



      17. No order as to costs.
