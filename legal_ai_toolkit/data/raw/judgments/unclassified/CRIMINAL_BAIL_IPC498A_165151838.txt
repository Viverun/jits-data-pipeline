                          said wedlock on 23.07.1999, who is presently 23 years of age.



                          3.     Disputes and differences arose between the parties which led the
                          respondent-husband to file a divorce petition against the appellant on
                          27.07.2001 in the Court of District Judge, Saharsa, Bihar.



                          4.     Subsequently, on an application of withdrawal being filed by the
                          respondent husband, the Court at Saharsa returned the Divorce Petition for
                          being filed in the Court of proper jurisdiction.



                          5.     Thereafter, the respondent filed a Divorce Petition in the District Court,
                          Delhi on 15.10.2001 under 
Section 13(1)
(i-a) and (i-b) of the 
Hindu Marriage
                          Act, 1955
 [in short 'the Act'] premised on the ground of cruelty and desertion.
                          The summons was issued to the appellant-wife but she refused to accept the
                          same. Based on the report of the process server to the effect that the appellant
                          refused to accept the summons, the appellant-wife was proceeded ex parte in
                          the divorce proceedings on 08.04.2003. Eventually, the divorce petition was
                          allowed and an ex parte decree of divorce on the ground of "desertion" was
                          passed in favour of the respondent-husband and against the appellant-wife, on
                          14.05.2003 by the Additional District Judge, Delhi.



                          6.     After about 18 months, on 25.11.2004 the appellant-wife filed an
                          application under 
Order IX Rule 13 CPC
 alleging that the summons issued by
                          the court in the divorce petition was neither tendered to her nor she refused to
                          accept the same. It was pleaded by her that she acquired the knowledge of the
                          ex parte divorce decree dated 14.05.2003 only on 30.08.2004, when the copy
                          of said ex parte divorce decree was filed by the respondent-husband in her
                          maintenance proceedings pending in the Court at Madhepura, Bihar.
                          Additionally, it was pleaded by the appellant-wife that the respondent-husband

                          had earlier filed a divorce case in the Court at Saharsa, which was withdrawn
                          by him for being filed in the Court at Madhepura in Bihar, therefore, the
                          divorce petition could not have been filed before the District Judge, New Delhi.



                          7.     The respondent filed his reply, pleading that the appellant was having
                          knowledge of the Divorce Petition filed by him in Delhi and that he has already
                          re-married to Smt. Sanju Devi, D/o of Sh. Ramji Prasad Bhagat on 24.11.2004
                          as per Hindu rites and customs.



                          8.     Learned Additional District Judge, Delhi vide impugned order dismissed
                          the application of the appellant-wife under 
Order IX Rule 13 CPC
 on the
                          ground that the appellant-wife was aware of the divorce petition pending in the
                          Court at Delhi and that the contention that she had not been duly served and
                          had not refused to accept the notice of the petition, cannot be accepted. To
                          return this finding, the learned Additional District Judge has relied upon the
                          pleadings and the orders passed in other litigations between the parties wherein
                          there is a specific reference to the divorce petition having been filed by the
                          respondent-husband in the Court at Delhi. The learned Additional District
                          Judge also relied upon the cross-examination of the appellant-wife and her
                          father in a petition filed by the appellant-wife seeking maintenance [Misc. Case
                          No.27 /2001] wherein they had admitted about the pendency of the divorce
                          proceedings pending between the parties. The material part of the impugned
                          order reads as under: -



                               "The entire record thus speaks unequivocally to the effect that the
                               applicant was aware of the divorce petition pending in the Delhi

                               in the Anticipatory Bail Petition No.27/2002 filed by the non-
                               applicant in the court of Ld. Sessions Judge at Madhepura, that the
                               applicant was aware of the divorce petition having been filed by the
                               non-applicant at Delhi Courts through the show cause petition filed
                               by the non-applicant dated 22.07.2002 filed by the non-applicant in
                               Misc. Case No.27/2001 in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First
                               Class, Madhepura. The applicant was also aware of the pendency of
                               the divorce petition at Delhi, in view of order dated 16.09.2002 of the
                               Hon'ble High Court of Patna in Criminal Misc. No.12273/2002, the
                               anticipatory bail application filed by the non-applicant, the applicant
                               was aware of the pendency of a divorce petition other than the divorce
                               petition filed by the non-applicant, which was returned on 21.08.2001
                               by the Ld. District Judge at Saharsha as being pending on the date
                               31.11.2002, as per her statement dated 30.11.2002 in Misc. Case
                               No.27/2001, as per her cross-examination before the Court of the
                               Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Madhepura, that the father of the
                               applicant Sh. Vijay Kumar Bhagat was also aware of the pendency of
                               a divorce petition other than the divorce petition already withdrawn,
                               as per cross-examination dated 02.12.2002 before the Court of the
                               Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Madhepura in Case No.27/2001 and
                               the copy of that divorce petition was with the lawyer of the father of
                               the applicant, as per the cross-examination of Sh. Vijay Kumar
                               Bhagat.



                               It is thus apparent that the contention of the applicant that she was
                               not aware of the pendency of the divorce proceedings in the Court at
                               Delhi and had not been duly served with the notice of the petition and
                               had not refused to accept the same cannot be accepted."



                          9.     The appellant who appeared in-person has submitted that the respondent-
                          husband has not only played a fraud upon the appellant but has also played
                          fraud upon the Hon'ble Court. She submits that the earlier divorce petition was
                          filed by the respondent before the District Judge, Saharsa but the said petition
                          was withdrawn by the respondent stating that the Saharsa District court has no
                          jurisdiction and only the Madhepura District Court had jurisdiction and

                          21.08.2001. She contends that the appellant always had an impression that the
                          divorce petition will be filed only in Madhepura Court, Bihar but the
                          respondent committed fraud by filing the divorce petition in the Court at Delhi.
                          She further submits that she had no knowledge about the divorce petition
                          pending before the Additional District Judge, Delhi. It is further contended
                          that the appellant was not a party to the anticipatory bail applications filed by
                          the respondent and his family members in Complaint Case No.577/2001,
                          therefore, knowledge cannot be attributed based on the averments made in the
                          said applications or orders passed therein. She, thus, prayed for setting aside of
                          the impugned order as well as the judgment and decree of divorce dated
                          14.05.2003.



                          10.    Per contra, Mr Neeraj Shekhar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of
                          the respondent, contends that the service of summons was earlier refused by
                          the appellant and such refusal has been recorded by the postal authorities on
                          the registered cover. Subsequently, the summons was directed to be served
                          through the District Judge, Madhepura but the appellant again refused to accept
                          the same, therefore, a copy of the same was affixed by the process server on a
                          conspicuous part of the appellant's residence. He thus, urged that the appellant
                          was duly served. He further contends that in any case, the defendant had notice
                          of the date of hearing in the divorce petition, therefore, the learned Additional
                          District Judge has rightly refused to set aside the ex parte decree. To add
                          emphasis to his argument, he invited attention of the court to - (i) order dated
                          25.02.2002, whereby the anticipatory bail application of the family members of
                          the respondent-husband was dismissed; (ii) anticipatory bail application
                          no.27/2002 filed by the respondent in Complaint Case No.577/2001 under

                          First Class, Madhepura in Misc. Case No.27/2001 seeking maintenance,
                          wherein she has admitted that the respondent has filed a case of divorce against

                          the appellant's father has admitted about the divorce case having been filed by
                          the respondent and a copy of the divorce case being in possession of their
                          advocate.     The learned counsel further contends that not only the respondent
                          has remarried but he has two children from the said wedlock, therefore, the
                          present appeal is infructuous.



                          11.     We have considered the rival submissions made by the appellant
                          appearing in-person, as well as, by the learned counsel for the respondent and
                          have examined the record.



                          12.     The mode of delivery of summons through registered/speed post and the
                          effect of refusal by the defendant to take delivery of the postal article
                          containing summons, has been provided in Rule 9 of Order V of the Code,
                          which after the amendment of 2002, reads as under:-

                               Court:

                               Provided that the service of summons under this sub-rule shall be
                               made at the expenses of the plaintiff.

                               defendant resides outside the jurisdiction of the Court in which the
                               suit is instituted, and the Court directs that the service of summons on
                               that defendant may be made by such mode of service of summons as is
                               referred to in sub-rule (3) (except by registered post acknowledgment
                               due), the provisions of Rule 21 shall not apply.

                               (5) When an acknowledgment or any other receipt purporting to be
                               signed by the defendant or his agent is received by the Court or postal

                               endorsement purporting to have been made by a postal employee or
                               by any person authorised by the courier service to the effect that the
                               defendant or his agent had refused to take delivery of the postal
                               article containing the summons or had refused to accept the summons
                               by any other means specified in sub-rule (3) when tendered or
                               transmitted to him, the Court issuing the summons shall declare that
                               the summons had been duly served on the defendant:

                               Provided that where the summons was properly addressed, pre-paid
                               and duly sent by registered post acknowledgment due, the declaration
                               referred to in this sub-rule shall be made notwithstanding the fact that
                               the acknowledgment having been lost or mislaid, or for any other
                               reason, has not been received by the Court within thirty days from the
                               date of issue of summons.

                                (6) The High Court or the District Judge, as the case may be, shall
                                prepare a panel of courier agencies for the purposes of sub-rule (1)."



                          13.    It is clear from the perusal of above provision that one of the modes of
                          delivering of summons as prescribed under Order 5 Rule 9(3) includes service
                          through registered post acknowledgement due or by speed post. Order 5 Rule
                          9(5) specifically provides that if there is a refusal by the defendant to take
                          delivery of the postal article containing summons and the same is received
                          back by the Court with an endorsement made by a postal employee to that
                          effect, the court issuing summons is obliged to declare that the summons had
                          been duly served on the defendant.



                          14.    Order V Rule 17 of the Code deals with a somewhat similar situation
                          where the serving officer tries to serve the summons and the defendant refuses
                          to accept or sign the acknowledgement. Order V Rule 17 reads as under:



                                "17. Procedure when defendant refuses to accept service, or cannot
                                be found.--Where the defendant or his agent or such other person as
                                aforesaid refuses to sign the acknowledgment, or where the serving
                                officer, after using all due and reasonable diligence, cannot find the
                                defendant , [who is absent from his residence at the time when service
                                is sought to be effected on him at his residence and there is no
                                likelihood of his being found at the residence within a reasonable
                                time] and there is no agent empowered to accept service of the
                                summons on his behalf, nor any other person on whom service can be
                                made, the serving officer shall affix a copy of the summons on the
                                outer door or some other conspicuous part of the house in which the
                                defendant ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally
                                works for gain, and shall then return the original to the Court from
                                which it was issued, with a report endorsed thereon or annexed
                                thereto stating that he has so affixed the copy, the circumstances
                                under which he did so, and the name and address of the person (if
                                any) by whom the house was identified and in whose presence the
                                copy was affixed."

                          15.    The above provision makes it evident that that when the defendant
                          refuses to sign the acknowledgement, the serving officer is obliged to affix a
                          copy of the summons on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the
                          house in which the defendant ordinarily resides and is obliged to return the
                          original summons to the court from which it was issued, with a report endorsed
                          thereon or annexed thereto stating that he has so affixed the copy, the
                          circumstances under which he did so, and the name and address of the person
                          (if any) by whom the house was identified and in whose presence the copy was
                          affixed.



                          16.    Initially summons in the divorce petition was issued to the appellant on
                          16.10.2001 for 20.12.2001 but the postal authorities reported that on repeated
                          visits the addressee could not be found. Again, fresh summons was issued on
                          20.12.2001 for 07.03.2002 but after repeated visits, the postal authorities gave
                          the report on 17.01.2002 that the addressee had refused to accept the registered
                          post. In view of the endorsement of refusal, the service stood effected on the
                          appellant but at that juncture the Court did not make a declaration that the
                          summons had been duly served on the appellant, in terms of Order V Rule 9(5)
                          
CPC
.



                          17.    Summons was then issued on 16.05.2002 but the process issued was not
                          received back. Vide order dated 28.11.2002, learned Additional District Judge,
                          Delhi issued fresh summons for service through registered post, as well as,
                          through the concerned District Judge, but the same were received back
                          unexecuted.



                          18.    Again on 23.01.2003, summons was issued for 08.04.2003 through

                          registered post, as well as, through the concerned District Judge. The summons
                          sent through registered post were received back unexecuted with the report that
                          "lene se inkaar karne par chipka diya". The process server also tried to serve
                          the appellant but as the appellant had refused to accept the same, therefore, a
                          copy of the summons and the petition, were affixed by him on a conspicuous
                          part of the appellant's residence in the presence of two witnesses, namely, Sh.
                          Sanjeev Kumar and Chowkidar Sh. Paswan. The report of the process server,
                          duly affirmed before the Nazir of the Court at Madhepura, is part of the lower
                          court record.      The service was thus, effected on the appellant as per the
                          procedure laid down in Rule 17 of 
Order V CPC
.



                          19.    On the basis of the report of the process server, and regard being had to
                          the previous refusal, the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi vide order
                          dated 08.04.2003 proceeded ex-parte against the appellant. We are also of the
                          view that the procedure adopted for effecting the service on appellant was
                          proper and the service was complete. There is no irregularity in the service of
                          summons and the learned Additional District Judge has rightly held that the
                          appellant had been duly served with the summons in the divorce petition.



                          20.    There is another aspect of the matter. Even if there is any irregularity in
                          the service of summons, still in view of the second proviso to Rule 13 of Order
                          IX an ex-parte decree cannot be set aside on the ground of irregularity in
                          service of summons, if the Court is satisfied that appellant had notice of the
                          date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear in the Court. At this juncture,
                          it is apposite to reproduce the provisions of 
Order IX Rule 13 CPC
, which
                          reads as under:

                                apply to the Court by which the decree was passed for an order to set
                                it aside; and if he satisfies the Court that the summons was not duly

                                appearing when the suit was called on for hearing, the Court shall
                                make an order setting aside the decree as against him upon such
                                terms as to costs, payment into Court or otherwise as it thinks fit, and
                                shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit:

                                Provided that where the decree is of such a nature that it cannot be

                                all or any of the other defendants also:

                                Provided further than no Court shall set aside a hdecree passed ex

                                service of summons, if it is satisfied that the defendant had notice of
                                the date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear and answer the
                                plaintiff's claim.

                                Explanation.--Where there has been an appeal against a decree
                                passed ex parte under this rule, and the appeal has been disposed of

                                withdrawn the appeal, no application shall lie under this rule for

                                mandatory in nature. Thus, it is not permissible for the court to allow

                          divorce petition having been filed by the respondent in the Court at Delhi, has
                          been mentioned in the - (i)      application for anticipatory bail filed by the

                          respondent/husband in the aforesaid case; (iii) reply to show cause notice
                          submitted by the respondent in the Misc. No.27/2001 filed by the appellant in
                          the court of CJM, First Class, Madhepura claiming maintenance from the
                          respondent; and (iv) order dated 16.09.2002 passed by the High Court of Patna
                          in Crl.Misc.No.12273/2002 granting anticipatory bail to the respondent; but
                          these documents do not indicate other details apropos the divorce petition viz.,

                          knowledge of the divorce petition pending in the Court at Delhi could be
                          attributed to the appellant but it cannot be said with certainty that she had
                          notice of the "date of hearing", which is a requirement under the second
                          proviso to Rule 13 of

                          Judicial Magistrate, First Class Madhepura, cannot be ignored.



                                (i)        The relevant part of the appellant's statement dated 30.11.1992
                                reads as under:



                                       "12. My husband has filed the case of divorce against me. I don't
                                       know that when the case of divorce was filed."

                                                                                        (emphasis supplied)


                                (ii)       The relevant part of the statement dated 02.12.2022 of the
                                appellant's father, Shri Vijay Kumar Bhagat, reads as under:



                                       "19. My daughter Seema used to go to Bakhtiyarpur. I have not
                                       attended the Court case of divorce filed by my son-in-law. I have
                                       learnt about divorce case recently. Advocate sahib has taken the
                                       copies etc. of divorce case. It is not correct that divorce case was
                                       filed at first."

                                                                                        (emphasis supplied)
                                  Conjoint reading of the statements of the appellant and her father makes
                          it evident that the appellant has been served with summons and she had handed
                          over the copy of the divorce petition to her Advocate, which leads to the
                          conclusion that the appellant had the notice of the "date of hearing" in the
                          divorce petition and had sufficient time to appear in the Court and answer
                          respondent's claim.



                          24.     Notably, the divorce suit filed in the court at Saharsa was withdrawn by
                          the respondent on 21.08.2001, while the divorce petition was filed by him in
                          the District Court, Delhi on 15.10.2001, therefore, the admission of appellant
                          and her father made subsequently in their statements on 30.11.2002 and
                          02.12.2002, respectively, as regard the divorce case having been filed by the
                          respondent, undoubtedly alludes to the divorce petition filed in Delhi.

                          25.    In the circumstances, the contention of the appellant that she was not
                          duly served and that she had no knowledge of the divorce petition filed by the
                          respondent before the Court in Delhi is bereft of any merit.



                          26.    The contention of the appellant that the respondent withdrew the divorce
                          petition filed before the District Judge, Saharsa for filing it before the District
                          Court, Madhepura but the respondent committed fraud upon the appellant by
                          filing it before the District Court in Delhi instead of Madhepura, is also without
                          substance. The order dated 21.08.2001 of District Judge, Saharsa vide which
                          Divorce Petition no.12/2001 was withdrawn from Court at Saharsa does not
                          record that the divorce petition is being withdrawn for being filed at
                          Madhepura.       Rather the order mentions that the divorce petition is being
                          withdrawn for being filed before the Court of proper jurisdiction. The material
                          part of the said order reads as under :



                                "A petition has been filed on behalf of plaintiff/petitioner praying
                                there in that to return the plaint in order to get it filed in a Court of
                                proper jurisdiction as there appears no jurisdiction of this case in the
                                instant case. Heard arguments for the Plaintiff/Petitioner.
                                Since the plaintiff/Petitioner himself wants to withdraw the suit, let the
                                plaint of this suit be returned to him accordingly. Accordingly this suit
                                stands disposed of."

                          The appellant, in any case, could have objected to the territorial jurisdiction of
                          the Court at Delhi to entertain the divorce petition filed by the respondent after
                          entering her appearance in the divorce petition, but she chose not to appear
                          despite service and adequate notice of the date of hearing.



                          27.    Another submission of the learned counsel for the respondent is that
                          after seventeen months of the ex-parte decree, the respondent has remarried
                          and now has two children from the second marriage - one son aged about 16

                          years and a daughter aged about 15 years. During the course of arguments, we
                          have specifically put to the appellant whether she admits second marriage of
                          the respondent, to which her reply is evasive. She states that the second
                          marriage of the respondent is not a subject matter of the present appeal and it is
                          for the court to decide about the legal status of the second marriage. The
                          appellant did not, however, deny or dispute the factum of the respondent's
                          second marriage. On the contrary, the respondent through an affidavit dated
                          08.08.2007 has placed on record the fact that he has remarried on 24.11.2004.



                          28.    The legal status of the respondent's second marriage and its bearing on
                          the present appeal, however, has to be tested on the anvil of 
Section 15
 of the
                          Act, which reads thus:



                                "15. Divorced persons when may marry again.--When a marriage
                                has been dissolved by a decree of divorce and either there is no right
                                of appeal against the decree or, if there is such a right of appeal, the
                                time for appealing has expired without an appeal having been
                                presented, or an appeal has been presented but has been dismissed, it
                                shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to marry again."



                          29.    In terms of 
Section 15
 of the Act, either party to the marriage is well
                          within his or her right to marry when the time for filing an appeal has expired
                          without an appeal having been preferred, or an appeal has been presented but
                          the same has been dismissed. The bar or impediment to contract a second
                          marriage operates during the pendency of appeal only if an appeal is preferred
                          within the period of limitation. In other words, the provision enables parties to
                          marry again only after the decree of divorce has become final.



 
30.    The provision of 
Section 15
 of the Act has been subject matter of a
                          recent decision of the Supreme Court in 
Krishnaveni Rai v. Pankaj Rai and

                          Anr., (2020) 11 SCC 253. In that case the ex-husband of appellant wife
                          remarried as no appeal was filed within period of limitation. The appeal was
                          preferred by the appellant wife almost one year after the expiry of period of
                          limitation. In this factual backdrop, the Supreme Court held that bar of 
Section
                          15
 was not attracted, it was lawful for the ex-husband to remarry and the
                          appeal was infructous from the inception. The relevant extract of the judgment
                          reads as under:




                               "28. 
Section 15
 clarifies that when a marriage has been dissolved by
                               a decree of divorce, and there is no right of appeal against the decree,
                               or if there is such a right of appeal, the time for appealing has expired
                               without an appeal having been preferred, or an appeal has been
                               presented but the same has been dismissed, it shall be lawful for
                               either party to the marriage to marry again. Had it been the
                               legislative intent that a marriage during the pendency of an appeal
                               should be declared void, Section 11 would expressly have provided so.



 
29. As held by this Court in 
Anurag Mittal v. Shaily Mishra
                               Mittal [Anurag Mittal
 v. Shaily Mishra Mittal, (2018) 9 SCC 691 :


 
(2018) 4 SCC (Civ) 550] , the object of 
Section 15
 is to provide
                               protection to the person who had filed an appeal against the decree of
                               dissolution of marriage and to ensure that such appeal was not
                               frustrated. The protection afforded by 
Section 15
 is primarily to a
                               person contesting the decree of divorce. As observed by Bobde, J. in
                               his concurring judgment in

                               pp. 702-703, paras 31 & 33)

                               "I am in agreement with the view taken by Nageswara Rao, J. but it is
                               necessary to state how the question before us has already been settled

Even when the words of the proviso were
                               found to be prohibitory in clear negative terms -- "it shall not be
                               lawful", etc., this Court held that the incapacity to marry imposed by

                               more difficult to infer nullity when there is no prohibition; where
                               there are no negative words but on the other hand positive words like
                               "it shall be lawful".
 
Assuming that a marriage contracted before it
                               became lawful to do so was unlawful and the words create a
                               disability, it is not possible to infer a nullity or voidness vide paras 9
                               and 10 of 
Lila Gupta
 case [
Lila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain
, (1978) 3 SCC
                               258] . ...


                                                                    ***

 
33. What is held in essence is that if a provision of law prescribes an
                               incapacity to marry and yet the person marries while under that
                               incapacity, the marriage would not be void in the absence of an
                               express provision that declares nullity. Quae incapacity imposed by
                               statute, there is no difference between an incapacity imposed by
                               negative language such as "it shall not be lawful" or an incapacity
                               imposed by positive language like "it shall be lawful (in certain
                               conditions, in the absence of which it is impliedly unlawful)". It would
                               thus appear that the law is already settled by this Court that a
                               marriage contracted during a prescribed period will not be void
                               because it was contracted under an incapacity. Obviously, this would
                               have no bearing on the other conditions of a valid marriage. The
                               decision in 
Lila Gupta
 case [
Lila Gupta v. Laxmi Narain
, (1978) 3
                               SCC 258] thus covers the present case on law."




                               31. In any case, the bar of 
Section 15
 is not at all attracted in the facts
                               and circumstances of this case, where the appeal from the decree of
                               divorce had been filed almost a year after expiry of the period of
                               limitation for filing an appeal. 
Section 15
 permits a marriage after
                               dissolution of a marriage if there is no right of appeal against the
                               decree, or even if there is such a right to appeal, the time of appealing
                               has expired without an appeal having been presented, or the appeal
                               has been presented but has been dismissed. In this case, no appeal
                               had been presented within the period prescribed by limitation.



                               32. The bar, if any, under 
Section 15
 of the Hindu Marriage Act
                               applies only if there is an appeal filed within the period of limitation,
                               and not afterwards upon condonation of delay in filing an appeal
                               unless of course, the decree of divorce is stayed or there is an interim
                               order of court, restraining the parties or any of them from remarrying
                               during the pendency of the appeal.

                                  33. As observed above, the appeal was infructuous for all practical
                                  purposes, from the inception, since the appellant's ex-husband had
                                  lawfully remarried after expiry of the period of limitation for filing an
                                  appeal, there being no appeal till then."

                                                                                      (emphasis supplied)



 
31.       When confronted with 
the above decision
 in 
Krishnaveni Rai
 (supra),
                          the appellant submits that it will not apply in case where the husband has
                          obtained ex parte decree of divorce and that too by committing fraud.




                          32.       It is trite that the dissolution of marriage is complete once the decree is
                          made. A decree of divorce breaks the marital tie and the parties forfeit the
                          status of husband and wife in relation to each other. Each one becomes
                          competent to contract another marriage as provided by 
section 15
 of the Act1.
                          In law the effect of ex parte decree of divorce is not different from a contested
                          one. Even 
Section 15
 of the Act does not make any distinction between a
                          contested decree and an ex parte decree. Therefore, in case of an ex parte
                          decree of divorce also it shall be lawful for either party to the marriage to
                          marry again if no appeal is filed against such decree within the period of
                          limitation.



                          33.       In the present case no appeal was preferred within the period of
                          limitation or even thereafter. The application under 
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC
 was
                          also filed after seventeen months from the date of ex parte decree as against
                          limitation period of thirty days from the date of decree as provided under
                          
Article 123
 of the 
Limitation Act
, despite the appellant having been duly
                          served with summons. 
In the circumstances, it was lawful for the respondent

                          husband to solemnize another marriage. We have already observed that no
                          fraud has been committed by the respondent. Summons was also served on the
                          appellant as per the procedure prescribed in law. This being the position, an
                          application under 
Order 9 Rule 13 CPC
 filed by the appellant a day after the
                          second marriage was solemnized by the respondent-husband, was infructuous
                          for all practical purposes, from the very inception. So is the present appeal.




                          34.    In view of the above, there is no merit in the appeal and accordingly, the
                          same is dismissed.
