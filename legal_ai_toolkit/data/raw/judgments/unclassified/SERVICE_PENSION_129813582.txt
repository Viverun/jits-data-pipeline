     of notice of Rule for the respondents.



2.   With the consent of the learned advocates appearing

     for the respective parties, the petitions were taken up

     for its final disposal on 5.1.2022.



3.   In all these petitions, under 
Article 226
 of the

     Constitution of India, the petitioners who were

     erstwhile employees of the State Government and

     ultimately on retirement there-from were absorbed

     with the Food and Civil Supplies Department, a Public

     Sector undertaking, initially, prayed for a relief of

     granting the benefit of medical allowance in their

     monthly pension as well as family pension to the

     heirs. When the petitions have come up for hearing,

     the learned counsels for the respective parties have

     made a statement that as far as their grievance of

     family pension is concerned, the same has been

     resolved, inasmuch as, family pension is now being

     paid to them by virtue of the GR dated 10.7.2019. The

     only controversy therefore that remains is that of

     granting of the benefit of the medical allowance in

  C/SCA/3180/2019                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



     their monthly pension.



4.   For the purposes of this judgment, facts of Special

     Civil Application No.3180 of 2019 are seen.



      4.1. The petitioners are senior citizens and they

      have approached this Court inasmuch as, it is their

      case that the State is not implementing the verdict

      given by this Court in cases of similarly situated

      pensioners who are co-employees of the present

      employers in respect of grant of medical allowance

      in their monthly pensions. The petitioners had joined

      the Food and Civil Supplies department on different

      dates and, thereafter upon creation of the Gujarat

      State Civil Supplies Corporation on 2.10.1980, the

      petitioners are the employees of Civil Services

      Department and were sent on deputation to the

      Corporation. In the year 1986, the State Government

      decided to absorb the employees sent on deputation

      to the Corporation and other employees like the

      petitioners were permanently absorbed. All those

      employees had been treated to have retired from

      government service with effect from 4.12.1998 and

      were         sanctioned       pension        from            the         State

      Government.        Their      pension       is   also         commuted.



      Thereafter, 1/3rd of commuted pension was restored

      on completion of fifteen years and such pension

      payment         orders    are      placed        on       record.           The

      petitioners are also granted 50% of DA merger.



5.   Ms.      Harshal    Pandya,        learned        counsel           for       the

     petitioners would submit that the petitioners are not

     being paid medical allowance which other pensioners

     are      being     receiving       as      monthly           pension.            A

     representation       was      made,        which,         however            has

     remained unanswered. Ms. Pandya for the petitioners

     would place reliance on the decision of this Court

     rendered in SCA No.12918 / 2010 with SCA No.12929

     / 2010 dated 5.4.2019, wherein, an identical issue of

     the retired employees of the Gujarat State Civil

     Supplies Corporation in context of prayer to direct

     them to pay medical allowance with the pension was

     considered. She would submit that following the

     earlier decision rendered in SCA No.16209 of 2013


                                 Page 4 of 40


                                                            Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022

  C/SCA/3180/2019                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



     the Court allowed the petition with a direction to see

     that the medical allowance is sanctioned to the

     petitioners and paid alongwith family pension. She

     would therefore submit that the petitioners being

     similarly situated are entitled to the benefits of

     medical allowance as it forms part of components of

     pension as decided by this Court. The aforesaid

     decision was even confirmed in appeal as the LPA

     against       the   said    judgments        have         not        been

     entertained.



6.   Learned       AGP    Mr.     Thakkar      appearing           for       the

     respondent - State would draw the attention of the

     Court to the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent-



     State and submit that the case of the petitioners does

     not fall within the parameters of Rule 9(55) of the

     Gujarat Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 2002 and,

     therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to seek the

     benefits of medical allowance as a part of their

     pension. Reliance is also placed on Rule 51(2)(c) of

     the Rules which provides for retirement benefits and

     the submission is made that the medical allowance


                                Page 5 of 40


                                                      Downloaded on : Tue Feb 08 22:21:23 IST 2022

 C/SCA/3180/2019                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



   and medical reimbursement would not form part of

   the retirement benefits and, therefore, the petitioners

   accordingly are not entitled to the benefits of medical

   allowance. The pension defined in Rule 9(55) is

   referred to for the purposes of this submission.



     6.1. Reading the affidavit-in-reply, learned AGP

     would further submit that the petition is barred by

     delay and latches inasmuch as the petitioners have

     been fence-sitters. They have not approached this

     Court within time and they have slept over their

     rights and chosen not to come to this Court. Fence-



 
sitters cannot be given the benefit of identical order

     of the Court, merely, because such an order is

     passed in the case of other co-employees. Reliance is

     placed on the decision in the case of 
State of Uttar

     Pradesh v. Arvind Kumar Shrivastava
 reported

     in 2015(1) SCC 237. The relevant paragraphs of

     that judgment are read before this Court to submit

     that fence-sitters who have acquiescence cannot be

     given the benefit of a subsequent decision of the

     Court.

7.   Ms. Pandya on the other hand would rely on the

     following decisions:



               (1) Vipulkumar Atmaram Parekh v. State
               of Gujarat reported in 2009(5) GLR 3914 -

          (4)   Union of India v. Krishna Rao
 reported
          in 2018(18) SCC 107 - Para 12


8.   Considering the above submissions made by the

     learned advocates for the respective parties, the issue

     need not detain us for long.



9.   In an extensive consideration made by this Court in

     SCA No.16209 of 2013, a judgment which was

     rendered by this Court on 20.10.2015 which was

     subsequently followed in the decision dated 5.4.2016

     in SCA No.12918 of 2010, the Court extensively

     considered the provisions in context of the prayer of

     payment of medical allowance to the petitioners who

     were          employees   of     the     Industrial          Research

   Laboratory and the Court has in the decision dated

   5.4.2016 rendered in SCA No.12918 of 2010 in the

   context of the State Civil Supply Corporation, which

   were the co-employees of the petitioners, held as

   under extensively reproducing the decision. The

   Court observed in para Nos.7 and 8 as under:



              "7. In my view, this issue is no longer
              res-integra, after the pronouncement of the
              judgment and order of this Court dated
              30th October, 2015 passed in the Special Civil
              Application No.16209 of 2013. The order reads
              thus:



              "1 By this writ application under 
Article 226
 of
              the Constitution of India, the       petitioners
              retired    Government      employees,       have
              prayed for the following reliefs:



              7. The petitioners respectfully pray that, on the
              basis of the facts and circumstances as
              mentioned hereinabove and which may be
              urged at the time of hearing, the Honourable
              Court may be pleased to issue a writ of
              mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order
              or direction to the respondent authorities and
              may be pleased to:



              (A) declare and hold that the petitioners are
              entitled and eligible for the benefit of medical
              allowance in monthly pension and the family
              pension, and

              (B) direct the respondent authorities to
              extend the benefit of medical allowance
              in their monthly pension and the benefit
              of family pension to the petitioners, and

              (D) pension admissible and final disposal
              of this petition, this Honourable Court may
              be pleased to direct the GIRDA, Res. No.4 to

              respect of grant of benefit of medical allowance
              and family pension to the petitioners so as to
              enable the authorities of the State Government
              to consider the same, and

              (E) pending admissible and final disposal
              of  this    petition,   this Honourable   Court
              may be pleased to direct the respondent
              authorities to start paying medical allowance to

              may consider as just and proper in the facts
              and circumstances of the case.



              2 The case of the             petitioners         may         be
              summarized as under;



              2.1 The petitioners joined the services of                  the
              State Government and were posted in                         the
              Industrial Research Laboratory (I.R.L.,                      for
              short) under the Administrative Control                       of
              the Commissioner of Industries. All                         the
              petitioners were holding the technical post.



              2.2 On 06.04.1981, the Gujarat Industrial
              Research and Development Agency (GIRDA,
              for short) was established.



              2.3      On      30.06.1982,      the     State
              Government accorded approval to the GIRDA
              to take over the Industrial Research Laboratory
              with effect from 01.04.1982, and accordingly,



                             Page 9 of 40

 C/SCA/3180/2019                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



              the same was taken over by the GIRDA. All the
              employees working in the I.R.L. were sent on
              deputation in the GIRDA. In the year 1982, the
              question of permanent absorption of the
              employees working in the I.R.L. cropped up in
              view of the merger of the I.R.L. with the
              GIRDA, In such circumstances, the State
              Government decided to call for an option from
              the employees of the I.R.L. whether they
              desired to be absorbed permanently in the
              GIRDA or not. While calling for such option, it
              was made clear to the employees working on
              the technical side that as everything was being
              taken over by the GIRDA, no technical post
              would continue, and therefore, upon giving
              option for being continued in the parent
              department,     their    services   would    be
              terminated.



              2.4 In such circumstances 
referred to above
,
              the petitioners were left with no other option,
              except being absorbed in the GIRDA, and
              accordingly, they were absorbed with effect
              from 01.10.1985 on permanent basis.



              2.5 After being absorbed in the GIRDA, all the
              petitioners were treated to have retired from
              the    services    of the   Government.     The
              pension      was sanctioned in favour of the
              petitioners with effect from 01.10.1985 for that
              period and were permitted to commute full
              pension. In the year 19981999, the State
              Government decided to grant the benefit of the
              commuted portion of pension to all the
              Government      employees     who   had    been
              absorbed in the Public Sector Undertaking /
              Autonomous Body. Since the authority delayed
              the process, the petitioners Nos.1 and 2 herein
              filed two Special            Civil Applications
              Nos.12436 and 12437 of 2009 respectively.



              Both the writ applications were disposed of in

              1. During the course of hearing, Mr.J.K.
              Shah, learned Assistant Government Pleader,
              has tendered the affidavit filed by Mr.Ramsing

 C/SCA/3180/2019                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



              in pension with effect from 01.04.2004,
              several    representations   were     made    in
              that    regard.   On 11.05.2011, the Finance
              Department clarified that since all the benefits
              were granted to the absorbed employees at par
              with the other pensioners, the      benefit   of
              merger of 50% D.A. would be also
              payable to such employees.



              2.7 On 28.07.2011, the District Treasury Office
              was instructed to pay pension after merging
              50% D.A.

              2.8 It is the case of the petitioners that in the
              pension, which is being paid to them, the
              medical allowance is not being paid. The other
              pensioners are being paid the medical
              allowance. The two widows of the Government
              employees also preferred representations for
              grant of the family pension upon death of their
              respective husbands who were absorbed and
              treated as retired from the Government
              services along with the present petitioners.
              However, the request was declined. On
              09.05.2012, the District Treasury Office,
              Vadodara replied that as there was no clear
              direction for payment of medical allowance, the
              same was not being paid. On the issue of family
              pension     and     medical     allowance,    the
              GIRDA informed the State Government that
              such benefits are not being paid to the
              employees of the GIRDA and appropriate
              instructions were sought in that regard by the
              GIRDA from the Government. The grievance of
              the petitioners is that they have all retired
              and although are entitled for the benefit
              of medical allowance in their monthly pension,
              yet the same has been wrongly denied without
              there being any legal basis for the same.



              3 Ms. Harshal Pandya, the learned advocate
              appearing for the petitioners submitted that

              although the Commissioner of Industries
              has issued appropriate directions as regards
              the payment of medical allowance, the
              authorities of GIRDA for some reasons or the
              other are not forwarding the proposal for the
              grant of medical allowance and family pension.



              4 Ms. Pandya submitted that it is not proper on
              the part of the State Government to harass
              helpless    widows.     According     to   Ms.
              Pandya,      the benefit of family pension is
              available to a widow / widower of a pensioner
              under the statutory rules of the Gujarat Civil
              Services (Pension) Rules, but the same has
              been denied despite the fact that the
              employees absorbed in other Boards /
              Corporations are being paid the same.



              5 Ms. Pandya submitted that her clients are all
              retired employees of the State Government and
              are claiming pension for the service rendered
              with the State Government. For the service
              rendered with the GIRDA, benefits have
              already been paid which do not include
              pension. Her clients are not claiming any
              benefit from the GIRDA.



              6 In such circumstances 
referred to above
, Ms.
              Pandya submitted that there being merit in this
              application, the same be allowed and
              appropriate Mandamus be issued.



              7 On the other hand, this writ application has
              been vehemently opposed by Mr. Swapneshwar
              Gautam, the learned Assistant Government
              Pleader appearing for the State respondent.
              Mr. Gautam placed reliance on the following

              9 Having heard the learned counsel appearing
              for the parties and having gone through the
              materials on record, the only question that falls
              for my consideration is whether the petitioners
              are entitled to reliefs, as prayed for, in this writ
              application.



              10 The word pensioner is defined in the Gujarat
              Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 2002. Pensioner
              means a retired Government employee who
              has been granted pension

              10.1 Rule 51 of the Gujarat Civil Service
              (Pension) Rules, 2002 provides benefit of family
              pension to the families of absorbed employees,
              which reads as under:



              Rule 51:   Pension on absorption in or
              under Public Sector undertaking:



              (2)(b)(i) The benefit of family pension under
              ChapterX of these rules shall be admissible
              only to the families of those who are actually
              in receipt of pension          from the State
              Government,     after their absorption in the
              Public Sector undertaking referred to in this
              rule. This benefit shall not be admissible to the
              families of those who got only the service
              gratuity.



              (ii) Family Pension shall not be admissible from
              only one source either from the State
              Government or the public sector undertaking
              referred to in this rule in case such public
              sector undertaking has a similar scheme for
              payment of family pension. The beneficiary
              shall be given option to choose either of the
              two scheme.



              (iii) Grant of family pension shall be subject to
              other conditions specified in Chapter X of these

              rules.



              (iv) It shall be responsibility of pension
              sanctioning authority to process the claim of
              family pension. He shall forward the claim of
              family pension after verifying that there exists
              no scheme for grant of family pension to the
              families of    the Government        employees
              already absorbed in the public sector
              undertaking.



              11 It appears from the stance of the GIRDA
              that the grant of benefit of restoration of
              pension, merger of D.A. and three increments,
              disentitle the pensioners to claim the family
              pension and medical allowance, as they cannot
              be treated as employees of the State
              Government. It also appears that the GIRDA
              proposes to rely upon a              Government
              Resolution dated 19.02.1974, by which, the
              State Government had declined to take the
              responsibility of paying the family pension.



              12 However, it appears that the State
              Government,      thereafter,   issued another
              resolution dated 01.04.1989 modifying the
              earlier resolution/policy    for     bringing
              uniformity in the mater of pensionery
              benefits. The relevant part of the resolution
              dated 01.04.1989 reads thus:



              At present the cases of Government employees,
              on deputation to Public Sector Undertaking
              of   the    State   Government,      who     are
              absorbed in the PSUs in public interest
              permanently, are regulated as per the
              provisions contained in the G.Rs. F. D. referred
              to in the preamble.        The    question     of

              Government of India had been under
              consideration of Government. After careful
              consideration, Government       has   decided
              that    in   partial   modification  to    the
              provisions contained in the GRs referred to in
              the preamble, the cases of the Government
              employees who select to be absorbed in the
              Autonomous body/Public Sector Undertaking
              will be regulated as under:



              (1)    A      Government       employee      on

              Undertaking/Autonomous body is eligible for
              prorata pension and DCRG based on the length
              of his qualifying services till the date of his
              absorption in the PSU/Autonomous Body. The
              pension will be calculated on the average
              emoluments for 3 years preceding the date of
              absorption and DCRG will be calculated on the
              basis of the emoluments immediately before
              absorption.



              (2) Within 6 months of absorption, every
              such    of Government employees, absorbed
              in PSUs/Autonomous bodies will exercise
              option for either of the two alternatives
              indicated below:



              (a) Receiving monthly pension and DCRG as
              per the rules or


              (b) Receiving DCTG and a lumpsum amount in
              lieu of pension worked out with reference to
              the commutation table. Were no option is
              exercised,   the   absorbed    employee   will
              automatically be governed under the option (b)
              above. The option once exercised will be
              final. The person who chooses the alternative
              mentioned in Para1 and 2(b) above, 1/3 of the
              lumpsum     amount    will   be  treated    as
              commutation of pension and 2/3 of the
              amount     will   be    treated as retirement

              benefits.



              (3) In case the Government employee,
              absorbed in PSU/Autonomous            Bodies,
              resigns after receiving pensionery benefits,
              the     resignation  will   be    treated as
              resignation from Government service and
              as a consequence of resignation, pensionary
              benefits received under these orders will be
              forfeited.



              (4) The absorbed Government employee will
              receive all the benefits admissible to other
              corresponding employees of PSUs/Autonomous
              bodies. But in respect of gratuity the sum total
              of the gratuity received from Government at
              the time of absorption and the gratuity
              received from the PSU/Autonomous body
              for service rendered there should not exceed
              the amount of gratuity that would have been
              received had he been continued in Government
              service and retired on the same pay which be
              drew on retirement from PSUs/Autonomous
              bodies.



              (5) Any further liberalisation of pension
              rule after permanent absorption will not be
              extended. However, if such         liberalisation
              comes into effect retrospectively i.e., with
              effect from the date prior to the date of
              absorption, the benefit will be admissible.



              (6) In the case where the absorbed
              employee elects to receive recurring pension
              and DCRG in terms of 1(2)(a) above, and
              wishes to commute some portion of his pension
              as per the rules, the same will be admissible.



              (7) These benefits will be admissible only if the
              absorption is in public interest.

              family pension. He should forward the claim for
              family pension after verifying that there exists
              no scheme for grant of family pension to
              the families of Government servant already
              absorbed in the PSUs/Autonomous bodies.



              (12) For actual payment of retired benefits as a
              consequence of absorption, the procedure
              prescribed for a retired employee should be
              followed.


              13    The     materials    on    record    would
              indicate     that    the     widows     of   the

              respective employees, who were absorbed in
              the Gujarat Water Resources Development
              Corporation and were receiving the pension
              from the State Government,          are    being
              granted the benefit of family pension.
              The G.W.R.D.C. is also a Public Sector
              Undertaking of the State Government. I see no
              good reason for the respondents to deny the
              benefit so far as the petitioners are concerned,
              including the widows. I also take notice of the
              Government resolution dated 03.10.2012
              sanctioning     the    medical allowance to the
              Government / Panchayat employees, etc, which

              RESOLUTION:



              Under the Government Resolution Dated :
              22/01/98, mentioned in the preamble, the state
              Government has decided to grant Medical
              Allowance     of    Rs.100/    per   month    to
              employees     as    well    as pensioners of the
              State Government and Panchayat. The revision
              of the existing rate of Medical Allowance was
              under consideration of the          Government.
              After       careful      consideration       the
              Government is pleased to revise the existing
              rate of Medical Allowance Rs.100/ per month to
              Rs.300/ per month with following conditions.



              1) These orders shall be applicable to
              employees and pensioners of the State
              Government, employees and pensioners of
              panchayat and Primary and Secondary School
              teachers as well as Work Charged employees
              (who have completed the service of one full
              year without any break).



              (2) These orders shall be implemented with
              effect from dated 01102012.



              (3)   Other   provisions   of   the   G.R.F,D.
              Dated      22011998      shall continue to be
              applicable.



              (4)  Accounting     system      and            conditions
              regarding option shall be as it is.



              14 I also take notice of the Government
              resolution dated 09.03.1999 as regards the
              absorption of the Government employees in the
              Public Sector Undertaking / Autonomous Body
              of the State Government. The same reads as

 C/SCA/3180/2019                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



              In   the    Government    Resolution Finance
              Department No.NVT1196 GOI10P,         dated:

              23.4.1998, Para 3 of the said Resolution
              is substituted as follow:



              3.    The      Government,      after    careful
              considerations, has decided to grant benefit
              of   restoration    of   one third    commuted
              portion of pension of pension after 15 years
              from the date of commutation or 1.4.1985,
              whichever     is   later notwithstanding    the
              fact that having commuted the full pension
              they were not in receipt of any monthly
              pension.



              15 I find merit in the submissions of Ms.
              Pandya that the confusion has been created by
              the Treasury Office, Vadodara, so far as the
              grant of family pension to the two widows is
              concerned. Ms. Pandya is right in submitting
              that the Treasury Office has no authority to
              take any decision in the absence of any
              direction or decision taken by the highest
              authority i.e. the Finance Department. I find
              substance in the submissions of Ms. Pandya
              that the petitioners are claiming the two
              benefits in their capacity as retired employees
              of the State Government i.e. for the services
              rendered with the State Government and not
              for the services rendered with the GIRDA. In
              fact, the GIRDA has nothing to do with this
              issue.



              16 In the result, this application is allowed. The
              State Government as well as the respondent
              No.3 herein are directed to see that
              the medical allowance is sanctioned and paid
              to the pensioners along with the monthly
              pension as they are receiving, and at the same
              time, the two widows are paid the family
              pensions in accordance with the rules
              governing the same. This exercise shall be

               today and the payment should be made with
               arrears from the date of filing of this petition."



               8 In the result, both the writ applications are
               allowed. The State Government as well as the
               respondents Nos.1 and 2 are directed to see
               that the medical allowance is sanctioned and
               paid to the petitioners along with a monthly
               pension as they are receiving. If any of
               the petitioners have passed away, then the
               widows shall be paid family pension            in
               accordance with the rules governing the
               same with the necessary benefits. Let this
               exercise be completed within a period of two
               months from today and the payment should be
               made with the arrears from the date of filing of
               these petitions. Direct service is permitted."



10. Accordingly, the case of the present petitioners is

    squarely covered by 
the above decision
.



11. To the submission made by learned AGP that the

    petitioners being fence-sitters and, therefore, the

    decision of 
State of Uttar Pradesh
 (Supra) should

    be made applicable, it is needless to say that by the

    decision in the case of Vipul Aatmaram Parekh

    (Supra), this Court observing as under (paragraph 9

    thereof) has held that if at any particular of point,

    there is decision of this Court every authority of the

    State Government is bound to follow the same and

   apply its mind and extended them to the employees

   rather than compel them to come to Court.




              "9. At the outset, it is required to be noted that
              the objection raised by the respondent No.3
              that while granting the benefit of higher pay
              scale on completion of 9 years service/seniority
              prior to the request transfer is not required to
              be counted is not sustainable in view of the
              many decisions of the Division Bench as well as
              learned Single Judges of this Court. Even, the
              controversy in question is now not res integra
              in view of the the decision of the Hon'ble
              Supreme Court in the case of Uttam Vishun
              Pawar (supra). All the decisions have been
              considered by this Court in the recent decision
              of this Court in the case of Naynaben Manubhai
              Vyas & Others(supra) dated 12.3.2009 in
              Special Civil Application No. 1446 of 1994 and
              other allied matters. In spite of the above
              decisions of this Court, since long the office of
              the respondent No.3 is raising same and similar
              objection driving the employee to the Court and
              to obtain the similar order. If, on a particular
              point there is a decision of this Court every
              authority of the State Government is bound to
              follow the same unless it is upset by the higher
              forum. The authority has to apply its mind
              before raising objection and grant the benefit
              accordingly and shall not compel the employee
              to obtain similar order from the Court. To raise
              the objections again and again which are
              overruled by the Court by decision would not
              only compelling the employee to incur the
              expenditure towards the legal proceedings but
              it will also increase the litigation and burden to
              the Courts, which are otherwise today heavy
              burdened due to backlog of cases and Courts
              are trying their best to get out of the backlog.

              Suchak (supra) the learned Single Judge of this
              Court as far as back in the year 1992 has
              observed that the Government should be model
              employer. The model employer is one who
              would not deny just claim of his employee and
              employees on any technical ground. Such
              model employer would not wait for any
              direction to be given to accept just claim of the
              employee/employees. It is further observed that
              once it is found that an employee is similarly
              situated the benefits flowing from a judgment
              in a case of other similarly situated employee,
              it should be given to other similarly situated
              employee and employee should not be driven to
              the Court for addressing just grievances. Even
              in the case of Secretary, Labour, Social Welfare
              & Tribunal Development Department & Anr.
              (Supra), the Full Bench of this Court in para 9
              and 10 has observed and held as under:



                   "9. The legal position regarding the
                   binding nature of judgments delivered by
                   High Courts was clearly explained as far
                   back as 1962 by the Supreme Court.

                   who was the legal position, the legal
                   position in paragraph 29 of the report as
                   follows:



                        This raises the question whether an
                        administrative tribunal can ignore
                        the law declared by the highest court
                        in the State and initiate proceedings
                        in direct violation of the law so
                        declared. Under 
Art. 215
, every High
                        Court shall be a court of record and
                        shall have all the powers of such a
                        court including the power to punish
                        for contempt of itself. Under Art:

                  226, it has a plenary power to issue
                  orders or writs for the enforcement
                  of the fundamental rights and for any
                  other purpose to any person or
                  authority, including in appropriate
                  cases any Government, within its
                  territorial jurisdiction. Under 
Art.
                  227
 it has jurisdiction over all courts
                  and      tribunals   throughout      the
                  territories in relation to which it
                  exercises jurisdiction. It would be
                  anomalous to suggest that a tribunal
                  over which the High Court has
                  superintendence can ignore the law
                  declared by that court and start
                  proceedings in direct violation of it. If
                  a tribunal can do so, all the
                  subordinate courts can equally do so,
                  for there is no specific provision, just
                  like in the case of Supreme Court,
                  making the law declared by the High
                  Court binding on subordinate courts.

                  It is implicit in the power of
                  supervision conferred on a superior
                  tribunal that all the tribunals subject
                  to its supervision should conform to
                  the law 
laid down by
 it. Such
                  obedience would also be conducive to
                  their smooth working: otherwise,
                  there would be confusion in the
                  administration of law and respect for
                  law would irretrievably suffer, We,
                  therefore, hold that the law declared
                  by the highest court in the State is
                  binding on authorities or tribunals
                  under its superintendence, and that
                  they cannot ignore it either in
                  initiating a proceeding or deciding on
                  the rights involved in such a
                  proceeding. If that be so, the notice
                  issued by the authority, signifying the
                  launching of proceedings contrary to

                       the law 
laid down by
 the High Court
                       would be invalid and the proceedings

                       jurisdiction."



 
The position was reiterated in 
Makhan Lal

                  1971 S.C. 2206. It was the context of the
                  law declared by the Supreme Court that
                  the decision laid down to that effect so far
                  as 
Article 141
 of the Constitution was
                  concerned, but what has been observed in
                  paragraph 5 at page 2209 by Grover J.
                  speaking for the Supreme Court has equal
                  application so far as pronouncements by
                  the High Courts are concerned. Grover J.
                  observed at page 2209:




 
"The Judgment which was delivered
                       did     not   merely     declare   the

laid down in

                       clear and unequivocal terms that the
                       distribution of appointments, posts or
                       promotions made in implementation
                       of the communal policy was contrary
                       to the constitutional guarantee of
                       
Article 16.
 The law so declared by
                       this court was binding on the
                       respondent State and its officers and
                       they were bound to follow it whether
                       a majority of the present respondents
                       were parties or not to the previous
                       petition."




 
It cannot, therefore, be contended by
                       anyone, that since Acharya, the
                       petitioner in Special Civil Application
                       No. 2215 of 1979, was not a party to
                       Special Civil Application No. 806 of
                       1975, that the law

                  Desai, J. in his judgment 
in that case

                  on August 7, 1975 was not applicable
                  to the case of Acharya.
 Whether the

                  or whether the law is declared by the

 1972 S.C.
                  2466, the legal position regarding
                  binding nature of the High Court's
                  decision was once again reiterated by
                  the Supreme Court and after quoting
                  the above passage which we have
                  extracted from the judgment of

                  Commercial Co. s case (supra) in

                  judgment, Dwiveid J. speaking for the
                  Supreme Court observed at page
                  2169:




 
"The conduct of the appellant in
                  following the previous decision of the
                  High Court is calculated to create
                  confusion in the administration of
                  law. It will undermine respect for law
                  
laid down by
 the High Court and
                  impair the constitutional authority of
                  the High Court. His conduct is
                  therefore comprehended by the
                  principles underlying the law of
                  contempt. The analogy of the inferior
                  court's disobedience to the specific
                  order of a superior court also
                  suggests that his conduct falls within
                  the purview of the law of contempt.

                  Just as the disobedience to a specific
                  order of the Court undermines the
                  authority and dignity of the court in a
                  particular    case,    similarly    any
                  deliberate and mala fide conduct of
                  not following the law 
laid down in
 the
                  previous decision undermines the
                  constitutional authority and respect
                  of the High Court. Indeed, while the
                  former conduct has repercussions on
                  an individual case and on a limited
                  number of persons, the later conduct
                  has a much wider and more
                  disastrous impact. It is calculated not
                  only to undermine the constitutional
                  authority and respect of the High
                  Court generally, but is also likely to
                  subvert the Rule of law and engender
                  harassing uncertainty and confusion
                  in the administration of law."




 
In 
Hashmukhlal C. Shah V. State of
                  Gujarat
, 19 G.L.R. 378, a Division
                  Bench of this High Court consisting
                  of J.B. Mehta and P.D. Desai JJ. after
                  examining several decisions on the
                  point, observed: "... in a Government
                  which is ruled by laws, there must be
                  complete awareness to carry out
                  faithfully and honestly lawful orders
                  passed by a Court of law after
                  impartial adjudication. Then only will
                  private individuals, organizations and
                  institutions learn to respect the
                  decisions of Court. In absence of
                  such attitude on the part of all
                  concerned, chaotic conditions might
                  arise and the function assigned to the
                  Courts of law under the Constitution
                  might be rendered a futile exercise."




                  From these four decisions,                        the
                  following propositions emerges:

                        (1).It is immaterial that in a previous
                        litigation the particular petitioner
                        before the Court was or was not a
                        party, but if law on a particular point
                        has been 
laid down by
 the High
                        Court, it must be followed by all
                        authorities and tribunals in the State.




 
(2).The law 
laid down by
 the High
                        Court must be followed by all
                        authorities and subordinate tribunals
                        when it has been declared by the
                        highest Court in the State and they
                        cannot ignore it either in initiating
                        proceeding of deciding on the rights
                        involved in such a proceeding.




 
(3).If in spite of the earlier exposition
                        of law by the High Court having been
                        pointed out and attention being
                        pointedly drawn to that legal position
                        in utter disregard of that position
                        proceedings are initiated, it must be
                        held to be a wilful disregard of the
                        law 
laid down by
 the High Court and
                        would amount to civil contempt as
                        defined in 
section 2(b)
 of the
                        Contempt Courts Act, 1971."




 
Thus, even the Division Bench has held
                   that not following the law 
laid down by
 the
                   High Court and disregarding the same
                   would amount to Civil Contempt as
                   defined in 
Section 2(b)
 of the of the
                   Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. However,
                   in view of the unconditional apology
                   tendered by the concerned officer, which
                   is accepted, no further order is passed."

 C/SCA/3180/2019                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 08/02/2022



   Supreme Court in paragraph Nos.4 to 8 has observed

   as under:




              "4. The principles underlying continuing
              wrongs and recurring/ successive wrongs have
              been applied to service law disputes. A
              `continuing wrong' refers to a single wrongful
              act which causes a continuing injury.
              `Recurring/successive wrongs' are those which
              occur periodically, each wrong giving rise to a
              distinct and separate cause of action. This
              Court in Balakrishna S.P. Waghmare vs. Shree
              Dhyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan - [AIR 1959 SC
              798], explained the concept of continuing
              wrong (in the context of Section 23 of
              Limitation Act, 1908 corresponding to 
Section 22

              of Limitation Act, 1963) :

              "31. It is the very essence of a continuing
              wrong that it is an act which creates a
              continuing source of injury and renders the
              doer of the act responsible and liable for the
              continuance of the said injury. If the wrongful
              act causes an injury which is complete, there is
              no continuing wrong even though the damage
              resulting from the act may continue. If,
              however, a wrongful act is of such a character
              that the injury caused by it itself continues,
              then the act constitutes a continuing wrong. In
              this connection, it is necessary to draw a
              distinction between the injury caused by the
              wrongful act and what may be described as the
              effect of the said injury."

In 
M. R. Gupta vs. Union of India
 [1995 (5)
              SCC 628], the appellant approached the High
              Court in 1989 with a grievance in regard to his
              initial pay fixation with effect from 1.8.1978.
              The claim was rejected as it was raised after 11
              years. This Court applied the principles of

              continuing wrong and recurring wrongs and
              reversed the decision. This Court held :


                  "5. ...The appellant's grievance that his
                  pay fixation was not in accordance with
                  the rules, was the assertion of a
                  continuing wrong against him which gave
                  rise to a recurring cause of action each
                  time he was paid a salary which was not
                  computed in accordance with the rules. So
                  long as the appellant is in service, a fresh
                  cause of action arises every month when
                  he is paid his monthly salary on the basis
                  of a wrong computation made contrary to
                  rules. It is no doubt true that if the
                  appellant's claim is found correct on
                  merits, he would be entitled to be paid
                  according to the properly fixed pay scale
                  in the future and the question of limitation
                  would arise for recovery of the arrears for
                  the past period. In other words, the
                  appellant's claim, if any, for recovery of
                  arrears calculated on the basis of
                  difference in the pay which has become
                  time barred would not be recoverable, but
                  he would be entitled to proper fixation of
                  his pay in accordance with rules and to
                  cessation of a continuing wrong if on
                  merits his claim is justified. Similarly, any
                  other consequential relief claimed by him,
                  such as, promotion etc., would also be
                  subject to the defence of latches etc. to
                  dis-entitle him to those reliefs. The pay
                  fixation can be made only on the basis of
                  the situation existing on 1.8.1978 without
                  taking     into     account     any     other
                  consequential relief which may be barred
                  by his latches and the bar of limitation. It
                  is to this limited extent of proper pay
                  fixation, the application cannot be treated
                  as time barred........."

              6.  
In 
Shiv Dass vs. Union of India
 - 2007 (9)
              SCC 277 Paras 8 & 10), this Court held:




                   "8... The High Court does not ordinarily
                   permit     a  belated    resort    to   the
                   extraordinary remedy because it is likely
                   to     cause    confusion     and     public
                   inconvenience and bring in its train new
                   injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is
                   exercised after unreasonable delay, it may
                   have the effect of inflicting not only
                   hardship and inconvenience but also
                   injustice on third parties. It was pointed
                   out that when writ jurisdiction is invoked,
                   unexplained delay coupled with the
                   creation of third party rights in the
                   meantime is an important factor which
                   also weighs with the High Court in
                   deciding whether or not to exercise such
                   jurisdiction.



                   10. In the case of pension the cause of
                   action actually continues from month to
                   month. That, however, cannot be a ground
                   to    overlook        delay    in     filing the
                   petition.......... If petition is filed beyond a
                   reasonable period say three years
                   normally the Court would reject the same
                   or restrict the relief which could be
                   granted to a reasonable period of about
                   three years."



              7. To summarise, normally, a belated service
              related claim will be rejected on the ground of
              delay and latches (where remedy is sought by
              filing a writ petition) or limitation (where
              remedy is sought by an application to the
              Administrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions
              to the said rule is cases relating to a continuing
              wrong. Where a service related claim is based
              on a continuing wrong, relief can be granted
              even if there is a long delay in seeking remedy,

               with reference to the date on which the
               continuing     wrong     commenced,      if   such
               continuing wrong creates a continuing source
               of injury. But there is an exception to the
               exception. If the grievance is in respect of any
               order or administrative decision which related
               to or affected several others also, and if the re-
               opening of the issue would affect the settled
               rights of third parties, then the claim will not
               be entertained. For example, if the issue relates
               to payment or re-fixation of pay or pension,
               relief may be granted in spite of delay as it
               does not affect the rights of third parties. But if
               the claim involved issues relating to seniority
               or promotion etc., affecting others, delay would
               render the claim stale and doctrine of
               laches/limitation will be applied. In so far as
               the consequential relief of recovery of arrears
               for a past period, the principles relating to
               recurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a
               consequence, High Courts will restrict the
               consequential relief relating to arrears
               normally to a period of three years prior to the
               date of filing of the writ petition.



               8. In this case, the delay of 16 years would
               affect the consequential claim for arrears. The
               High Court was not justified in directing
               payment of arrears relating to 16 years, and
               that too with interest. It ought to have
               restricted the relief relating to arrears to only
               three years before the date of writ petition, or
               from the date of demand to date of writ
               petition, whichever was lesser. It ought not to
               have granted interest on arrears in such
               circumstances."



13. For the aforesaid reasons, all these petitions are

    allowed. The respondents are directed to see that the

     petitioners are sanctioned medical allowance and the

     same is paid to the petitioners alongwith monthly

     pension in accordance with the directions issued by

     this Court in the case of Special Civil Application

     No.12918/2010. That exercise shall be completed

     within a period of two months from the date of receipt

     of copy of the order and the payment should be made

     with arrears from the date of filing of the petition.



     Rule is made absolute to the aforesaid extent. Direct

     Service is permitted.
