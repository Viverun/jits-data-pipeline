                       I.         INTRODUCTION


                       1.         Rule returnable forthwith. Learned Advocates for the
                                  respective parties waive service of notice of Rule. With the
                                  consent of the parties matter is taken up for final hearing.



                       2.         The present Revision Application has been filed to challenge
                                  the order dated 21.10.2022, passed by the 18th City Civil and
                                  Sessions Court in Civil Suit No. 220 of 2020, whereby the
                                  Ld. Trial Court rejected the application, below Exhibit 80,
                                  filed under the provisions of 
Order VII Rule 11 of the Code
                                  of Civil Procedure
, 1908 ("
CPC
").



                       3.         For convenience, the parties are referred to by their status
                                  before the Ld. Trial Court.



                       4.         The brief facts leading to the present Revision Application
                                  are as follows. The plaintiffs instituted Civil Suit No. 220 of
                                  2020, contending that under a partnership deed dated
                                  04.06.2003, the father of the plaintiffs and the father of
                                  defendants Nos. 1/1 to 1/6 had constituted a partnership firm
                                  under the name Tirupati Corporation. Upon the demise of
                                  both the original partners, and in terms of Clause 12 of the
                                  said partnership deed, the plaintiffs and defendants Nos. 1/1
                                  to 1/6 became partners of the said firm. The plaintiffs filed
                                  the suit seeking a declaration that, pursuant to the agreement
                                  dated 19.12.1983, they hold an undivided share in the suit
                                  property and further prayed for a direction to be issued to the



                                                                2

                                                                                                              undefined




                                  defendants Nos. 3 and 4 to execute a sale deed in favour of
                                  the Plaintiffs in respect of the said property.



                       5.         The Plaintiffs also sought to challenge the sale deed, dated
                                  18.11.2003, executed by defendant No. 4, in favour of
                                  defendant No. 5, as well as the sale deed, dated 14.11.2008,
                                  executed by defendants Nos. 1 and 2, in favour of defendant
                                  No. 6. A prayer for permanent injunction in respect of the suit
                                  property was also made. Subsequently, defendants Nos. 7 and
                                  8 were joined as parties, as defendant No. 7 had purchased a
                                  portion of the suit property on 26.07.2019, and defendant No.
                                  8 had purchased another portion on 20.02.2021.



                       6.         Defendant No. 7 thereafter filed an application under Order
                                  VII Rule 11(d) 
of the Code of Civil Procedure
, contending
                                  that the suit was not maintainable as (i) it was barred by
                                  
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, (ii) it was
                                  barred by limitation, and (iii) the plaintiffs had no cause of
                                  action to file the present suit. Upon consideration of the plaint
                                  and the documents annexed thereto, the Ld. Trial Court, by
                                  order dated 21.10.2022, dismissed the said application.
                                  Aggrieved thereby, the present Revision Application has been
                                  preferred.

                                                                                                              NEUTRAL CITATION




                             C/CRA/11/2023                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                              undefined




                                  Application under 
Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil
                                  Procedure
 is based on three principal grounds: (i) that the Suit
                                  is barred under 
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership Act,
                                  1932, (ii) that the plaint is barred by the law of limitation, and

                                  (iii) that the Plaintiffs have no legal right or locus to institute
                                  the Suit.



                       8.         On the first submission, namely that the Suit is barred by
                                  
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Ld. Senior
                                  Advocate for the Defendant has advanced detailed arguments
                                  by placing reliance on the cause title of the plaint. It is
                                  pointed out that the Plaintiffs have described themselves as
                                  the legal heirs of one of the original partners, namely
                                  Nanubhai Ranchhodbhai Bharwad, whereas Defendant Nos.
                                  1/1 to 1/6 are described as the legal heirs of the other partner,
                                  namely Manibhai Chhaganbhai Patel.



                       9.         It is submitted that a perusal of the Partnership Deed would
                                  reveal that there were only two partners in the firm, Tirupati
                                  Corporation. The Plaintiffs in the present Suit, while
                                  asserting themselves to be the partners of the said firm, have
                                  sought reliefs arising out of the said partnership deed. The
                                  Suit, it is urged, proceeds on the footing that the Plaintiffs, as
                                  partners of Tirupati Corporation, are entitled to specific
                                  performance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983, which was
                                  executed in favour of the said firm by Defendant No. 4.



                                                               4

                             C/CRA/11/2023                               JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                            undefined





                       10.        It is contended that, in view of the provisions of 
Section 69(1)

                                  of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Plaintiffs, suing as
                                  partners of an unregistered firm, cannot maintain the present
                                  Suit against Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, who are also claimed
                                  to be partners of Tirupati Corporation. The Plaintiffs have
                                  sought a direction against Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 to execute
                                  a sale deed exclusively in their favour, although they possess
                                  no independent or individual right in the Suit property. Their
                                  claim, it is submitted, is founded solely on the Agreement
                                  dated 19.12.1983 entered into by the partnership firm.



                       11.        It is further argued that, though the Plaintiffs have not sought
                                  any specific relief against the other partners, namely
                                  Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, the effect of the reliefs claimed is
                                  that the Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the Agreement
                                  in their own favour as partners of Tirupati Corporation. In
                                  view of the admitted position that the said firm is
                                  unregistered, the Suit, according to the Ld. Senior Advocate,
                                  is squarely hit by 
Section 69(1)
 of the Indian Partnership Act,
                                  1932, and is therefore not maintainable in law.



                       12.        It is further contended by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the
                                  Defendant that the Plaintiffs have sought to enforce rights
                                  arising from the agreement dated 19.12.1983, against
                                  Defendant Nos. 2 to 8, who are admittedly not partners of the
                                  firm Tirupati Corporation and are complete strangers to the
                                  said transaction. Since the firm is unregistered, any such

                             C/CRA/11/2023                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                              undefined




                                  attempt to enforce contractual rights on behalf of the firm is
                                  expressly barred under 
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership
                                  Act, 1932, and the Suit is therefore liable to be rejected as
                                  being barred by law.



                       13.        Moreover, it has been urged that the Plaintiffs have also
                                  prayed for reliefs challenging the sale deed dated 14.11.2008.
                                  The said sale deed, however, was executed by the partnership
                                  firm itself through its partner, namely the father of Defendant
                                  Nos. 1/1 to 1/6. The Suit, therefore, is in essence one seeking
                                  enforcement of contractual rights arising from transactions
                                  undertaken by an unregistered firm. In view of the statutory
                                  bar contained in 
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership Act,
                                  1932, such a Suit is not maintainable and must fail at the
                                  threshold.



 
14.        Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has relied on the
                                  decision in the case of 
Farooq vs. Shandhya Anthraper
,
                                  (2018) 12 SCC 580 more particularly paras: 5 and 6 which
                                  read as under:




                                         "5. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel
                                         appearing for the parties, it is clear that the plaint,
                                         read as a whole, relied upon Clause 25(d) of the
                                         partnership deed which specifically states that no
                                         partners of the firm shall without the consent in
                                         writing of the other partners be entitled to transfer
                                         immovable property belonging to the firm. The
                                         plaint then goes on to say that the suit schedule

                                                                                                                undefined




                                         property was purchased out of the funds of the firm
                                         for the purpose of development and sale. In Para 11,
                                         the plaintiffs discovered that a sale deed has been
                                         executed by the first defendant. It has been
                                         specifically stated that the plaintiffs had never
                                         consented to the same and the first defendant has no
                                         authority to sell any immovable property belonging
                                         to the firm.

                                         6.     The plaint, read as a whole, leaves no manner
                                         of doubt that the basis for the suit is 
Section 69
 of
                                         the Partnership Act read with Clause 25(d) of the
                                         partnership deed dated 29-12-1995. Para 18 of the
                                         plaint does not carry the matter further inasmuch as
                                         the only sentence which could possibly be relied
                                         upon, and which was relied upon by the High Court,
                                         is that the plaintiffs are entitled to file the suit even
                                         independently of the partnership firm. Having found
                                         that the basis of the suit is the factume of
                                         partnership and having relied upon Clause 25(d) of
                                         the partnership deed, it is clear that the trial court
                                         correctly found that the bar of 
Section 69
 of the Act
                                         was attracted in the facts of this case."

                       15.        Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has relied on the
                                  decision reported in in the case of Sri Velji Narayan Patel vs.
                                  Sri Jayanti Lal Patel, AIR 2009 Cal. 164 more particularly,
                                  Para 9, which reads thus:

                                                                                                               undefined




                                         registrar of firms. Sub-section (2) similarly
                                         disentitles the firm to institute a suit against a third
                                         party unless the firm is registered. The common
                                         feature between Sub-section (1) and Sub-section (2)
                                         is that such suit must relate to enforcement of right
                                         arising out of a contract of conferred by the Act. If a
                                         suit by a partner against a partner or firm does not
                                         relate to enforcement of a right arising out of a
                                         contract then there is no legal prohibition because
                                         the spirit of 
Section 69
 either of Sub-section (1) or of
                                         Sub-section (2) is that such suit must be related to
                                         enforcement of the right arising from a contract.
                                         Having gone through the plaint of the suit it clearly
                                         appears that the plaintiff instituted the suit as a
                                         partner for enforcement of his right arising out of
                                         the contract. The entire narrative of the plaint is for
                                         declaration that the plaintiff is the owner of 50 per
                                         cent of the share of the partnership business and for
                                         declaration that he is entitled to enjoy 50 per cent of
                                         the said business under the name and style of M/s.

                                         other documents and for declaration that the
                                         defendant is liable to disburse and pay plaintiffs
                                         share of profit in the business. Plaintiff does not sue
                                         in his individual capacity. The prayers in the plaint
                                         are basically for enforcement of his right as
                                         embodied in the partnership deed which was
                                         executed by and between the parties on 15th of
                                         April, 2000. In such circumstances, the provision of
                                         Sub-section (1) of 
Section 69
 appears to have hit the
                                         plaint. Order 7, Rule 11(d) contains "where the suit

Section 69(1)
 prohibits a suit amongst the
                                         partners of an unregistered partnership firm, for the

                                         or conferred by the Act, unless the suit amongst the
                                         partners is in the nature of dissolution of the
                                         partnership firm and/or rendition of accounts.

                                               effect is to render a suit by a plaintiff in respect
                                               of a right vested in him or acquired by him
                                               under a contract which he entered into as a

                                               existing or dissolved, void. In other words, a
                                               partner of an erstwhile unregistered
                                               partnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce
                                               a right arising out of a contract falling within
                                               the ambit of 
Section 69
 of the Partnership Act.
                                               In the instant case, Seth Sugan Chand had to
                                               admit in unmistakable terms that the firm
                                               "Sethiya & Co." was not registered under the
                                               
Indian Partnership Act
. It cannot also be denied
                                               that the suit out of which the appeals have
                                               arisen was for enforcement of the agreement
                                               entered into by the plaintiff as partner of
                                               Sethiya & Co. which was an unregistered firm.
                                               That being so, the suit was undoubtedly a suit
                                               for the benefit and in the interest of the firm and
                                               consequently a suit on behalf of the firm. It is
                                               also to be borne in mind that it was never
                                               pleaded by the plaintiff, not even in the
                                               replication, that he was suing to recover the
                                               outstandings of a dissolved firm. Thus, the suit
                                               was clearly hit by 
Section 69
 of the Partnership

                                         "21. With the help of learned advocate for the
                                         petitioner, I have perused the plaint of Regular Civil
                                         Suit No.600 of 2016 filed by the plaintiffs-

                                         respondents, which is at Annexure-B to this petition,
                                         and upon bare perusal of the entire plaint, I am
                                         unable to find out anywhere in the plaint a single
                                         averment that the respondent No.1- is a registered
                                         firm, and as such, I find merit in the contention
                                         canvassed by the learned advocate for the applicant
                                         that in the absence of any assertion made in the
                                         plaint by the respondents that their firm is a
                                         registered firm, and in the absence of any
                                         documentary evidence being produced by them in
                                         support thereof, the suit instituted by the
                                         respondents is hit by the provisions of 
Section 69
 of
                                         the Indian Partnership Act, and when the suit is
                                         barred by any law, as per Clause 11(d) of Order VII,
                                         the same is required to be dismissed at the
                                         threshold."

                       18.        With regard to the contention that no cause of action has
                                  arisen for the Plaintiffs to institute the present Suit, it has
                                  been submitted by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant
                                  that the Plaintiffs themselves have specifically pleaded in the
                                  plaint that there were only two partners in the partnership
                                  firm Tirupati Corporation as on 01.04.1982, each having a
                                  50% share in the partnership property. The Plaintiffs claim to
                                  have become partners of the said firm by virtue of Clause 13
                                  of the partnership deed dated 04.06.2003, which provides that
                                  upon the death of a partner, his legal heirs, if willing, may be

                                                                                                             NEUTRAL CITATION




                             C/CRA/11/2023                                JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  inducted as partners of the firm.



                       19.        It is further contended that the record clearly establishes that,
                                  the father of the Plaintiffs, who was one of the two partners,
                                  expired on 23.12.2010. Consequently, it is urged that in view
                                  of there being only two partners, the partnership firm stood
                                  automatically dissolved upon the death of one of them, by
                                  operation of 
Section 42(c)
 of the Indian Partnership Act,
                                  1932. The Ld. Senior Advocate has submitted that even if the
                                  partnership deed contains a clause permitting legal heirs to be
                                  admitted as partners, such stipulation cannot override the
                                  statutory consequence of dissolution upon the death of one of
                                  the two partners. A partnership consisting of only two
                                  partners cannot, upon the death of one, continue as a validly
                                  existing firm, nor can a third party be inducted thereafter,
                                  since there remains no subsisting contract of partnership to
                                  support such induction.



                       20.        On that basis, it is argued that the Plaintiffs, who claim to be
                                  the legal heirs of the deceased partner, cannot assert any right
                                  as partners of Tirupati Corporation, as the firm itself ceased
                                  to exist upon the death of their father. Consequently, the
                                  Plaintiffs could not have instituted the present Suit on the
                                  footing that they are partners of the said firm or that the firm
                                  continues to subsist. It has therefore been strongly urged that
                                  the plaint discloses no cause of action in favour of the
                                  Plaintiffs and that the Suit, having been filed by persons who


                                                              12

Order VII Rule 11
                                  of the Code of Civil Procedure
.



                       21.        The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has further
                                  contended that the plaint is hopelessly barred by limitation. It
                                  is submitted that the Plaintiffs seek specific performance of
                                  an agreement dated 19.12.1983, along with a declaration to
                                  cancel the sale deed dated 18.11.2003 executed by Defendant
                                  No. 4 in favour of Defendant No. 5, and to set aside another
                                  sale deed dated 14.11.2008, executed by Defendant Nos. 1
                                  and 2 in favour of Defendant No. 6. It is pointed out that a
                                  bare perusal of the sale deed dated 14.11.2008 makes it
                                  evident that it was executed by the partners of the firm
                                  Tirupati Corporation itself. Hence, it is submitted that the
                                  Plaintiffs were fully aware of the said transaction, and
                                  therefore, the plea of ignorance or discovery at a later stage
                                  cannot be sustained.



                       22.        The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has also
                                  submitted that a plain reading of the plaint would reveal that
                                  the Plaintiffs are challenging sale deeds executed as far back
                                  as the year 2003, while the present Suit has been instituted
                                  only in the year 2020. It is emphasised that the plaint is
                                  entirely silent as to when the Plaintiffs first acquired
                                  knowledge of the impugned transactions. The record further

                             C/CRA/11/2023                                JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  year 2010, and even during his lifetime, he had not sought
                                  specific performance of the agreement dated 15.12.1983.



                       23.        It is urged that the Plaintiffs have, with a view to circumvent
                                  the bar of limitation, inserted vague and general averments in
                                  the plaint without any specific or concrete disclosure of dates
                                  or events. Such vague assertions, it is contended, are
                                  insufficient to extend or save limitation under law. In the
                                  absence of specific pleadings disclosing how and when the
                                  cause of action arose, or when the Plaintiffs allegedly came to
                                  know of the impugned transactions, the Suit cannot be treated
                                  as within limitation. Hence, it is submitted that the plaint is
                                  liable to be rejected as being barred by the law of limitation.



                       24.        Tirupati Corporation, the firm, had jointly instituted Civil
                                  Suit No. 1435 of 2003, in which Defendant No. 5 was also
                                  impleaded. That Suit sought injunctive relief but did not
                                  include any prayer for specific performance of the agreement
                                  dated 19.12.1983. This, according to the Ld. Senior
                                  Advocate, clearly establishes that even as early as the year
                                  2003, the parties were aware of the execution of the sale
                                  deeds and the transactions concerning the suit property.



                       25.        It has also been contended that the entire case of the Plaintiffs
                                  is founded upon the agreement dated 19.12.1983, entered into
                                  between Defendant No. 3 and the partnership firm. However,
                                  Defendant No. 3 himself was not the owner of the suit

                                                                                                              undefined




                                  property and had independently instituted Civil Suit No. 2231
                                  of 2003 seeking specific performance of the said agreement,
                                  which was ultimately dismissed for default. Therefore, the
                                  cause of action, if any, for seeking specific performance arose
                                  in favour of the partnership firm as far back as 15.12.1983.
                                  The present Suit having been instituted only in the year 2020,
                                  after an inordinate lapse of nearly thirty-seven years, is
                                  clearly barred by limitation, and the plaint deserves to be
                                  rejected on that ground alone.



                       26.        In that view of the matter it has been argued that as the main
                                  relief sought in the plaint being barred under the provision of
                                  Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1832 and the
                                  ancillary relief with respect to challenge to sale deed is also
                                  barred by law of limitation and in view of the death of
                                  original partners i.e., father of plaintiff and the father of
                                  defendant no.1/1/ to 1/6, no cause of action has arisen for the
                                  plaintiff to file the suit, the order that has been passed by trial
                                  Court is not reasoned order and the trial Court has not dealt
                                  with arguments as to how the plaint is maintainable in view
                                  of Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1832 and
                                  
Limitation Act
 and in view of facts stated in the application,
                                  the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the suit, the trial
                                  Court could not have rejected the application and the present
                                  Civil Revision Application is required to be allowed and the
                                  plaint is required to be rejected.

                       III.       SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF - RESPONDENT


                       27.        Per Contra, Ld. Senior Advocate Mr. Sanjay Mehta,
                                  appearing for the Plaintiffs, has submitted that while
                                  considering an Application under 
Order VII Rule 11 of the
                                  Code of Civil Procedure
, the Court is required to confine its
                                  examination to the averments made in the Plaint and the
                                  documents             annexed   thereto.   It   is    only      upon        such
                                  consideration that the Court can determine whether the plaint
                                  is barred by law.



                       28.        It is submitted that, in the present case, there is no dispute
                                  that both the original partners namely, the father of the
                                  Plaintiffs and the father of Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6 have
                                  passed away, resulting in the dissolution of the partnership
                                  firm. The Plaintiffs, being the legal heirs of one of the
                                  partners, have instituted the present Suit seeking reliefs in
                                  respect of the property belonging to the dissolved firm.
                                  Therefore, the bar under 
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership
                                  Act, 1932, would not apply to the present case, as the Suit
                                  does not concern the enforcement of contractual rights arising
                                  out of a subsisting partnership, but rather relates to the
                                  division and distribution of assets belonging to the dissolved
                                  firm. Hence, the present property will have to be divided
                                  between the Partners.



                       29.        Mr. Mehta has further drawn my attention to Paragraph 4 of



                                                                    16

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  the Plaint, wherein it has been specifically averred that by an
                                  Agreement dated 15.12.1983, Defendant No. 3 entered into
                                  an Agreement with the Plaintiff. It is pointed out that
                                  Defendant No. 4, being the owner of the suit property, had
                                  earlier entered into an agreement with Defendant No. 3 on
                                  12.02.1982. Relying upon the terms and conditions of the
                                  Agreement dated 15.12.1983, it is submitted that the said
                                  agreement expressly records that Defendant No. 3, as the
                                  signatory, was under an obligation to execute a sale deed in
                                  favour of the Plaintiff and/or his nominee.



                       30.        Further, placing reliance on the Agreement dated 19.12.1983
                                  (entered into between the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 3), it is
                                  submitted that an additional sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- was paid
                                  by the Plaintiff to Defendant No. 3. Consequently, possession
                                  of the suit property was handed over to the Plaintiff in
                                  pursuance thereof. On the basis of these recitals, it is
                                  contended that possession of the suit property continues to
                                  remain with the Plaintiff, and hence, the reliefs sought in the
                                  Suit are also for protection of such lawful possession in
                                  addition to the other consequential declarations.



                       31.        The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has further invited
                                  the attention of this Court to Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003,
                                  which was instituted by the partners of the firm, Tirupati
                                  Corporation, seeking a decree of permanent injunction. It is
                                  submitted that although the said Suit was filed jointly by both

                                                                                                             NEUTRAL CITATION




                             C/CRA/11/2023                                JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  partners, the surviving partner subsequently withdrew the
                                  same on 03.08.2012, without impleading or joining the legal
                                  heirs of the deceased partner. The Plaintiffs, contended that
                                  there were neither aware of the filing of the said Suit nor of
                                  its subsequent withdrawal, and they first came to know of
                                  these facts only at a later stage. It is therefore submitted that
                                  the Plaintiffs cannot be non-suited on the basis of
                                  proceedings of which they had no knowledge or participation.



                       32.        The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has further drawn
                                  the attention of this Court to Civil Suit No. 2231 of 2003,
                                  which had been instituted by Defendant No. 3, the executor
                                  of the agreement dated 15.12.1983. It is submitted that the
                                  said Suit was one for specific performance of the contract
                                  executed by the original owner, Defendant No. 4, in favour of
                                  Defendant No. 3. The said Suit, however, came to be
                                  dismissed for default, and an Application for its restoration is
                                  presently pending adjudication.



                       33.        The Ld. Senior Advocate has also invited attention to the sale
                                  deed dated 14.11.2008, which was executed by the father of
                                  Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, in his capacity as a partner of

                                  Patel (HUF), in respect of the partnership property. It is
                                  contended that, in view of 
Section 19
 of the Indian
                                  Partnership Act, 1932, such a transaction could not have been

                             C/CRA/11/2023                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                               undefined




                                  the other partner(s). Hence, the present Suit has been filed to
                                  challenge the said sale deed, being an unauthorised and
                                  invalid act in law.



                       34.        Placing reliance on the aforesaid judgments and in view of
                                  the submissions made, it has been urged that no error has
                                  been committed by the Ld. Trial Court and the present Civil
                                  Revision Application is required to be rejected.



                       IV.        ANALYSIS


                       35.        Having heard the Ld. Senior Advocates for the respective
                                  parties and upon a perusal of the Plaint in the present Suit
                                  along with its documents, the following position emerges on
                                  record:



                                  i.         The Suit has been instituted by the partners of Tirupati
                                             Corporation, and a categorical assertion is made in
                                             Paragraph 2 of the Plaint that the Plaintiffs are
                                             partners of the said firm. Defendant No. 1 has been
                                             impleaded in the Suit in the capacity of being a partner
                                             of Tirupati Corporation.



                                  ii.        It is further stated in the Plaint that the partnership
                                             firm Tirupati Corporation has not been dissolved.



                                  iii.       Though the Agreement of 1983 was entered into



                                                                 19

                                                                                                                 NEUTRAL CITATION




                             C/CRA/11/2023                                    JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                                 undefined




                                             with the Partnership Firm, the reliefs prayed for in
                                             the Plaint include a decree for specific performance of
                                             the agreement dated 19.12.1983, claimed exclusively
                                             in favour of the Plaintiffs.



                                  iv.        The Plaint itself records that Tirupati Corporation
                                             consisted of only two partners, namely, Nanubhai
                                             Ranchhodbhai Bharvad, the predecessor of the
                                             Plaintiffs,   and   Manilal    Chhaganlal         Patel,        the
                                             predecessor of Defendant No. 1, and that both the said
                                             partners have since expired.



                                  v.         The Plaint also discloses that Defendant Nos. 1/1 to
                                             1/6 have been joined in the present proceedings in
                                             their capacity as partners of the firm, having
                                             succeeded to the interest of the deceased partner,
                                             Manibhai Chhaganbhai Patel.



                                  vi.        The Plaintiffs have instituted the present Suit as the
                                             legal heirs of Nanubhai Ranchhodbhai Bharvad. The
                                             reliefs claimed, however, are not for specific
                                             performance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983 either
                                             in favour of the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation
                                             or jointly in favour of the legal heirs of both deceased
                                             partners, but solely in favour of the Plaintiffs.



                                  vii.       The Suit pertains to enforcement of the Agreement
                                             dated 19.12.1983, which was executed by Defendant



                                                                  20

                                                                                                                   undefined




                                             No. 3 in favour of the Plaintiffs. The record further
                                             indicates that Defendant No. 3 had earlier filed a
                                             separate Suit for specific performance of the
                                             agreement executed in his favour by Defendant Nos. 4
                                             and 5, which came to be dismissed (Restoration
                                             Application for which, is pending).



                                  viii.      It is also an admitted position that a separate Civil
                                             Suit, being Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003, had been
                                             instituted by the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation
                                             seeking injunctive relief. However, even at that stage,
                                             no relief for specific performance of the agreement
                                             dated 19.12.1983 had been sought for and on behalf of
                                             the    partnership   firm   and    the     said       Suit      was
                                             subsequently withdrawn on 03.08.2012.



                       36.        The Plaintiff asserts his right of possession over the suit
                                  property on the basis of the agreement executed on
                                  19.12.1983, claiming that such possession flows from and is
                                  protected under the terms of the said Agreement.



                                  Cause of Action

                                  
Section 42(C)
 of the Partnership Act


                       37.        First and foremost, under the provisions of 
Section 42(c)
 of
                                  the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership stands
                                  dissolved by the death of a partner unless there exists a
                                  specific contract to the contrary. The statute proceeds on the


                                                                  21

                                                                                                                NEUTRAL CITATION




                             C/CRA/11/2023                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                                undefined




                                  principle that a partnership is founded upon mutual trust,
                                  confidence, and personal consent among the partners.
                                  Consequently, when one of the partners dies, the relationship
                                  of mutual agency, which is the essence of a partnership,
                                  ceases to exist. In the absence of a clear agreement permitting
                                  continuation after the death of a partner, the dissolution
                                  occurs automatically by operation of law.



                       38.        In the present case, the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation
                                  consisted        of   only   two    partners,   namely         Nanubhai
                                  Ranchhodbhai Bharvad, the predecessor of the Plaintiffs, and
                                  Manilal Chhaganlal Patel, the predecessor of Defendant No.

                                  1. Upon the death of either partner, the firm could not legally
                                  continue to exist because a partnership requires at least two
                                  living persons to constitute its foundation. The clause in the
                                  partnership deed permitting induction of legal heirs upon the
                                  death of a partner cannot revive or reconstitute a partnership
                                  that has already stood dissolved. Such induction can only
                                  occur where the partnership continues to exist.



                       39.        Therefore, upon the death of either partner, the firm stood
                                  dissolved under 
Section 42(c)
 of the Indian Partnership Act,
                                  1932. Once dissolved, the partnership firm ceased to have
                                  any legal existence, and no partner or legal heir could
                                  maintain or defend any proceedings in the name of that firm.
                                  The Plaintiffs' claim, therefore, proceeds from a non-existent
                                  entity and cannot be sustained in law.



                                                                 22

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  Suit of Specific Performance by the Plaintiffs not
                                  maintainable


                       40.        Considering the aforesaid undisputed facts, it is evident that
                                  the dispute in the present proceedings arises out of claims
                                  advanced by the partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation,
                                  who have filed the Suit asserting rights derived from the
                                  Firm. The Firm has a Contract/Agreement with Defendant
                                  No. 3.



                       41.        The Plaintiffs further seek to assert possession and ownership
                                  by invoking the principle of part performance under the
                                  supplementary agreement dated 19.12.1983, which too was
                                  executed by Defendant No. 3. Consequently, the Plaintiffs
                                  have sought specific performance of the agreement dated
                                  19.12.1983 in their favour.



                       42.        It further appears from the record that the Plaintiffs have
                                  instituted the present Suit in their capacity as partners of the
                                  firm Tirupati Corporation, yet the relief sought is for specific
                                  performance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983 exclusively
                                  in their own favour. The agreement, however, was executed
                                  with the partnership firm and not with the individual partners.
                                  Therefore, while the Plaintiffs claim to represent the firm, the
                                  reliefs prayed for are personal in nature and not on behalf of
                                  the firm, thereby creating an inconsistency between the
                                  capacity in which the Suit is filed and the nature of the reliefs

                       43.        At the present juncture, it is apposite to refer to 
Section 15
 of
                                  the Specific Relief Act, 1963:



                                         15. Who may obtain specific performance. --

                                         Except as otherwise provided by this Chapter, the
                                         specific performance of a contract may be obtained
                                         by--

                                         (a) any party thereto;

                                         (b) the representative in interest or the principal, of
                                         any party thereto:

                                         Provided that where the learning, skill, solvency or
                                         any personal quality of such party is a material
                                         ingredient in the contract, or where the contract
                                         provides that his interest shall not be assigned, his
                                         representative in interest or his principal shall not
                                         be entitled to specific performance of the contract,
                                         unless such party has already performed his part of
                                         the contract, or the performance thereof by his
                                         representative in interest, or his principal, has been
                                         accepted by the other party;

                                         (c) where the contract is a settlement on marriage,
                                         or a compromise of doubtful rights between
                                         members of the same family, any person beneficially
                                         entitled thereunder;

                                         (d) where the contract has been entered into by a
                                         tenant for life in due exercise of a power, the
                                         remainderman;

                                         (e) a reversioner in possession, where the agreement

                                                                                                              undefined




                                         is a covenant entered into with his predecessor in
                                         title and the reversioner is entitled to the benefit of
                                         such covenant;

                                         ..."

                       44.        However, the record makes it abundantly clear that the
                                  partnership firm Tirupati Corporation is no longer in
                                  existence, having stood dissolved upon the death of its two
                                  partners. There is no dispute between the parties on this.
                                  Since there were only two partners, the demise of one
                                  resulted in the automatic dissolution of the firm.



                       45.        That having dissolved, there is no disclosure of any cause of
                                  action for the Plaintiff to seek specific performance of the
                                  Contract. That too, only qua the Plaintiffs. Therefore, in
                                  essence, it is not even a specific performance of the said
                                  Contract. This is because, there is no Contract with the
                                  Plaintiff, of which the Plaintiff can seek performance.

                                  Pvt. Ltd., 2008 SCC Online Del 1786, the Delhi High Court
                                  on interpretation of 
Section 15
 of the 1963 Act held as under:



                                         7.    So far as adjudication in the present
                                         application is concerned, it becomes necessary to
                                         examine the necessary provisions which stipulate as
                                         to who would be a proper party in a suit for specific
                                         performance. 
Section 15
 of the Specific Relief Act,
                                         1963 clearly stipulates that only the two persons

                                         contract/agreement, specific performance whereof
                                         is sought, are necessary and proper parties in a suit
                                         for specific performance. By virtue of 
Section 15
 of
                                         the Specific Relief Act, 1963, specific performance
                                         of a contract can be obtained by any party thereto
                                         or by the representative in interest or the principal,
                                         of any party thereto or by the persons who have
                                         been set out in 
Section 15
 of the statute.

                       47.        However, the term "representative in interest" has been
                                  interpreted by the Hon'ble Apex Court in several judgments
                                  and the present Plaintiffs do not fall in the said category [see:

 
Kapilaben and Ors. v. Ashok
 kumar Jayantilal Sheth,
                                  (2020) 20 SCC 648 Para 24].
 It does not even appear to be
                                  the Plaintiff's case that they are representatives in interest of
                                  the Firm. Had that been so, even the Defendant Nos. 1/1 to
                                  1/6 would stand on a similar footing.



                       48.        One other strange relief as sought for in the Plaint is to grant
                                  specific performance of the Contract qua the Plaintiffs only.
                                  Therefore also, the prayer in effect, is not of specific
                                  performance of the Contract. This is because, the Contract as
                                  entered into between the parties is required to be enforced.
                                  The Plaintiff cannot seek enforcement of the said Agreement
                                  in its favour alone. Therefore also, the present suit does not
                                  disclose any cause of action.



                       49.        Therefore,            there   cannot    be   specific     performance             or
                                  enforcement of a Contract unless it is sought for in the same



                                                                     26

                                  form as it was entered into. There is no manner in which the
                                  specific performance of the Contract can be sought qua the
                                  Plaintiffs alone.



                       50.        If the argument of the Plaintiff is that the Contract had
                                  stipulated that sale deed can be executed qua anyone that the
                                  proposed vendee stipulates, it cannot be countenanced
                                  because, the Plaintiff is not the proposed vendee in its
                                  individual capacity, but the Firm.



                                  Illusory Cause of Action


                       51.        A further aspect that merits consideration is the conduct of
                                  the     Plaintiffs,   which   reflects   clear    approbation            and
                                  reprobation. On one hand, for the purpose of overcoming the
                                  statutory bar under 
Section 69
 of the Indian Partnership Act,
                                  the Plaintiffs seek to disown the existence of the firm Tirupati
                                  Corporation, contending that the firm stood dissolved upon
                                  the death of its partners and that the present Suit is filed in
                                  their individual capacity. On the other hand, for the purpose
                                  of asserting cause of action and claiming rights under the
                                  agreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983, the Plaintiffs
                                  project themselves as partners of the same firm and seek
                                  specific performance of contracts executed in favour of that
                                  firm.



                       52.        Such contradictory pleas cannot be permitted in law. A party
                                  cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate in the same

                                  consistency and fairness demands that a litigant cannot take
                                  mutually destructive stands in order to derive advantage from
                                  both. Once the Plaintiffs themselves admit that the
                                  partnership           firm   has   ceased       to     exist,      they       cannot
                                  simultaneously claim contractual rights in its name or through
                                  its agreements.



                       53.        This inconsistent approach clearly demonstrates that the Suit
                                  is based on contradictory and self-defeating pleadings,
                                  creating no enforceable right in law. Such litigation, founded
                                  on shifting stands and mutually irreconcilable contentions,
                                  falls squarely within the mischief of Order VII Rule 11(d) 
of
                                  the Code of Civil Procedure
 and deserves rejection at the
                                  threshold.



                       54.        The Plaint, on a plain reading, discloses no real or subsisting
                                  cause of action. The Plaintiffs have sought to assert a right on
                                  the basis of an agreement allegedly entered into by the
                                  partnership firm Tirupati Corporation on 15.12.1983 and
                                  19.12.1983. However, the firm itself stands dissolved upon
                                  the death of its partners, and the Suit has been filed many
                                  decades        thereafter.     The      claim        founded         upon        such
                                  extinguished rights is ex facie barred under

Limitation Act
. Even if the averments made in the Plaint are
                                  taken at their highest value, the cause of action so pleaded is
                                  illusory, and does not create any enforceable right in law.



                       55.        In the present case, it is evident from the averments in the
                                  Plaint that the Suit is hopelessly barred by limitation. The
                                  Plaintiffs and their predecessors were aware of all material
                                  facts, including the agreements of 1983 and the subsequent
                                  sale deeds executed in 2003 and 2008. The record also
                                  reflects that the erstwhile partners themselves filed a Civil
                                  Suit in 2003, but did not claim specific performance at that
                                  time. It is, therefore, clear that the present Plaint has been
                                  drafted merely to create an artificial and non-existent cause of
                                  action in an attempt to overcome the statutory bar. Such a
                                  fictitious or illusory cause of action cannot confer jurisdiction
                                  upon the Court to entertain the Suit.



                       56.        The legislative intent behind Order VII Rule 11(d) 
of the
                                  Code of Civil Procedure
 is to prevent the abuse of the judicial
                                  process and to protect litigants from being subjected to
                                  needless trials in cases where the plaint, on its face, is barred
                                  by law. When the plaint itself reveals that the claim is legally
                                  untenable, it becomes the duty of the Court to reject it at the
                                  threshold. Courts must not permit litigants to engage in
                                  speculative or vexatious litigation, which only serves to
                                  prolong proceedings and harass the opposite party.

                       57.        In this context, it has been repeatedly emphasised by the
                                  Hon'ble Supreme Court that the power under Order VII Rule
                                  11(d) is intended to strike down sham, frivolous and
                                  vexatious claims at inception. To allow such suits to proceed
                                  despite clear legal bars would defeat the very object of the
                                  provision and burden the judicial system with unnecessary
                                  trials. The Court is not expected to permit a litigant to rely
                                  upon a hollow or illusory cause of action to gain entry into
                                  the judicial process. In the present case, therefore, the plaint
                                  being barred by limitation and by the provisions of 
Section 69

                                  of the Partnership Act, and disclosing no legally sustainable
                                  cause of action, deserves to be rejected at the threshold.



                                  Barred by Law

                                  Limitation to seek specific performance - 
Article 54


                       58.        Apart from the fact that the there was no cause of action for
                                  the Plaintiff to sue the Defendants seeking specific
                                  performance of the Contract qua the Plaintiffs alone, such an
                                  action is also barred by limitation on the following count.



                       59.        As on today, the Partnership Firm does not exist. This has
                                  been admitted by both the parties. This is in view of 
Section
                                  49(C)
 of the Partnership Act. By operation of law, this
                                  Partnership stood dissolved. Once the Partnership stood
                                  dissolved, there is no manner in which a dissolved entity can
                                  seek any specific performance of the said Contract.

                       60.        However, even during the subsistence of the Partnership
                                  Firm, a Suit had been instituted as Civil Suit No. 1435 of
                                  2003       by     Tirupati      Corporation,      represented          by       the
                                  predecessors of the Plaintiffs and Defendant No. 1. In that
                                  Suit, Defendant Nos. 3 to 5 were also parties, yet no relief for
                                  specific performance of the agreement was sought. This
                                  circumstance indicates that even during the lifetime of the
                                  original partners, the partnership firm did not claim any
                                  enforceable           right   arising    from    the    agreement           dated
                                  19.12.1983.



                       61.        Therefore, it is clear that at least in the year 2003, the
                                  Partnership Firm (through its partners) was aware and had
                                  knowledge of the Agreement and fact that the same was not
                                  specifically enforced.

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  was aware that there was no sale deed has been executed by
                                  the Defendant No. 3 in its favour. Having known the same
                                  and being aware of it, the Firm at the relevant time did not
                                  seek specific performance of the Agreement of 1983.



                       64.        Though the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that cause of action
                                  for filing a suit for injunction and specific relief is separate
                                  and distinct, Order II Rule 2 may not apply to bar a later suit
                                  for specific performance. However, the limitation to file such
                                  a suit for specific performance cannot be stopped by any of
                                  the parties.



                       65.        The said previous Suit was instituted by the Firm only for the
                                  purpose of seeking an injunction and was ultimately
                                  withdrawn on 03.08.2012. This clearly establishes that the
                                  fact of execution of the agreement was well within the
                                  knowledge of the erstwhile partners of the firm Tirupati
                                  Corporation. Despite such knowledge, no Suit for specific
                                  performance was instituted by them within the prescribed
                                  period of limitation as contemplated under 
Article 54
 of the
                                  
Limitation Act, 1963
.



                       66.        In view of these facts, it cannot be accepted that the Plaintiffs
                                  were unaware of the existence or execution of the agreements
                                  dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983 or of the refusal by
                                  Defendant No. 4 to execute the sale deed. The cause of action
                                  for seeking specific performance, therefore, clearly accrued in

                                                                                                            undefined




                                  the year 1983 itself and, at the latest, in the year 2003 when
                                  the earlier Suit was filed. Hence, the ratio laid down in
                                  Bardoli Shreerang Exhibitors Private Limited (supra) would
                                  not assist the Plaintiffs, as the plea of lack of knowledge is
                                  not supported by the record or the conduct of the erstwhile
                                  partners of the firm.



                                  Deemed Knowledge


                       67.        In the present case, if the distinct causes of action pleaded in
                                  the Plaint are considered, two aspects emerge clearly: (i) the
                                  relief for specific performance of the agreement executed in
                                  the year 1983 is ex facie barred by limitation. From the facts
                                  stated hereinabove, it is evident that the Plaintiff was, at all
                                  times, aware that the original owner, Defendant No. 4, had
                                  refused to execute the sale deed pursuant to the said
                                  agreement, at least by the year 2003, when the erstwhile
                                  partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation had filed a Civil
                                  Suit concerning the same property.



                       68.        Moreover, cause of action pertains to the challenge of the sale
                                  deeds executed by Defendant No. 4 in favour of Defendant
                                  No. 5, and by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in favour of Defendant
                                  No. 6, in the year 2008. The fact remains that the sale deed
                                  executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in favour of Defendant
                                  No. 6 was executed in their capacity as partners of the
                                  partnership firm Tirupati Corporation, and being a registered

                                                                                                              undefined

                                  Therefore, the Plaintiff could not have filed the Suit beyond
                                  the period of limitation prescribed under 
Article 59
 of the

                                  2003 is also a registered document, constituting deemed
                                  knowledge in law, and hence, the Plaintiff cannot be heard to
                                  say that the cause of action to file the present Suit has
                                  subsequently arisen


 
69.        This Court in M/s. 
Vraj Developers v. Rameshbhai
                                  Gopalbhai Patel
 and ors., CRA 26 of 2017 has held as
                                  follows:




                                         Genesis of this doctrine or proposition seems to lay
                                         in the fact that a person cannot after an indefinite
                                         period of time rise to challenge everything or every
                                         document which has been executed while that
                                         person was in a slumber. Therefore, some questions
                                         which can legitimately arise such a situation are (i)
                                         Whether the Plaintiff could have reasonably known
                                         about a transaction? (ii) Could that factum of
                                         execution of the transaction be discovered by the
                                         Plaintiff by due diligence? (iii) What is the nature of
                                         right that the Plaintiff claims to hold over the
                                         property? (iv) Is his claim of belated knowledge
                                         consistent with such right that the Plaintiff professes
                                         to have?, etc.
                                         ...



                                                               34

                                                                                                                undefined




                                         Having noticed the aforesaid position of law on the
                                         aspect of 'deemed knowledge' the following
                                         principles can be culled out:

                                         1)        Prima Facie, there is a presumption that a
                                                   registered document has been validly
                                                   executed [Prem Singh (supra)].

                                         2)        Registration of a document, (unless rebutting
                                                   the presumption of knowledge) gives notice to
                                                   public about such registration [Suraj Lamps
                                                   (supra) Para 17].

                                         3)        Whenever a document is registered the date
                                                   of registration becomes the date of deemed
                                                   knowledge. In other cases where a fact could
                                                   be discovered by due diligence then deemed
                                                   knowledge would be attributed to the Plaintiff
                                                   [Dilboo (supra)].

                                         4)        After this stage, two outcomes may occur.

                                                   i.     The Plaintiff has validly pleaded
                                                          material and exact dates of acquiring
                                                          knowledge, etc. and has pleaded a
                                                          cause of action which is triable [cases
                                                          to the likes of Daliben, Chhotanben,
                                                          etc.]
                                                   ii.    The Plaintiff has made vague
                                                          averments, pleaded illusory cause,
                                                          inasmuch as has pleaded such
                                                          averments which outright show that
                                                          the date of knowledge as pleaded by
                                                          the Plaintiff is a false contention by
                                                          way of clever drafting.

                                                                                                               undefined





                                         5)        Therefore, at this juncture, under Order VII
                                                   Rule 11, it is important to examine and
                                                   scrutinize the cause of action so pleaded. If
                                                   the cause of action is illusory, vexatious or
                                                   frivolous as being outright sham.

                       70.        In the present case, the plea of the Plaintiffs that they were
                                  unaware of the execution of the sale deeds cannot be
                                  accepted. The sale deed executed by Defendant No. 4 in
                                  favour of Defendant No. 5 in the year 2003 and the
                                  subsequent sale deed executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in
                                  favour of Defendant No. 6 in the year 2008 are both
                                  registered documents, forming part of the public record.
                                  Under settled law, registration of a document constitutes
                                  deemed notice to all persons claiming any interest in the
                                  property. The Plaintiffs, being successors of the original
                                  partners of Tirupati Corporation, were bound to be aware of
                                  transactions affecting the property that formed part of the
                                  firm's assets. The record further shows that even in the year
                                  2003, a Civil Suit was filed by the erstwhile partners
                                  concerning the same property, thereby affirming their
                                  knowledge of the transactions. Hence, the Plaintiffs cannot
                                  now claim ignorance or seek to revive their right after
                                  decades.        The   deemed    knowledge     of     the      registered
                                  instruments squarely bars the present Suit under 
Articles 54

                                  and 
59
 of the 
Limitation Act

                                                                                                              undefined




                                  Act


                       71.        Another relevant aspect that requires consideration is that the
                                  present Suit has been instituted by the Plaintiffs claiming
                                  rights on behalf of the partnership firm. A reading of the
                                  averments in the Plaint makes it evident that the Plaintiffs
                                  assert their entitlement to the suit property by virtue of the
                                  Partnership Deed, under which they claim to have become
                                  partners upon the demise of their father.



                       72.        Reliance has been placed on Clause 12 of the said partnership
                                  deed to contend that, as the legal heirs of the deceased
                                  partner, the Plaintiffs have stepped into his shoes and thereby
                                  acquired the rights and interests of a partner in respect of the
                                  suit property.



                       73.        If the partnership deed and the existence of the partnership
                                  firm are excluded from consideration in the Suit, the
                                  Plaintiffs would have no independent or individual right in
                                  the suit property. Their entire claim is founded upon the
                                  rights allegedly flowing from the partnership firm and the
                                  partnership deed. In the absence of such partnership or any
                                  contractual nexus directly conferring ownership or possessory
                                  rights upon the Plaintiffs, no personal or separate entitlement
                                  in the suit property can be said to exist in their favour.



                       74.        When the partnership firm itself has ceased to exist, no
                                  individual partner can maintain a claim for specific



                                                              37

                                  an agreement vest in the firm as a collective entity, and once
                                  the firm stands dissolved, those rights cannot be individually
                                  enforced by a former partner, especially qua themselves
                                  alone. Any attempt by a partner to seek specific performance
                                  in a personal capacity, in relation to a contract entered into
                                  with the firm, is impermissible.



                       75.        In this background, it is apposite to consider 
Section 69
 of the
                                  Partnership Act into account:

                                         (a) the enforcement of any right to sue for the
                                         dissolution of a firm or for accounts of a dissolved
                                         firm, or a ay right or power to realise the property

 (2 of 1909), or the 
Provincial Insolvency Act,

 (5 of 1920), to realise the property of an

                       76.        The fact remains that the present Suit has been instituted to
                                  enforce rights arising out of a contractual obligation and has
                                  been filed by persons suing in the capacity of partners of the
                                  firm. However, such a Suit is not maintainable unless the
                                  partnership firm is duly registered and the persons suing are
                                  shown as partners in the Register of Firms, as contemplated
                                  under the 
Indian Partnership Act, 1932
. In the present case,
                                  the Plaintiffs are admittedly not recorded as partners in the
                                  Register of Firms, and since the firm itself is unregistered, the
                                  Suit could not have been instituted in law.



                       77.        Moreover, in view of sub-section (2) of 
Section 69
 of the
                                  Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Plaintiffs are seeking to
                                  enforce a right arising out of a contract against Defendant
                                  Nos. 2 to 8. As the firm in question is unregistered, such
                                  enforcement is expressly barred under the said provision.

                                  Hence, the Suit is barred by law, as consistently held by the
                                  Courts in similar circumstances.



                       78.        
In 
Farooq v. Sandhya Antraper
, 2018 (12) SCC 580, it has
                                  been held at paragraph No. 5 and 6 as under:




                                         "5. Having heard the learned Senior counsel
                                         appearing for the parties, it is clear that the plaint,
                                         read as a whole, relied upon clause 25 (d) of the
                                         Partnership Deed which specifically states that no
                                         partners of the firm shall without the consent in
                                         writing of the other partners be entitled to transfer
                                         immovable property belonging to the firm. The
                                         plaint then goes on to say that the suit schedule
                                         property was purchased out of the funds of the firm
                                         for the purpose of development and sale. In
                                         paragraph 11, the plaintiffs discovered that a sale
                                         deed has been executed by the first defendant. It has
                                         been specifcally stated that the plaintiffs had never
                                         consented to the same and the first defendant has no
                                         authority to sell any immovable property belonging
                                         to the firm.

                                         6.     The plaint, read as a whole, leaves no manner
                                         of doubt that the basis of the suit is 
Section 69
 of the
                                         Partnership Act read with clause 25 (d) of the
                                         Partnership Deed dated 29th December, 1995.
                                         Paragraph 18 of the plaint does not carry the matter
                                         further inasmuch as the only sentence which could
                                         possibly be relied upon, and which was relied upon
                                         by the High Court, is that the plaintiffs are entitled
                                         to file the suit even independently of the partnership
                                         firm. Having found that the basis of the suit is the

                                                                                                              undefined




                                         factum of partnership and having relied upon clause
                                         25 (d) of the Partnership Deed, it is clear that the
                                         Trial Court correctly found that the bar of 
Section
                                         69
 of the Act was attracted in the facts of this case.

                       79.        In the present case, the Plaintiffs have not instituted the Suit
                                  in their individual capacity but have done so in their capacity
                                  as partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation. This position is
                                  evident from the averments made in the Plaint, which clearly
                                  state that the Suit has been filed by the Plaintiffs as partners
                                  of the said firm. Consequently, in view of the admitted fact
                                  that the partnership firm stands dissolved upon the death of
                                  the original partners, the Plaintiffs could not have maintained
                                  the present Suit in law.



                       80.        This is also because, if the Plaintiffs do not claim through the
                                  Firm, they do not obtain any right to sue. Hence, it is done
                                  only with the reason to


 
81.        Moreover, the principle 
laid down by
 the Hon'ble Gujarat
                                  High Court in 
Pathik Udayan Bhatt v. Sakti Infotech and
                                  Others
, 2024 SCC OnLine Guj 4221, applies in the present
                                  case.

                                                                                                             undefined




                                         averment that the respondent No.1-is a registered
                                         firm, and as such, I find merit in the contention
                                         canvassed by the learned advocate for the applicant
                                         that in the absence of any assertion made in the
                                         plaint by the respondents that their firm is a
                                         registered firm, and in the absence of any
                                         documentary evidence being produced by them in
                                         support thereof, the suit instituted by the
                                         respondents is hit by the provisions of 
Section 69
 of
                                         the Indian Partnership Act, and when the suit is
                                         barred by any law, as per Clause 11(d) of Order VII,
                                         the same is required to be dismissed at the
                                         threshold."

                       82.        Therefore also, as there are no averments in the Plaint that the
                                  suit is filed by the firm which has been registered under the
                                  
Partnership Act
, the plaint ought to have been rejected by the
                                  trial Court even on this count.



                       83.        Therefore, in the absence of any averment in the Plaint to the
                                  effect that the Suit has been instituted by a firm duly
                                  registered under the provisions of the 
Indian Partnership Act,
                                  1932
, the Suit is rendered not maintainable in law. The Ld.
                                  Trial Court ought to have rejected the Plaint on this ground
                                  alone, as the statutory bar under 
Section 69
 of the Indian
                                  Partnership Act operates squarely against the maintainability
                                  of a Suit filed by or on behalf of an unregistered firm.

                                  by the Plaintiff is one for specific performance of the
                                  agreement dated 19.12.1983. The relief relating to protection
                                  of possession over the suit property, as pleaded in the Plaint,
                                  is merely incidental or ancillary to the claim for specific
                                  performance. Once it is held that the primary relief for
                                  specific       performance   is   barred     by      limitation,          any
                                  consequential or ancillary relief which is dependent upon the
                                  success of that principal claim cannot independently survive.
                                  The law is well settled that where the main relief is barred,
                                  the ancillary or consequential relief automatically falls.



                       85.        It further appears from the record that the Plaintiff seeks to
                                  protect his possession over the suit property by invoking the
                                  doctrine of part performance under 
Section 53A
 of the
                                  Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The Plaintiff's case is that
                                  possession was handed over to him pursuant to the
                                  supplementary agreement dated 19.12.1983, and therefore,
                                  his continued possession deserves protection. However,
                                  
Section 53A
 of the Transfer of Property Act does not confer
                                  ownership or any enforceable title; it merely protects the
                                  possession of a transferee who has acted in part performance
                                  of a contract.



                       86.        The scope of Section 53A has been judicially defined by the
                                  Hon'ble Supreme Court to mean that the provision operates
                                  only as a shield and not as a sword. It can be used as a
                                  defence to resist dispossession but cannot be invoked as a

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  basis to assert ownership or to seek affirmative relief such as
                                  specific performance or declaration of title. The Plaintiff,
                                  therefore, cannot rely on Section 53A to found a cause of
                                  action for enforcement of any contractual right.



                       87.        This is for a simple reason. If the Plaintiff is seeking a relief
                                  of protection of possession on the strength of an Agreement
                                  to Sell, it is claiming the benefit by operation of 
Section 53A

                                  of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 ("
TP Act
"). However,
                                  the benefit of 
Section 53A
 of the TP Act is not available to an
                                  Unregistered Agreement to sell holder. Albeit it is true that
                                  since the document has been executed before 2001, according
                                  to Section 17A the same is not required to be registered.



                       88.        In light of the above settled position, the Plaintiff's reliance
                                  on 
Section 53A
 of the Transfer of Property Act to sustain his
                                  claim or protect his possession is legally untenable. Once the
                                  primary claim for specific performance is barred by
                                  limitation, the ancillary plea for protection of possession
                                  under Section 53A must also fail.



                       89.        The Plaintiffs however, have tried to come out of the rigours
                                  of 
section 54
 of the Transfer of Property Act, by stating that
                                  since there are other reliefs regarding protection possession of
                                  the suit property. However, when the main relief of
                                  declaration and cancellation of the sale deed itself is not
                                  maintainable, it cannot be said that the Plaintiff had any cause

                                  of action for seeking other reliefs namely, injunction.



                       90.        It is pertinent to note that when the main relief of specific
                                  performance is not available to the Plaintiff on account of
                                  non-disclosure and non-existence of cause of action, for the
                                  same, the consequential relief of injunction cannot be said to
                                  be available to the Plaintiff on similar count. Therefore, when
                                  the relief of injunction is not an independent relief, there is no
                                  question of rejection of the Plaint, since the main relief itself
                                  is not maintainable in the present case.

                                  (Deceased) through L.Rs. and Ors. MANU/SC/0272/2022
                                  held as follows:



                                         11. From the impugned judgment and order passed
                                         by the High Court, it appears that the High Court
                                         has not properly appreciated the distinction between
                                         a substantive relief and a consequential relief. The
                                         High Court has observed that in the instant case
                                         the relief of permanent injunction can be said to be
                                         a substantive relief, which is clearly an erroneous
                                         view. It is to be noted that the main reliefs sought
                                         by the Plaintiff in the suit were cancellation of the
                                         sale deed and declaration and the prayer of
                                         permanent injunction restraining Defendant No. 1
                                         from disturbing her possession can be said to be a
                                         consequential relief. Therefore, the title to the
                                         property was the basis of the relief of possession. If
                                         that be so, in the present case, the relief for


                                                               45

                                         observed and held by the High Court. Therefore,
                                         once the Plaintiff has failed to get any substantive
                                         relief of cancellation of the sale deed and failed to
                                         get any declaratory relief, and as observed
                                         hereinabove, relief of injunction can be said to be a
                                         consequential relief. Therefore, the prayer for
                                         permanent injunction must fail. In the instant case

                                         possession of the suit land, i.e., the possession of the
                                         Plaintiff is "not legal or authorised by the law", the
                                         Plaintiff shall not be entitled to any permanent
                                         injunction.

                                         11.1 An injunction is a consequential relief and in a
                                         suit for declaration with a consequential relief of
                                         injunction, it is not a suit for declaration simpliciter,
                                         it is a suit for declaration with a further relief.

                                         Whether the further relief claimed has, in a
                                         particular case as consequential upon a declaration
                                         is adequate must always depend upon the facts and
                                         circumstances of each case. Where once a suit is
                                         held not maintainable, no relief of injunction can
                                         be granted. Injunction may be granted even against
                                         the true owner of the property, only when the person
                                         seeking the relief is in lawful possession and
                                         enjoyment of the property and also legally entitled to
                                         be in possession, not to disposes him, except in due
                                         process of law.

                       92.        Therefore, it is clear that the Plaintiff has sought relief of
                                  injunction as a mere consequential relief, which cannot

94.        Learned Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has also placed
                                  reliance on the judgment reported in 2021 SCC OnLine Guj
                                  3285 in the case of 
Bardoli Shreerang Exhibitors Private
                                  Limited v. Maheshbhai Babubhai Hirapara
, wherein the
                                  Hon'ble Court held that when there is a specific case pleaded
                                  by the Plaintiff that he became aware of the impugned deeds
                                  only upon the filing of the Written Statement in the earlier
                                  Suit, then, though such averment may or may not ultimately
                                  be proved, the issue of limitation cannot, at the threshold, be
                                  pressed against the Plaintiff.




                       95.        However, in the present case, the Plaintiffs are asserting
                                  rights as alleged partners of the dissolved firm Tirupati
                                  Corporation and are seeking to derive title and possession on
                                  the strength of agreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983.
                                  It is an admitted position that the original partners of Tirupati
                                  Corporation had already asserted their alleged rights under
                                  the same agreements, and even at that point of time, they had
                                  not sought specific performance. The Civil Suit No. 1435 of
                                  2003 filed by the partnership firm was only for injunction,
                                  and no relief for specific performance was claimed. This
                                  clearly indicates that the original partners were fully aware of
                                  the execution of the agreements as well as the conduct of the
                                  original owner, Defendant No. 4, who was not a signatory to
                                  either of the agreements and had never agreed to execute a

96.        With respect to the judgment relied upon by the learned
                                  Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff in the case of Shiv
                                  Developers through its 
Partner Sunilbhai Somabhai Ajmeri
                                  v. Aksharay Developers and Others
, the same will not be
                                  applicable to the facts of the present case. The Suit filed by
                                  the Plaintiff is for enforcement of rights arising from a
                                  contract and not based on any allegation of fraud or
                                  misrepresentation.
 
In 
Shive Developers
 (supra), the Court was
                                  dealing with a situation where the Suit was grounded on
                                  allegations of fraud, concealment and deceit, which is not the
                                  position in the present matter. The Plaintiff's claim is purely
                                  contractual and, therefore
, 
the said decision
 does not assist
                                  the Plaintiff.




                       97.        The judgment relied upon in the case of Daliben Valjibhai
                                  and Others v. Prajapati Kodarbhai Kacharabhai and
                                  Another is also not applicable. In that case, the Plaintiff had
                                  specifically contended that she became aware of the
                                  impugned sale deed only in the year 2004, and it was her case
                                  that the document contained forged signatures and thumb
                                  impressions. The issue there related to the computation of
                                  limitation in cases involving fraud under 
Section 17
 of the
                                  Limitation Act. In the present case, however, the erstwhile
                                  partners of Tirupati Corporation were fully aware of the
                                  agreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983 and had even

                                                                                                             undefined




                                  filed Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003 for injunction, which was
                                  later withdrawn. Therefore, the Plaintiffs, claiming through
                                  the same partners, cannot assert lack of knowledge. The right
                                  to sue arose much earlier, and the Suit filed in 2020 is clearly
                                  barred by limitation.



 
98.        Reliance placed on 
P. Kumarakurubaran v. P. Narayanan
                                  and Others
 is also misplaced. The said case concerned a
                                  challenge to a General Power of Attorney alleged to have
                                  been fraudulently executed. The Court examined limitation in
                                  that factual background. In the present case, the original
                                  owner, Defendant No. 4, was not a signatory to the
                                  agreements entered into between Defendant No. 3 and the
                                  partnership firm in 1983. The erstwhile partners never sought
                                  specific performance of those agreements despite being aware
                                  of the refusal of Defendant No. 4. The record shows that the
                                  partners had knowledge of such refusal at least since the year
                                  2003. Therefore
, 
the said judgment
 does not assist the
                                  Plaintiffs.




                       99.        As regards reliance on Vinod Infra Developers Ltd. v.

                                  Mahavir Lunia and Others, where the Hon'ble Supreme
                                  Court held that a plaint can only be rejected if it is manifestly
                                  vexatious or discloses no cause of action, the principle does
                                  not help the Plaintiffs. In the present case, there are two
                                  distinct causes of action: one for specific performance of the
                                  1983 agreement, and another challenging sale deeds executed

                                                                                                           undefined




                                  in 2003 and 2008. Both causes of action are barred by
                                  limitation. The registered sale deeds of 2003 and 2008 are
                                  public documents, and the Plaintiffs are deemed to have
                                  knowledge of their execution. The sale deed of 14.11.2008
                                  was executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in their capacity as
                                  partners of Tirupati Corporation, which imputes constructive
                                  notice to the Plaintiffs. Similarly, the sale deed executed by
                                  Defendant No. 4 in favour of Defendant No. 5 in 1983 was a
                                  registered document, creating deemed knowledge under law.
                                  Therefore, the Plaintiffs cannot claim ignorance or a fresh
                                  cause of action. The Suit is clearly barred by limitation under
                                  
Article 59
 of the 
Limitation Act
 and discloses no existing
                                  right to sue.



                       VI.        CONCLUSION


                       100.       Upon careful consideration of the pleadings, documents, and
                                  reliefs sought in the Plaint, this Court finds that the Suit
                                  suffers from fundamental legal infirmities and discloses no
                                  genuine cause of action. The summary reasoning for the same
                                  may be set out as follows:



                       101.       Firstly, the Suit is based on agreements dated 15.12.1983 and
                                  19.12.1983, which were entered into not with the Plaintiffs in
                                  their individual capacity but with the partnership firm
                                  Tirupati Corporation. The Plaintiffs, however, have sought
                                  specific performance of those agreements in their personal



                                                               51

                                                                                                           NEUTRAL CITATION




                             C/CRA/11/2023                              JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                           undefined




                                  favour. Such a pleading reflects an inherent inconsistency.
                                  The Plaintiffs cannot claim rights under agreements executed
                                  with the firm and simultaneously sue in their own names.
                                  This conduct amounts to clear approbation and reprobation
                                  seeking to rely on the firm when it suits their purpose and to
                                  disown its existence to avoid the statutory bar under 
Section
                                  69
 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Such mutually
                                  destructive pleas cannot stand together and render the cause
                                  of action wholly illusory.



                       102.       Secondly, the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation stood
                                  dissolved upon the death of its two partners, in terms of
                                  
Section 42(c)
 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Once the
                                  firm was dissolved, no legal relationship survived between
                                  the erstwhile partners, nor could any rights or liabilities be
                                  enforced in the name of the firm. The Plaintiffs, claiming
                                  through the deceased partners, cannot maintain a Suit on
                                  behalf of a non-existent entity or claim personal reliefs
                                  flowing from contracts executed in its name.



                       103.       Thirdly, even assuming the agreements to be validly
                                  executed, the Suit is hopelessly barred by limitation under
                                  
Article 54
 of the 
Limitation Act
. The right to seek specific
                                  performance accrued in 1983 when the agreements were
                                  executed, and, at the latest, in 2003 when the erstwhile
                                  partners filed Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003 without seeking
                                  such relief. The subsequent sale deeds executed in 2003 and


                                                               52

                             C/CRA/11/2023                               JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025

                                                                                                            undefined




                                  2008 are registered public documents, and the Plaintiffs are
                                  deemed to have had constructive notice of their execution.
                                  Hence, the plea of lack of knowledge or recent discovery is
                                  untenable.



                       104.       Fourthly, the Suit is expressly barred under 
Section 69(1)

                                  and (2) of the 
Indian Partnership Act, 1932
, since the
                                  partnership firm was unregistered and the Plaintiffs are not
                                  shown in the Register of Firms as partners. The statutory bar
                                  is absolute and goes to the root of the maintainability of the
                                  Suit.



                       105.       Fifthly, the cause of action, as pleaded, is artificial and
                                  illusory. The Plaintiffs have attempted to resurrect stale and
                                  extinguished rights (that too of the dissolved firm) through
                                  vague averments. The Suit, therefore, represents a clear
                                  instance of an illusory cause of action. Allowing such a Suit
                                  to proceed would amount to permitting abuse of the judicial
                                  process.



                       106.       In view of the above, this Court finds that the Plaint is devoid
                                  of merit and discloses no legally enforceable right. The Suit
                                  is barred both by limitation and by the provisions of 
Section
                                  69
 of the Partnership Act, 1932. The cause of action being
                                  illusory and inconsistent, the Plaint deserves to be rejected at
                                  the threshold under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d) 
of the Code
                                  of Civil Procedure
.

                                  Exhibit 80 is quashed and set aside. The application under
                                  Order VII Rule 11 is allowed, and the Plaint in Civil Suit No.
