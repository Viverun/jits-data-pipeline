             (ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of
             Yashwant Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in
             (1996) 7 SCC 113, dealing with question for determination "whether
             appellant is entitled to any pensionary benefits since total service of
             more than eighteen years was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The
             Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:-

                                           held:

                  "3.. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior
                                                      Senio Advocate appearing
                  for the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when
                  the appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½
                  years of quasi-permanent
                                   permanent service. According to him to earn
                  pension it was necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of
                  permanent service.

                       It is contended that since the total service of the appellant
                  was in quasi-permanent
                                  permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the
                  pensionary benefits.

                       There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant
                  was not made permanent even when he          h had served the
                  Government for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the
                  appellant is denied the pensionary benefits simply on the
                  ground that he was not a permanent employee of the
                  government. The appellant having served the government for
                  almost-two
                           two decades it would be unfair to treat him as
                  temporary/quasi-permanent.

                                     permanent.

                       Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we
                  hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become
                  permanent after he served the Government for such a long
                  period.

                      iod. The services of the appellant shall be treated to be in

                          12                                OA/050/00372/2021




     permanent capacity and he shall be entitled to the pensionary
     benefits. We allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the
     Tribunal and direct the respondents to treat the appellant as
     having been n retired from service on 7.3.1980 after serving the
     Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of permanent
     service) and as such his case for grant of pension be finalized
     within six months from the receipt of this order. The appellant
     shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date of
     retirement.

(iii) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical facts
and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain Singh,
CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017. Their Lordships was
seisin with similar issue as decided by Central Administrative Tribunal

Union of India- Ministry of Communication, Department of Posts taken
plea as before Tribunal that services of private respondents
                                                   respondents Temporary
Status Casual Labour, was never regularized nor worked on a regular
group 'D' post till his retirement. Therefore he is not entitled to
pensioner benefits. Their Lordships in case of 
Kritnarain Singh
 (supra)
affirmed view taken by this Tribunal
                                  ribunal in OA No. 900/2012 based on
Hon'ble High Court Patna judgement dated 15.12.2015 in CWJC No.
17204/2015. So also their Lordships observed that Tribunal has taken
correct view because in similar and identical circumstances the High
Court held in favour
                   our of an employee and that judgment stands and holds
the field and writ application dismissed.

(iv)    The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical
case in facts and legal issue in case of 
Union of India versus Smt
Ram Kali Devi, DWJC No.
 11435 of 2017 decided on 11.9.2017.11.9.2017
Their Lordships were seisin with similar issue as involved in the
present case. The Union of India, Department of Posts had
challenged order dated 22.3.2017 passed in O.A. No. 664/2015
(Patna) by this Tribunal
                    unal to pay family pension, retiral dues to widow
of deceased employee.




         Their Lordships observed that husband of petitioner granted
temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992
and he died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion
                                                  completi of more
than 25 years of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in
temporary status begets the benefits of pension. Failure on part of
postal department not to regularize services of husband of private
respondents cannot be appreciated. Their Lordships
                                              Lor         decided in
favour of temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'
employee and upheld order dated 22.3.2017 in similar OA No.
664/2015 (Patna). So also observed that in similar and identical cases
adjudicated in favour of employees in OA No. 113/2006
                                                113/      decided on
21.9.2006, affirmed by Patna High Court vide order dated 7.11.2007
in CWJC No. 4475/2007 and order of the High Court Patna has been
affirmed by Hon'ble Apex Court on 4.12.2009. So also similar cases
travelled from O.A. No. 900/2012 (CAT Patna)
                                         Pat     in CWJC No. 10978
of 2017 and Division Bench vide order dated 4.9.2017 had upheld
directions by this Tribunal extending benefits of pension as

(v)      The Hon'ble High  h Court Patna dealing with identical
facts and similar legal core issue as involved in the present case
interpreted rules applicable in the present OA in hand.

                       5.11.2007 and his legal heirs is entitled to
benefit of pension/family pension or not ?"




So also held that sub-clause
                        clause (3) of clause (2) of Para 5 of Casual
Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization Scheme
is crystal clear that temporary employees

                    regularized

                    employees who have worked for ten years or more should
                    have been regularized. It would not be proper to regulate

Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to
a Group

construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for
conferment of temporary group 'D' status af
                                         after
                                            ter rendering three years

                                                 services on regular cadre
post but no response. The respondents have stated in the written statement
that applicant could not be promoted as applicant on 05.03.2015 refused
promotion. The applicant was never at fault for such lack of regularization
and never refused regularization on the post held for 30 years.

23.           This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by
applicant in the O.A that respondents have not regularized services as per
law on time, in spite of written requests and retired on 31.12.2020 without
being regularized. The respondents in written statement not adverted to
specific allegation and not specifically denied as per requirement in Rule
3,4, and 5 of the order VIII 
of Code of Civil Procedure
. This Tribunal is of
the view since respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as
per the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for
regularization since 198
                     1981.. Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own
mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not rregularized

                                          right, right accrued pursuant to
employee before retirement. The matter of right

                                                                         en

Telecommunication & I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated
12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of implementation results in failure of
social-economic
       economic justice
                justice.. So also envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of
Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are substantive attempts to
enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to employee accrued rights
and has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justice.
Hence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no pensionry
benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief

                      clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated
30.11.1992 quoted herein above is also crystal
                                       crystal clear that casual labourers of
the postal department with effect from date of completion three years of
service in newly acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits
admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service
for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary
employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and

are regulated bby Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above.
The Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and
death gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same

pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Rules 2021.

27.           The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules

excludes temporary employee and Rule 2 explanation
                                       explanationss (6) of CCS Pension
Rules 2021 are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So
                                       20                               OA/050/00372/2021

28.           The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of
three years service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5
dated 30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to

31.           This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory
schemes clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with         CCS
Pension Rules 2021 (erstwhile Rules 2017) . This Tribunal considered the
matter and in vie
              view of whereof of the affirm view that Government of India,
Department of Posts instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66

9/91-SPB
     SPB-II dated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are
social legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously.

                                            harmoniously. The Rules 1965
and the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status
in department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly
acquired temporary status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and
pensionery benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement
Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 is failure of social
justice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is
substantive attempts to enhance social welf
                                       welfare

5 of the Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to

38.          
In case of 
Shiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India &
Others
 O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin
with issue - whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as
Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled
for pension and other retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for
promotion to MTS, regular post and applicant did not accept and continued
as Temporary Status and retired as temporary status employee at par with
Group 'D'. Applicant started employment as Night Guard on daily basis in
Postal Department, conferred status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS,
did not join denied pension, family pension.
 
This Tribunal in case 
Shiv
Shankar Sah
 (Supra) considered orders passed in similar facts in OA
No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015 upheld in CWJC No.11435 of
2017 by Hon'ble High Court
                     Court, Patna - failure on part of Postal Department
not to regularize the services of husband, private respondent in 23 years of
service after having granted temporary status at par with Group 'D'
employee and conduct of postal department cannot be appreciated or
ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017
upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing
respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under
old pension scheme.


39.          Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that
as per rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary
benefits on regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which
includes full service after regularization and 50% service rendered under
temporary
    orary status. On working for three years as Temporary Status treated at
par with Group 'D' employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary
status employee is not regularized having served more than 20 years, it can
only be due to failure of respondent
                          respondentss department. Temporary Status
employee officials otherwise meeting conditions for regularization and
pensionary benefits were thus eligible for pension and retirement benefits.
So also this Tribunal considered order passed in identical case OA No.143
                                    26                           OA/050/00372/2021




of 2018,
    018, a Temporary Status employee, not regularized and allowed OA for
grant of pension. 
In case of 
Shiv Chandra Sah
 (Supra) vide order dated
21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant entitled for pension
and pensionary benefits taking into accoun
                                    accountt his Temporary Status period as
Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on 03.11.2018,
considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service and to
issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.


40.           In case of Ratneshwarr Singh versus Union of India, O.A.
No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue
applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with
temporary status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee
confirmed at part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and
claim for pension denied that his service not regularized and applicant
denied to join on regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains
respondents did not issue any order of regularizat
                                       regularization
                                                  ion during 27 years of
applicant's service and right accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary
Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. 
So
also placed reliance in case OA No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order
dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of 2017 in 
Ratneshwar Singh
 (Supra)
this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018, allowed OA and directed for
fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other retiral dues in light of
judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and CWJC No.10978 of 22017

                                                                017

and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA No.372/2017.


41.           Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018,
Union of India & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated
03.07.2019 upheld this Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA
No.777/2016. Their Lor
                   Lordships
                      dships considered argument of respondents
department that contention of department cannot be accepted that applicant
refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be construed that applicant had
declined regularization on post he was occupying for more than 27 yyears.

42.          The present cases are similar to cases cited herein above and
covered by above precedents.

              "39.     In Yashwant Hari Katakkar (supra) Hon'ble Supreme
              Court held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the
              applicant
                  licant was not made permanent even when he had served the
              government for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if
              applicant is denied the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that
              he was not regularized not a permanent employee of the government.
              Keeping in view facts and circumstances appellant was deemed to
              have become permanent after he served the government for such a
              long period. The services shall be treated to be permanent capacity
              and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.

47.           Shri A.K. Singh, learned counsel for respondents much
emphasized on that applicant did not accept promotion from temporary
status- Generator Operato and submitted application dated 05.03.2015 for
refusal for promotion, hence not worked for a day on regular post.
Respondents merely made averments no such application dated 05.03.2015
of applicant filed. More so respondents cannot take advantage of own
lapses and applicant worked from 1984 till 31.12.2020 almost 36 years
continuous services and for reasons con
                                    conferred
                                       ferred temporary status 29.11.1989.

The respondents did not regularize applicant and there is no refusal by
applicant for being considered for regularization. No order of promotion
brought on record. Thus contention of respondents cannot be accepted in
light
   ht of lapses not regularization services in 36 years, service of applicant.

personal reas
         reasons,
              ons, but that cannot be construed to mean that he declined
regularization on the post he was occupying, occupancy of the post
continuous for more than 27 years remained undisputed.

Ratneshwar Singh
 (Supra) repelled same argument
                                                        argument and
upheld order of this Tribunal.
