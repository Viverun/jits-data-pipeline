JUDGMENT

         "To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to
         woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is
         woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power,
         then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not
         greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not
         greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage?
         Without her, man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our
         being, the future is with woman. Who can make a more effective
         appeal to the heart than woman?"----Mahatma Gandhi.

13, 15, 16, 17, 27, 28 and 29 and therefore their evidence as well as the
documents proved by them can be presumed to have been admitted as
correct by the accused since their evidence remains uncontroverted and
unrebutted.



STATEMENT OF THE ACCUSED UNDER SECTION 313 OF
THE CR.P.C.

9.              In his statement under 
section 313
 of the Cr.P.C., accused
Venktanjaneya Pratap Singh has controverted and rebutted the entire
evidence against him submitting that he was working as a Supervisor in
Citi Collections Company where the prosecutrix also used to work as a
tele caller. Apart from them, there were many other boys and girls
employed for various works some of whom were Mr.Manish, Mr.Vicky,
Mr.Amit, Mr.Raj Kumar, Ms.Mona, Ms.Dimple, Ms.Pooja etc. All of
them used to be on friendly terms and during holidays and leisure time
they used to go for lunch, movies etc. He did not know anything
regarding why the prosecutrix tried to end her life. He came to know later
on that she used to like him and on objections from her parents, she took
the extreme step of trying to end her life. This was a very unfortunate

incident in which he had no part to play. He also came to know later on
that since the prosecutrix was an earning member of her family and was
helping her household financially her parents did not want to marry her
off due to which she remained frustrated. Although they were good
friends and colleagues, they never went out alone and were always
surrounded by other friends and colleagues. He had joined the
investigation many times but once on calling of the I.O, he had gone to
the police station where to his shock, he was arrested after considerable
time of the incident. He is absolutely innocent. He has not committed any
offence nor has done any wrong. He is suffering for no fault of his. None
of the public/ independent witnesses have deposed anything against him.
He has preferred not to examine any witness in his defence.



ARGUMENTS

10.             I have heard arguments at length.              I have also given my
conscious thought and prolonged consideration to the material on record,
relevant provisions of law and the precedents on the point. I have also
carefully perused the written arguments filed on behalf of the accused.



11.             The Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has requested
for convicting accused Mr.Venktanjaneya Pratap Singh for having
committed the offence under 
sections 376
 and 
306
 of the IPC as the
prosecution has been able to bring home the charge against the accused
by examining its witnesses whose testimonies are corroborative and
reliable. The three dying declarations of the prosecutrix are in continuity
and the role of the accused is clearly elaborated. The investigation

conducted in the case also proves that the accused is guilty of the charged
offences.



12.             The counsel for the accused, on the other hand, has requested
for his acquittal submitting that there is nothing incriminating against the
accused on the record. There are several glaring inconsistencies and
contradictions revealed in the evidence of the parents of the deceased
prosecutrix. The first two dying declarations of the prosecutrix are correct
but the so called third dying declaration is manipulated and fabricated in
order to falsely implicate the accused. The colleagues of the prosecutrix
and the accused have not supported the prosecution case and had turned
hostile. The story of the prosecution is so full of improbabilities,
contradictions and untrustworthy that it is hard to believe.



DISCUSSION, ANALYSIS, OBSERVATIONS AND FINDINGS

13.             The question is how to test the veracity of the prosecution
story especially when it has some variations in the evidence. Mere
variance of the prosecution story with the evidence, in all cases, should
not lead to the conclusion inevitably to reject the prosecution story.
Efforts should be made to find the truth, this is the very object for which
the courts are created. To search it out, the Courts have been removing
chaff from the grain. It has to disperse the suspicious cloud and dust out
the smear as all these things clog the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and
dust remains, the criminals are clothed with this protective layer to
receive the benefit of doubt. So it is a solemn duty of the Courts, not to
merely conclude and leave the case the moment suspicions are created. It

is the onerous duty of the Court within permissible limit to find out the
truth. It means, on the other hand no innocent man should be punished
but on the other hand to see no person committing an offence should get
scot-free. If in spite of such effort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains
writ at large, benefit of doubt has to be created to the accused. For this,
one has to comprehend the totality of facts and the circumstances as
spelled out through the evidence, depending on the facts of each case by
testing the credibility of the witnesses, of course after excluding that part
of the evidence which are vague and uncertain. There is no mathematical
formula through which the truthfulness of the prosecution or a defence
case could be concretized. It would depend upon the evidence of each
case including the manner of deposition and his demeans, clarity,
corroboration of witnesses and overall, the conscience of a Judge evoked
by the evidence on record. So the Courts have to proceed further and
make genuine efforts within judicial sphere to search out the truth and not
stop at the threshold of creation of doubt to confer benefit of doubt.



14.             Under this sphere, I now proceed to test the submissions of
both the sides.

husband and her daughter had put her thumb right impression on the
same. Her daughter did not give any statement in DDU Hospital in her
presence. The statement of her daughter was recorded by the police only
in RML Hospital and the said statement was signed by her and her
daughter had put her right thumb impression on her statement
(Ex.PW3/A). Her injured daughter had told her in the hospital that one
boy namely Partap who is working in the same company where she was
working, is going to marry with other girl and she also told her that this
fact was told to her by her other colleagues working in the same
company. Her daughter also told her that as Partap had ruined her life
(Meri Zindagi Barbad Kar Di) and when she asked Partap, what will
happen with her in future "Mera Kaya Hoga". On this fact, Partap had
told her that "Main Tuje Jaan Se Maar Doonga Aur Atamhatya Kyon
Nahi Kar Leti". She also told her that accused Partap had made physical
relation with her on the pretext that he will marry with her. Accused
Venketanjaneya Partap Singh was not known to her prior to the incident.

written by him (PW1) on the dictation of his daughter and he also put his
signatures on the same. His wife (PW3) was also there. However, in his
cross examination, he has deposed that "The first statement given by my
daughter was in my presence. No magistrate was present at that time of
recording of the statement. I was informed that the IO had recorded the
statement of my daughter on 25.02.2011 but I was not present. My wife
had informed me about the same. ..........I do not know anything about
the first two statements of my daughter. .....At the time when she had
made her statement on 01.03.2011 the police official was not present
but he had instructed to me to take down the statement in writing. I did
not call any doctor as there was no doctor present at that time. My
daughter was in ICU when I had recorded her statement. I had
recorded the statement at about 2.30 to 3.00pm. There was nobody
present (doctor, nurse or ward boy) in the ICU. Except my wife, nobody
else was present....."



31.             When PW1 has deposed that he did not know anything about
the first two statements of his daughter, the same would indicate that he
was not present when Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A were recorded.
Admittedly, he was not present when Ex.PW3/A was recorded.



32.             PW3 has deposed that "No police officer visited DDU
Hospital." If this was the situation, then Ex.PW1/A could not have been
recorded.

declaration), when PW1 has deposed that the police official was not
present but he had instructed to him to take down the statement in writing,
the same indicates that the IO was aware that the prosecutrix wanted to
make a fresh statement on 01.03.2011 but the IO did not bother to go
inside the hospital and meet the prosecutrix and record her statement after
taking fitness certificate from the doctor, as he had done at the time of
recording of Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A.



34.             Now coming to the evidence of the mother of the prosecutrix
(PW3), she has deposed that the statement of her daughter was written by
her husband Mr. Rajesh Chopra as per dictation and version given by her
injured daughter and thereafter the said statement was signed by her
husband and her daughter had put her thumb right impression on the
same. Her daughter did not give any statement in DDU Hospital in her
presence. The statement of her daughter was recorded by the police only
in RML Hospital and the said statement was signed by her and her
daughter had put her right thumb impression on her statement
(Ex.PW3/A).



35.             PW3, in her cross examination has deposed that "My
statement was recorded by police officer namely Mr. Ashok Kumar on
24.02.2011 at RML Hospital. My statement was not recorded at DDU
Hospital. I had signed my statement. My daughter had affixed her
thumb impression on the statement (Ex.PW3/A) but I do not remember
if the thumb impression was of right hand or left hand. I had also

36.             PW1 has deposed that he had left the RML hospital when the
IO had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW3/A) in the
presence of PW3. However, PW3 has contradicted the evidence of PW1
when she had deposed that her husband, PW1, was also present with her
at the time of the statement of her daughter (Ex.PW3/A). This fact
indicates the possibility of manipulation of the document (Ex.PW3/A)
during the investigation.



37.             Further, PW1 has deposed that he had written Ex.PW1/B on
the dictation of the prosecutrix but PW3 has deposed that her daughter
remained in ICU Ward throughout and her husband did not go inside and
she used to sit inside. When PW1 did not go inside the ICU where the
prosecutrix was admitted, then there was no occasion for him to meet the
prosecutrix and write Ex.PW1/B on the dictation of the prosecutrix. This

a fabricated and manipulated document.



38.             PW1 has deposed that "I used to visit the ICU during the
visiting hours. I also had access to my daughter as were in attendance."

PW3, on the other hand, has deposed that "My daughter remained in

sit inside."



39.             PW3 has deposed that "I did not ask anything from my
daughter at that time as her condition was not good and we were also
shocked due to the incident." This conduct does not appear to be natural
as the first thing after hospitalization of the prosecutrix would have been
to ask her the reason for the suicide.



40.             PW1 has deposed that when he recorded Ex.PW1/B at about
2:30 to 3:00 pm in the ICU of RML Hospital, there was nobody present
(doctor, nurse or ward boy) in the ICU. Except his wife, nobody else was
present. However, PW3 has deposed that PW1 did not even go inside the
ICU. Also, it is unbelievable that in an ICU where a burn patient i.e. the
prosecutrix was admitted, there was no doctor, nurse or ward boy or any
other staff on duty. Also, it is not believable that in the ICU of RML
Hospital, no other patient was admitted there nor any other attendant of
any patient was there. These facts indicate that the evidence of PW1
regarding recording the statement of the prosecutrix (Ex.PW1/B-third

third statement of the deceased prosecutrix appears to be generated at the
instance of the parents of the deceased.



41.             Now regarding the statement under 
section 161
 of the Cr.P.C.
of PWs 1 and 3, it may be observed that the prosecutrix expired on
03.03.2011. PW1 has deposed that "The police recorded my statement in
this case in the hospital. I am not certain about the date on which my
statement was recorded. My statement was recorded prior to demise of
my daughter. .....My statement was not recorded after the demise of my
daughter. .........." PW3 has deposed that "I do not remember whether
I told the police in the statement under 
section 161
 Cr.P.C that my
daughter was in fit state of mind and was speaking properly. My
statement was again recorded by the same police officer. I do not
remember that date of such statement, however, I can not say whether it
was after some days, week or month. That statement was also recorded
by the police officer at RML Hospital."



42.             As per the record, the statement of PW1 was recorded on
05.05.2011 and the statement of PW3 was recorded on 03.05.2011. Both
PWs 1 and 3 have deposed that their statements were recorded in RML
Hospital but the record shows otherwise. This fact also indicates the
possibility of the evidence of PWs 1 and 3 being fabricated and
motivated.



43.             It is clear that the evidence of PW1 and 3 is full of glaring
confrontations,           overwhelming              contradictions,   improbabilities         and

improvements which are too material to be ignored and same strike a fatal
blow to the prosecution story.



THREE DYING DECLARATIONS OF THE DECEASED

44.             As per the prosecution, there are three dying declarations of
the prosecutrix i.e. Ex.PW1/A on 24.02.2011, Ex.PW3/A on 25.02.2011
and Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011.



45.             It is argued that when she made Ex.PW1/A on 24.02.2011,
she was hopeful that she would be saved and shall remain alive so she did
not even mention the name of the accused and only said that "Mujhe
kuch pareshani thi.....mujhe kissi se kuch pareshani nahi hai, main
apni zindagi se pareshan ho gai hun aur jeena nahi chahti". Even when
she made Ex.PW3/A on 25.02.2011, she was hopeful that she would be
saved and shall remain alive so she only said that "Mere ve Pratap ke
beech sharirik samanband bhi rahe hain.......Pratap ki shadi 11.3.2011
ko honi hai main is baat se bahut nirash hui aur marne ka faisla kar
liya". However, when she realized that she shall not live, she said very
clearly in her third dying declaration, Ex.PW1/B, on 01.03.2011, that
accused had physical relations with her on a false promise of marriage
and he abetted her suicide.



46.             The counsel for the accused has vehemently argued that the
first two dying declarations, which have been recorded by the IO, PW26,
are correct and the third one, Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011, which is written
by the father of the prosecutrix, is false and fabricated. The requisite

fitness certificate of the prosecutrix from the doctor has not been taken
nor the investigation has been conducted by the police regarding the
genuineness of Ex.PW1/B.



47.             As regards Ex.PW1/A, it transpires that IO, PW26, had gone
to DDU Hospital where he recorded the statement of the prosecutrix on
which she put her thumb impression and her parents put their signatures.
He had also moved an application (Ex.PW26/A) and the doctor had
certified the patient fit for statement.



48.             As regards Ex.PW3/A, it transpires that IO, PW26, had gone
to RML Hospital where he recorded the statement of the prosecutrix on
which she put her thumb impression and her mother put her signatures.
He had also moved an application (Ex.PW26/C) and the doctor had
certified the patient fit for statement.



49.             As regards Ex.PW1/B, it transpires that IO, PW26, was given
an application by the father of the prosecutrix, in allegations were leveled
against the accused. It had the thumb impressions of the prosecutrix and
the signatures of her father.



50.             On careful perusal of the record, it is revealed that the IO,
PW26, neither cared to go inside the RML Hospital to the ICU where the
prosecutrix remained admitted from 25.02.2011 to 03.03.2011.
Ex.PW1/B was given to the IO, PW26, by PW1, father of the prosecutrix
on 01.03.2011 when he had gone to the RML Hospital on receipt of

telephone call from her father (as per PW26). The prosecutrix expired on
03.03.2011 at about 5:45 or 6:00 pm (as per PW1). It transpires from the
record that the IO did not even care to verify about the genuineness of
Ex.PW1/B and whether or not the prosecutrix had actually dictated the
same to PW1. He did not make any enquiry from any doctor or hospital
staff about Ex.PW1/B. He did not even bother to meet the prosecutrix
while she was alive from 01.03.2011 till 03.03.2011 evening to enquire
whether or not she had actually made Ex.PW1/B. As he had done earlier
while recording Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/B, the IO did not care to go to
the doctor between 01.03.2011 till 03.03.2011 to take the fitness of the
prosecutrix and then record her next dying declaration.



51.             The least which was expected from the IO in such a serious
case was that on receipt of Ex.PW1/B, the IO should have gone to the
doctor, obtained the fitness certificate of the prosecutrix, met the
prosecutrix and then recorded her next dying declaration and made
verification of the veracity of Ex.PW1/B from the prosecutrix.



52.             As per the prosecution story the prosecutrix allegedly made
three statements/ dying declarations out of which the first two were
recorded in the presence of police officials by the IO where as the last
one, Ex.PW1/B, which is in the hand writing of the father of the
deceased, PW1, on the basis of which the present case was registered, has
been recorded in the absence of the police, hospital staff or any
Magistrate. If the prosecutrix had to implicate the accused, she could have
revealed his name at the first or second dying declarations in the presence

of the police. The third statement of the prosecutrix has apparently been
generated at the instance of the parents of the deceased.



53.             Here it may also be mentioned that PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 had
gone to the hospital but could not meet the prosecutrix as she was
unconscious. If the prosecutrix was unconscious in the ICU, then
Ex.PW1/B could not been dictated by her to PW1, who as per PW3, did
not even enter the ICU.



54.             Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A at the most show that the
prosecutrix who had physical relations with the accused was upset and
committed suicide as the accused was getting married. She has not stated
that the physical relations were not with her consent or that the accused
had promised to marry her and her consent for physical relations was
taken on a false pretext of marriage or misrepresentation of facts. The
possibility of one sided love cannot be ruled out. If she had to put the
blame on the accused for her suicide, she would have done it in her first
two dying declarations, Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A. No criminal role is
assigned to the accused in the first two dying declarations of the
prosecutrix, Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A, and as such, he cannot be held
liable for having committed any offence under 
sections 376
 and 
306
 of
the IPC on the basis of the same.



55.             It has already been discussed above that the evidence of PWs
1 and 3 indicates that Ex.PW1/B is a fabricated and manipulated
document and therefore no reliance can be placed on the same and no role

can be attributed to the accused in the suicide by the prosecutrix or the
reason for the suicide. The prosecutions has failed to prove that the
accused had raped and the prosecutrix and had abetted her suicide.



FITNESS CERTIFICATE BEFORE DYING DECLARATION AND
RECORDING BY SDM / MAGISTRATE

56.             The counsel for the accused has argued that Ex.PW1/B, the
third dying declaration of the prosecutrix, has been recorded without
taking the fitness certificate from the doctor and is recorded by the father
of the prosecutrix and therefore, it cannot be relied upon.



57.             The Additional Public Prosecutor has argued that there is no
prescribed manner of recording a dying declaration and any person can
record it. It is only to be seen whether or not it is consistent, voluntary
and in conscious and oriented condition.



58.             It is true that a dying declaration is not a deposition in Court
and it is neither made on oath nor in the presence of the accused. It is,
therefore, not tested by cross examination on behalf of the accused. But a
dying declaration is admitted in evidence by way of an exception to the
general rule against the admissibility of hearsay evidence, on the principle
of necessity. The weak points of a dying declaration just mentioned
merely serve to put the Court on its guard while testing its reliability, by
imposing on it an obligation to closely scrutinize all the relevant
circumstances.

59.             It has been observed by the hon'ble High Court of Delhi in a
recent case reported as 
Jagbir Singh v. State
, 2014 (1) JCC 172, that
"The law does not provide that a dying declaration should be made in
any prescribed manner or in form of questions and answers; it may be
in narrative form also, it is also not necessary that the dying declaration
has to be recorded by a Magistrate and non-recording of dying
declaration by a Magistrate would not per se be a ground to disbelieve
the version of prosecution."




60.             Relying on the above mentioned judgment, it can be said that
merely because the father, PW1, has recorded the dying declaration,
Ex.PW1/B, it cannot be said that it is not believable.



61.             Further, regarding the non- obtaining of the fitness certificate
from the doctor, the same also can be ignored provided a reasonable
explanation is given for the same and it is proved that the third dying
declaration, Ex.PW1/B, was given voluntarily by the prosecutrix when
she was conscious and well oriented.



62.             On perusal of the record, it transpires that as per PW3, the
mother of the prosecutrix, PW1, father of the prosecutrix, never went
inside the ICU while their daughter was admitted in hospital. PWs 4, 7, 9,
12 and 24 have deposed that she was unconscious. PW2 has also deposed
that she was not talking. PW1 has deposed that there was no doctor or
hospital staff when he recorded Ex.PW1/B on the dictation of his
daughter and this deposition is not believable as the ICU is of RML

there.



63.             Neither PW 1 nor PW26 have deposed that the prosecutrix
was conscious, well oriented and had made Ex.PW1/B voluntarily. In fact
PW1 has deposed that "It is only when her condition deteriorated that
she made her statement." The satisfaction of the PW1 that the
prosecutrix was fit to make her statement is not proved by the
prosecution.



64.             Further, PW1 has deposed that "At the time when she had
made her statement on 01.03.2011 the police official was not present
but he had instructed me to take down the statement in writing."

However, who this police official was and whether or not it was PW26
has not been proved. Also PW26 has not made any such deposition of
instructing PW1 to record the statement of the prosecutrix i.e. Ex.PW1/B
on 01.03.2011.



65.             All the above facts show that although Ex.PW1/B has not
been recorded by a Magistrate but the same does not vitiate the same.
However, still it cannot be relied upon as the fitness of the prosecutrix to
give her statement has not been proved. Also, as already discussed above,
as PW1 had not gone into the ICU, he could not have recorded
Ex.PW1/B.

EVIDENCE OF COLLEAGUES OF THE PROSECUTRIX AND
ACCUSED

66.             The prosecution has examined the colleagues of the
prosecutrix and the accused to prove its case. The prosecution has
examined Ms. Mona, friend of prosecturix, as PW4; Mr. Amit Kumar,
colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW7; Mr. Raj Kumar
Singh, colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW9; Mr.Vicky,
colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW12; Mr. Aji C.V,
colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW13; and Mr. Manish
Kumar, colleague of the prosecutrix and the accused as PW24.



67.             As per the prosecution story, PW1, father of the prosecutrix,
had given four applications written by PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 (Ex.PW7/A,
Ex.PW9/A, Ex.PW12/A and Ex.PW24/A) on 04.03.2011, one day after
the death of the prosecutrix, to the IO, PW26. It was alleged on all the
four applications that the prosecutrix had an affair with the accused and
they were to marry but accused cheated her as he was to marry another
girl due to which the prosecutrix committed suicide.



68.             During evidence, PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 turned hostile and did
not support the prosecution case. They were cross examined at length by
the Additional Public Prosecutor but nothing material came forth. They
have infact deposed that they had given the applications at the instance of
the father of the prosecutrix as he was crying and pleading after her death
due to which they got emotional and wrote the applications They have
denied about the affair. They have even stated that they did not visit the

prosecutrix in the ICU, as they were not permitted or she was
unconscious, nor they talked to her. Here it may be mentioned that if the
prosecutrix was unconscious in the ICU, then Ex.PW1/B could not been
dictated by her to PW1, who as per PW3, did not even enter the ICU.



69.             PW4, Ms.Mona, friend of the prosecutrix has also turned
hostile and has denied that the prosecutrix told her that she was going to
marry the accused. She had met the prosecutrix in the hospital but the
prosecutrix was not in a position to speak to her and did not tell her
anything. Nothing material came forth in her cross examination on behalf
of the State.



70.             PW13 has only proved the certificate, Ex.PW13/A that the
prosecutrix and the accused were the employees of the company during
the relevant period.



71.             It becomes clear from the evidence of PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 as
well as of PW4 that the version of the prosecution is untrustworthy and
unbelievable.



CONTRADICTIONS IN EVIDENCE

72.             Several contradictions in the testimonies of the parents of the
prosecutrix, PWs 1 and 3, have already been discussed above and are not
being repeated.

Ex.PW1/A, keeping of seal by the IO after use, etc. which are too
material to be ignored as they strike the very root of the prosecution case
and also give a shattering blow to the prosecution story.



74.             There are also some contradictions between the evidence of
PW1 and PW2 regarding the knowledge about the affair of the
prosecutrix with the accused as PW1 has denied the same while PW2 has
deposed that he had come to know about the same from his children that
she had an affair with a boy, whose name he did not know. PW1 has
deposed that neither he nor his wife, PW3, had discussed about marriage
with the prosecutrix nor she had informed him her choice. As per PW1,
the prosecutrix was talking while PW2 has deposed that she did not utter
a word in his presence although he was with her for 15/20 minutes.



75.             PW2 has also deposed that the site plan was not prepared in
his presence by the IO or any other police official which is contradiction
to the evidence of PW26.



76.             All the above mentioned overwhelming contradictions and
inconsistencies give a shattering blow to the case. These blemishes are
too major to be ignored and strike at the root of the prosecution case.

CASE PROPERTY IN TORN CONDITION

77.             The case property i.e. two bottles, Ex.P1 collectively,
umbrella, Ex.P2 and match box with match sticks, Ex.P3 were produced
in the Court in torn condition and some of the seals were also torn and
broken. These articles are also easily available in the market, as per PW2
in whose presence the same were seized.



78.             The above facts throw a shadow of doubt on the prosecution
version and the possibility of false implication of the accused cannot be
completely ruled out.



MENS REA / MOTIVE

79.             Regarding the motive of crime, it may be observed that in a
case based on circumstantial evidence, the existence of motive assumed
significance though the absence of motive does not necessarily discredit
the prosecution case, if the case stands otherwise established by other
conclusive circumstances and the chain of circumstantial evidence is so
complete and is consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the
accused and inconsistent with the hypothesis of his innocence.



80.             The motive has to be gathered from the surrounding
circumstances and such evidence should from one of the links to the
chain of circumstantial evidence. The proof of motive would only
strengthen the prosecution case and fortify the Court in its ultimate
conclusion but in the absence of any connecting evidence or link which
would be sufficient in itself from the face of it, the accused cannot be

convicted. Motives of men are often subjective, submerged and
unnameable to easy proof that courts have to go without clear evidence
thereon if other clinching evidence exists. A motive is indicated to
heighten the probability that the offence was committed by the person
who was impelled by the motive but if the crime is alleged to have been
committed for a particular motive, it is relevant to inquire whether the
pattern of the crime fits in which the alleged motive.



81.             In the present case there is sufficient evidence on record to
show that the accused did not have a motive to commit the offence. A
witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs
from sources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless
the witness has cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to
implicate him falsely. Ordinarily a close relation would be the last to
screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true,
when feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there
is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a
grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a
criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is
often a sure guarantee of truth. However, there can be no sweeping
generalization. Each case must be judged on its own facts. These
observations are only made to combat what is so often put forward in
cases as a general rule of prudence. There is no such general rule. Each
case must be limited to and be governed by its own facts.

has raped the prosecutrix and abetted her suicide and this version appears
to be untrue as there is no reason why he would do so. There is nothing
on the record to show that the accused has committed the offence, as
alleged by the prosecution.



83.               There does not appear to be any criminal intention and
mens rea on the part of the accused.



DEFENCE OF THE ACCUSED

84.      In his statement under 
section 313
 of the Cr.P.C., the accused has
stated that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in this case by
the prosecutrix. He has admitted that he and the prosecutrix were working
in the same office. He did not know anything regarding why the
prosecutrix tried to end her life. He came to know later on that she used to
like him and on objections from her parents, she took the extreme step of
trying to end her life. This was a very unfortunate incident in which he
had no part to play. Although they were good friends and colleagues, they
never went out alone and were always surrounded by other friends and
colleagues.



85.             The defence of the accused appears to be plausible considering
the unreliable evidence of the prosecution which suffers from
overwhelming contradictions and glaring inconsistencies.



86.             However, the prosecution has to stand of its own legs and is

required to prove all its allegations against the accused and all the
ingredients of the offence alleged to have been committed by the accused.



87.             It has already been discussed above that the evidence of
prosecution is not reliable and is unworthy of credence. Therefore, the
defence of the accused appears to be plausible.



INVESTIGATION

88.               The investigation conducted in the present case has been
deposed by PWs 6, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26. PW26 is the
IO of the case. The MLCs of the prosecutrix and the accused have been
proved by PWs 15, 17 and 29. The post mortem report of the prosecutrix,
Ex.PW16/A, has been proved by PW16. The FSL reports have been
proved by PW27 28. The FIR has been proved by PW14. The CDRs
have been proved by PW8.



89.             The investigation conducted including the documents prepared
in the present case has been substantially proved by the police witnesses
including the IO. They have deposed on the lines of the prosecution case.



90.             It is the actual crime which is important than the investigation.
Where the actual crime is being elaborated and proved in the evidence of
the prosecutrix, then the investigation becomes less important.



91.             There are two stages in the criminal prosecution. The first
obviously is the commission of the crime and the second is the

investigation conducted regarding the same. In case the investigation is
faulty or it has not been proved in evidence at trial, does it absolve the
liability of the culprit who has committed the offence? The answer is
logically in the negative as any lapse on the part of the investigation does
not negate the offence.



92.               However, it can be seen from the record that the
investigation has not been conducted properly, fairly and impartially. In
fact this is a case of complete dereliction of duties and deviation from all
rules of prudence and law by the IO. This was a case where the
investigation should have been conducted with great responsibility as a
human life has been lost and the accused, in the event of conviction,
would have received a severe sentence. The (mis) conduct of the IO is
deplorable.



93.               The reason for the suicide of the prosecutrix has not been
investigated properly by the IO. The IO did not make the doctor remain
with the prosecutrix and join the investigation while he recorded
Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW3/A. He did not seek the permission of the doctor
to lower the bandage on the thumb of the prosecutrix before taking her
thumb impression on the first two statements. He did not even ask the
doctor to remove or lower her bandage. He did not even ask any doctor or
nurse to counter sign on them.



94.               The IO has deposed in his cross examination that "the
prosecutrix had mentioned about her physical relations with the

accused in her second statement but I felt that she was not telling the
complete truth." However, still the IO has preferred not to conduct any
investigation despite forming the opinion that the prosecurix was not
telling the complete truth.



95.               The IO had retained the seal after seizing the articles from
the spot of incident (as is deposed by PW25) and no explanation is
coming forth from the prosecution regarding the same.



96.               It is shocking to note that the IO failed to go inside the ICU
of RML Hospital on 01.03.2011 despite going there on receipt of a
telephonic call from the father of the prosecutrix where he was handed
over Ex.PW1/B. He failed to go to the prosecutrix between 01.03.2011
till 03.03.2011 evening, till she was alive. He failed to verify the
genuineness of Ex.PW1/B from the prosecutrix and whether or not she
had actually dictated the contents of the same to her father. He even failed
to examine any doctor to ascertain her medical condition and fitness for
giving Ex.PW1/B. He even did not care to read Ex.PW1/B at the
hospital. Even receiving Ex.PW7/A, Ex.PW9/A, Ex.PW12/A and
Ex.PW24/A (applications from the colleagues of the prosecutrix and the
accused) on 04.03.2011 from PW1, the father of the prosecutrix, the IO
did not record their statements or make investigation from them till
28.05.2011, 06.06.2011 and 23.06.2011. The IO did not care too issue any
notice to PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24 to join the investigation when he had not
met them in the office. No explanation is furnished for the same.

97.               He also did not deem it appropriate to call the Magistrate or
SDM for recording the statement/ dying declaration of the prosecutrix, as
per the convention and practice while she was alive between 24.02.2011
and 03.03.2011. The IO has deposed that "I did not find it necessary to
call SDM for the purpose of recording the statement." He also failed to
call any senior officer for the said purpose. Neither the IO nor the
prosecution has been able to give any explanation for the same.



98.               The explanation given by the IO, in his cross examination is
that "I did not meet prosecutrix on 01.03.2011 as I had to go to the PS
since I was on duty....... I was busy doing investigation in other cases
and also as I could not meet them since they (PWs 7, 9, 12 and 24) were
busy in their official work". He has not furnished any explanation as to
why after receiving Ex.PW1/B on 01.03.2011, he did not meet the
prosecutrix till she was alive i.e. till 03.03.2011.



99.             Although it is alleged that on the night of 24.02.2011 before
the suicide, a message was sent from the mobile phone used by the
prosecutrix to the mobile phone of the accused but no voice recording
was obtained by the IO during investigation. Even the transcript of the
message was neither produced nor proved. The records produced by PW8
show that the message was received on the next day, after the suicide was
attempted by the prosecutrix and as such the accused could not have done
anything to stop her from making such an attempt. Even otherwise, the
prosecution has failed to prove that the particular numbers (as mentioned
above) were used by the prosecutrix and the accused.

100.            The IO did not even care to record the statements of parents of
the prosecutrix before and after her death immediately. He admittedly
recorded the statement of PW3, mother of the prosecutrix, on 03.05.2011
i.e. after two months of the demise of the prosecutrix and the statement of
PW1, father of the prosecutrix, on 05.05.2011 i.e. after more than two
months of her demise. The explanation given by the IO is that "...I was
busy in investigation of other cases".



101.            The IO did not take any opinion regarding the handwriting on
Ex.PW1/B (although the same is not disputed by the accused). No
explanation is furnished for the same.



102.            The IO did not issue any notice to the accused or his office
prior to 23.06.2011 for his appearance before him despite this being a
case of very heinous offences of rape and abetment to suicide.



103.            The IO also did not verify the records of the mobile phones of
the prosecutrix and the accused. The records of mobile phone numbers
9811533558 and 9953622645 which are in the names of Gurpreet Singh
and Deepak were produced by PW8. It is clear that the IO has not made
any verification regarding these two mobile phone numbers. Although in
information given by Mr.Satish Jain (Ex.PW26/M and Ex.PW26/N), the
mobile numbers of the prosecutrix and the accused are mentioned but the
IO has not made Mr.Satish Jain a witness in the case nor the prosecution
has examined him. The IO has failed to make any investigation regarding
the mobile phone number of the accused, despite the stand of the

prosecution being that the prosecutrix had sent a message to him that she
was going to commit suicide.



104.            The prosecution has also failed to make Ms.Dimple a witness
or produce and examine her despite her being a material witness who
could have deposed about the present case.



105.            The prosecution has also failed to make Mr.Sunil Bhatia,
Manager in the company where the prosecutrix and the accused worked, a
witness or produce and examine him despite her being a material witness
who could have deposed about the present case.



106.            It appears that a very casual approach rather a negligent
approach has been taken by the IO for investigation in this case which
was required to be investigated with great responsibility and sincerity.



107.            It is clear that from the investigation or in fact lack of
investigation, the version of the prosecution appears to be unreliable and
untrustworthy.



FINAL CONCLUSION

108.            In the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of
Maharastra, AIR 1984 SC 1622, the Apex Court has laid down the tests
which are prerequisites before conviction should be recorded, which are
as under:

       drawn should be fully established. The circumstances concerned
       'must or should' and not 'may be' established;

       2. The facts so established should be consistent onlywith the
       hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should
       not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused
       is guilty;

       3. The circumstances should be of conclusive nature and
       tendency;

       4. They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to
       be proved; and

       5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave
       any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the
       innocence of the accused and must show that in all human
       probability the act must have been done by the accused.



109.            Applying the above principles of law to the facts of present
case, it stands established that the accused had not raped the prosecutrix
nor abetted her suicide. There is no incriminating evidence against the
accused. The gaps in the prosecution evidence, the several discrepancies
in the evidence and other circumstances make it highly improbable that
such an incident ever took place.



110.            This was a case which rested mainly on the third dying
declaration of the prosecutrix, Ex.PW1/B, the genuineness, authenticity
and veracity of the same has not been proved by the prosecution,
primarily due to the negligence and failure of the IO to investigate
properly.



111.            When the dying declaration of the prosecutrix has not been
proved by the prosecution, the reason for her suicide i.e. rape by accused

also remains unproved. The prosecution has miserably failed to prove that
sometime during period of four years prior to 23.02.2011, the accused had
raped the deceased prosecutrix at his house 1/36, Press Colony, Rajouri
Garden, Delhi and he had instigated and abetted her to commit suicide
which she attempted by firstly drinking acid and then pouring petrol on
her and setting herself on fire in her house and subsequently expired on
03.03.2011. The role of the accused in the suicide of the prosecutrix has
not been proved by the prosecution.



112.             Consequently, no inference can be drawn that the accused is
guilty of the charged offences as the testimony of the prosecution
witnesses is unreliable and unworthy of credence.



113.             Onus is always on the prosecution to prove and accused is
entitled to the benefit of reasonable doubt. Case of the prosecution is to
be proved beyond reasonable doubt and cannot take support from
weakness of case of defence. In case the evidence is read in totality and
story projected by the prosecution is found to be improbable, prosecution
case becomes liable to be rejected.



114.            If the prosecution evidence is read and considered in totality of
circumstances along with other material on record, in which offence is
alleged to have been committed, the deposition does not inspire
confidence and is unreliable and unworthy of credence and in the absence
of special circumstances, no conviction can be based on such evidence.

115.            It is a case of heinous crime of rape and abetment of suicide,
which carries grave implication for the accused, if convicted. Therefore,
for convicting any person for the said offence, the degree of proof has to
be that of a high standard and not mere possibility of committing the said
offence. In a criminal case, the prosecution has to prove its case beyond
reasonable doubt against the accused. The prosecution story does not
inspire confidence and is not worthy of credence. The gaps in the
prosecution evidence, the several discrepancies in the evidence and other
circumstances make it highly improbable that such an incident ever took
place.



116.            All the above facts indicate that there is no veracity in the
prosecution case in respect of the offence of rape and abetment of
suicide of the prosecutrix and the accused merits to be acquitted for
the offence under 
sections 306
 and 
376

117.            Therefore, in view of above discussion, the conscience of this
Court is completely satisfied that the prosecution has failed to bring home
the charge against the accused Mr.Venktanjaneya Pratap Singh.



118.            Accordingly,            Mr.Venktanjaneya        Pratap     Singh,         the
accused, is hereby acquitted of the charges for the offence punishable
