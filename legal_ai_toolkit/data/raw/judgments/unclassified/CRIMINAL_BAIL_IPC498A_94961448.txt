THE PRL. DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE, GADAG HAS BEEN
REJECTED.

     THIS PETITION, COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                         ORDER



    1.    Accused in S.C.No.80/2023 pending before the

Court of the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Gadag

arising out of Crime No.40/2023 registered by Mulugund

police station, Gadag for the offences punishable under


Sections 498A
, 
302
, 
504
 of IPC, is before this Court under


Section 439
 of Cr.P.C.



    2.    Heard the learned counsel for the parties.


    3.    FIR in Crime No.40/2023 was registered by

Mulugund police station, Gadag against the petitioner

herein initially for the offences punishable under 
Sections

498A
, 
504
, 
307
, 
323
 of IPC on the complaint of Salim who

is the brother of the victim Reshma Husain Shekh. In the

said case, the petitioner was arrested on 30.05.2023.

Investigation in the case is completed and charge sheet

has been filed. Bail application filed by the petitioner

                             -3-

                                      NC: 2024:KHC-D:3621

                                      CRL.P No. 103713 of 2023





before the trial Court in Crl.Misc.361/2023 was rejected on

06.10.2023. Therefore, he is before this Court.


    4.      Learned   counsel   for    the   petitioner   having

reiterated the grounds urged in the petition submits that

the version of alleged eyewitness CW6 in her statement

under 
Section 161
 of Cr.P.C. and under 
Section 164
 of

Cr.P.C. are inconsistent. The petitioner has no criminal

antecedents and he has two minor children who are

required to be taken care of. He is in custody from

30.05.2023 onwards. Accordingly, he prays to allow the

petition.



    5.      Per contra, learned High Court Government

Pleader has opposed the bail application.


    6.      FIR in Crime No.40/2023 was registered by

Mulugund police station, Gadag on the complaint of Salim

which was lodged on 30.05.2023, at about 9.05 a.m. In

the complaint, it is averred that the complainant's sister

was married to the petitioner herein about 12 years prior

to the date of the complaint and from the wedlock, the

couple have two children. It is further averred that the

                              -4-

                                      NC: 2024:KHC-D:3621

                                      CRL.P No. 103713 of 2023





petitioner was ill-treating his wife and therefore the

complainant had brought back his sister-Reshma along

with the two minor children to his house about 15 days

prior to the date of the complaint.



    7.     On 29.05.2023, the petitioner allegedly came to

the house of the complainant and requested him to send

his wife with him as he intended to visit Davalmalik Hillock

at Mulugund. The complainant allegedly sent his cousin

sister-Simran along with the petitioner and Reshma. At

about 6.30 p.m. on the said date, Simran allegedly

telephoned the complainant and informed him that the

petitioner had pushed down Reshma from the Hillock and

she has sustained grievous injury and therefore she was

taken to the hospital. Immediately the complainant went

to the hospital and noticed that Reshma had suffered

grievous injury and she was not in a position to talk. It is

in this background, on 30.05.2023 a complaint was lodged

based on which FIR in Crime No.40/2023 was registered.

Reshma    had   subsequently       died   in   the   hospital   on

                                -5-

                                      NC: 2024:KHC-D:3621

                                      CRL.P No. 103713 of 2023





31.05.2023. Therefore 
Section 302
 of IPC was invoked

against the accused.



      8.     According to the prosecution, CW6-Simran was

the eyewitness to        the   incident in   question. In     the

complaint, it is averred that Simran had informed the

complainant at about 6.30 p.m. on 29.05.2023 that

petitioner had pushed down Reshma from the Hillock and

as a result of the fall, Reshma had suffered grievous injury

and she was taken to the hospital and immediately

thereafter complainant visited the hospital. The complaint

was lodged belatedly i.e., on the next date at about 9.05

a.m. The statement made by the eyewitness CW6 before

the police under 
Section 161
 of Cr.P.C. and the statement

made by her before the jurisdictional Magistrate under


Section 164
 of Cr.P.C. are inconsistent. From a perusal of

the statement of CWs.7 and 8 who are the other alleged

eyewitnesses, a serious doubt arises as to whether they

had witnessed the petitioner pushing down his wife from

the    hillock.   The   petitioner,   who    was   arrested   on

30.05.2023, has no criminal antecedents. Investigation in

                              -6-

                                   CRL.P No. 103713 of 2023





the case is completed and charge sheet has been filed. He

is required to take care of his two minor children. Under

these circumstances, I am of the opinion that the prayer

made by the petitioner for grant of regular bail is required

to be answered in the affirmative. Accordingly, the

following:



                          ORDER

        Petition is allowed. The petitioner is directed to be

enlarged on bail in S.C.No.80/2023 pending before the

Court of the Principal District and Sessions Judge, Gadag

arising out of Crime No.40/2023 registered by Mulugund

police station, Gadag for the offences punishable under


Sections 498A
, 
302
, 
504
 of IPC, subject to the following

conditions:





  i.    The petitioner shall execute personal bond for a
        sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with 2 sureties for the
        likesum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional
        Court;



  ii.   The petitioner shall appear regularly on all the
        dates of hearing before the Trial Court unless the

                                 -7-

                                      CRL.P No. 103713 of 2023





          Trial Court exempts his appearance for valid
          reasons;



   iii.   The petitioner shall not directly or indirectly
          threaten      or   tamper   with   the   prosecution
          witnesses;



   iv.    The petitioner shall not leave the jurisdiction of
          the Trial Court without permission of the said
          Court until the case registered against him is
          disposed off.
