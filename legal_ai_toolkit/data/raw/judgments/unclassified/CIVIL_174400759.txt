                          1


 
The formal decree has not been drawn up as yet, thus last paragraph of the judgment is treated as a decree,
                          in light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in 
Sir Sobha Singh and Sons Pvt. Ltd. v. Shashi Mohan Kapur

                          (deceased through L.R.) in C.A. No. 534/2019. The reference to the word "decree" in the judgment is to be
                          read accordingly.


                          2


                            In FAO (OS) 514/2010, a dispute was raised by Mrs. Madhuri Singh with regard to her 25% share in the
                          suit premises (arising out of the share of her deceased husband Late Mr. Inderjit Singh). Therein, vide order
                          dated 21st April 2017, the Bench had ordered that 25% of the sale proceeds received upon auctioning the suit
                          property, after deducting the expenses incurred, are to be secured in the execution proceedings, disbursal
                          whereof shall be subject to the final decision in FAO (OS) 514/2010. The said appeal is still pending.

                          3.         Contrary to the mandate of the Decree, Decree Holders [hereinafter
                          collectively, 'DHs'], seek immediate and exclusive physical possession and
                          partition of their 50% share (in the freehold property) by metes and bounds,
                          contending that the Decree stands modified vide order dated 05th November,
                          2019 passed by the Division Bench [hereinafter, 'DB Order'].3 The prayer
                          clause for seeking court's assistance in executing the decree, reads as follows:

                                     "A.     Grant immediate exclusive physical possession of 50% of the
                                             superstructure of the suit property to the applicants;
                                     B.      Partition the Suit Property by metes and bounds into two equal halves."



                          4.         Judgment Debtors [hereinafter, collectively, 'JDs'], in opposition, raise
                          two primary protests by arguing that: (i) granting of possession and partition
                          through metes and bounds, goes beyond the scope of 
Order XXI Rule 11 of
                          the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908 [hereinafter, '
CPC
']; and (ii) the Decree,
                          which was passed with the consent of all parties, only permits sale of suit
                          property, and cannot be altered without mutual consent.

                          5.         Conflicting opinions expressed by the parties have given rise to two
                          critical questions: (a) Does a decree for sale by auction preclude the executing
                          court from directing a partition of the suit property by metes and bounds? (b)
                          Has the Division Bench modified the final judgment and decree in ancillary
                          appeal proceedings related to an interim order?



                          CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES



                          6.         Mr. Arvind K. Nigam, Senior Counsel for DHs, made the following
                          submissions:

                                 the year 2000-2015, including attempts to find buyers outside of court,
                                 but to no avail.

                           ii.   JDs as well as DHs had submitted their respective site plans for
                                 partition. Although earlier there was disagreement amongst parties,
                                 however, DH is now willing to accept either half of the suit property,
                                 i.e., side A or side B, each measuring 1930 sq. yds, as per the suit
                                 property sharing arrangement.

                          iii.   Under the Master Plan for Delhi 2021 [hereinafter, 'MPD 2021'], each
                                 side, holding 1930 sq. yards of land, is entitled to 100 Floor Area Ratio
                                 [hereinafter, 'FAR'], 25% ground coverage and upto 9 permissible
                                 dwelling units. This will enable DHs to retain their land, while the other
                                 half can be auctioned, to enable JDs to realize cash, as they have prayed
                                 for. The 25% share of the branch of Mr. Inderjit Singh (who was earlier
                                 represented through his wife - Ms. Madhuri Singh, since deceased), is
                                 to be retained in the Court, as she died issueless, and testamentary
                                 proceedings are ongoing. DH offered JDs ownership of other half of
                                 the suit property along with full cooperation to retain, build, further
                                 partition, or sell their land.

                          iv.    Partition by metes and bounds is the norm and not an exception. Sale
                                 of the suit property, as per provisions of the 
Partition Act, 1893
, is only
                                 ordered if it is found that the suit property is not physically divisible.
                                 Given the peculiar circumstances, viz. vast size of the suit property, its
                                 unequivocal divisibility, and the 34-year-old litigation, there are
                                 compelling enough reasons for this Court to exercise its power under
                                 
Section 9
 of the Partition Act, 1893 and order part-sale and part-
                                 partition of the suit property.

                              v.    There are no practical impediments to the partitioning of the suit
                                    property. Modifications to the superstructure and additional
                                    construction (built-up area being currently significantly less than
                                    permissible FAR) are permitted in a partition, to make the already huge
                                    suit property further habitable to the parties, thus negating the argument
                                    that it is a single unit use, incapable of partition.

 
vi.   Partition of properties is, in substance, partition of FAR. Since the suit
                                    property's FAR can be divided equally, there are no practical or legal
                                    barriers to its partition. Reliance was placed on judgments of Supreme
                                    Court in 
Sharda Nath v. Delhi Administration,4
 and of this Court in
                                    
M.G. Ramachandran and Anr. v. MCD,5
 which was upheld by the
                                    Division Bench.6 It was observed that the right to demarcate and
                                    construct upon property, without NOC from the other side, is
                                    permissible, and authorities will have no objection if the owner of a
                                    portion of a property, files an application for building plans individually
                                    or jointly, subject to FAR allocation. Parties shall also be entitled to
                                    apply for separate mutation, utility connections and other civic
                                    amenities. Here, as both sides would have access to municipal roads in
                                    the front and the back, as well as separate entrances to the
                                    superstructure, no hindrance is envisaged.


                          vii.      Almost all properties in Friends Colony East stand partitioned. There
                                    is an active market for the sale of partitioned properties. The suit
                                    property can also be partitioned and constructed upon, with distinct and

                                  tradable titles with separate FARs. On the contrary, there is no record,
                                  in the recent past, of any sale of property in Friends Colony East as
                                  large as the suit property. In real estate sector, it is well understood that
                                  all things being equal, smaller plots of divided properties sell for higher
                                  prices per square yard, are significantly easier to sell, and have a more
                                  liquid market.

                          7.      Per contra, Mr. Ritin Rai, Senior Advocate, and Mr. Nikhil Mehra, Mr.
                          Kirtiman Singh and Mr. Aabhas Kshetarpal, Advocates for the JDs, oppose
                          the reliefs, by contending that: (i) the DB Order does not modify the final
                          consent Decree; (ii) Executing court cannot go beyond terms of Decree;7 (iii)
                          No attempts have been made to execute the Decree since 2009; and, (iv) The
                          appropriate course for the Court would be to order public auction of the suit
                          property. Additionally, JD-4 has also prayed for directions to occupants to
                          vacate the suit property in order to facilitate its sale by public auction.

                          8.      In response, DHs have submitted as follows:

                               i. DB Order dated 05th November, 2019 grants liberty to executing court
                                 to look at all possibilities for executing the Decree, which is not limited
                                 to the sale of property as originally ordered under the Decree, and hence,
                                 this amounts to modification of the final consent Decree and should be
                                 treated as such.

                              ii. JDs resisted all attempts to put DH in possession of 50% of the suit
                                 property, despite the shares having been declared as far back as 9 th
                                 December, 2019 and DHs are being deprived of the right to enjoy their

                              iii. The Court has never ruled that larger freehold property was incapable of
                                  being partitioned into two halves. DHs have always maintained that the
                                  suit property can be partitioned into two halves.8
                              iv. Reliance by the JDs, on an earlier Report of the Local Commissioner
                                  [hereinafter, 'LC'] dated 15th December, 1999 to contend that the suit
                                  property cannot be partitioned into two halves, is misplaced. LC's
                                  mandate was to determine whether the suit property was divisible into
                                  four independent living units, not two. The predecessors-in-interest of
                                  the JDs had filed their objection to the said report, and asserted that the
                                  suit property was indeed divisible - not only into four units but also into
                                  two units, with DH-1 holding 25% share. Earlier partition attempts did
                                  not fructify because DH and JD had submitted separate site plans, and
                                  both parties wanted the same side. Now, DH is willing to accept either
                                  side under either of the site plans. The filing of site plans to partition the
                                  suit property into two halves, by both JDs and DHs, is itself testimony to
                                  the fact that the suit property is divisible into two halves.
                              v. JDs' share does not meet the threshold of one moiety, as prescribed under
                                  
Section 2
 of the Partition Act, 1893, to put the suit property for sale.9

Section 2
 - Power to court to order sale instead of division in partition suits.--

                                   Whenever in any suit for partition in which, if instituted prior to the commencement of this Act, a
                                   decree for partition might have been made, it appears to the court that, by reason of the nature of
                                   the property to which the suit relates, or of the number of the shareholders therein, or of any other
                                   special circumstance, a division of the property cannot reasonably or conveniently be made, and
                                   that a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds would be more beneficial for all the
                                   shareholders, the court may, if it thinks fit, on the request of any of such shareholders interested
                                   individually or collectively to the extent of one moiety or upwards, direct a sale of the property and
                                   a distribution of the proceeds.

                                   that is, one moiety of the suit property. In fact, JDs have misrepresented
                                   that they are entitled to 50% share in the suit property under the decree,
                                   when in fact, the Division Bench, vide order dated 09th November, 2017
                                   in FAO(OS) 514/2010, had clarified that late Mrs. Madhuri Singh's 25%
                                   share (which JDs claim) shall be secured by depositing proceeds in the
                                   Court. As LRs of late Mr. Bikramjit Singh, JDs 2-4 are legally one party,
                                   together entitled to 25% share of the total, i.e., 8.33% share individually¸
                                   as noted in the Order dated 21st April, 2017.

 
vi. DHs' claim on late Mrs. Madhuri Singh's share does not prevent them
                                   from seeking 50% exclusive possession of DHs' own share, as presently
                                   determined. However, if found entitled to a greater share in the
                                   succession proceedings, DHs shall limit their claim only to the monetary
                                   value of such excess share, whenever the other half is sold.
                          vii. As regards JD's objection that Decree has not been modified by way of
                                   the DB Order, it was argued that this Court must take into account the
                                   ruling which was made by the appellate court while exercising its
                                   jurisdiction over the same decree for which execution has being sought
                                   in the current case. Any other interpretation would be in the teeth of
                                   
Order XXI Rule 28 of CPC

                          ANALYSIS



                          9.      The protracted and intricate litigation between parties, which began
                          with the filing of partition suit CS(OS) 3235/1988 and remains ongoing, is
                          without a doubt, disconcerting. Twenty-five years have elapsed since the
                          preliminary decree was issued on 09th December, 1997, and a further fifteen
                          years have passed since the final Decree was issued on 1st October, 2007. The
                          declaration of shares is the only aspect that has been resolved [being 1/4th to
                          each sibling]; however, the parties remain at logger-heads qua the method and
                          manner of division.

 
10.     Mr. Nigam has explained that the youngest of the siblings, DH-1, now
                          a septuagenarian, is the last surviving member of the original parties in the
                          civil suit. Having reached an advanced stage of life, he desires to see an end
                          to this 34-year-long tussle. He expresses a keen desire to re-enter his parental

                          dwelling home, which (undisputedly) was purchased by their mother in 1958.
                          For him, the relief of possession and partition is immediate, in contrast to a
                          sale order. In his view, sale of the property is unfair and distressing, depriving
                          him of the right to inhabit the dwelling home that has enormous sentimental
                          attachment. The history of legal disputes between the parties has also led DH-
                          1 to believe that sale process could be a long and arduous journey with an
                          uncertain outcome. He has underscored the obstacles in selling a freehold
                          property as big as the suit property, which seems to be an unprecedented case
                          in Friends Colony. The thought of finding a new home, even if the sale of the
                          property goes through, is a daunting prospect for him at his advanced age.
                          Therefore, given the possibility of suit property being partitioned, he
                          considers that selling the same may not be best course of action.

                          11.    Keeping all this in mind, and with the objective to bring an end to the
                          conflict, this Court has heard the instant matter extensively over the course of
                          multiple hearings to enable the parties to realize their respective share in the
                          suit property.

                          12.    The above reasons highlighted by Mr. Nigam bring to light compelling
                          urgency of the Plaintiff/DH-1 in pressing for a final resolution to the disputes
                          between parties. However, being a court of law, this Executing Court cannot
                          take a decision based solely on such emotional arguments. While equity can
                          be a relevant factor in ensuring fair and just implementation of a Court's
                          decision in enforcing a decree, but if the judgment is precisely worded, equity
                          has limited maneuverability. Moreover, in cases where a decree stems from a
                          partition suit and the parties are not on equal footing, it is crucial to keep in
                          mind that the final judgment may not always be 'balanced' or 'just' from the
                          viewpoint of all parties involved. In a partition suit, the term 'decree holder'

                          and 'judgment debtor' are not well-defined, even though a decree has a
                          binding effect on all parties involved. The plaintiff to a partition suit is not
                          wholly a dominus litis, and a 'judgment debtor' to a decree arising therefrom
                          is thus not necessarily the party against whom an unfavourable decision was
                          rendered. For this reason, this Executing Court cannot take a view that
                          prioritizes only the interests of DHs herein, who are likely to be the pressing
                          litigant only due to his swiftness in pressing for execution. Further, even if
                          one were to somehow ignore the collective rights of the JDs herein, and
                          proceed on the assumption that partitioning of the suit property is an equitable
                          relief, yet, this Court finds no room to grant such a relief in the absence of
                          consensus between the parties, as the Decree is for sale thereof.

                          13.    Basis the preceding discussion, in order to ascertain the viability of
                          granting the relief sought, let us scrutinize the applicable provisions to acquire
                          a more comprehensive understanding of the executing court's jurisdiction.



                          Relevant Sections

                          14.    
Section 2(2)
 of the CPC provides the following definition of the term
                          "decree":

                                      '"decree" means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as
                                      regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the
                                      parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and
                                      may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection
                                      of a plaint and the determination of any question within Section 144, but shall
                                      not include--

                                           (a) any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an
                                           order, or

                                           (b) any order of dismissal for default
                                           Explanation.--A decree is preliminary when further proceedings have to
                                      be taken before the suit can be completely disposed of. It is final when such
                                      adjudication completely disposes of the suit. It may be partly preliminary and
                                      partly final;.".

                          15.    
Section 47
 of CPC stipulates that all questions arising between the
                          parties to suit, in which the decree was passed, shall be determined by the
                          Court executing the decree. It reads as under:

                                 "47. Questions to be determined by the Court executing decree.--(1) All questions arising
                                 between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed, or their representatives,
                                 and relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree, shall be determined
                                 by the Court executing the decree and not by a separate suit.



                                 Where a question arises as to whether any person is or is not the representative of a party,
                                 such question shall, for the purposes of this section, be determined by the Court.



                                 [Explanation I.--For the purposes of this section, a plaintiff whose suit has been dismissed
                                 and a defendant against whom a suit has been dismissed are parties to the suit.



                                 Explanation II.--(a) For the purposes of this section, a purchaser of property at a sale in
                                 execution of a decree shall be deemed to be a party to the suit in which the decree is passed;
                                 and


                                 (b) all questions relating to the delivery of possession of such property to such purchaser
                                 or his representative shall be deemed to be questions relating to the execution, discharge
                                 or satisfaction of the decree within the meaning of this section.]"



                          16.    
Section 51
 of CPC enlists the powers of an executing court, as under:

                                             "51. Powers of Court to enforce execution.--Subject to such
                                      conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, the Court may, on the
                                      application of the decree-holder, order execution of the decree--

                                             (a) by delivery of any property specifically decreed;

                                             (b) by attachment and sale or by the sale without attachment of any
                                      property;

                                             (c) by arrest and detention in prison for such period not exceeding the
                                      period specified in Section 58, where arrest and detention is permissible under
                                      that Section;

                                             (d) by appointing a receiver; or

                                      :

                                             Provided that, where the decree is for the payment of money, execution
                                      by detention in prison shall not be ordered unless, after giving the judgment-

                                      prison, the Court, for reasons recorded in writing, is satisfied--

                                             Explanation. --In the calculation of the means of the judgment-debtor
                                      for the purposes of clause (b), there shall be left out of account any property

                          What are the powers of the Court of Execution?



                          17.    Prior to analyzing the afore-noted provisions, it is important to recall
                          that the final decree under consideration has resulted from a partition suit in
                          which, at the first stage, the Court decides inter se share of parties to the suit
                          property, and their entitlement to seek division thereof. Such preliminary
                          decree passed under Order XXI Rule 18(2) 
of CPC
, determines ownership
                          rights, shares of parties and their entitlement. It establishes the basis for final
                          partition of the suit property in question. If division by metes and bounds
                          cannot be made without further enquiry, then the court proceeds to pass a
                          preliminary decree and takes assistance from a commissioner, who is directed
                          to physically examine the property and suggest means and manner of division.
                          On the basis of this LC's report, the court can grant the final relief of
                          separating the property. However, if it appears that dividing the property is
                          not reasonably or conveniently feasible, or that a sale would be more
                          advantageous, the court may order the sale for distribution of proceeds
                          according to the determined shares. This course can also be adopted by
                          consent between the parties. Thus, the final decree conclusively determines
                          rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy. It
                          is considered to be the final adjudication, because nothing remains to be done

                          thereafter on the question of partition.

                          18.        Further, the provisions referred to in the preceding paragraphs,
                          concerning powers of executing court, also suggest that the executing court's
                          power is bounded and restricted. The limitation on court's power is also
                          indicated by the wording of Section 51, which begins with the stipulation,
                          "Subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, the Court
                          may, on the application of the decree-holder, order execution of the decree".
                          This means that the court has the power to enforce a decree, but that power is
                          limited by the conditions prescribed by the decree. In other words,
                          notwithstanding the range of powers the executing court has been equipped
                          with, it is not open to such court to go beyond the terms of the decree. Under
                          
Section 47
 of the CPC, which has been relied upon by both the parties in their
                          submissions, the executing court is empowered to determine all questions
                          between the parties in relation to execution, discharge or satisfaction of the
                          decree. It allows the executing court to tailor its enforcement efforts to the
                          specific circumstances of each case, in order to ensure that a decree is
                          enforced effectively. However, under this provision, jurisdiction is limited to
                          deciding objections qua executability, on the ground of jurisdictional
                          infirmity or voidness.12 The said provision does not empower or vest with the
                          executing court, the jurisdiction to re-draw or overwrite the terms of a decree.
                          Power under 
Section 47
 of the CPC is further subject to restrictions relating
                          to execution, which are provided under 
Order XXI of CPC
 which deals with
                          diverse situations. 
In a nutshell, the executing court can neither travel behind
                          the decree, sit in appeal over the decree, nor pass an order jeopardizing right

                          of parties as laid out thereunder. Only in limited cases - where the decree is
                          by a Court lacking inherent jurisdiction or is in nullity - can the decree be
                          rendered non-est and inexecutable by the executing court.13 Therefore, the
                          executing Court, in its endeavor to provide relief to the parties, cannot use any
                          discretion which would tantamount to modifying or altering the decree itself.

                          19.        DHs' argument that they have not received any benefit from the
                          Decree, although well-intended, holds no weight. Equally persuasive is the
                          argument of JD-3, who has pointed out that in case DHs are put in possession
                          of the suit property, it would set the clock back by more than twenty years, by
                          essentially undoing previous decisions and restarting the trial on an issue that
                          has been resolved for a long time and confirmed through repeated court
                          rulings.

                          20.        The parties applied for partition with the aim of dividing their shares,
                          which resulted in a clear definition of their rights under the preliminary
                          decree. The next step involved allocation of these rights. LC appointed by this
                          Court, as noted above, observed that partition of the suit property was not

                          show that the parties evinced a preference for partitioning the suit property at
                          different stages. Nevertheless, since the proposal did not gain unanimous
                          approval, a final consent decree was issued mandating the sale of the property.
                          Hence, the exercise which has been done in the suit proceedings prior to final
                          decree, cannot be repeated in the execution proceedings. It is not open for this
                          Court to undertake the exercise of re-examining and re-determining whether
                          the suit property can be partitioned by metes and bounds, and modify the

                          decree. The final decree for sale has been passed after much deliberation, over
                          several dates of hearing and across several rounds of discussion amongst the
                          parties. DHs' right to seek partition by metes and bounds was foreclosed on
                          the passing of final decree, and therefore, under the ambit of 
Section 47
 of
                          CPC, executing court cannot now be called upon to re-determine rights of
                          parties relating to possession and partition by metes and bounds.

                          21.    Now that the powers of this court stand clarified to the above effect,
                          this brings us to the next crucial question, as follows:



                          What are the terms of the Decree and whether they have been modified by the
                          Division Bench?



                          22.    In order to find answer to the above captioned query, it would be
                          necessary to examine the orders leading to the passing of the final Decree,
                          commencing from 09th December, 1997 when the preliminary decree was
                          passed on the following terms:

                                "          xx               ...                xx                ...               xx
                                27.        There shall be a decree;

                                a) directing the division of the premises bearing No. 54, Friends Colony, New Delhi,
                                    into 4 shares and 1/4th share shall be allotted to the plaintiff;

                                b) directing the allotment of 1/4th share to Smt. Maduri Singh, (second defendant),
                                    1/4 share to Smt. Vijay Kumari (defendant No. 3) and 1/4th share to the first
                                    defendant;

                                c) directing the dismissal of the claim of the plaintiff regarding moveable properties
                                    mentioned in the scheduled to the plaint;

                                d) restraining the first defendant from dis-possessing the plaintiff from the first floor
                                    of the annexe portion of property bearing No. 54, Friends Colony, New Delhi;

                                e) restraining the first. defendant from preventing the plaintiff from using the
                                    common portions in the premises of 54, Friends Colony, New Delhi;

                                f) directing the first defendant to pay the plaintiff the costs of the suit;"



                          23.    After the preliminary decree, the Court undertook consequential action
                          of determining whether division of property was possible by way of metes
                          and bounds. For this purpose, as is usually the case, an LC was appointed to

                          physically examine the suit property and suggest the manner of division. He
                          was directed to visit the suit property and submit a plan, prepared through a
                          qualified architect, to demarcate separate shares of each of the parties. The
                          LC apprised the court that it would not be possible to divide the suit property
                          into four equal parts, and submitted a report dated 15th December, 1999 to that
                          effect. At that stage, Plaintiff/DH-1 herein agreed that the suit property cannot
                          be partitioned by metes and bounds and should be put to sale. This was also
                          the view orally expressed by the LC, as noted in the Order dated 19th October,
                          2000, whereupon the court observed that:

                                 "I am fully satisfied that the suit property is incapable of being partitioned by metes
                                 and bounds".



                          And ordered:

                                 "...I am of the opinion that a division of the suit property cannot be reasonably or
                                 conveniently made and that the sale of the suit property and distribution of the
                                 proceeds would be very beneficial for all the shareholders".



                          24.    The 1/4th co-sharers were directed to submit their sealed offers/bids for
                          sale/purchase of their respective shares/rights in the suit property. The
                          preliminary decree was assailed in appeal by Defendant No. 1/JD-1 herein in
                          RFA(OS) 1/1999, whereupon the following order was passed:

                                " C.M. 500/2000 in RFA(OS) 1/99
                                  In view of the order passed on 12.7.99 that the proceedings may continue but final
                                decree will not be passed, no further orders are required to be passed on this
                                application by which the appellant has sought stay of an order passed on 19.10.2000
                                by learned Single Judge. The order passed on 19.10.2000 is one of the interlocutory
                                orders passed and can be said to be a step towards passing final decree. Any party
                                aggrieved by interlocutory orders has an adequate remedy of challenging the said
                                orders after passing of the Decree, in case the said party would feel aggrieved by
                                the Decree.

                                  With these observations the application is dismissed."



                          25.    Parties could not agree on a plan of partition and on 20th February,
                          2007, consented that the suit property be sold and purchaser be given vacant

                          failing which, it was to be sold through public auction. On the subsequent
                          date, the following order was passed:

                                   "          xx                ...               xx                ...               xx
                                   Since no mode of partition has been found feasible and in view of consent recorded on
                                   20.2.2007, the suit property is put to sale by public auction. At this-stage learned

                                   of the other parties. If that be so, defendant no.1 can participate in the public auction

                          declined to interfere, with the following observations:

                                     Facts were noted and recorded by the learned Single Judge in order dated 19th
                                     January, 2007 but the parties were given one more opportunity to find a solution
                                     and the suit was adjourned to 20th February, 2007. On 20th February, 2007, when
                                     the matter was listed before learned Single Judge, all parties agreed that they were
                                     unable to find any mode for amicable division of the suit property and agreed that
                                     the suit property be sold and purchaser be given vacant possession. The parties
                                     prayed for some time for getting a purchaser failing which, it was agreed that the
                                     suit property will be sold by public auction. Thus, the learned Single Judge was
                                     considerate and even at that stage on 20.2.2007 granted time to the parties and
                                     explore possibility of getting a purchaser.



                                     Consent given by learned counsel for the appellant for putting the property to
                                     auction has been accepted and acted upon by learned Single Judge for rejecting
                                     the application being IA 5783/2007. In these circumstances, we are of the
                                     considered opinion that reliance on 
Section 3
 of the Partition Act is misplaced. We
                                     may reiterate the fact that the parties have failed to find out suitable and
                                     appropriate mode for dividing the suit property in last ten years.



                                     Appellant/defendant No.1 is in physical possession of the suit property to the

                                     and therefore no specific application was required to be filed. The Court has also

                                 Appellant can participate in public auction to the exclusion of his share. It is also

                                 a registered memorandum of understanding with a third party.



                                 Contempt application was filed against the appellant/defendant No. 1. The
                                 appellant is admittedly in possession of the suit property and therefore stalling and
                                 delaying the proceedings and, therefore, for last ten years the preliminary decree
                                 remains on paper and has not been acted upon. We are not inclined to interfere
                                 with the order passed by learned Single Judge. The appeal has no merit and the
                                 same is dismissed."



                          27.    Thereafter, on 01st October, 2007, the Decree was passed in the
                          following terms:

                                "CS(OS) No.3235/1988


                                     The Preliminary Decree was passed on 09.12.1997. The parties were not able
                                to find an amicable division of the suit property in question. It is in view thereof that
                                on 20.02.2007 it was agreed that the suit property be sold and the purchaser will get
                                vacant possession of the suit property. The parties were also, not able to get any
                                purchaser failing which the suit property had been agreed to be sold by public
                                auction. Learned counsel for the parties state that the shares of the parties have
                                changed on account of inter se documents executed between the parties. In view
                                thereof the share of the plaintiff is 31.218 per cent, of LRs of defendant no. 1 is 50
                                per cent and of the defendant no.3 is 18.782 per cent. A final decree is thus passed
                                in for respect of the suit property declaring the share of the parties as aforesaid as
                                also the agreement to put the suit property to public auction by sale to implement
                                the division of the suit property. In pursuance to and the Decree, now the suit
                                property would be sold through the public auction." [Emphasis supplied]


                          28.    Taking into account the repeated unsuccessful efforts to divide the suit
                          property by metes and bounds, parties consented to a decree for sale as they
                          were in agreement that partition by metes and bounds was not a feasible
                          option. From the above orders, it is but obvious that the final Decree was
                          passed as a consequence of parties agreeing to the sale of suit property by
                          public auction to implement the division of shares as determined in the
                          preliminary decree, and towards that effort, a proclamation of sale was issued
                          on 12th February 2009. This is also manifest from the order dated 23rd October

                          sale of suit property.

                          29.        Thereafter, parties engaged in efforts to find a way for the sale of the
                          suit property, as recorded in order dated 25th March 2008 to the following
                          effect:

                                   "CS (OS) 3235/1988
                                             xx                ...                xx              ...                xx
                                       It has been agreed between the parties that the suit property question has to be
                                   put to sale. The difficulty is with the procedure of sale. Earlier, public auction was
                                   directed which did not meet with a success. Thereafter, the parties sought time to
                                   find out a way as to how the suit property has to be sold. Today also, the court is
                                   faced with the same problem as the plaintiff and the defendants are not in agreement
                                   as to the mode in which it is to be sold.

                                       After some discussion, it appears that the appropriate method of sale of the suit
                                   property would be that both the plaintiff and the defendants shall jointly seek buyers
                                   and both parties would be at liberty to arrange for a buyer. The object being that the
                                   highest price is obtained for the suit property. The counsel for the parties state that
                                   three weeks time be given to them in the first instance to carry out this exercise. In
                                   case they do not achieve any success, then the counsel submit that the alternative of
                                   a public auction can be explored by this court once again.
                                       The counsel for the parties will sit together and settle the terms within a week.
                                   The learned counsel for the parties agree that, broadly speaking, the terms settled in
                                   the earlier proclamation by this court would be the basis for the terms of the sale
                                   except for the price."



                          30.        Several attempts were made to sell the suit property through public
                          auction, but without any success. The attempt at an inter-party bidding was
                          also unsuccessful.

                          31.        On 27th August, 2007, the Division Bench in FAO(OS) 305/2005 held
                          that since the parties had consented to sale of property by public auction,
                          Appellant cannot be allowed to retract from the same, and the suit property
                          must be sold in such a manner.15

                          issuing notice in an appeal filed by (late) Ms. Madhuri Singh, also restrained
                          Respondents therein/DHs and JDs 1-4 herein, "from changing status quo with
                          regard to possession and from entering into any contract for sale of property",
                          and stayed the suit proceedings before the Single Bench.16

                          33.        In the same matter, on 21st April, 2017, the Appellate Court re-affirmed
                          the Decree passed by the Single Judge, in the following terms:

                                   "CM APPL. 14312/2010 (stay)

                                   1. The present application has been filed by the appellant praying inter alia for
                                   staying the suit proceedings and for restraining the respondents from selling,
                                   transferring, alienating or creating any third party interest in the suit premises, i.e.,
                                   premises bearing No. 54, Friends Colony (East), New Delhi.

                                              xx               ...               xx               ...                xx

                                   5. Having regard to the fact that the shares of the parties in the suit premises have
                                   already been declared in the preliminary decree and a final decree came to be passed
                                   in the suit as long back as on 01.10.2007, this leaves the aspect of apportionment of
                                   the sale proceeds between the parties upon auctioning of the suit premises.

                                   6. We are of the opinion that no further orders are required to be passed in the suit.
                                   Only because the appellant has a dispute with the legal heirs of the deceased
                                   respondent No.1 cannot be a ground to deprive the others of their shares in the suit
                                   premises. The suit is disposed of and the parties are held entitled to seek execution
                                   of the judgment and decree dated 01.10.2007, in accordance with law.

                                   7. As a result, the interim order dated 11.08.2010 is modified to the extent that the
                                   parties in possession of the suit premises will maintain status quo with regard to the
                                   possession and they are restrained from entering into any contract for the sale of the
                                   suit premises, till the execution proceedings that may be filed by any of the parties,
                                   attain finality.

                                   8. As there is a dispute raised by the appellant with regard to her 25% share in the
                                   suit premises, an amount to the extent of 25% of the sale proceeds received on
                                   auctioning the suit premises, after deducting the expenses incurred, shall be secured
                                   in the execution proceedings. Disbursal of the said amount is made subject to a final
                                   decision in the present appeal.

                                   9. The application is disposed of."                               [Emphasis supplied]



                          34.         Thus, the Division Bench in FAO(OS) 514/2010 disposed of the suit
                          CS(OS) 3235/1988 on 21st April 2017. This was then clarified vide DB Order
                          dated 05th November, 2019. The said appellate order reads as under:

 
"CM 3899/2018 (for modification of order dated 21st April, 2017)

                                 3.       Ms. Mini Pushkarna, learned counsel for the Applicants/Plaintiffs
                                 expresses the concern that the said order, not having recorded the failed attempts
                                 at having the suit property auctioned, forecloses the possibility of the LRs of the
                                 Plaintiff, actually seeking possession of their share of the suit property by metes
                                 and bounds. Incidentally, the LRs of the Defendant No.3 also expressed the same
                                 concern.

                                 4.       Having perused the orders passed prior to 21st April, 2017, and the fact
                                 that the repeated attempts of auctioning the suit property have failed, the Court
                                 clarifies that the order dated 21st April, 2017 passed by this Court will not be
                                 construed as having foreclosed other possibilities of executing the Decree dated 1st
                                 October, 2007. In other words, in the execution proceedings to be initiated by the
                                 parties for executing the said final decree, it will be open to the executing court to
                                 explore all possibilities of securing to the parties their respective shares, as
                                 determined by the Decree, not limited to the sale of the suit property by way of a
                                 public auction. This should sufficiently allay any apprehension that may be
                                 harboured by either the Plaintiff or the Defendant No.3.

                                 5.       The application is disposed of in terms of above order.



                                CS(OS) 514/2010 & CMs 27307/2018, 32236/2018 and 35376/2019

                                 6.        This appeal was originally filed by the Defendant No. 2 in the suit, who
                                 has, during the pendency of the present appeal expired. There are applications
                                 under Order XXII Rule 4 Civil Procedure Code ("
CPC
‟) for her substitution in
                                 the appeal by several applicants. It appears that the Appellant, prior to her death,
                                 purportedly executed more than one Will, and there are probate proceedings
                                 concerning the said Wills, which are still pending in the Civil Courts in Nainital
                                 and Delhi. Clearly, therefore, the present applications seeking substitution of the
                                 Appellant will have to await the final outcome of those proceedings.

                                 7.        This appeal itself is directed against an order dated 31st May 2010, which
                                 purportedly crystallizes the entitlement of the Appellant/Defendant No. 2 in the
                                 suit, as far as her share in the suit property is concerned.

                                 8.        During the pendency of the present appeal, subsequent to the order dated
                                 21st April 2017, extracted hereinabove, it has been clarified by an order dated 9th
                                 November 2017, that the 25% share of the present Appellant, would have to come
                                 from the share of the Defendant No. 1 in the suit i.e. the 50% share of Defendant
                                 No. 1. It has been clarified by the order dated 21st April, 2017 that the share of
                                 25% of the present Appellant, will be secured by the executing court in the
                                 execution proceedings.

                                 9.        The Court is of the view that the abovementioned orders sufficiently
                                 protect the interest of the LRs of the Appellant/Defendant No. 2. The Court is
                                 therefore not prepared to add anything further to what has already been expressed
                                 by the above order dated 21st April, 2017 and the further clarification of this Court
                                 by the order dated 9th November, 2017.

                                 10. As far as the entitlement of the Applicants to be substituted for the Appellant is
                                 concerned, the Court directs that depending upon the outcome of the probate
                                 proceedings, the executing court will entertain the applications on behalf of the
                                 present Appellant and their claim will stand protected in terms of the above orders
                                 of this Court.

                                 11.       The appeal and the applications are accordingly disposed of."

                          against the DB Order, the Bench made observations to the following effect:

                                 3. The parties are agreed upon modification of the order dated 5th November, 2019
                                 to the limited extent that in para 11 of the said order the Court has noted that the
                                 appeal stands disposed of.

                                 4. It is stated that the Appellant's entitlement to a share in the suit property is yet
                                 to be considered and has to be decided in the appeal. It is further stated that the
                                 Appellant is required to be substituted by her Legal Representatives.

                                 5. Accordingly, this Court modifies the order dated 5th November, 2019 and directs

                                           proceedings may continue in accordance with law."

                                 FAO (OS) 514/2010

                                 7. List for hearing on 30th April 2020 in the limited question as indicated in the
                                 order dated 5th November 2019 as modified hereinabove."



                          36.    The said appeal continues till date. Thus, at the outset, JDs' reliance on
                          disposal of the suit is unavailing, as the said order clearly states that parties
                          had the right to enforce the Decree dated 01st October, 2007.

                          37.    Having read the flow of orders leading up to the instant execution
                          petition, we can now deal with the effect of the DB Order (dated 5th November
                          2019), as already extracted in the preceding paragraphs, which is the mainstay
                          of DH's claim for seeking partition by metes and bounds, as they rely on the
                          same to contend that the DB Order has modified the Decree. DHs have argued
                          that under 
Order XXI Rule 28 of CPC
, since the order in appeal related to the
                          same decree of which execution is sought herein, as per the 'doctrine of
                          merger', Division Bench had modified the Decree by empowering the
                          executing Court to consider partition, firstly and comprehensively, prior to
                          exploring possibility of a sale.

                          38.    In the opinion of the Court, the aforenoted construction of the

                          observations made in the DB Order, is wholly misconceived. The aforenoted
                          proceedings note the efforts and stance of parties, which leads to only one
                          conclusion - that the final decree before the Court is for sale of the property.
                          The Division Bench, by way of the DB Order, has only clarified its earlier
                          order dated 21st April, 2017, making it clear that the said order should not be
                          construed as having foreclosed other possibilities of executing the Decree
                          dated 01st October, 2007, in terms of the decree and in accordance with law.
                          Appellate Court has given further clarity by using the expression "in other
                          words", indicating that the executing Court can explore all possibilities of
                          securing to parties their respective shares, as determined by the final Decree,
                          which are not limited to sale of the suit property by way of a public auction.
                          This merely enables the executing Court to secure respective shares of the
                          parties by other modes of sale, apart from public auction, which can only
                          mean that parties can now sell the property by other means, for example - to
                          a buyer by consent, or, to any of the parties by way of buy-out of shares of
                          others. However, the final Decree, which arises from a judgment of the same
                          date and calls only for the sale of the property as method of disposal of
                          property, remains intact, and it would be a stretch to read it in any other
                          manner. Allowing partitioning of the property, as prayed for in the relief
                          clause extracted in para 3 herein, would necessarily mean that the decree has
                          been reversed, which cannot be countenanced. Thus, Court cannot accept
                          DHs' notion that the directions in the DB Order imply any alteration or
                          modification of the Decree.

                          39.    All parties to the suit were duly represented in appeal, a fact strongly
                          emphasized by DH to suggest the binding nature of the DB Order. Indeed, the
                          order of Division Bench is binding on this Court under Order XXI Rule 28

CPC
, having been passed in relation to execution of Decree, and this is not in
                          contest in any manner. However, we cannot ignore that the said proceedings
                          related to an interim order. The final judgment and Decree was not assailed
                          by the appellant therein (late Mrs. Madhuri Singh) and was not the subject
                          matter of the appeal. Division Bench did not deliberate upon the final
                          judgment, and therefore, the observations clarifying its earlier order does not
                          tantamount to a direction to the executing court to separate or divide the suit
                          property in a manner different from the one set out in the Decree. Therefore,
                          in the opinion of this Court, it is not open for this Court to partition the suit
                          property and put DHs in possession of 50% thereof.

                          40.    It is also noted that while DHs have joined hands to claim one moiety
                          in the suit property and seek possession thereof, however, there is no such
                          agreement between JDs. Therefore, even if the Court were to, at this juncture,
                          assume that partition plans suggested by parties are viable and the suit
                          property could be partitioned by metes and bounds, granting such a relief
                          would put interest of other JDs in jeopardy. Order dated 01 st October, 2007,
                          has to be interpreted to ensure that it benefits all parties including JDs, who
                          resolutely maintain that they do not wish to partition and are interested in sale
                          of the suit property. They have serious objection with respect to the
                          workability of the option of part-sale. The substantive ends of justice have to
                          be seen for not just DHs but for all parties, and as such, DHs' suggestion of
                          part-possession and part-sale of the suit property is unworkable and riddled
                          with complications as the JDs are not in agreement with each other.

                          41.    The suit property admeasures 3860 sq. yards. DHs submitted that they
                          are entitled to 1930 sq. yards and are seeking division of permissible FAR,
                          and further seek partition by contending that each partition side holds 1930

                          sq. yards, which would entitle them to 100 FAR, 25% ground coverage and
                          up to 9 permissible dwelling units. In the opinion of the court, this would
                          entail sub-division of the suit property, which is impermissible, and
                          nonetheless, division on the basis of FAR is clearly beyond the terms of the
                          Decree. Thus, despite pleas raised by DHs citing feasibility of division under
                          municipal norms and bye-laws such as MPD 2021, this Court remains
                          unconvinced. Considering multiple ownership rights, partition by metes and
                          bounds would necessarily entail such sub-division of the suit property, which
                          is beyond what is prescribed under MPD 2021.17 This Court is also mindful
                          of the fact that at some point, predecessor-in-interest of JDs 2-4 [being late
                          JD-1] had supported/preferred physical partition and opposed sale of the suit
                          property, but then, DHs have also taken a vacillating position, and such issues
                          were finally put to bed when the suit court took note of the fact that parties
                          were not able to resolve their differences by way of partition, and passed the
                          final consent Decree.

                          42.     For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the opinion that, since the
                          Decree has not been modified by the Division Bench, the only course of action
                          that now remains is to proceed with sale of the suit property, for which, as
                          directed by the Division Bench, the executing Court shall explore other
                          possibilities of sale, such as inter-se bidding amongst parties or sale to
                          identified buyer, with consent of all parties.
