                                3. As per the prosecution case, the informant states

                   that his daughter who was married to the petitioner herein was

                   done to death on account of non-fulfillment of the demand of

                   petitioner has been falsely implicated in the case only for the

                   reason of his being the husband of the deceased. The allegations

                   are false and concocted. Even in the postmortem examination,

                      the cause of death is said to be asphyxia due to hanging. The

                      petitioner is in custody since 4.7.2023.


                                   5. The application for bail is opposed by learned APP

                      for the State who submits that the petitioner is the husband of

                      the deceased and charge-sheet has been submitted under

                                   6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and

                      taking into consideration the allegations in the F.I.R, the

section 304B
 and 
34
 of the

                      Indian Penal Code, the Court is not inclined to enlarge the

                      petitioner on bail and the application is rejected.


                                   7. Learned trial Court is directed to expedite the trial.
