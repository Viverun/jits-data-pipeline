         Leave granted in each of the special leave petition.



                                                                          2


2.    These appeals, by the grant of special leave, are directed 



against common judgment dated May 2, 2008 rendered by the 



Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in C.W.P. No. 2157 



of 2002, C.W.P. No.1965 of 2002 and C.W.P. No.2362 of 2002. 



The   appellants   were   the   Members   of   Delhi   Higher   Judicial 



Service   (`D.H.J.S.',   for   short).     Mr.   M.S.Rohilla   and   Mr. 



P.D.Gupta   were   compulsorily   retired   from   service   under   Rule 



56 (j) of the Fundamental Rules, read with Rule 33 of the Delhi 



Judicial Service Rules 1970, whereas deceased Mr. R.S.Verma 



was   compulsorily   retired   from   service   under   Rule   16(3)   of   All 



India Service (Death-cum-Retirement Benefit) Rules 1958 read 



with Rule 27 of the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules 1970, 



on   different   dates.     They   had   challenged   orders   of   their 



compulsory   retirement   from   service   by   filing   Writ   Petitions 



under   
Article   226.
     Though   the   result   of   each   appeal   would 



depend on its own facts, having regard to the commonality of 



submissions   on   legal   aspects,   this   Court   had   tagged   these 



cases together and heard them one after the other.  This Court 



proposes   to   dispose   of   the   three   appeals,   by   this   common 



Judgment   for   the   sake   of   avoiding   repetitiveness   of   legal 



                                                                        3



principles.  However, the Court proposes to consider each case 



on its own merits.  



      With these observations, the Court proposes to deal with 



appeal arising out of Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.27028 



of 2008, filed by Mr. Rajendra Singh Verma against decision in 



C.W.P.   No.2157   of   2002.     Mr.   Verma   was   born   on   April   13, 



1950.     After   enrolling  himself  as  an  advocate,   he  had  started 



legal practice in the year 1980.   In the year 1994 applications 



were   invited   from   practicing   advocates   for   direct   recruitment 



to  the  D.H.J.S.     Mr.  Verma  had also  applied   pursuant   to  the 



said   advertisement   and   after   interview   he   was   selected   and 



was offered appointment to D.H.J.S.   He joined the service on 



9.3.1995 and was aged about 45 years on the date of joining 



service.        He   worked   as   Additional   District   Judge   at 



Karkardooma   Courts,   Shahdara,   Delhi.     For   the   year   1995-



1996 he was given a `B' remark in the A.C.R., which means his 



performance was average.  From April 1, 1999 to December 7, 



2000, he functioned as Sessions Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi.



                                                                             4


3.    By   the   year   2000   he   had   rendered   service   of   five   years. 



It may be mentioned that a Screening Committee consisting of 



two   Hon'ble   Judges   of   Delhi   High   Court   was   constituted   for 



screening the cases of those officers of the D.H.J.S. and Delhi 



Judicial   Service,   who   had   either   completed   thirty   years   of 



service   or   had   attained   the   age   of   50/55   years   and   for 



considering   the   question   whether   those   Judicial   Officers 



should   be   continued   in   service   or   should   be   prematurely 



retired   in   public   interest.           The   Screening   Committee 



considered   the   cases   of   several   officers   including   that   of   Mr. 



Verma   under   Rule   56   (j)   of   the   Fundamental   Rules.     The 



learned   members   of   Screening   Committee   perused   service 



record including the ACR dossiers of the Judicial Officers but 



did   not   find,   for   the   time   being,   any   Officer   who   could   be 



retired prematurely in public interest as on July 17, 2000.   A 



copy   of   the   abstracts   from   the   Minutes   of   the   Meeting   of   the 



Full Court of Delhi High Court held on July 22, 2000 indicates 



that   the   Full   Court   had   accepted   the   report   of   the   Screening 



Committee.  



                                                                        5


      However, by an order dated December 7, 2000 which was 



served   upon   Mr.   Verma   on   December   8,   2000,   judicial   work 



entrusted   to   him   was   withdrawn   with   immediate   effect.     He 



was   made   in-charge   of   all   the   record   rooms   in   Tis   Hazari 



Courts,   Delhi.     ACRs  of  four  years  i.e.   from   the  year  1997  to 



the   year   2000   were   not   communicated   to   him   on   due   dates. 



From  the record it is  evident that ACRs of Mr.  Verma for  the 



years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were written in one go and he was 



awarded   `C`   remark,   which   means   below   average.     The   ACRs 



for above mentioned three years were communicated to him on 



January   8,   2001   whereupon   he   had   made   representation 



against the same on February 16, 2001.  



4.    In the A.C.R. for the year 2000, he was given `C-' remark, 



which   means   his   integrity   was   doubtful.                     While 



communicating   the   ACR   for   the   year   2000,   he   was   given   a 



time   of   six   weeks   to   make   representation   against   the   same. 



Such   communication   was   received   by   him   on   September   25, 



2001.  On September 21, 2001 the Screening Committee of the 



High   Court   decided   to   retire   Mr.   Verma   compulsorily   from 



                                                                         6



service.   The Full Court of the Delhi High Court accepted the 



recommendation   made   by   the   Screening   Committee   in   its 



meeting   held   on   September   22,   2001.     After   acceptance   of 



recommendation   of   the   Screening   Committee   by   the   Full 



Court, entire work entrusted to him was withdrawn by a letter 



dated   September   24,   2001.     He   made   representation   dated 



September   25,   2001   against   the   proposed   order   retiring   him 



compulsorily   from   service.     He   was   thereafter   served   with 



order   dated   September   27,   2001   retiring   him   compulsorily 



from service with effect from September 28, 2001.  The record 



shows   that   the   representation   dated   16.2.2001   made   by   Mr. 



Verma  against  ACRs  for  the  years  1997,   1998  and  1999   was 



rejected   on  October   5,  2001.     Against  the  A.C.R.   for  the   year 



2000,   Mr.   Verma   had   made   a   representation   dated   October 



13, 2001, which was received by the High Court on September 



25,   2001.     This   was   rejected   by   the   High   Court   vide   order 



dated November 25, 2001.  



5.    Thereupon Mr. Verma had filed C.W.P. No. 2157 of 2002 



before   the   Delhi   High   Court   challenging   the   order   of 



                                                                          7



compulsory retirement dated September 27, 2001.  The reliefs 



claimed in the petition filed by him are enumerated in detail in 



paragraph 7 of the impugned judgment and, therefore, it is not 



necessary   to   reproduce   the   same   in   this   judgment.     The 



prayers   made   by   Mr.   Verma   in   his   Writ   Petition   were 



essentially   based  on  the   following   grounds,   namely,   (1)   ACRs 



for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were not recorded as and 



when   they   fell   due   and,   therefore,   he   had   reason   to   believe 



that   nothing   adverse   was   found   against   his   judicial   work 



and/or conduct whereas recording of ACRs for the three years 



at the same time on January 3, 2001, was illegal. (2)                  There 



was   no   inspection   by   the   Hon'ble   Inspecting   Judge   for   the 



years   1997,   1998,   1999   and   2000   as   a   result   of   which   the 



decision   to   retire   him   prematurely   from   service   on   the   basis 



that his performance was below average and his integrity was 



doubtful, was bad in law. (3) In July, 2000 when the Screening 



Committee   had   reviewed   the   cases   of   various   Officers   of 



D.H.J.S.   for   premature   retirement   in   public   interest,   no 



recommendation   was   made   to   retire   anyone   including   him, 



compulsorily   from   service   and   thus   review   of   his   case   on 



                                                                         8



September 21, 2001 by the Screening Committee, on the same 



material,   was   impermissible.     (4)   Adverse   entry   for   the   year 



2000   was   served   upon   him   on   September   25,   2001   vide   a 



letter dated September 21, 2001 from the Registrar (Vigilance), 



High   Court   whereas   the   recommendation   made   by   the 



Screening   Committee   on   September   21,   2001   to   retire   him 



compulsorily from service was accepted by the Full Court in its 



meeting   held   on   September   22,   2001,   on   the   basis   of   which 



the   Lt.   Governor   of   Delhi   passed   the   order   of   compulsory 



retirement   on   September   27,   2001   which   was   communicated 



to him on September 28, 2001 and as he was deprived of right 



to   make   meaningful   representation   against   ACR   of   the   year 



2000,   the   order   retiring   him   compulsorily   from   service   was 



liable to be set aside. (5) His representation against the entries 



for   the   years   1997,   1998   and   1999   was   rejected   vide   letter 



dated October 5, 2001, which was received by him on October 



8,   2001   whereas   his   representation   dated   October   13,   2001 



against   the   entry   for   the   year   2000   was   dismissed   by   order 



dated   April   5,   2002,   before   which   order   of   compulsory 



retirement from service was passed against him on September 



                                                                       9



28, 2001 and thus non-consideration of representation before 



passing   order   of   compulsory   retirement   had   vitiated   order   of 



his compulsory retirement.  (6) Before   taking   decision   to   retire 



him prematurely from service opportunity of being heard was 



not given to him.   (7) The circumstances of the case indicated 



that the Order of compulsorily retirement passed against him 



was   punitive,   arbitrary,   mala   fide   and   in   violation   of   the 



principles of natural justice.

7.    On Service of notice, the respondent No.1, namely, the Lt. 



Governor,   Administrator   (Government   of   N.C.T.   of   Delhi)   and 



the   respondent   No.2,   i.e.,   the   High   Court   of   Delhi   had   filed 



their   separate   counter   affidavits   opposing   the   Writ   Petition. 



The   High   Court,   in   its   reply,   amongst   other   things   had 



explained   that   the   date   of   birth   of   Mr.   Verma   was   April   13, 



1950 and, therefore, review of his case on September 21, 2001 



when   he   had   completed   fifty   one   years   of   age   was   perfectly 



legal.   According to the High Court, his case was reviewed by 



the   Screening   Committee   on   September   21,   2001   and   the 



Committee had recommended that he should be compulsorily 



retired from service keeping in view his overall service record, 



ACRs and performance.  The High Court mentioned in its reply 



that   the   recommendation   made   by   the   Screening   Committee 



was accepted by the Full Court on September 22, 2001.  What 



                                                                            11



was   asserted   by   the   High   Court   was   that   the   decision   of   the 



Full Court was just and reasonable having regard to the ACRs 



of Mr. Verma. 



8.           The Division Bench hearing the petition filed by Mr. 


             Verma   had   summoned   the   entire   service   record 



             relating   to   his   case.     After   hearing   the   learned 



             counsel   for   the   parties   and   considering   the 



             materials   on   the   record,   the   High   Court   observed 



             that   a   mere   glance   at   the   ACRs   of   Mr.   Verma   and 



             other   records   was   enough   to   conclude   that   the 



             decision to retire him compulsorily from service was 



             well founded.   The High Court discussed principles 



             
laid   down   by
   this   Court   in       the   case   of  
Baikunth 


             Nath   Das
  (supra)   with   regard   to   compulsory 


             retirement   under   Rule   56(j)   of   the   Fundamental 



             Rules,   and   also   took   into   consideration   the 



             principles   of   law   as   to   when   interference   by   a   writ 



             Court   with   the   decision   of   compulsory   retirement 



             would be justified.  Having noticed the law, the High 



                                                            12



Court   held   that   principles   of   natural   justice   were 



not attracted in case of compulsory retirement.  The 



High Court observed that in this case the ACRs for 



three   years   were   recorded   at   the   same   time   which 



according   to   High   Court   was   not   proper,   but   held 



that   there   is   no   absolute   proposition   of   law   that 



recording   of   ACRs   at   once   would   be  perse  illegal.




The   High   Court   expressed   the   view   that   if   good 



reasons were noted for which the ACRs could not be 



recorded   by   stipulated   dates   and   the   matter   of 



recording of ACRs had to be deferred, the recording 



of ACRs of few years at one point of time would not 



render the same illegal.  The High Court noticed the 



reasons   as   to   why   ACRs   for   the   years   1997,   1998 



and   1999   were   recorded   in   one   go,   and   thereafter 



held   that   there   was   sufficient   explanation   for 



recording the ACRs of three years at one time.   The 



argument   that   there   was   no   material   justifying 



recording   such   ACRs   was   considered   to   be 



misconceived   in   view   of   settled   legal   position. 



                                                                    13


       According   to   the   High   Court   the   entire   service 



       record   of   Mr.   Verma   from   1995   to   2000   revealed 



       that   even   for   one   year   he   had   not   earned   "Above 



       Average"   remark  and  his   performance   and   conduct 



       as a judicial officer in fact had kept on deteriorating 



       and   shown   a   downward   trend.     After   taking   into 



       consideration   the  law  on  the   point,  the   High  Court 



       concluded   that   action   under   Fundamental   Rule 



       56(j)   need   not   await   the   disposal   of   the 



       representation   made   against   the   ACRs   and, 



       therefore,   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement 



       passed   against   him   after   taking   into   consideration 



       the ACR for the year 2000 was not bad in law.  



9.     In   view   of   the   above   conclusions   the   High   Court 



       dismissed   the   petition   which   has   given   rise   to   the 



       above numbered appeal. 



10.    It   may   be   mentioned   that   during   the   pendency   of 



       the SLP the original petitioner that is Mr. Rajendra 



       Singh   Verma   expired   in   October,   2009.     Therefore, 



                                                                          14



             the   appeal   is   being   prosecuted   by   his   legal 



             representatives. 



11.          The facts giving rise to the appeal arising out of SLP 



             (C) No. 314 of 2009, are as under:



       The   appellant   Mr.   Purshottam   Das   Gupta   was   born   on 



24.12.1949.     He joined  Delhi  Judicial Service  on 28.01.1978. 




He was granted selection grade on 03.06.1993 retrospectively 



with   effect   from   31.05.1991.     He   joined   as   Additional   Senior 



Civil  Judge  Delhi  on 06.01.1996.     According   to  him  his work 



and   conduct   from   1978   to   1992   was   graded   as   "B",   which 



means   his   performance   was   average.     In   the   year   1995   the 



Inspecting   Judge   reported   that   "I   have   not   inspected   his 



Court,   but   I   have   heard   complaints   about   integrity",   and   left 



column   nos.   6   and   7   to   be   filled   up   by   Full   Court.     On 



18.05.1996 the Full Court recorded ACR for the years 1994-95 



as "C-Integrity Doubtful" and on the basis of the same denied 



promotion to him to Delhi Higher Judicial Service.  Mr. Gupta 



filed a representation against adverse ACR for the year 1994-



95   on   10.07.1996.     The   High   Court   rejected   the   same   by   an 



                                                                             15



order   dated   05.09.1997.     On   26.09.1997   the   Full   Court 



recorded   his   ACR   for   the   year   1996   as   "B".     He   filed   W.P.(C) 



No.   4334   of   1997   against   his   non-promotion   to   Delhi   Higher 



Judicial  Services and also  prayed  to  expunge adverse remark 



for the year 1994-95.  Pending the said petition, the Full Court 



on   22.05.1998   recorded   his   ACR   for   the   year   1997   as   "B". 



W.P.(C) No. 4334 of 1997 filed by Mr. Gupta was allowed by a 



Single   Judge   of   the   High   Court   vide   Judgment   dated 



28.05.1999 and the adverse remark for the year 1994-95 was 



quashed.   Thereupon, he was granted deemed promotion with 



seniority.   The High Court on its administrative side filed LPA 



No.   329   of   1999   against   Judgment   dated   28.05.1999.     On 



24.12.1999 he attained the age of 50 years.   In July 2000 the 



Screening   Committee   had   reviewed   the   cases   of   various 



officers   of   DHJS   including   that   of   Mr.   Gupta   for   premature 



retirement   in   public   interest.     The   Screening   Committee   gave 



report   dated   July   17,   2000.     In   the   report   it   was   mentioned 



that   the   Members   of   the   Screening   Committee   had   gone 



through   the   service   record   including   the   ACR   dossiers   of   the 



officers   of   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   and   Delhi   Judicial 



                                                                           16



Service   who   were   within   the   zone   of   consideration   for   being 



considered   for   premature   retirement   in   public   interest   at   the 



age of 50/55 years, but they did not find, for the time being, 



any   Officer   who   could   be   retired   prematurely   in   public 



interest.     The   Full   Court   considered   the   report   of   Screening 



Committee in its meeting held on 22.07.2000 and accepted the 



report.   However, on 29.07.2000 the Full Court recorded ACR 



of   the   appellant   for   the   year   1999   as   "C".     On   ACR   being 



communicated,   to   him,   he   filed   representation   dated 



08.09.2000.



12.          The   LPA   No.   329   of   1997   filed   by   the   High   Court 



             against   Judgment   dated   28.05.1999   rendered  by   a 



             Single Judge in W.P.(C) No. 4334 of 1997 which was 



             filed by the appellant, was accepted by the Division 



             Bench   vide     Judgment     dated   09.02.2001.     The 



             record   does   not   indicate   that   the   Judgment 



             rendered   by   the   Division   Bench   in   LPA   No.   329   of 



             1997   was   subjected   to   challenge   by   Mr.   Gupta 



                                                               17



before higher forum.   It may be mentioned that Mr. 



Justice   M.S.A.   Siddiqui   was   nominated   as 



Inspecting   Judge   of   the   court   of   Mr.   Gupta   for   the 



year   2000.     The   case   of   Mr.   Gupta   is   that   he   had 



sent one  copy  each of his five Judgments  delivered 



by him during the year 2001, on 18.05.2001 as was 



requisitioned by the learned Inspecting Judge.   The 



learned   Inspecting   Judge   retired   on   29.05.2001 



without giving his report in respect of Mr. Gupta for 



the   year   2000.     The   representation   made   against 



adverse ACR for  the  year 1999 was rejected  by  the 



High   Court   vide   order   dated   01.06.2001.     The 



record   does   not   show   that   
the   said   decision
   was 



challenged by Mr. Gupta before higher authority or 



in   court   of   law.     Thus   the   ACR   for   the   year   1999 



had   attained   finality.     According   to  Mr.   Gupta,  Mr. 



Justice   K.S.Gupta   who   was   not   his   inspecting 



Judge for any year visited his Court on 07.09.2001 



and directed him to send copies of three Judgments 



delivered   by   him   during   2000,   which   requisition 



                                                             18



was   complied   with   by   him.     The   record   would 



indicate   that   Mr.   Justice   K.S.Gupta   submitted   his 



inspection   report   for   the   year   2000   on   11.09.2001 



for consideration of the Full Court.  On 21.09.2001, 



the   Full   Court   recorded   ACR   of   Mr.   Gupta   for   the 



year   2000   as   "C   (Integrity   Doubtful)".              On 



21.09.2001   the   Screening   Committee   of   the   High 



Court   submitted   its   report   recommending   his 



premature retirement from service.   The Full Court 



in   its   Meeting   dated   22.09.2001   recommended 



premature   retirement   of   Mr.   Gupta   to   the   Lt. 



Governor   of   Delhi   (The   Administrator).                On 



21.09.2001 he was communicated ACR for the year 



2000   and   he   was   granted   six   weeks   time   to   file 



representation   against   the   same.     Meanwhile   the 



Administrator   (Lt.   Governor   of   Delhi)   passed   an 



order   dated   27.09.2001,   prematurely   retiring   him 



from service,  under  Fundamental  Rule 56  (j) of the 



Fundamental   Rules   read   with   Rule   33   of   Delhi 



Judicial Service Rules, 1970.  The appellant made a 



                                                             19



representation against adverse entry in the ACR for 



the year 2000, on 29.10.2001 i.e. after the appellant 



was   retired   compulsorily   from   service.               The 



appellant   also   addressed   a   representation   dated 



16.11.2001   to   the   Administrator   against   the   order 



retiring   him   compulsorily   from   the   service.     It   was 



forwarded   by   the   Administrator,   to   the   High   Court 



for necessary action. The High Court by order dated 



12.02.2002 rejected the representation made by the 



appellant on 16.11.2001 which was addressed to Lt. 



Governor.     The   representation   of   the   appellant 



against   adverse   ACR   for   the   year   2000   was   also 



rejected   by   the   High   Court   vide   order   dated 



16.03.2010.   Feeling aggrieved by the order retiring 



him   compulsorily   from   service   the   appellant   filed 



W.P.(C) No. 2362 of 2002 in the High Court and also 



prayed   to   expunge   adverse   remarks   in   his   ACR   for 



the years 1999 and 2000. 



                                                                    20


13.    On   service   of   notice   the   High   Court   filed   reply 



       affidavit   controverting   the   averments   made   in   the 



       petition.     It   was   explained   in   the   reply   that   the 



       Screening Committee of the two learned Judges had 



       considered   the   overall   service   record   of   the 



       appellant   and   found   that   his   performance   and 



       conduct   were   recorded   as   average   for   the   years 



       1979-80, 1980-81, 1999, 1997 and 1998.  The High 



       Court   mentioned  in  the   reply  that  in  the  report  for 



       the   year   1995,   the   Inspecting   Judge   had   recorded 



       that he had heard complaints about the integrity of 



       the appellant.  According to the High Court, again in 



       the   inspection   report   for   the   year   1999-2000   the 



       Inspecting Judge, in respect of judicial reputation of 



       the appellant and in respect of his impartiality and 



       integrity,   had   recorded   that   the   appellant   did   not 



       enjoy good reputation.  As per the reply, the case of 



       the   appellant   was   considered   for   promotion 



       on18.05.1996 but he was not found fit at that time 



       and even in the subsequent selections as a result of 



                                                               21



which he was not promoted.   What was highlighted 



in   the   reply   was   that   for   the   year   1994-95   the 



appellant   was   granted   "C-Integrity   Doubtful" 



whereas for the year 1999 he was granted "C (Below 



Average)" and for the year 2000 he was granted "C-



Integrity Doubtful", and keeping in view the over all 



assessment   of   service   record,   the   Screening 



Committee had recommended that the appellant be 



prematurely   retired   from   service   in   public   interest 



forthwith.     It   was   explained   in   the   reply   that   the 



report   of   the   Screening   Committee   with   respect   to 



number   of   Judicial   Officers   was   placed   before   the 



Full   Court   of   the   High   Court   and   the   Full   Court 



after   considering   the   report   of   the   Screening 



Committee and the work and conduct as reflected in 



service   record   and   general   reputation   of   the 



appellant   as   well   as   of   other   officers,   had   resolved 



that   it   be   recommended   to   the   Administrator, 



Government   of  NCT  of  Delhi   to   retire   the   appellant 



and   others   forthwith   in   public   interest.       The   High 



                                                                   22



       Court mentioned  in the reply that the Lt. Governor 



       had   accepted   the   recommendations   of   the   High 



       Court   and   vide   order   dated   27.09.2001,   the 



       appellant   was   compulsorily   retired   in   public 



       interest.   It was further stated in the reply that the 



       appellant had preferred  a representation before  the 



       Lt.   Governor   who   after   going   through   his   service 



       record   including   assessments   made   by   the 



       Inspecting   Judge   along   with   the   recommendations 



       of   the   Screening   Committee   and   the   resolution   of 



       the Full Court of the High Court had concluded that 



       the appellant was not fit to be continued in service 



       and  his  representation  was rejected   by  order  dated 



       13.09.2001   which   was   communicated   to   him   vide 



       order dated 27.09.2002.





14.    The   High   Court   after   hearing   the   learned   Counsel 


       for the parties concluded that so far as ACR for the 



       year   1999-2000   was   concerned,   there   was   hardly 



       any   reason   to   interfere   with   the   same.     The   High 



                                                               23



Court   noted   that   the   ACR   for   the   year   1994-95 



recording   "C-Integrity   Doubtful"   was   upheld   by   the 



High   Court,   on   judicial   side,   on   the   ground   that 



there was sufficient material to record the said ACR. 



According   to   the   High   Court   the   Judgment   of   the 



Division   Bench   of   the   Delhi   High   Court   in   L.P.A. 



was   upheld   by   the   Supreme   Court   which   operated 



as     res-judicata     so   far   as   the   appellant   was 



concerned.     The   High   Court,   on   the   basis   of   said 



fact,   came   to   the   conclusion   that   the   action   of   the 



High   Court   on   its   administrative   side,   to 



compulsorily retire the appellant from service would 



be sustainable as easing out a person with integrity 



doubtful.  The High Court noticed that so far as the 



ACR for the year 1999 was concerned the appellant 



was   given   "C"   grading   i.e.   below   average   and 



representation   made   by   him   was   rejected   by   the 



Full Court in its Meeting held on 19.05.2001.  High 



Court after looking into the over all career profile of 



the   appellant   held   that   it   was   totally   untenable   to 



                                                                        24



             allege   that there   was  any  bias   or mala  fide  against 



             him.





15.          In   view   of   the   above   mentioned   conclusions   the 



             High Court rejected the petition.





16.          Thereupon,   the   petitioner   filed   Review   Petition 



             before   the   High   Court.     However,   the   same   was 



             withdrawn   with   a   view   to   filing   SLP   against 



             Judgment   delivered   by   High   Court   in   W.P.(C)   No. 



             2362   of   2002.     After   withdrawing   the   review 



             application,   the   appellant   filed   Special   Leave 



             Petition   no.   314   of   2009   which   on   leave   being 



             granted is treated as an appeal.





17.          The facts of the appeal arising out of Special Leave 



             to Appeal No.27200 of 2008 are as under :-





       The   appellant,   i.e.,   Mr.   M.S.   Rohilla   was   appointed   as 



Civil/Sub.   Judge,   in  the   Subordinate   Judicial   Services  under 



the Government of Delhi on May 05, 1972.   On June 17, 1975 



he was confirmed as an officer in the Delhi Judicial Services. 



                                                                           25



He   was   granted   benefit   of   Selection   Grade   on   June   3,   1980 



and   was   promoted   to   the   Higher   Judicial   Services   as 



Additional   District   &   Sessions   Judge   on   November   1,   1989. 



One anonymous complaint was received against him and, after 



looking into the same, he was reverted to Subordinate Judicial 



Services,   as   Civil/Sub.   Judge   by   order   dated   February   15, 



1995.     Feeling   aggrieved,   he   had   preferred   W.P.   No.   4589   of 



1995,   challenging   his   reversion.     Meanwhile,   he   was   served 



with   a   communication   from   the   High   Court   of   Delhi   dated 



October   23,   1997   wherein   his   A.C.R.   for   the   year   1996   was 



graded   as   `C'.     Thereupon   he   made   a   representation   dated 



December   3,   1997   against   the   said   grading.                     The 



representation   made   by   him   was   rejected   on   December   2, 



1998.  The record does not show that any steps were taken by 



him to challenge order dated December 2, 1998 by which his 



representation against ACR for the year 1996 was rejected.





18.          Thereafter   he   received   a   communication   from   the 



             High   Court   in   the   year   1999   whereby   he   was 



             informed   that   in   his   A.C.R.   for   the   year   1997,   he 



                                                               26



was   awarded   `B'   remark.                   Again   by   a 



communication   dated   February   9,   2000   forwarded 



by the High Court he was informed that in his ACR 



for   the   year   1998   he   was   graded   `B'.     He   made   a 



representation against his ACR for the year 1998 in 



the   year   2000.     In   July,   2000   the   Screening 



Committee consisting of Hon'ble Judges of the High 



Court   of   Delhi   reviewed   the   case   of   the   appellant 



with   that   of   several   other   judicial   officers.     As 



observed   earlier,   the   deliberations   made   by   the 



Screening   Committee   indicate   that   it   did   not   find, 



for the time being, any officer who  could be retired 



prematurely in public interest as on July 17, 2000. 




A   copy   of   the   abstracts   from   the   Minutes   of   the 



meeting   of   the   Full   Court   of   High   Court   of   Delhi 



held on July 22, 2000 produced on the record of the 



case,   indicates   that   Full   Court   had   accepted   the 



report   of   the   Screening   Committee.     In   July,   2000 



he   received   a   communication   from   the   High   Court 



mentioning   that   his   ACR   for   the   year   1999   was 



                                                               27



graded   as   `B'.     On   21.9.2001   he   received   a 



communication from the High Court with reference 



to   the   ACR   for   the   year   2000   whereby   he   was 



informed that he was given Grade `C'.  It was further 



mentioned   therein   that   his   integrity   was   found 



doubtful.  By the said communication, he was given 



six weeks time to make a representation against the 



said   grading.     According   to   Mr.   Rohilla,   when   he 



was   awaiting   the   response   to   his   previous 



representations made with reference to the ACRs for 



the   years   1998   and   1999   and   when   he   was   yet   to 



respond   to   the   ACR   for   the   year   2000,   he   received 



communication dated September 27, 2001 from the 



High   Court   prematurely   retiring   him   from   service 



under rule 56(j) of the fundamental Rules read with 



Rule 33 of the Delhi Subordinate Judicial Services. 



According   to   him   he   made   a   representation 



requesting   the   respondents   to   supply   the   material 



upon   which   decision   was   taken   to   prematurely 



retire   him   from   service.     As   he   was   called   upon   to 



                                                                              28



       make a representation against the ACR for the year 



       2000   within   six   weeks   from   the   date   of 



       communication              dated         21.9.2001,         he         filed 



       representation dated November 3, 2001 against the 



       same   but   of   no   avail.     Ultimately,   in   the   month   of 



       March   2002   he   filed   W.P.   No.   1965   of   2002 



       challenging order of his compulsory retirement from 



       service.     Pending   the   said   Writ   Petition,   the   Full 



       Bench   of   the   High   Court   hearing   W.P.   No.   4589   of 



       1995   which   was   directed   against   the   order   of   his 



       reversion   dated   February   15,   1995,   allowed   the 



       same by judgment dated May 29, 2006.   The result 



       was   that   he   stood   reinstated   to   his   post   of 



       Additional   District   Judge   under   Higher   Judicial 



       Services.  



19.    As   is   evident   from   the   memorandum   of   the   writ 



       petition,   the   order   retiring   him   compulsorily   from 



       service   was   challenged   on   several   grounds.     On 



       notice   being   served   the   respondents   namely   the 



                                                                29



Lieutenant   Governor   as   well   Delhi   High   Court   had 



filed   their   separate   counter   affidavits   controverting 



the   claims   advanced   by   Mr.   Rohilla   in   his   writ 



petition.   It was emphasized in the counter affidavit 



filed   on   behalf   of   the   High   Court   that   the   petition 



filed   by   Mr.   Rohilla   proceeded   on   a   mistaken 



assumption and incorrect presumption that he was 



retired   compulsorily   from   service   only   upon 



consideration   of   adverse   remark   `C-'   recorded 



indicating   that   his   integrity   was   doubtful   for   the 



year   2000.     It  was   mentioned  in   the   reply   that  the 



Full   Court   as   also   the   Screening   Committee 



consisting   of   the   two   learned   Judges   of   the   Delhi 



High Court, had considered his entire service record 



which   revealed   that   his   performance   as   a   judicial 



officer  was either average  or below average and  his 



integrity   was   found   doubtful   and   despite   the 



passage   of   time,   nothing   was   done   by   him   to 



improve his performance/image.  The reply affidavit 



proceeded   to   mention   that   in   so   far   as   the   case   of 



                                                                    30



Mr.   Rohilla   was   concerned,   in   its   report   dated 



September   21,   2001   the   Screening   Committee   had 



inter alia recorded as under : 



"The   officer   has   earned   throughout   his   career 

`B' (Average) or C (Below Average) or `C' (Below 

Average-Integrity   doubtful)   reports   except   for 

three   years   i.e.   1979-80,   1981-82   and   1988 

when he could earn only B+ (Good) and for the 

years   1997,   1998   and   1999   when   he   could 

earn  `B' reports.    In the  inspection  note  dated 

29th     March   1973,   the   concerned   Hon'ble 

Inspecting   Judge   observed   that   he   needed   to 

be   watched   so   far   as   his   efficiency   as   a 

Judicial Officer was concerned.  The District & 

Sessions   Judge,   Delhi,   in   his   report   dated 

31.5.1973   for   the   year   1972-73,   mentioned 

that  "a complaint was pending against him in 

the High Court about the return of ornaments 

in   a   theft   case   to   a   party   which   was   not 

entitled".     Further,   as   directed   by   a   Single 

Bench   of   this   Court   by   its   order   dated 

24.7.1973   passed   in   Criminal   Revision   No. 

428/72 in re:  
Ramavtar  Vs. State
, the findings 

of   the   District   &   Sessions   Judge,   Delhi, 

regarding the conduct of Mr. M.S. Rohilla, then 

working   as   Judicial   Magistrate,   First   Class, 

were   placed   on   his   personal   file.     It   had   been 

noted in the aforesaid findings of the District & 

Sessions   Judge,   that   Mr.   M.S.   Rohilla   should 

not   have   shown   so   much   indecent   haste   in 

passing   the   order   for   handing   over   the 

ornaments to Jawahar Lal Gupta.  Though, the 

District   &   Sessions   Judge,   Delhi,   did   not  find 

any   malafide   on   the   part   of   Mr.   M.S.   Rohilla, 

still   according   to   him,   he   acted   in   a   most 



                                                                31



injudicious   manner   due   to   his   inexperience 

and   suppression   of   the   material   facts   by   the 

S.H.O.   while   sending   the   report   in   the   above 

noted case.  The Full Court recorded `C' (Below 

Average) remarks for the year 1972-73).


      In the Inspection Report dated 29.4.1978 

for   the   year   1977-78,   the   District   &   Sessions 

Judge,   Delhi,   observed   regarding   the 

reputation   for   honesty   and   impartiality   of   the 

officer that there were complaints of which the 

High Court was seized then.  In the Inspection 

Report dated 7.12.1985, for the year 1983-84, 

his efficiency as Judicial Officer was termed as 

a   mediocre.     As   regards   his   reputation   for 

honesty   and   impartiality,   the   District   & 

Sessions Judge observed that he must improve 

his reputation which suffered a set back when 

he   was   Additional   Rent   Controller.              In 

Inspection   Report   for   the   same   year,   the 

District & Sessions Judge, Delhi, reported that 

he   did   not   enjoy   good   reputation   for   honesty 

among lawyers and general public and that he 

was   in   the   habit   of   drinking   and   gambling 

almost   daily.     In   the   Inspection   Report   dated 

7.12.1985 for the year 1984-85, the concerned 

Hon'ble   Inspecting   Judge   had   observed   that 

his   reputation   was   under   cloud   although   no 

specific instance of corruption had come to his 

notice, but watch was called for.  





      Following adverse remarks were recorded 

on   the   work   and   conduct   of   Sh.   M.S.   Rohilla 

for the years mentioned against each :-

             Keeping in view the over all record of the 


       officer, we recommend that Mr. M.S. Rohilla be 

       prematurely   retired   in   public   interest 

       forthwith." 





20.    According   to   the   High   Court   it   was   on   this   basis 



       that   the   case   of   Mr.   Rohilla   was   recommended   for 



       premature   retirement   in   public   interest   which 



       recommendation was accepted by the Full Court. 



21.    It may be stated that the entire service record of Mr. 



       Rohilla was called for by the Division Bench.   After 



       taking   holistic   view   of   the   matter   and   the   facts 



       projected in the counter affidavit of the High Court, 



       the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   expressed 



       irresistible   opinion   that   Mr.   Rohilla   was   rightly 



       retired compulsorily from service under FR 56 (j) of 



       Fundamental Rules.  According to the High Court, it 



       was totally misconceived and untenable on the part 



                                                               33



of   Mr.   Rohilla   to   argue   that   the   so-called   material 



relied   upon   was   only   one   sided   view   or   it   was   not 



known   what   was   the   material   placed   before   the 



High   Court   before   decision   to   retire   him 



compulsorily   from   service   was   taken.     The   High 



Court   found   that   there   was   no   force   in   the 



contention that his case could have been considered 



for the purpose of compulsory retirement only in the 



year   2001   when   he   was   about   to   attain   the   age   of 



55 years in the year 2002.   The High Court further 



concluded that it was also a wrong premise adopted 



by   Mr.   Rohilla   that   the   High   Court   had   based   its 



decision solely on the basis of his ACR for the year 



2000 wherein it was recorded that his integrity was 



doubtful.     What   was   concluded   by   the   High   Court 



was   that   the   exercise   undertaken   clearly   revealed 



that   his   entire   service   record   was   taken   into 



consideration.     In   view   of   the   above-mentioned 



conclusions   as   well   as   other   findings,   the   High 



Court   has   rejected   the   writ   petition   filed   by   Mr. 



                                                                      34



       Rohilla giving rise to the appeal by him. 



22.    It is relevant to notice that though each appeal will 



       have to be decided on its own facts, certain common 



       points   were   raised   in   three   appeals   by   the   learned 



       counsel   for   the   appellants   for   consideration   of   this 



       Court.     Therefore   this   Court   proposes   to   deal   with 



       those common points raised by the learned counsel 



       for the appellants for consideration. 



23.    Normally,   an   aggrieved   civil   servant   can   challenge 



       an   order   of   compulsory   retirement   on   any   of   the 



       following   grounds,   namely,   (a)   that   the   requisite 



       opinion   has   not   been   formed,   or   (b)   that   the 



       decision is based on collateral grounds, or (c) that it 



       is an arbitrary decision.   If the civil servant is able 



       to establish that the order of compulsory retirement 



       suffers   from   any   of   the   above   infirmities,   the   court 



       has jurisdiction  to quash the same.   In the light of 



       the above stated position of law, the present appeals 



       will have to be considered.



                                                                      35


24.    The   first   point   which   was   argued   was   that   once   a 


       review   was   conducted   by   the   Screening   Committee 



       of   the   High   Court   on   17.7.2000   on   the   appellants' 



       reaching the age of 50 years, which was accepted by 



       the   Full   Court,   no   second   review   on   the   same 



       material   was   permissible   and   the   service   record   of 



       the   appellants   for   compulsory   retirement,   could 



       have been reviewed only upon their reaching the age 



       of   55   years   and   not   before   reaching   the   said   age. 



       What   was   maintained   was   that   the   Screening 



       Committee as well as the Full Court had considered 



       the entire service record of the appellants and found 



       that   there   was   no   material   to   recommend 



       compulsory retirement of any of them as a result of 



       which   the   previous   record   of   each   appellant   before 



       July, 2000 could not have been again considered for 



       compulsory   retirement.     According   to   the   learned 



       counsel   for   the   appellants,   the   effect   of   decision   of 



       the   Full   Court   of   the   High   Court   dated   July,   22, 



       2000   reflected   in   its   resolution,   passed   on   the 



                                                                      36



       recommendation   of   the   report   of   the   Screening 



       Committee   dated   July   17,   2000,   which   was 



       submitted   after   considering   the   entire   service 



       records and ACR Dossiers of each of the appellant, 



       not   to   retire   any   of   them   prematurely,   was   that 



       there   was   a   bar   to   consider   again   the   case   of   the 



       appellants  for  premature  retirement and,  therefore, 



       the order of compulsory retirement was liable to be 



       set   aside.     
In   support   of   this   plea,   reliance   was 



       placed on the decision of this Court in 
State of U.P. 



       Vs.  Chandra   Mohan   Nigam   &   Others
  (1977)   4 


       SCC 345.




25.    In   reply   to   the   above   mentioned   argument,   it   was 


       pointed   out   by   the   learned   Counsel   for   the   High 



       Court that the decision of the Committee dated July 



       17, 2000 was purely tentative in nature and was not 



       a   final   decision.     According   to   the   learned   counsel 



       for   the   High   Court,   the   use   of   the   expression   "for 



       the   time   being"   in   the   Minutes   of   the   Committee 



                                                                37



would show that it was not a final decision meaning 



thereby the matters were to be considered in detail 



on   a   later   date   and   final   decision   was   to   be   taken 



later   on.     What   was   maintained   was   that   the 



decision of the Committee dated July 17, 2000 was 



not   a   decision   dealing   each   officer   separately   but 



general in nature and, therefore the phrase "for the 



time being" should be construed to mean that it was 



not a final decision and the cases of the appellants 



were   deferred   for   being   considered   in   future. 



Elaborating   this   contention,   it   was   submitted   that 



the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   has 



considered   the   question   as   to   whether   it   was 



consideration on merits or a case of deferment and 



rightly held that the exercise done in July 2000 was 



not   final   and   the   cases   of   the   appellants   were 



deferred.     According   to   the   learned   counsel,   the 



High   Court,   in   the   impugned   judgment,   was 



perfectly   justified   in   holding   that   there   was   no 



consideration   on   merits   of   the   cases   of   the 



                                                                38



appellants   before   21.9.2001,   and,   therefore,   the 



orders   passed   in   cases   of   the   appellants   retiring 



them compulsorily from service were not bad in law. 



Without prejudice to above mentioned contention, it 



was argued that even if it was assumed for the sake 



of   argument   that   there   was   consideration   of   the 



cases   of   the   appellants   in   July,   2000,   even   then 



there   was   no   legal   bar   in   again   considering   their 



cases in next year particularly when it had come to 



the notice of the High Court that their integrity was 



doubtful.     The   learned   counsel   for   the   High   Court 



emphasized   that   in  
State   of   U.P.  Vs.  Chandra 


Mohan   Nigam   and   others
  (Supra)   there   was 


consideration of cases of the respondents therein for 



compulsory   retirement   at   the   age   of   50   years   and 



next consideration  could have been only at the age 



of 55 years but in the said case an exception to this 



rule   is   carved   out,   namely,   if   material   in   regard   to 



doubtful   integrity   of   the   officer   comes   to   light,   the 



authority   need   not   wait   till   the   officer   attains   the 



                                                                39



age   of   55   years   and   action   can   be   taken 



immediately.
 
Placing reliance on the decision of this 



Court   in  
Government   of   T.N.  Vs.  P.A.   Manickam
 


(1996)   8   SCC   519,  it   was   argued   that   the 


consideration   of   an   employee   for   compulsory 



retirement at the age of 50 years is only the starting 



point and not the end point, and, therefore, after 50 



years   at   any   time   case   of   an   officer   can   be 



considered for compulsory retirement.
 
The learned 



counsel   brought   to   the   notice   of   this   Court,   the 



observations   made   in  
Nawal   Singh  Vs.  State   of 


U.P.   and   another
  (2003)   8   SCC   117  to   the   effect 


that   "the   nature   of   judicial   service   is   such   that   it 



cannot   afford   to   suffer   continuance   in   service   of 



persons of doubtful integrity or who have lost their 



utility"   and   argued   that   it   was   always   open   to   the 



High Court to consider the case of the appellants at 



any   point   of   time   though   earlier   a   decision   was 



taken   not   to   retire   any   of   the   appellants 



compulsorily   from   service   in   the   public   interest.




                                                               40


According to the learned counsel for the High Court 



the   consideration   of   the   cases   of   the   appellants   in 



September,   2001   was   in   fact   not   a   review   of   the 



earlier   decision   taken   by   the   Screening   Committee 



in   July   2000   but   it   was   a   fresh   consideration   and 



on   review   of   record   of  service   of   the   appellants   the 



High   Court   was   justified   in   retiring   the   appellants 



compulsorily   from   service.     Placing   reliance   on   the 



decision   in  
Haryana   State   Electricity   Board  Vs. 


K.C. Gambhir
 (1997) 7 SCC 85, it was pointed out 


that therein the case of the officer was considered at 



the   age   of   50   years   and   he   was   permitted   to 



continue   in   service   and   again   his   case   was 



considered   at   the   age   of   55   years   and   he   was 



permitted   to   continue   in   service   but   he   was 



compulsorily retired at the age of 57 years and such 



a decision was upheld by this Court by rejecting the 



plea that his case could have been considered only 



again at the age of 60 years.




                                                                     41


26.    This   Court   has   considered   the   rival   contentions 



       raised by the learned counsel for the parties on the 



       question   whether   the   cases   of   the   appellants   for 



       compulsory retirement, could have been considered 



       again  before   they   had  reached the  age  of 55  years, 



       when   the   Screening   Committee   had   already 



       considered their cases for compulsory retirement on 



       their attaining the age of 50 years on July 17, 2000, 



       and   had   not   recommended   their   compulsory 



       retirement which recommendation  was accepted by 



       the Full Court of the High Court.  



27.    In   this   connection   it   is   relevant   to   notice   certain 



       facts emerging from the record of the case.  Rule 27 



       of   the   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   Rules,   1970 



       provides   that   in   respect   of   matters   regarding   the 



       conditions   of   service   for   which   no   provision   or 



       insufficient provision has been made in those rules, 



       the rules, directions or orders for the time being in 



       force,   and   applicable   to   the   officers   of   comparable 



                                                                           42



           status   in   the   Indian   Administrative   Service   and 



           serving in connection with the affairs of the Union of 



           India, shall regulate the conditions of such service. 



           Thus   Rule   16(3)   of   the   All   India   Services   (Death-



           cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 (`the Rules of 



           1958' for short) would be applicable to the officers of 



           the Delhi Higher Judicial Service.  Clause (3) of Rule 



           16   of   the   Rules   of   1958   was   substituted   in   1972 



           specifying the age of premature retirement to be 50. 



           Rule 16(3), after its substitution, reads as under: -



           "16 (3)     The   Central   Government   may,   in 

           consultation   with   the   State   Government 

           concerned   and   after   giving   a   member   of   the 

           Service   at   least   three   months,   previous   notice 

           in writing, or three months pay and allowance 

           in lieu of such notice, require that member to 

           retire   in   public   interest   from   service   on   the 

           date   on   which   such   member   completes   thirty 

           years of qualifying service or attains fifty years 

           of age or on any date thereafter to be specified 

           in the notice."





Therefore,   the   matter   regarding   pre-mature   retirement   of 



officers   of   the   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   who   have 



completed 30 years of qualifying service or attained 50 years of 



                                                                       43



age, has to be reviewed in the light of Rule 16(3) of the Rules of 



1958 quoted above.  



28.        Similarly, in case of officer of Delhi Judicial Service, 



           Rule   33   of   Delhi   Judicial   Service   Rules,   1970 



           provides   that   in   respect   of   all   such   matters 



           regarding   the   conditions   of   service   for   which   no 



           provision or insufficient provision has been made in 



           the Rules, the Rules or orders for the time being in 



           force,   and   applicable   to   Government   servants 



           holding corresponding posts in connection with the 



           affairs   of   the   Union   of   India,   shall   regulate   the 



           conditions of such service.



29.        In   Delhi   Judicial   Service   Rules,   1970,   no  provision 



           for   compulsory   retirement   has   been   made. 



           Therefore, Fundamental Rule 56(j), which is, for the 



           time   being   in   force   and   applicable   to   Government 



           servants   holding   corresponding   posts   envisaged 



           under the Delhi Judicial Service Rules, 1970, shall 



           regulate   the   matter   of   compulsory   retirement   of 



                                                                                     44



             officers of Delhi Judicial Service.  Fundamental Rule 



             56(j), which is applicable to officers of Delhi Judicial 



             Service, reads as under:-



             "(j) Notwithstanding anything contained in this 

             rule, the appropriate authority shall, if it is of 

             the  opinion   that it  is   in  the  public   interest  so 

             to   do,   have   the   absolute   right   to   retire   any 

             Government   servant   by   giving   him   notice   of 

             not less than three months in writing or three 

             months   pay   and   allowances   in   lieu   of   such 

             notice:





             (i)     if   he   is   in   Group   `A'  or   Group   `B'   service 

                     or post in a substantive, quasi permanent 

                     or   temporary   capacity   and   had   entered 

                     Government   service   before   attaining   the 

                     age of 35 years, after he has attained the 

                     age of 50 years;





             (ii)    in   any   other   case   after   he   has   attained 

                     the age of fifty-five years.





             Provided   that   nothing   in   this   clause   shall 

             apply   to   a   Government   servant   referred   to   in 

             clause (e), who entered Government service on 

             or before the 23rd July, 1966."



It   would   be   seen   that   FR   56(j)   gives   absolute   rights   to   the 



appropriate   authority   to   retire   any   government   servant   who 



entered  the  service  before  attaining   the  age  of  35  years,   after 



he has attained the age of 50 years.  



                                                                      45


30.    The   cases   of   the   officers   of   Delhi   Higher   Judicial 



       Service   and   Delhi   Judicial   Service   were   laid   before 



       the   Screening   Committee   constituted   by   the 



       Administrative   Committee   vide   its   resolution   dated 



       December   15,   1992   and   also   for   laying   down   the 



       guidelines   before   reviewing   the   cases   of   direct 



       recruits.     The   Screening   Committee   decided   as 



       under :-



       "Government Rules be applied."





31.    It may be stated that after reviewing the cases of the 



       officers   of   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   and   Delhi 



       Judicial Service upto 31.12.1994, the Full Court in 



       its meeting held on February 7, 1996 had taken the 



       following decision :-



       "It was decided that for screening of the cases 

       of   the   officers   of   the   Delhi   Higher   Judicial 

       Service and Delhi Judicial Services, now falling 

       within the zone of consideration for retirement 

       in   public   interest,   a   Screening   Committee 

       consisting of Hon'ble Mr. Justice Jaspal Singh 

       and   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   J.K.   Mehra   be 

       constituted and the report of the Committee be 

       laid before the Full Court for consideration."



                                                                             46


Consequent   upon   the   retirement   of   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   J.K. 



Mehra,   it   was   decided   to   reconstitute   the   composition   of   the 



Screening   Committee   by   Full   Court   in   its   meeting   held   on 



January   17,   1998.     The   aforesaid   reconstituted   Screening 



Committee reviewed the cases of several judicial officers in its 



meeting held on July 17, 2000 and gave its report which reads 



as under: -



             "We   have   gone   through   the   service   record 

             including   the   ACR   dossiers   of   the   officers   of 

             Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   and   Delhi 

             Judicial   Service   who   are   within   the   zone   of 

             consideration   for   being   considered   for 

             premature retirement  in public  interest at  the 

             age of 50/55 years.




             We do not find, for the time being, any officer 

             who   can   be   retired   prematurely   in   public 

             interest."





32.          As ordered by the then Hon'ble the Chief Justice of 



             the   Delhi   High   Court,   the   report   of   the   Screening 



             Committee  was  to   be   laid  before   the   Full   Court   for 



             consideration and orders. 



                                                                         47


33.    In   the   meeting   of   the   Full   Court   held   on   July   22, 



       2000   the   report   of   the   Screening   Committee   was 



       considered.     The   true   copy   of   extracts   from   the 



       Minutes   of   the   Meeting   of   the   Full   Court   held   on 



       Saturday,   the   July   22,   2000   at   11.00   A.M.   in   the 



       Judge Court reads as under :-



       "Agenda : 6.   To   review   the   case   of   the   officers 

       of   DHJS   and   DJS   who   are   within   the   zone   of 

       consideration   for   being   considered   for 

       premature   retirement   in   public   interest   - 

       Report   dated   17.7.2000   of   the   Screening 

       Committee   consisting   of   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice 

       Arun   Kumar   and   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   S.K. 

       Mahajan   constituted   pursuant   to   Full   Court 

       decision dated 17.01.1998.




       Minutes   :   "The   report   of   the   Committee   was 

       accepted."





34.    On   a   fair   reading   of   the   report   of   the   Screening 


       Committee   quoted   above   read   with   the   resolution 



       adopted by the Full Court in its meeting dated July 



       22,   2000,   it   becomes   evident   that   the   cases   of   the 



       appellants alone for premature retirement were not 



       considered   but   cases   of   all   the   officers   of   Delhi 



       Higher   Judicial   Service   as   well   as   that   of   officers 



                                                               48



belonging to Delhi Judicial Service who were within 



the   zone   of   consideration   for   being   considered   for 



premature retirement in public interest at the age of 



50/55   years   were   also   considered.     The   record   of 



the   case   would   indicate   that   cases   of   number   of 



officers   belonging   to   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service 



and   Delhi   Judicial   Service   were   considered   on   one 



day,   and   that   too,   in   the   Meeting   of   the   Screening 



Committee   held   on   July   17,   2000.     The   record 



indicates   that   case   of   each   officer   was   not 



considered   individually.     No   reasons   could   be 



recorded   by   the   Screening   Committee   as   to   how 



earlier entries adversely reflecting on the integrity of 



the   appellants,   were   dealt   with   or   viewed.     Under 



the circumstances, the observation that "We do not 



find,   for   the   time   being,   any   officer   who   can   be 



retired   prematurely   in   public   interest"   will   have   to 



be   regarded   as   tentative   and   not   final   in   nature. 



When   the   Screening   Committee   stated   that   it   did 



not find for the time being any officer who could be 



                                                                   49



retired prematurely in public interest, it meant that 



the   cases   of   all   the   officers   were   deferred   to   be 



considered in near future.  It would be seen that FR 



56(j)   gives   absolute   right   to   the   appropriate 



authority to retire any Government servant who has 



entered   the   service   before   attaining   the   age   of   35 



years, after he has attained the age of 50 years and 



in   other   cases   after   he   has   attained   the   age   of   55 



years.   There is no rule prohibiting consideration of 



case   of   an   officer   for   compulsory   retirement   before 



he   attains   the   age   of   55   years,   even   if   his   case   is 



earlier   considered  at   the   age   of   50   years.     There   is 



nothing in the Delhi Judicial Service Rules or Delhi 



Higher   Judicial   Service   Rules   or   the   Indian 



Administrative   Service   Rules   laying   down   a 



prohibition   that   if   the   case   of   an   officer   for 



compulsory   retirement   is   considered   at   the   age   of 



50   years,   his   case   cannot   be   reconsidered   till   he 



attains the age of 55 years.  As held by this Court in 



Government   of   T.N.
  (Supra),   50   years   is   only   the 



                                                                     50



       starting   point   and   not   the   end   point   which   means 



       that after 50 years at any time case of an officer can 



       be considered for compulsory retirement.




35.    
In  
State   of   U.P.  Vs.  Chandra   Mohan   Nigam   and 


       Others
  (1977) 4  SCC 345, the facts were  that the 


       respondent,   i.e.,   Mr.   Chandra   Mohan   Nigam   was 



       recruited   in   the   Indian   Administrative   Service   in 



       Uttar   Pradesh   Cadre.     He   joined   service   on   March 



       23, 1947.  He was appointed as Judicial Member of 



       the Board of Revenue in 1969 and had attained the 



       age of 50 years on December 29, 1967.  By an order 



       dated   August   22,   1970   the   President   of   India,   in 



       consultation with the Government of Uttar Pradesh, 



       in pursuance of the power conferred by sub-rule (3) 



       of   Rule   16   of   the   All   India   Services   (Death-cum-




       Retirement   Benefits)   Rules   1958   had   passed   the 



       order of compulsory retirement of the respondent in 



       the   public   interest   on   the   expiry   of   three   months 



       from   the   date   of   service   of   the   order.     That   was 



                                                                         51



             challenged by Mr. Chandra Mohan Nigam by a writ 



             petition   before   the   Allahabad   High   Court.     The 



             learned   Single   Judge   had   allowed   the   same   on   the 



             grounds   of   contravention   of   the   justiciable   and 



             binding  rules  and   because   the  order   was  based   on 



             consideration   of   irrelevant   matters   and   was   also 



             vitiated by bias.  



       Feeling aggrieved both the Union of India and the State of 



U.P.   had   appealed   to   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court. 



The Division Bench of the High Court by an order dated April 



13, 1973, dismissed both the appeals by a common judgment. 



The Division Bench had not agreed with all the reasons given 



by   the   learned   Single   Judge   and   had   quashed   the   order   of 



compulsory retirement holding that the decision of the Central 



Government to retire Mr. Nigam was passed on collateral facts 



and was, therefore, invalid.  



36.          In   appeals   by   certificates,   this   Court   had   noticed 



             the service career of the respondent.  It was noticed 



             that   the   respondent   during   his   service   career,   had 



                                                                      52



       the following adverse entries in his character role - 



       (1) A warning was administered to him on December 



       6, 1953, for taking undue interest in the ejectment 



       of tenants from a house owned by him at Lucknow, 



       (2)   another   warning   was   issued   to   him   on   August 



       31,   1962,   for   having   acquired   a   car   from   Varanasi 



       Corporation   while   working   as   the   Administrator   of 



       the said Corporation, (3) he was once warned for not 



       observing   proper   rules   and   procedure   for   utilizing 



       the fund earmarked for lower-income group housing 



       scheme towards the construction of a market (1956-



       1957)   and   (4)   he   was   placed   under   suspension   in 



       1964 in connection with some strictures passed on 



       him   by   the   Election   Tribunal   in   a   case   relating   to 



       the         Gorakhpur         Parliamentary          Constituency 



       elections.



37.    With   regard   to   the   last   entry,   he   had   filed   appeal 



       before High Court and the strictures were expunged 



       upon   which   the   order   of   suspension   was   set   aside 



                                                                 53



and   he   was   reinstated   in   service.     However,   the 



aforesaid entry continued to be part of his character 



roll at least till December 20, 1969.  In pursuance of 



sub-Rule (3) of Rule 16 and in consonance with the 



certain   instructions,   the   State   Government   of   U.P. 



in   October   1969   had   constituted   a   Review 



Committee to review the records of the members of 



the   Service   who  were   to   attain   or  had   attained   the 



age   of   50   years.     The   list   of   officers   considered   by 



this   Committee   had   included   the   respondent   Mr. 



Nigam.     The  Committee had  not recommended  any 



of   the   Officers   including   Mr.   Nigam   for   premature 



retirement   and,   on   the   other   hand,   had 



recommended   that   they   should   be   continued   in 



service.     The   State   Government   had   accepted   the 



report of the Review Committee and communicated 



its   decision   to   the   Central   Government.     On 



December   20,   1969,   the   Secretary,   Ministry   of 



Home   affairs   of   the   Central   Government   had 



addressed a letter wherein a reference was made to 



                                                            54



the   adverse   remarks   in   the   character   roll   of   Mr. 



Nigam   including   suspension   of   Mr.   Nigam   which 



was   set   aside   on   strictures   being   expunged   by   the 



High Court, and a view was expressed that his was 



a   fit   case   in   which   proposal   for   his   premature 



retirement under Rule 16(3) of the All India Services 



(Death-cum-Retirement   Benefits)   Rules,   1958 



should   have   been   considered.     After   noticing   the 



fact   that   the   State   Government   had   not 



recommended   the   compulsory   retirement   the   letter 



proceeded to mention that  the Central Government 



was   not   knowing   if   there   were   any   particular 



reasons for taking a different view or whether it was 



a case of over-sight.   By  the said letter the Central 



Government   had   expressed   opinion   to   have   the 



considered   views   of   the   State   Government   before 



any decision was taken by the Central Government. 



On   January   29,   1970,   the   Chief   Secretary   to   the 



State   Government   had   replied   that   the   Review 



Committee   had   considered   the   character   roll   and 



                                                              55



the merits of the case of Mr. Nigam and found that 



he   was   suitable   for   continuing   in   service,   and   that 



the decision of the Committee  was accepted  by  the 



State   Government.     In   the   reply,   it   was   mentioned 



that  the  State  Government's  decision  in the  matter 



was taken after thorough consideration and that the 



State   Government   did   not   consider   it   necessary   to 



go   into   this   question   again.     No   adverse   decision 



contrary   to   the   recommendation   of   the   State 



Government   was   taken   and   communicated   by   the 



Central   Government   to   the   State   Government   in 



pursuance   of   the   recommendation   of   the   first 



Review   Committee  in   October,   1969.    However,   the 



State Government, on its own motion, constituted a 



second   Review   Committee   in   May   1970.     Again 



before   this   Committee   also   the   case   of   all   the 



officers   who   had   attained   the   age   of   50   years 



including   those   whose   cases   had   been   reviewed 



earlier   in   October   1969   was   also   placed   for 



consideration.          
Thus   Mr.   Nigam
's   case   was 



                                                                             56



             considered again by the Second Review Committee.




             This time the Committee recommended that the two 



             officers   one   of   whom   was   Mr.   Nigam   should   be 



             prematurely retired.   The State  Government having 



             accepted   this   recommendation   forwarded   the   same 



             to   the   Central   Government.                The   Central 



             Government   asked   the   State   Government   to   send 



             the   proceeding   of   the   Review   Committee   and   on 



             receipt of the proceedings,  the  Central  Government 



             agreed with the views of the State Government and 



             passed   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement   of   Mr. 



             Nigam. 



38.          It is in the light of these facts that this Court made 



             following   observations   in   paragraph   29   of   the 



             reported decision which read as under : 



       "29.  The   correct   position   that   emerges   from   Rule 

       16(3)   read   with   the   procedural   instructions   is   that 

       the Central Government, after consultation with the 

       State   Government,   may   prematurely   retire   a   civil 

       servant with  three  months' previous  notice  prior  to 

       his attaining 50 years or 55 years, as the case may 

       be. The only exception is  of those  cases  which  had 

       to be examined for the first time after amendment of 



                                                                                      57



       the   rule   substituting   50   years   for   55   years   where 

       even officers, who had crossed the age of 50 years, 

       even before reaching 55, could be for the first time 

       reviewed.   Once   a   review   has   taken   place   and   no 

       decision to retire on that review has been ordered by 

       the   Central   Government,   the   officer   gets   a   lease   in 

       the case of 50 years upto the next barrier at 55 and, 

       if   he   is   again   cleared   at   that   point,   he   is   free   and 

       untrammelled   upto   58   which   is   his   usual   span   of 

       the   service   career.   This   is   the   normal   rule   subject 

       always   to   exceptional   circumstances   such   as 

       disclosure   of   fresh   objectionable   grounds   with 

       regard to integrity or some other reasonably weighty 

       reason."





39.           So   far   as   present   case   is   concerned,   no   final 


              decision   was   taken   by   the   Screening   Committee   in 



              case   of   any   officer   of   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service 



              and Delhi  Judicial Service, but a tentative decision 



              was taken that at that stage no officer was found fit 



              who   could   have   been   retired   compulsorily   from 



              service.     This   is   not   a   case   wherein   a   review   had 



              taken place and a positive final decision to continue 



              the   appellants   in   service,   was   taken   by   the 



              Screening   Committee.     
In   the   case   of  
Chandra 


              Mohan   Nigam
  (Supra),   the   case   of   Mr.   Nigam   was 


              considered   positively   for   retirement   but   a   specific 



                                                               58



recommendation   was   made   to   continue   him   in 



service,   by   the   Review   Committee   which   was 



accepted   by   the   State   Government   and   except 



expressing an opinion that having regard to certain 



adverse remarks in his character roll, this was a fit 



case in which proposal for his premature retirement 



should   have   been   considered,   the   Central 



Government,   after   receipt   of   reply   from   the   State 



Government,   had   not   taken   any   adverse   decision 



contrary   to   the   recommendation   of   the   State 



Government,   which   was   in   turn   based   on   the 



recommendation   of   the   First   Review   Committee.




Further, in 
Chandra Mohan Nigam
's case itself this 



Court   has   in   para   27   of   the   reported   decision 



hastened to add that when integrity of an officer is 



in   question,   that   will   be   an   exceptional 



circumstance   for   which   order   may   be   passed   in 



respect  of  such  an  officer  under   Rule   16(3),   at  any 



time,   if   other   conditions   of   that   rule   are   fulfilled 



apart   from   the   choice   of   disciplinary   action   which 



                                                                       59



       will   also   be   open   to   the   Government.
 
Thus   an 



       exception   to   the   rule,   that   if   there   is   consideration 



       at  the   age   of  50,   next   consideration   can  be  only at 



       the age of 55 is made in  
Chandra Mohan Nigam
's 



       case   itself   by   holding   that   if   material   in   regard   to 



       doubtful   integrity   of   the   officer   comes   to   light,   the 



       authority   need   not   wait   till   the   officer   attains   the 



       age   of   55   years   and   action   can   be   taken 



       immediately.    The  integrity  of  all  the  three   Judicial 



       Officers   was   found   to   be   doubtful   and,   therefore, 



       their compulsory retirement from service cannot be 



       held to be illegal.




40.    At   this   stage,   a   reference   may   be   made   to   the 


       decision of this Court in 
Haryana State Electricity 


       Board vs. K.C. Gambhir
 (1997) 7 SCC 85.  Though 


       the   decision   may   not   be   strictly   applicable   to   the 



       facts of the present cases, but certain observations 



       made   therein   are   relevant   to   understand   the   issue 



                                                                             60



             posed for consideration of this Court in the present 



             appeals.




      The   respondent   therein   was   an   employee   of   Haryana 



State   Electricity   Board.     He   was   promoted   as   Executive 



Engineer on February 19, 1977.   When he attained the age of 



50 years, his case for compulsory retirement was reviewed on 



November 30, 1986.  His integrity was reported doubtful in the 



year 1985-86, yet it was decided not to retire him compulsorily 



because   his   representation   against   adverse   remarks   was 



pending.     On   attaining   55   years   of   age,   his   case   for 



compulsory   retirement   was   again   reviewed   on   November   30, 



1991.     AT   that   time   also,   departmental   proceedings   were 



pending   against   him   for   a   serious   act   of   misconduct   and, 



therefore,   it   was   decided   not   to   retire   him.     The   enquiry   was 



over   on   August   4,   1993   and   thereafter,   he   was   compulsorily 



retired   on   February   3,   1994   by   giving   him   three   months' 



notice.     The   retirement   came   nine   months   before   his   date   of 



superannuation.     Thus,   on   two   earlier   occasions,   it   was 



decided not to retire him compulsorily, but on third occasion, 



                                                                            61



order   of   compulsory   retirement   was   passed.     The   order   of 



compulsory   retirement   was   set   aside   by   the   High   Court   of 



Punjab   and   Haryana   in   the   writ   petition   filed   by   the 



respondent.  This Court, while allowing the appeal filed by the 



Haryana   State   Electricity   Board,   observed   that   though   the 



appellant could have taken the action of compulsorily retiring 



the   respondent   from   service   earlier,   it   acted   very   fairly   and 



allowed him to remain in service till his representation against 



the adverse remarks was considered on the first occasion and 



subsequently,   till   the   departmental   enquiry   was   completed. 



The clear meaning of the above-mentioned observation is that 



even   during   the   pendency   of   his   representation   against 



adverse   remarks   and   during   the   pendency   of   departmental 



enquiry,   Haryana   State   Electricity   Board   could   have   taken 



action   of   compulsorily   retiring   the   respondent   from   service 



earlier.  Thus on the basis of service record, the three Judicial 



Officers could have been retired compulsorily from service but 



a tentative decision was taken not to retire them from service 



at   that   point   of   time.     But   this   tentative   decision   would   not 



preclude   the   authority   concerned   from   passing   orders   of 



                                                                          62



compulsory retirement later on.



41.       
In  
Government   of   T.N.  vs.  P.A.   Manickam
  AIR 


          1996 SC 2250, what is ruled by this Court is that 


          the   rule   permits   the   appropriate   authority   to   retire 



          any   Government   servant   after   he   has   attained   the 



          age of 50 years or after he has completed  25 years 



          of   qualifying   service   and   the   rule   prescribes   a 



          starting   point,   which   is   the   attaining   of   the   age   of 



          50   years   or   the   completion   of   25   years   of   service, 



          but it does not prescribe a terminus ad quam and it 



          is,   therefore,   open   to   the   appropriate   authority 



          under the rule to consider the case of a Government 



          servant   for   premature   retirement   at   any   time   after 



          the aforementioned starting points.   Thus, after the 



          so-called   review   of   the   cases   of   the   two   appellants 



          and   the   deceased   officer   in   July,   2000,   their   cases 



          were rightly reviewed again and orders retiring them 



          compulsorily   from   service   were   rightly   passed 



          against them.




                                                                             63


42.          
In  
Union   of   India  Vs.  M.E.   Reddy
  (1980)   2   SCC 


             15, the respondent Mr. Reddy started his career in 


             the   Police   Service   as   Deputy   Superintendent   of 



             Police   in   the   year   1948.     In   the   year   1958   he   was 



             appointed to the Indian Police Service.  On July 31, 



             1958, he was promoted as Superintendent of Police 



             in   State   of   Andhra   Pradesh   and   held   charge   of   a 



             number   of   Districts   from   time   to   time.     He   was 



             awarded   the   President   Police   Medal   on   August   14, 



             1967 but the award of the said medal was withheld 



             as   he   was   placed   under   suspension   by   the 



             Government   on   August   11,   1967   pending 



             departmental   enquiry   into   a   number   of   allegations 



             made against him.




       In   1969,   he   filed   a   writ   petition   in   the   Andhra   Pradesh 



High   Court   praying   that   the   order   of   suspension   passed 



against him be quashed as it was passed on false allegations 



and   at   the   instance   of   Mr.   K.   Brahmanand   Reddy   who   was 



then   Chief   Minister   of   the   State.     The   writ   petition   was 



                                                                          64



admitted   by   the   High   Court   and   an   interim   order   staying   all 



further   proceedings   in   departmental   enquiry   was   passed. 



When   the   writ   came   up   for   hearing,   the   State   Government 



represented to the High Court that, it had decided to withdraw 



order   of   suspension   and   reinstate   Mr.   Reddy.     The   State 



Government   withdrew   the   order   of   suspension   and   directed 



that   the   period   of   suspension   be   treated   as   on   duty. 



Thereafter,   on   application   being   filed   by   Mr.   Reddy,   the   writ 



petition   was   dismissed   as   withdrawn.     Because   of   these 



developments the departmental proceedings against him were 



dropped   and   he   was   given   Selection   Grade,   which   was 



withheld because of the suspension order.   By an order dated 



April   28,   1971,   he   was   promoted   to   the   rank   of   Deputy 



Inspector   General   of   Police.     During   the   course   of   the 



departmental   enquiry   an   entry   to   the   effect   that   "he   had 



concocted a case of attempt to rape against one Mr. Venugopal 



Reddy   to   please   the   then   Inspector   General   of   Police   Mr. 



Nambiar and there was a strong suspicion about his integrity" 



was made in his A.C.R.  He made a representation to expunge 



the   entry.     The   Government   decided   that  as   statements   were 



                                                                               65



factual,   it   would   be   sufficient   if   entry   was   made   to   the   effect 



that   the   suspension   was   subsequently   lifted   and   the   period 



was   treated   as   on   duty   and   that   further   action   was   not 



necessary as there were no good grounds to hold him guity of 



any of the charges leveled against him.





      However,   on   August   7,   1975,   a   Review   Committee 



consisting   of   the   Chief   Secretary,   Home   Secretary   and 



Inspector   General of Police  considered  various cases  of police 



officers   including   that   of   Mr.   Reddy   and   made 



recommendations.     On  September   11,   1975,   the   Government 



of   India,   after   considering   report   of   the   Review   Committee, 



ordered compulsory retirement of Mr. Reddy in public interest.





      Thereupon   Mr.   Reddy   filed   writ   petition   in   the   Andhra 



Pradesh   High   Court.     The   Single   Judge   allowed   the   petition 



and   quashed   order   of   compulsory   retirement.     That   decision 



was upheld by the Division Bench of the High Court, in appeal 



filed   by   State   of   Andhra   Pradesh   and   Union   of   India. 



Therefore, the two appeals by certificate were filed before this 



Court.





                                                                               66


      It   was   argued   before   this   Court   on   behalf   of   Mr.   Reddy 



that the order impugned was passed on materials which were 



not   existent   inasmuch   as   there   were   no   adverse   remarks 



against Mr. Reddy who had a spotless career throughout and 



if   such   remarks   had   been   made   in   his   confidential   reports, 



they would have been communicated  to him under the rules. 



This contention was negatived in following terms: -





      "Here   we   might   mention   that   the   appellants   were 

      fair   and   candid   enough   to   place   the   entire 

      confidential personal file of Reddy before us starting 

      from the date he joined the Police Service and after 

      perusing the same we are unable to agree with Mr. 

      Krishnamurty   Iyer   that   the   officer   had   a   spotless 

      career.     The   assessment   made   by   his   superior 

      officers  from  the  very  beginning  of  his  service  until 

      the   impugned   order   was   passed   show   that   at   the 

      best   Reddy   was   merely   an   average   officer   and   that 

      the reports show that he was found to be sometimes 

      tactless, impolite, impersonated, suffered from other 

      infirmities,   though   not   all   of   them   were   of   a   very 

      serious nature so as to amount to an adverse entry 

      which may be communicated to him.  We might also 

      mention   that   before   passing   an   order   under   Rule 

      16(3) it is not an entry here or an entry there which 

      has   to   be   taken   into   consideration   by   the 

      Government   but   the   overall   picture   of   the   officer 

      during the long years of his service that he puts in 

      has   to   be   considered   from   the   point   of   view   of 

      achieving   higher   standard   of   efficiency   and 

      dedication so as to be retained even after the officer 

      has put in the requisite number of years of service. 



                                                                               67



       Even   in   the   last   entry   which   was   sought   to   be 

       expunged through a representation made by Reddy 

       and   other   entries   made   before   that   it   appears   that 

       the integrity of Reddy was not above board."





While allowing the appeals of the Union of India and State of 



Andhra Pradesh, this Court has emphasized the importance of 



adverse   entry.     After   referring   to   observations   made   by   this 



Court in para 27 of the decision in the case of 
Sate of U.P. vs. 


Chandra Mohan Nigam
 (1977) 4 SCC 345, wherein the Court 


had   hastened   to   add   that   when   integrity   of   an   officer   is   in 



question   that   will   be   an   exceptional   circumstance   for   which 



order  may  be  passed  in  respect  of such  a person  under   Rule 



16(3)   at  any  time,   if   other   conditions   of  the   rule   are   fulfilled, 



apart from the choice of disciplinary action which will also be 



open   to   Government,   this   Court   
M.E.   Reddy
's   case,   has   held 



as under: -




       "Thus,   even   according   to   the   decision   rendered   by 

       this   Court   in   the   aforesaid   case   the   fact   that   an 

       officer  is  of  doubtful  integrity   stands  on  a  separate 

       footing and if he is compulsorily retired that neither 

       involves any stigma nor any error in the order."



                                                                          68


Further, in the process of interpreting the decision in 
Chandra 


Mohan   Nigam
's  case,   this   Court   in   para   25   of   the   reported 


decision   inter-alia   observed   that   "we   have   already   indicated 



above   that   this   Court   made   it   absolutely   clear   that   when   a 



person   was   retired   under   Rule   16(3)   on   the   ground   that   his 



integrity was in question, the observations made by this Court 



would have no application."




43.          Apart   from   the   poor   judicial   performance,   the 



             appellants   were   also   retired   compulsorily   from 



             service,   on   the   ground   that   their   integrity   was 



             doubtful.  



44.          The   mandate   of   
Article   235
   of   the   Constitution   is 


             that   the   High   Court   has   to   maintain   constant   vigil 



             on   its   subordinate   judiciary   as   
laid   down   by
   this 



             Court   in  High   Court   of   Judicature   at   Bombay 


             through its 
Registrars  Vs.  Shirishkumar Rangrao 


             Patil and Another
  (1997) 6 SCC 339.   In the said 


             case, this Court has explained that the lymph nodes 



             (cancerous   cells)   of   corruption   constantly   keep 



                                                                         69



       creeping   into   the   vital   veins   of   the   judiciary   and 



       need   to   stem   it   out   by   judicial   surgery   lies   on   the 



       judiciary   itself   by   its   self-   imposed   or   corrective 



       measures   or   disciplinary   action   under   the   doctrine 



       of   control   enshrined   in   
Articles   235
,   124(6)
   of   the 



       Constitution,    and   therefore,   it would   be  necessary 



       that   there   should   be   constant   vigil   by   the   High 



       Court   concerned   on   its   subordinate   judiciary   and 



       self introspection.




45.    Judicial   service   is   not   a   service   in   the   sense   of   an 


       employment   as   is   commonly   understood.     Judges 



       are discharging their functions while exercising the 



       sovereign judicial power of the State.  Their honesty 



       and   integrity   is   expected   to   be   beyond   doubt.     It 



       should   be   reflected   in   their   overall   reputation. 



       There   is   no   manner   of   doubt   that   the   nature   of 



       judicial service is such that it cannot afford to suffer 



       continuance   in   service   of   persons   of   doubtful 



       integrity or who have lost their utility.  As explained 



                                                             70



by   this   Court   in  Chandra   Singh   and   others  Vs. 


State of Rajasthan & another  (2003) 6 SCC 545, 


the   power   of   compulsory   retirement   can   be 



exercised   at   any   time   and   that   the   power   under 




Article   235
   in   this   regard   is   not   in   any   manner 



circumscribed   by   any   rule   or   order.     What   is 



explained in the said decision by this Court is that 




Article 235
 of the Constitution of India enables the 



High   Court   to   assess   the   performance   of   any 



judicial officer at any time with a view to discipline 



the black sheep or weed out the deadwood, and this 



constitutional   power   of   the   High   Court   cannot   be 



circumscribed by any rule or order.  
Moreover while 



upholding   the   orders   of   compulsory   retirement   of 



judicial   officers   who   were   working   in   the   State   of 



U.P.,   following   weighty   observations   have   been 



made by this Court in para 13 of decision in case of 



Nawal Singh  vs.  State of U.P. and another
  (2003) 


8 SCC 117: -




                                                                                71


       "13. It   is   to   be   reiterated   that   for   keeping   the 

       stream   of   justice   unpolluted,   repeated   scrutiny   of 

       service   records   of   judicial   officers   after   a   specified 

       age/completion of specified years of service provided 

       under  the  Rules  is a must  by  each and every  High 

       Court as the lower judiciary is the foundation of the 

       judicial   system.     We   hope   that   the   High   Courts 

       would   take   appropriate   steps   regularly   for   weeding 

       out   the   dead   wood   or   the   persons   polluting   the 

       justice delivery system."





46.          Under   the   circumstances   this   Court   is   of   the   firm 



             opinion   that   the   principle   
laid   down   in
 
Chandra 



             Mohan   Nigam
's   case   will   not   be   applicable   to   the 



             facts   of   the   appellants   who   were   Members   of   the 



             Delhi Higher Judicial Service.




47.          Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that 


             the principle 
laid down in
 
Chandra Mohan Nigam
's 



             case would apply with all the vigour to the  facts  of 



             the appellants also, this Court finds that in respect 



             of   all   the   three   officers,   after   the   previous 



             consideration   in   July,   2000,   new   material   in   the 



             form   of   ACR   for   the   year   2000   "`C'   integrity 



             doubtful" had come into existence and had become 



                                                                72



a   part   of   their   respective   service   records   when   the 



Full   Court   in   its   meeting   held   on   13.9.2001 



recorded   their   ACRs   for   the   year   2000.
 
Thus   the 



consideration   by  the  Committee  constituted   for  the 



purpose   of   evaluating   the   cases   of   the   officers   to 



ascertain   whether   they   should   be   compulsorily 



retired, was subsequent in point of time, namely, on 



21.09.2001   and   as   such   it   will   be   fully   covered   by 



the exception spelt out in 
Chandra Mohan Nigam
's 



Case itself in regard to consideration of cases again 



before the age of 55 years.  The consideration of the 



cases   of   the   three   judicial   officers   on   the   basis   of 



ACRs   dated   September   13,   2001   recorded   by   the 



Full Court of the Delhi High Court is not a review of 



the   earlier   decision   of   July,   2000.     It   is   a   fresh 



consideration.  It is review of the record of service of 



the   officers   and   not   review   of   the   earlier   decision 



and   such   review   is   not   only   permissible   but   is 



perfectly legal and valid.




                                                                      73


48.    The   net   result   of   the   above   discussion   is   that   this 



       Court   does   not   find   any   substance   in   the   first 



       contention   raised   on   behalf   of   the   appellants   and 



       the same is hereby rejected. 



49.    The   next   contention   which   was   raised   by   the 


       learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   was   that   the 



       order   passed   by   the   Lt.   Governor   compulsorily 



       retiring the appellants from service, without seeking 



       aid   and   advice   of   his   Council   of   Ministers,   as 



       required by 
Article 239(AA)(4)
 of the Constitution is 



       ultra vires as well as illegal and therefore, the same 



       should   not   be   sustained.     Elaborating   the   said 



       point,   it   was   argued   that   the   order   retiring   the 



       appellants compulsorily from service was passed by 



       the   Lt.   Governor   on   receiving   the   recommendation 



       of   the   High   Court   of   Delhi,   pursuant   to   the 



       resolution   of   the   Full   Court   passed   on   September 



       22,   2001   acting   under   and   in   exercise   of   control 



       over   subordinate   judiciary   under   
Article   235
  of  the 



                                                                        74



            Constitution, but the powers of the Lt. Governor  of 



            N.C.T.   of   Delhi   under   
Article   239(AA)(4)
   which   are 



            analogous   to   powers   of   a   Governor   under   
Article 



            163(1)
 of the Constitution can be exercised only on 



            aid   and   advice   of   his   Council   of   Ministers,   and 



            therefore,   the   order   passed   by   the   Lt.   Governor 



            retiring the appellants compulsorily from service are 



            bad   in   law.     In   support   of   these   submissions   the 



            learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   placed   reliance 



            on:   (a)  Samsher   Singh  Vs.  State   of   Punjab   and 


            Another, (1974) 2 SCC 831  = AIR 1974 SC 2192 


            and   (b)  M.M.Gupta   and   Others  Vs.  State   of 


            Jammu   &   Kashmir   and   Others,   (1982)   3   SCC 



            412. 





50.    The   learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   High   Court 



pleaded   that   the   contention   that   Lt.   Governor   while   passing 



the   Order   of   compulsory   retirement   ought   to   have   been 



advised   by   his   Council   of   Ministers   was   not   advanced   before 



the High Court and therefore was not considered by the High 



                                                                              75



Court   and   this   plea   should   not   be   permitted   to   be   raised   for 



the first  time in the  appeals  arising  by grant  of special leave. 



It   was   pointed   out   that   in   the   appeal   arising   out   of   SLP   No. 



314 of 2009 in the list of dates filed by Mr. P.D. Gupta it was 



pleaded that this plea was urged before the High Court but the 



same was not considered before the High Court and if that be 



so the remedy of the appellant is to go back to the High Court 



and   file   the   review   petition.     What   was   emphasized   was   that 



Mr.   Gupta   had   in   fact   filed   a   review   petition   but   later   on 



withdrawn the same without seeking any liberty to agitate this 



point in the Special Leave Petition or in any other proceedings 



and   therefore,   he   is   not   entitled   to   urge   this   plea.     It   was 



emphatically   pointed   out   by   the   learned  counsel   for  the  High 



Court that in other appeals, it is not stated by the appellants 



that   such   a   plea   was   urged   before   the   High   Court   and   they 



having  not urged  such a plea in the memorandum  of Special 



Leave   Petitions,   the   plea   raised   at   the   delayed   and   belated 



stage   should   not   be   considered   by   this   Court.     
In   support   of 



this   argument,   the   learned   counsel   for   the   respondent   relied 


upon decisions in (
a)             Daman Singh and Others Vs. State 



                                                                         76



of Punjab and Others
, (
1985) 2 SCC 670, (b) State of Punjab 


and   Another  Vs.  H.B.   Malhotra
,   (
2006)   11   SCC   169,   (c) 


Mohd. Akram Ansari Vs. Chief Election Officer and Others
, 


(
2008)   2   SCC   95  and   (d)  Ex-Constable   Ramvir   Singh  Vs. 


Union of India and Others
, (2009) 3 SCC 97.




51.   Without   prejudice   to   the   above   stated   contention,   it   was 


argued  by   the   learned  counsel   for   the  respondent   that  under 




Article 235
, it is High Court which has to exercise supervision 



and   control   over   the   subordinate   judiciary   and   not   the   State 



Government   and   therefore,   recommendations   of   the   High 



Court in regard to compulsory retirement were/are binding on 



the   State   Government/the   Governor.     The   learned   counsel 



pleaded   that   the   Lt.   Governor   has   to   act   on   the 



recommendation of the High Court and there is no illegality, if 



the Governor  on the recommendations of the High Court had 



passed order retiring the appellants compulsorily from service. 



To   buttress   this   submission,   the   learned   counsel   for   the 



respondent placed reliance on (a) Samsher Singh Vs. State of 


Punjab   and   Another,   (1974)   2   SCC   831  =   AIR   1974   SC 



                                                                             77

1986)   3   SCC   604  and   (g)  T.   Lakshmi 


Narasimha   Chari  Vs.  High
   Court   of   A.P.   and   Another, 


(1996) 5 SCC 90.




      This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties 



at   great   length   on   the   question   whether   the   order   passed   by 



the   Lt.   Governor   compulsorily   retiring   the   appellants   from 



service   without   seeking   aid   and   advice   of   his   Council   of 



Ministers   as   required   under   
Article   239   (AA)(4)
   of   the 



Constitution is ultravires and illegal.  



52.It   is   true   that   the   appellant   Mr.   Gupta   has   stated   in   the 


    Memorandum  of Special  Leave Petition that  the point that 



    Lt.   Governor   could   not   have   passed   order   retiring   him 



                                                                         78



compulsorily   from   service   on   the   recommendation   of   the 



High   Court   and   without   seeking   aid   and   advice   of   his 



Council of Ministers, was urged before the High Court, but 



the said point was not considered by the High Court.   It is 



rightly   argued   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   respondent 



that   even   in   such   an   eventuality,   the   only   course/remedy 



available   to   the   said   appellant   was   to   approach   the   High 



Court   seeking  review  of  the   Judgment.     The   record   shows 



that   the   appellant   Mr.   Gupta   had   filed   review   application 



before   the   High   Court,   but   the   same   was   unconditionally 



withdrawn.  At the time of withdrawal of review application, 



the   appellant   had   not   sought   any   liberty   to   agitate   this 



point in Special Leave Petition before this Court.   So far as 



two   other   appellants   are   concerned   they   have   not   stated 



that   such   a   point   was   argued   on   their   behalf   before   the 



High   Court   and   was   not   dealt   with   by   the   High   Court. 



Under   the   circumstances   a   question   arises   whether   the 



learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   should   be   permitted   to 



raise   such   a   plea   before   this   Court   at   the   stage   of   final 



disposal of the matters.  



                                                                             79


53.Ordinarily   the   Supreme   Court   would   not   entertain   a   new 


   prayer at the hearing of the appeal under 
Article 136
 when 



   it is not raised in the High Court or in the petition seeking 



   leave to appeal.  Point not raised before the High Court but 



   taken   in   Special   Leave   Petition   will   not   ordinarily   be 



   allowed   to   be   agitated   before   this   Court.     The   consistent 



   practice   of   this   Court   is   that   the   Court   does   not   permit   a 



   party   to   raise   a   new   point   which   has   not   been   argued 



   before   the   High   Court.     However,   there   are   exceptional 



   cases in which this Court may permit a party to raise a new 



   plea before this Court for the first time, for example, where 



   the   plea   raised  does  not  require  investigation   of  new   facts 



   or   where   the   question   raised   is   a   pure   question   of   law   or 



   where   the   point   is   likely   to   be   raised   in   future   affecting 



   such   cases   or   where   the   respondent   has   dealt   with   the 



   point raised for the first time, in the reply filed before this 



   Court and the learned counsel for the parties are heard at 



   length and in great detail.  This Court having gone through 



   the   decisions   relied   upon   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the 



   respondent, finds that no absolute proposition of law is 
laid 



                                                                            80



   down   in
   any   of   the   decisions   that   in   no   circumstances   a 



   new   plea   can   ever   be   permitted   to   be   raised   before   this 



   Court   if   the   same   was   not   raised   before   the   High   Court. 



   The question sought to be raised is a pure question of law 



   for   which   factual   foundation   is   already   laid.     The   learned 



   counsel for the parties have been heard at great length on 



   the   new   point   sought   to   be   raised   first   time   before   this 



   Court.  The authorities cited at the Bar have been read and 



   re-read   to   emphasize   respective   view   points.     Therefore, 



   having   regard   to   the   facts   of   the   case,   this   Court   has 



   permitted   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   to   raise 



   the point  and heard the learned  counsel for the  parties in 



   detail.  



54.In order to answer the question posed for the consideration 


   of   the   Court,   it   will   be   useful   to   notice   the   contents   of 



   
Articles 163(1)
 and 
239(AA) (4)
 of the Constitution. 



55.Article 163 makes provision that Council of Ministers has 


   to aid and advice Governor.  It inter alia provides that there 



   shall   be   a   Council   of   Ministers   with   the   Chief   Minister   as 



                                                                              81



   the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of 



   his   functions,   except   in   so   far   as   he   is   by   or   under   the 



   Constitution   required   to   exercise   his   functions   or   any   of 



   them   in   his   discretion.     The   said   Article   further   provides 



   that if any question arises whether any matter is or is not a 



   matter in respect of which the Governor is by or under this 



   Constitution required to act  in his discretion,  the decision 



   of   the   Governor   in   his   discretion   shall   be   final,   and   the 



   validity   of   anything   done   by   the   Governor   shall   not   be 



   called in question on the ground that he ought or ought not 



   to   have   acted   in   his   discretion.     Sub   
Article   (3)
   of   
Article 



   163
   stipulates   that   the   question   whether   any,   and   if   so 



   what,   advice   was   tendered   by   Ministers   to   the   Governor 



   shall not be inquired into in any Court.  



56.Article   239AA   inserted   by   the   
Constitution   (Sixty-ninth 


   Amendment)   Act,   1991
   enacts   special   provisions   with 



   respect   to   Delhi.     Clause   (1)   of   said   Article   states   that   as 



   from the date of commencement of the Constitution (Sixty-



   ninth   
Amendment)   Act,   1991
   which   is   February   1,   1992 



                                                                             82



the   Union   Territory   of   Delhi   shall   be   called   the   National 



Capital Territory of the Delhi and the administrator thereof 



appointed   under   
Article   239
   shall   be   designated   as   the 



Lieutenant   Governor.     Sub-clause   (2)   deals   with   the 



constitution of Legislative Assembly for the National Capital 



Territory   and   total   number   of   seats   of   the   assembly   etc. 



Sub-clause   (3)   of   the   Article   confers   power   on   the 



Legislative Assembly to make laws for the whole or any part 



of the National Capital Territory.  Sub-clause (4) with which 



the court is concerned, inter alia provides that  there shall 



be   a   Council   of   Ministers   consisting   of   not   more   than   ten 



per cent of the total number of members in the Legislative 



Assembly,   with   the   Chief   Minister   at   the   head   to   aid   and 



advise   the   Lieutenant   Governor   in   the   exercise   of   his 



functions   in   relation   to   matters   with   respect   to   which   the 



Legislative Assembly has power to make laws, except in so 



far   as   he   is,   by   or   under   any   law,   required   to   act   in   his 



discretion. 



                                                                           83


57. A   meaningful   and   conjoint   reading   of   
Article   163
   of   the 



   Constitution makes it clear that the Governor has to act on 



   aid   and   advice   of   the   Council   of   Ministers   with   the   Chief 



   Ministers as the head except in so far as he is by or under 



   this Constitution  required to exercise his  functions or any 



   of them in his discretion.   In view of the provisions of sub 



   Article   (4)   of   Article   239AA   of   the   Constitution,   the   Lt. 



 
Governor   has   to   take   aid   and   advice   of   the   Council   of 



   Ministers   in   the   exercise   of   his   functions   in   relation   to 



   matters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly has 



   power to make laws.   
Article 235
 provides that the control 



   over   the   subordinate   courts   is   vested   in   High   Court   of   a 



   State.     The   expression   "control"   has   been   elucidated   in 



   several   reported   decisions   of   this   Court,   the   leading   case 



   being  
Shamsher  vs.  State   of   Punjab
  (1974)   2   SCC   831.




   The   "control"   vested   in   the   High   Court   is   a  mechanism  to 



   ensure   independence   of   the   subordinate   judiciary.     Under 



   
Article   235
   of   the   Constitution,   the   control   over   the 



   subordinate   judiciary,   vested   in   the   High   Court,   is 



   exclusive   in   nature,   comprehensive   in   extent   and   effective 



                                                                           84



in   operation   and   it   is   to   subserve   a   basic   feature   of   the 



Constitution, i.e., independence of judiciary.  Among others 



things,   it   includes   -   (a)   (i)     disciplinary   jurisdiction   and   a 



complete   control   subject   only   to   the   power   of   Governor   in 



the   matter   of   appointment,   dismissal,   removal   and 



reduction in rank of District Judges and initial posting and 



promotion to the cadre of District Judges, (ii) in 
Article 235
 



the word `Control' is accompanied by the word `vest' which 



shows that the High Court alone is made the sole custodian 



of the control over the judiciary, and (iii) Suspension  from 



service   of   a   member   of   judiciary   with   a   view   to   hold 



disciplinary   enquiry;   (b)   transfers,   promotion   and 



confirmation of such promotions, of persons holding posts 



in   judicial   service,   inferior   to   that   of   District   Judge;   (c) 



transfer   of   District   Judges;   (d)   recall   of   District   Judges 



posted   on   ex-cadre   posts   or                  on   deputation   on 



administrative   posts;   (e)   award   of   selection   grade   to   the 



members   of   the   judicial   service,   including   District   Judges 



and   grant   of   further   promotion   after   their   initial 



appointment   to   the   cadre;   (f)   confirmation   of   the   District 



                                                                        85



   Judges who have been on probation or are officiating after 



   their   initial   appointment   or   promotion   by   the   Governor   to 



   the   cadre   of   District   Judges   under   
Article   233;
   and   (g) 



   premature   or   compulsory   retirement   of   Judges   of   the 



   District Courts and of Subordinate Courts. 



58.The scheme envisaged by the Constitution does not permit 


   the   State   to   encroach   upon   the   area   reserved   by   
Articles 



   233
, 234
 and first part of 
Article 235
 either by legislation or 



   rules or executive instructions.  



59.Article   235   has   no   concern   with   the   conferring   of 


   jurisdiction and powers on the Court but it only relates to 



   administrative   and   disciplinary   jurisdiction   over   the 



   subordinate Courts.   Therefore, the conferment of power of 



   the   prescribed   authority   by   the   State   Legislature   on   the 



   Judicial   Officers   cannot   be   construed   to   mean   that   the 



   power of the High Court under 
Article 235
 is inoperative or 



   inchoate   as   High   Court   alone   is   the   sole   authority 



   competent   to   initiate   disciplinary   proceedings   against 



   Subordinate   Judicial   Officers   or   to   impose   various 



                                                                        86



punishments   including   passing   of   order   of   compulsory 



retirement on verification of the service record.    The State 



is   least   competent   to   aid   and   advise   Governor   on   such 



subjects.     While   the   High   Court   retains   the   power   of 



disciplinary   control   over   the   subordinate   judiciary 



including   power   to   initiate   disciplinary   proceedings, 



suspend them during enquiries and impose punishment on 



them,   but   when   it   comes   to   the   question   of   dismissal, 



removal   or   reduction   in   rank   or   termination   of   services   of 



judicial   officers   on   any   count   whatsoever,   the   High   Court 



becomes   the   recommending   authority   and   cannot   itself 



pass the orders.   The formal  order to give effect to such  a 



decision   has   to   be   passed   by   the   State   Governor   on   the 



recommendations   of   the   High   Court.     In   disciplinary 



proceedings if an action is taken by the High Court against 



the judicial officer the recommendations made by the High 



Court   bind   the   Governor   and   he   is   left   with   no   discretion 



except   to   act   according   to   the   recommendations.     The 



Governor,   under   the  scheme  of  
Articles  233
,  234
  and 
235
 



of   the   Constitution   cannot   refuse   to   act   in   terms   of   the 



                                                                       87



   recommendations   made   by   the   High   Court   on   the   ground 



   that he is not aided and advised by the Council of Ministers 



   and this is the true import of total control of the High Court 



   over the Subordinate Judiciary.  



60.In the light of the above mentioned principles the decisions 


   sited at the bar will have to be considered. 



61. 
In  
Shamsher   Singh
  (Supra),   there   were   two   appellants, 



   namely, Shamsher Singh and Ishwar Chand Agarwal.   The 



   two   appellants   were   members  of   the   Punjab   Civil   Services 



   (Judicial   Branch)   and   were   appointed   on   probation.     The 



   services   of   appellant   Shamsher   Singh   were   terminated   by 



   an  order  dated  April  27,  1967,  by  the   Governor  of  Punjab 



   under Rule 9 of the Punjab Civil Services (Punishment and 



   Appeal)   Rules,   1952,   with   immediate   effect.     By   an   order 



   dated   December   15,   1969,   the   services   of   the   appellant 



   Ishwar Chand Agarwal were terminated under Rule 7(3) in 



   Part   `D'   of   the   Punjab   Civil   Services   (Judicial   Branch) 



   Rules,   1951,   by   the   Governor   of   Punjab,   on   the 



   recommendation of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.




                                                                         88


   Both   of   them   had   filed   writ   petitions   in   the   Punjab   and 



   Haryana   High   Court   against   the   termination   of   their 



   services.  The writ petitions were dismissed and, thereafter, 



   they had filed appeals to the Supreme Court.



62.The   first   contention   raised   by   appellant   Ishwar   Chand 


   Agarwal that he completed his initial period of probation of 



   two years on November 11, 1968 and by reason of the fact 



   that   he   continued   in   service   after   the   maximum   period   of 



   probation,   he   became   confirmed   by   necessary   implication, 



   was   negatived   by   this   Court   on   the   ground   that   notice 



   dated   October   4,   1968   was   given   at   the   end   of   the 



   probation and the period of probation got extended till the 



   inquiry proceedings commenced by the notice under Rule 9 



   came to an end.



63.The second contention on behalf of Ishwar Chand Agarwal 


   that  termination   of   his   service   was  by   way  of   punishment 



   on   the   basis   of   charges   of   gross   misconduct   by   ex-parte 



   enquiry   conducted   by   the   Vigilance   Department   found 



   favour with this Court.



                                                                            89


64.This   Court   accepted   the   plea   that   the   termination   of   his 


   services was based on the findings of misconduct contained 



   in about eight complaints, which were never communicated 



   to him and High Court had abdicated the control vested in 



   it   under   
Article   235
   by   not   having   an   enquiry   through 



   judicial   officers   subordinate   to   the   control   of   the   High 



   Court,  but  asking   the   Government   to  enquire  through   the 



   Vigilance Department.  



65.The abdication of the control over the subordinate judiciary 


   by   the   High   Court   under   
Article   235
   in   favour   of   the 



   Government and the stand of the State that the High Court 



   wanted the Government to be satisfied about the suitability 



   of  Mr.   Agarwal   was  found   to   be   something   obnoxious   and 



   had   annoyed   and   shocked   this   Court.     Therefore,   this 



   Court,   without   mincing   the   words,   authoritatively,   clearly 



   and   for   future   guidance   of   one   and   all,   expressed   itself   in 



   the   following   strong   words   in   para   78   of   the   reported 



   decision.



                                                                                              90


      "78. The   High   Court   for   reasons   which   are   not 

      stated   requested   the   Government   to   depute   the 

      Director of Vigilance to hold an enquiry.  It is indeed 

      strange that the High Court which had control over 

      the subordinate  judiciary asked the  Government to 

      hold an enquiry through the Vigilance Department. 

      The   members   of   the   subordinate   judiciary   are   not 

      only   under   the   control   of   the   High   Court   but   are 

      also under the care and custody of the High Court. 

      The   High   Court   failed   to   discharge   the   duty   of 

      preserving   its   control.     The   request   by   the   High 

      Court   to   have   the   enquiry   through   the   Director   of 

      Vigilance   was   an   act   of   self   abnegation.     The 

      contention of the State that the High Court wanted 

      the   Government   to   be   satisfied   makes   matters 

      worse.         The         Governor         will         act         on         the 

      recommendation   of   the   High   Court.     That   is   the 

      broad basis of 
Article 235.
   The High Court should 

      have   conducted   the   enquiry   preferably   through 

      District   Judges.     The   members   of   the   subordinate 

      judiciary   look   up   to   the   High   Court   not   only   for 

      discipline but also for dignity.  The High Court acted 

      in   total   disregard   of   
Article   235
   by   asking   the 

      Government   to   enquire   through   the   Director   of 

      Vigilance."





      Having   laid   down,   abovementioned   proposition   of   law, 



this   Court   deprecated   the   abdication   of   control   by   the   High 



Court   by   observing   that   the   High   Court   denied   itself   the 



dignified   control   over   the   Subordinate   Judiciary   and   after 



holding that the order of termination of the services of Ishwar 



                                                                            91



Chand   Agarwal   was   clearly   by   way   of   punishment,   set   aside 



the same.



66. 
In  view   of  what   is   categorically,   clearly   and  authoritatively 



    held   in   paragraph   78   of   the   reported   decision   there   is   no 



    manner of doubt that it is ruled by Seven Judge Bench of 



    this   Court   in   case   of  
Shamsher   Singh
  (supra),   that   the 



    Governor   has   to   act   on   the   recommendation   of   the   High 



    Court and that is the broad basis of 
Article 235.




      The appellant Shamsher Singh was appointed on May 1, 



1964 as Subordinate Judge.  He was on probation.  On March 



22,   1967,   the   Chief   Secretary   issued   a   notice   to   him 



substantially   repeating   the   same   charges   which   had   been 



communicated to him by the Registrar on December 15, 1966, 



and asked the appellant to show cause as to why his services 



should not be terminated  as he was found unsuitable for the 



job.     The   appellant   gave   an   answer.     On   April   29,   1967,   the 



services of the appellant were terminated.



      Shamsher Singh, in the context of the Rules of Business, 



contended   that   the   removal   of   a   Subordinate   Judge   from 



                                                                             92



service   was   a   personal   power   of   the   Governor   and   was 



incapable of being  delegated  or dealt with  under  the Rules of 



Business.



      This   Court   held   that   the   Governor   can   allocate   the 



business   of   the   Government   to   the   Ministers   and   such 



allocation   is   no   delegation   and   it   is   an   exercise   of   executive 



power   by   the  Governor  through   the   Council  or  officers  under 



the   Rules   of   Business.     Therefore,   the   contention   of   the 



appellant   that   the   order   was   passed   by   the   Chief   Minister 



without  the  formal   approval  of the  Governor  was  found  to  be 



untenable and it was held that the order was of the Governor.



      Thereafter,   this   Court   noted   the   contents   of   the   show-



cause   notice,   reply   given   to   the   said   notice   by   the   appellant, 



protection   granted   by   Rule   9,   etc.   and   held   that   it   was   clear 



that   the   order   of   termination   of   services   of   Shamsher   Singh 



was one of punishment and set it aside.



      In   the   light   of   the   contention   raised   on   behalf   of 



Shamsher Singh in the context of the Rules of Business, this 



Court, in para 88 of 
the said decision
, held that the President 



                                                                         93



and   the   Governor   act   on   the   aid   and   advice   of   Council   of 



Ministers   in  executive   action  and   the   appointment   as  well  as 



removal of the members of the Subordinate Judicial Service is 



an executive action of the Governor to be exercised on the aid 



and advice of the Council of Ministers in accordance with the 



provisions of the Constitution.



67. Thus what is observed by the Supreme Court, in para 88 of 



   the reported decision, will have to be read in the light of the 



   submission   made   on   behalf   of   the   appellant   Shamsher 



   Singh   and   subject   to   clear,   unambiguous   and   manifest 



   proposition   of   law   
laid   down   in
   para   78   of   the   reported 



   decision.
 
Therefore,   it   is   wrong   to   contend   that   in 


   
Shamsher   Singh
's  case   (supra),   it   is   ruled   by   this   Court 


   that the Governor is bound to act as per the aid and advice 



   tendered   by   the   Council   of   Ministers   and   not   on   the 



   recommendations   of   the   High   Court   in   the   matter   of 



   termination of services of the judicial officers on any count 



   whatsoever.




                                                                             94


68. 
In  another decision relied  upon  by  the  learned   counsel  for 



   the   appellants,   i.e.,   in  
M.M.   Gupta   and   Others
  (Supra), 



   this Court held that in the appointment of Judicial Officers 



   or removal of Judicial Officer by the Government, there has 



   to   be   effective   consultation   between   the   Government   and 



   the  High  Court.     This decision  basically   interprets   Section 



   109   of   the   Constitution   of   Jammu   and   Kashmir.     In   the 



   State of Jammu and Kashmir certain vacancies for the post 



   of District and Sessions Judge occurred for being filled up 



   out   of   the   eligible   Judicial   Officers.     The   High   Court   at   a 



   meeting   of   all   the   Judges   considered   the   merits   and 



   suitability of all the eligible candidates and by a resolution 



   recommended to the Government the name of some officers 



   in supersession of others.   The Government then called for 



   a   copy   of   the   High   Court's   resolution   and   Annual 



   Confidential   Reports   of   the   candidates.     In   response,   the 



   high   Court   sent   its   detailed   comments   justifying   its 



   recommendation   as   also   reasons   for   the   supersession   of 



   seniors   along   with   the   resolution   and   confidential   reports 



   as desired by the Government.   Thereafter, a Cabinet sub-




                                                                          95


committee   considered   the   matter.     But   the   government 



neither   communicated   the   recommendation   of   the 



Committee to the High Court, nor sought the High Court's 



views thereon and thereafter without any further intimation 



or discussions made the appointments in accordance with 



seniority.   Those officers whose names were recommended 



by   the   High   Court   filed   a   writ   petition   under   
Article   226
 



challenging   validity   of   the   appointments.     The   Court 



granted   a   stay   of   operation   of   the   appointment   order 



pending   disposal   of   the   matter   regarding   admissibility   of 



the   petition.     But   ultimately   in   view   of   the   agreement 



between   the   parties,   the   High   Court   declined   to   hear   the 



petition on the ground of judicial propriety and vacated the 



order   of   stay   and   granted   a   certificate   of   fitness   to   the 



petitioners to file an appeal in the Supreme Court, holding 



that   the   point   involved   in   the   writ   petition   relating   to   the 



interpretation of Section 109 of the Constitution of Jammu 



and   Kashmir,   raised   a   substantial   question   of   law   of 



general   public   importance   and   the   case   was   a   fit   one   in 



which   a   certificate   of   fitness   should   be   granted.     Against 



                                                                            96



this   order   the   State   filed   a   special   leave   to   appeal   in   this 



Court.     The   petitioners   also   filed   a   writ   petition   under 




Article 32
 substantially for the same reliefs claimed in their 



earlier   writ   petition   under   
Article   226.
     Allowing   the 



aggrieved   officers   appeal   with   costs   against   the   State 



Government,   this   Court   held   that   the   power   to   make 



appointment   of   District   Judges   vested   in   the   Governor   is 



conditioned   by   the   mandatory   duty   on   the   part   of   the 



Governor   to   consult   the   High   Court,   and   the   High   Court 



has   to   decide   whether   a   person   is   fit   for   promotion   and 



make   recommendations   accordingly.     This   
Court   further 



held
   that   the   consultation   has   to   be   made   with   the   High 



Court alone and not with any other authority, because the 



High Court by virtue of its control over the officers must be 



considered to be the best judge of the ability and suitability 



of   any   officer   as   it   has   in   its   possession   all   the   relevant 



materials   regarding   the   performance   of   the   officers.




Therefore,  this  Court   in the  said  case  ruled  that it  should 



generally be left to the High Court to decide as to which of 



the officers will best serve the requirements in furtherance 



                                                                           97



  of   the   cause   of   justice.     In   this   decision   in   no   uncertain 



  terms   this   Court   after   considering   previous   judgments   on 



  the   point   held   that   the   High   Court   should   judge   the 



  suitability for promotion in a detached manner taking into 



  consideration   all   material   facts   and   relevant   factors   and 



  normally,   as   a   matter   of   rule,   the   recommendations   made 



  by   the   High   Court   should   be   accepted   by   the   State 



  Government and the Governor should act on the same.   If 



  the decision is construed in a pragmatic manner there is no 



  manner   of   doubt   that   this  decision   also   takes   a  view   that 



  Governor has to act on the recommendations made by the 



  High   Court.     Ultimately,   this   Court   found   that   the 



  appointments of respondent Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 therein made by 



  the   State   Government   were   in   violation   of   the 



  Constitutional provisions and were therefore, set aside. 



69. 
In 
State of Haryana Vs. Inder Prakash Anand H.C.S. and 



  Others
  (Supra),   the   respondent   joined   the   Punjab   Civil 


  Service,   (Executive   Branch)   in   November,   1954.     He   was 



  selected for the Judicial Branch of the Punjab Civil Service 



                                                                      98



on May 1, 1965.   On November 15, 1968 he was promoted 



as   officiating   Additional   District   and   Sessions   Judge.     He 



was   due   to   attain   the   age   of   55   years   on   February   24, 



1971.   The State referred his case to the High Court for its 



recommendation whether he should be retired at the age of 



55 years or he should be retained in service till the age of 



58 years, i.e., the age of superannuation.   The High Court 



recommended   that   the   respondent   should   be   reverted   to 



his   substantive   post   of   Senior   Subordinate   Judge/Chief 



Judicial   Magistrate   and   that   he   might   be   allowed   to 



continue in service till the age of 58 years.  The State again 



sought   recommendation   about   his   retirement.     The   High 



Court   recommended   against   compulsory   retirement.     The 



State Government did not agree and retired the respondent 



compulsorily.  The High Court in a Writ Petition filed by the 



respondent   quashed   the   order.     In   appeal   this   Court 



examined   the  scope  of 
Article  235
  of the  Constitution  and 



held   that   control   which   is   vested   in   the   High   Court   is 



complete control subject only to the power of the Governor 



in the matter of appointment including dismissal, removal, 



                                                                             99



   reduction in rank and the initial  posting and of the initial 



   promotion   to   District   Judges.     According   to   this   Court 



   when a case is not of removal or dismissal or reduction in 



   rank,   any   order   in   respect   of   exercise   of   control   over   the 



   judicial officers is by the High Court and cannot be by any 



   other   authority.     What   is   explained   by   this   Court   is   that 



   there cannot be dual control and if the State Government is 



   to   have   the   power   of   deciding   whether   a   judicial   officer 



   should   be   retained   in   service   after   attaining   the   age   of   55 



   years up to the age of 58 years, that will seriously affect the 



   independence   of   the   Judiciary   and   take   away   the   control 



   vested   in   the   High   Court.     What   is   ruled   by   this   Court   in 



   
the said decision
 is that it is unsound to contend that the 



   Governor and not the High Court has the power to retire a 



   judicial officer compulsorily under 
Section 14
 of the Punjab 



   General Clauses Act.




70.In   paragraph   18   of   the   reported   judgment   this   Court   has 


   held that the control vested in the high Court is that if the 



   High Court is of the opinion that a particular judicial officer 



                                                                                10



   is   not   fit   to   be   retained   in   service,   the   High   Court   will 



   communicate that to the Governor because the Governor is 



   the   authority   to   dismiss,   remove,   reduce   in   rank   or 



   terminate   the   appointment,   but   in   such   cases   it   is   the 



   contemplation in the Constitution that the Governor as the 



   head   of   the   State   will   act   in   harmony   with   the 



   recommendation   of   the   High   Court.     According   to   this 



   Court, if the recommendation of the High Court is not held 



   to   be   binding   on   the   State,   the   consequences   will   be 



   unfortunate.   What is highlighted by this Court in 
the said 



   decision
   is   that   it   is   in   public   interest   that   the   State   will 



   accept   the   recommendation   of   the   High   Court.     As   a 



   principle, it is stated in 
the said decision
 that the vesting of 



   complete control over the subordinate Judiciary in the High 



   Court   leads   to   this   that   the   decision   of   the   High   Court   in 



   matters within its jurisdiction will bind the State.




71. In  Baldev   Raj  Guliani  (1976)  4  SCC   201,  this  Court   had 



   occasion to consider and interpret the provisions of 
Articles 



   235
, 311
 and 
234
 read with 
Article 309
 of the Constitution. 



                                                                      10


In   the   said   case   adverse   reports   having   been   received 



against   the   appellant   while   he   was   acting   as   Subordinate 



Judge,   disciplinary   proceedings   were   initiated   against   him 



by   the   High   Court.     After   preliminary   enquiry,   he   was 



suspended and on the findings of the departmental enquiry 



and   on   consideration   of   his   explanation   in   reply   to   show-



cause   notice   under   
Article   311(2)
,   the   High   Court 



recommended to the Government that the officer should be 



removed from service.   The State Government although on 



its own showing was inclined to agree with the views of the 



High   Court   and   with   the   recommendations   made   by   it, 



however   referred   the   case   to   the   Haryana   Public   Service 



Commission   for   advice   purporting   to   act   under   
Article 



320(3)
   of   the   Constitution.     The   Commission   advised   that 



no case had been made out against the appellant and that 



he   should   be   exonerated.     The   Governor   accepted   the 



advice   of   the   Commission   and   passed   the   order   for 



reinstatement.  The High Court, however, did not issue any 



posting   order   as  it  regarded  the   order   of  reinstatement   by 



the Governor  illegal.   It even requested the Government to 



                                                                      10



   review its order.  



72.Thereupon the appellant filed a writ petition praying for a 


   writ   of   mandamus   directing   the   high   Court   to   issue   an 



   appropriate   order   of   posting   and   also   for   a   mandamus 



   directing the Government to disburse full salary to him and 



   other   consequential   reliefs.     While   the   writ   petition   was 



   pending   the   Governor   compulsorily   retired   him. 



   Subsequently  a Full Bench  of the  High Court delivered its 



   judgment   holding   the   order   of   reinstatement   violative   of 



   
Article   235
,   for   the   Governor   was   bound   to   accept   the 



   recommendation   of   the   High   Court   as   regards   the 



   subordinate   judiciary.     Therefore,   the   appellant   preferred 



   an   appeal   before   this   Court.     Three   questions   were 



   considered by this Court in the said case - (1) whether the 



   Government is bound under the Constitution to accept the 



   recommendation of the High Court and to pass an order of 



   removal of the judicial officer, (2) whether consultation with 



   the   Public   Service   Commission   in   the   matter   of   a 



   disciplinary proceeding relating to the judicial officer under 



                                                                       10



   the control of the High Court is unconstitutional.   Was the 



   order   of   reinstatement   passed   by   the   Government 



   constitutionally valid, and (3) if not what will be position of 



   the   officer   on   the   date   of   the   officer's   compulsory 



   retirement?     Was   an   order   of   removal   possible   after   that 



   date? 



73.After   considering   the   scheme   envisaged   by   different 


   provisions   of   the   Constitution   this   Court   held   that   the 



   appointing authority of a Subordinate Judge under  
Article 



   235
   as   well   as   under   the   Appointment   Rules,   is   the 



   Governor because under 
Article 235
 itself the Subordinate 



   Judge   will   be   governed   by   the   Appointment   Rules       made 



   under 
Article 234
 read with 
Article 309.
     This Court then 



   considered   the   submission   of   the   appellant   that   the 



   Governor being the appointing authority, both under 
Article 



   235
 and the Appointment Rules read with the Punishment 



   Rules, is the final authority to pass the order of removal of 



   the officer and is not under any constitutional obligation to 



   be   bound   by   the   recommendation   of   the   High   Court   and 



                                                                        10



also   the   assertion   made   on   behalf   of   the   High   Court   that 




Article   235
   leaves   no   option   to   the   Governor   to   refuse   to 



accept   its   recommendation   in   a   disciplinary   matter   in 



respect of a judicial officer.  This Court found that the High 



Court   in   making   its   recommendation   to   the   Governor   for 



passing   the   order   of   removal,   had   rightly   conceded   the 



authority of the Governor to pass the same.  Thereafter the 



Court   considered   the   question   :   Is   the   recommendation   of 



the   High   Court   binding   on   the   Governor,   and   answered 



that   since   the   Governor   is   the   ultimate   authority   to   pass 



the order for removal it will not be correct always to insist 



that he has no authority even under certain extraordinary 



circumstances   to   decline   to   accept,   forthwith,   the 



particular recommendation, but ordinarily and as a matter 



of graceful routine, recommendations of the High Court are 



and   should   be   always   accepted   by   the   Governor,   because 



that is ordinarily so and should be in practice the rule as a 



matter of healthy convention. 



                                                                                 10


74.In   paragraph   28,   of   the   reported   decision   this   Court   has 


   held that the quality of exclusive control of the High Court 



   does  not appear  to be whittled  down by the  constitutional 



   device of all orders issued in the name of the Governor as 



   the   head   of   the   State   administration   and,   therefore,   when 



   the   High   Court   exercising   disciplinary   control   over   the 



   subordinate   judiciary   finds,   after   a   proper   enquiry,   that   a 



   certain   officer   is   guilty   of   gross   misconduct   and   is 



   unworthy   to   be   retained   in   judicial   service   and,   therefore, 



   recommends to the Governor his removal or dismissal, it is 



   difficult   to   conceive   how   and   under   what   circumstances 



   such a recommendation should be rejected by the Governor 



   acting   with   the   aid   and   advice   of   the   Council   of   Ministers 



   or,   as   is   usually   the   case,   of   one   of   the   ministers.     It   is 



   explained   by   this   Court   in   
the   said   decision
   that   in   this 



   context   more   than   once   the   Supreme   Court   has   observed 



   that   the   recommendation   of   the   High   Court   in   respect   of 



   judicial officers should always be accepted by the Governor, 



   and   this   is   the   inner   significance   of   the   constitutional 



   provisions relating to the subordinate judiciary.  This Court 



                                                                           10



further noted that whenever in an extraordinary case, rare 



in   itself,   the   Governor   feels,   for   certain   reasons   that   he   is 



unable to accept the High Court's recommendations, these 



reasons will be communicated to the High Court to enable 



it to reconsider the matter, but it is, however, inconceivable 



that   without   reference   to   the   High   Court,   the   Governor 



would   pass   an   order   which   had   not   been   earlier 



recommended   by   the   High   Court.     This   Court   further 



explained   that   such   a   course   will   be   contrary   to   the 



contemplation   in   the   Constitution   and   should   not   take 



place.   In para 36 of the reported decision , this Court has 



explained   the   power   and/or   role   of   Governor   in   such 



matters and laid down the law authoritatively as under : -



  "36. The Governor could not have passed any order 

  on   the   advice   of   the   Public   Service   Commission   in 

  this   case.     The   advice   should   be   of   no   other 

  authority   than   the   High   Court   in   the   matter   of 

  judicial   officers.     This   is   the   plain   implication   of 

  
Article  235.
 
Article  320(3)(c)
  is clearly  out  of  place 

  so  far   as the   High  Court   is   concerned  dealing  with 

  judicial officers.   To give any other interpretation to 

  
article 320(3)(c)
 will be to defeat the supreme object 

  underlying   
Article   235
  of  the  Constitution   specially 

  intended   for   the   protection   of   the   judicial   officers 

  and   necessarily   the   independence   of   the 



                                                                                  10



      subordinate judiciary.  It is absolutely clear that the 

      Governor   cannot   consult   the   Public   Service 

      Commission   in   the   case   of   judicial   officers   and 

      accept   its   advice   and   act   according   to   it.     There   is 

      no room for any outside body between the Governor 

      and the High Court."





It may be noted that in the case of 
Baldev Raj Guliani
 (supra), 



this   Court   had   considered   the   case   of   Shamsher   Singh   and 



thereafter  has  laid  down  above  mentioned  proposition  of  law.




In   the   decision   delivered   in   case   of   Baldev   Raj   Guliani,   this 



Court has not ruled that the Governor has to act in aid and on 



advice   of  the   Council   of   Ministers.     What  is   ruled   is   that  the 



recommendation   made   by   the   High   Court   is   binding   on   the 



Governor.  



75. Again in the case of  Regist
                                        rar, High Court of 
Madras   Vs. 


    R. Rajaiah
, (1988) 3 SCC 211, the High Court had decided 


    to   compulsorily   retire   the   respondents   but   had   not 



    communicated   the   recommendations   to   the   Governor   for 



    passing   formal   orders   of   compulsory   retirement.     Instead 



    the   High   Court   had   passed   the   orders   of   compulsory 



    retirement under FR 56 (d).   As there was no formal order 



    by   the   Government   under   FR   56   (d),   this   Court   held   that 



                                                                        10



the   impugned   orders   of   the   High   Court   were   ineffective.




Ultimately,   this   Court   did   not   interfere   with   the   view 



expressed   by   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   on 



merits   of   the   matter   and   held   that   the   High   Court   was 



perfectly   justified   in   quashing   orders   of   compulsory 



retirement.     However,   this   Court   considered   the   scope   of 




Article   235
   of   the   Constitution   and   held   that   the   test   of 



control is not the passing of an order against a member of 



the subordinate judicial service, but the power to take such 



decision and action.  The Court explained that so far as the 



members of the subordinate judicial service are concerned, 



it is the Governor, who being the appointing authority, has 



to  pass  an  order of compulsory retirement or  any order  of 



punishment against such a member, but passing or signing 



of   such   orders   by   the   Governor   will   not   necessarily   take 



away the control of the High Court vested in it under 
Article 



235
 of the Constitution.   This Court further explained that 



an  action against any Government  servant consists of two 



parts.   Under the first part, a decision will have to be made 



whether   an   action   will   be   taken   against   the   Government 



                                                                     10



servant   and   in   the   second   part,   the   decision   would   be 



carried out by a formal order.   Having explained  this, this 



Court proceeded to hold that the power of control envisaged 



under 
Article 235
 of the Constitution relates to the power of 



making a decision by the High Court against a member of 



the   subordinate   judicial   service   and   such   a   decision   is 



arrived at by holding an enquiry by the High Court against 



the member concerned, and after the High Court comes to 



the   conclusion   that   some   action   either   in   the   nature   of 



compulsory   retirement   or   by   the   imposition   of   a 



punishment,   as   the   case   may  be,   has   to   be   taken   against 



the   member   concerned,   the   High   Court   will   make   a 



recommendation   in   that   regard   to   the   Governor   and   the 



Governor will act in accordance with such recommendation 



of  the  High  Court  by  passing  an order in  accordance with 



the decision of the High Court.  What is ruled by this Court 



is   that   the   Governor   cannot   take   any   action   against   any 



member   of   a   subordinate   judicial   service   without   and 



contrary   to   the   recommendation   of   the   High   Court.     After 



review of the law on the subject matter till then, this Court 



                                                                            11



    has   made   following   pertinent   observations,   in   para   18   of 



    the reported decision: -



      "18. The  control  of  the  High  Court,   as  understood, 

      will   also   be   applicable   in   the   case   of   compulsory 

      retirement   in   that   the   High   Court   will,   upon   an 

      enquiry, come to a conclusion whether a member of 

      a   subordinate   judicial   service   should   be   retired 

      prematurely or not.   If the High Court comes to the 

      conclusion   that   such   a   member   should   be 

      prematurely retired, it will make a recommendation 

      in   that   regard   to   the   Governor   inasmuch   as   the 

      Governor is the appointing authority.  The Governor 

      will make formal order of compulsory retirement in 

      accordance   with   the   recommendation   of   the   High 

      Court."





Again,   in   para   20   of   the   reported   decision,   this   Court,   while 



holding   that   so   long   as   there   is   no   formal   order   by   the 



Governor, the compulsory retirement, as directed by the High 



Court   would   not   take   place,   has,   inter-alia   observed   that   "It 



may be that the power of the Governor under Rule 56(d) of the 



Fundamental Rules is very formal in nature, for the Governor 



merely   acts   on   the   recommendation   of   the   High   Court   by 



signing   an   order   in   that   regard".     The   proposition   of  law  
laid 



down   in
   this   case   also   supports   the   contention   of   the 



respondents that in the matter of disciplinary action against a 



                                                                       11



member of the Subordinate Judicial Service, the Governor has 



no   option,   but   to   pass   final   order   on   the   basis   of   the 



recommendation of the High Court.



76. It may be mentioned that in this case, i.e., Registrar, High 



   Court   of   
Madras
  (supra),   this   Court   has   referred   to   the 


   decision   of  
Shamsher   Singh
  (supra),   and   has   thereafter 



   ruled   that   Governor   has   to   act   in   accordance   with   the 



   recommendation of the High Court by passing an order in 



   accordance   with   the   decision   of   the   High   Court   and   the 



   Governor   cannot   take   any   action   against   any   member   of 



   the   judicial   service   without   and   contrary   to   the 



   recommendation of the High Court.




77. This   Court   further   finds   that   in  Registrar   (Admn.)   High 



   Court of 
Orissa, Cuttack
  (Supra), decision of Orissa High 


   Court on administrative side was required to be forwarded 



   to   the   Governor   for   passing   an   order   of   the   compulsory 



   retirement   but   this   was   not   done,   and   an   order   of 



   compulsory retirement was passed by the High Court itself.




   This   decision   was   challenged   before   the   high   Court   on 



                                                                        11



judicial   side.     The   writ   petition   was   decided   in   favour   of 



judicial   officers   holding   that   the   order   dated   February   5, 



1987 compulsorily retiring them was bad in law.  In appeal, 



this   Court   considered   the   scope   of   
Articles   233
   to   235   of 



the Constitution as well as 
Articles 55
 and 
368
 in the light 



of basic feature of the Constitution namely independence of 



the  judiciary.     After  noticing  several previous  decisions on 



the   point,   this   Court   considered   the   powers   of   the   High 



Court   and   held   that   the   Governor   is   bound   by   the 



recommendation   of   the   High   Court   but   the   constitutional 



propriety requires that the recommendation would be sent 



by the High Court to the Governor and formal order would 



be   passed   by   the   Governor.     Explaining   the   scope   of 




Articles 234
, 235
 and 
311
 of the Constitution, a five-Judge 



Constitution   Bench   of   this   Court   has   held   that   while   the 



High   Court   retains   the   power   of   disciplinary   control   over 



the   subordinate   judiciary,   including   the   power   to   initiate 



disciplinary   proceedings,   suspend   them   pending   enquiries 



and impose punishment on them but when it comes to the 



question   of   dismissal,   removal,   reduction   in   rank   or 



                                                                            11



   termination   of   the   services   of   the   judicial   officer,   on   any 



   count   whatsoever,   the   High   Court   becomes   only   the 



   recommending   authority   and   cannot   itself   pass   such   an 



   order.  What is ruled by the Constitution Bench is that the 



   formal   order   to   give   effect   to   such   a   decision   has   to   be 



   passed only by the State Governor on the recommendation 



   of the High Court.



78.In  the   said case,  this Court  found that  by  not  making  an 


   order   of  compulsory   retirement   on  the   recommendation   of 



   the   High   Court,   a   peculiar   situation   was   created   in   the 



   sense   that   the   judicial   officers   were   neither   in   service   nor 



   were they technically out of service nor had they performed 



   any   work   and,   therefore,   in   order   to   balance   the   equities 



   between   the   parties   and   in   order   to   give   litigation   a 



   quietous,   this   Court   had   requested   the   Governor   of   the 



   State   to   pass   a   formal   order   of   compulsory   retirement   of 



   judicial officers.



79.On review of law, what is ruled by the Constitution Bench 


   of   this   Court   is   that   undoubtedly,   the   High   Courts   alone 



                                                                         11



   are   entitled   to   initiate,   to   hold   enquiry   and   to   take   a 



   decision in respect of dismissal, removal, reduction in rank 



   or   termination   from   service,   but   the   formal   order   to   give 



   effect to such a decision has to be passed only by the State 



   Governor on the recommendation of the High Court, and it 



   is well settled again by a catena of decisions of this Court 



   that   the   recommendation   of   the   High   Court   is   binding   on 



   the State Government/Governor.  



80. 
In  
Tej Pal Singh  Vs.  State of U.P. and Another
, (1986) 3 



   SCC 604, the  State Government moved the  High Court in 


   the year 1967 with proposal of premature retirement of the 



   appellant,   an   Additional   District   and   Sessions   Judge.     On 



   July   8,   1968   the   Administrative   Judge   agreed   with   the 



   proposal of premature retirement after giving three months' 



   notice.       The   Governor   passed   the   order   of   retirement   on 



   August   24,   1968.     Three   days   thereafter,   on   August   27, 



   1968 the Administrative Committee of the High Court gave 



   its   approval   to   the   recommendation   of   the   Administrative 



   Judge   earlier   communicated   to   the   State   Government.




                                                                       11


Thereafter   on   August   30,   1968   the   Additional   Registrar 



transmitted the order of retirement to the appellant.  It was 



actually   served   on   the   appellant   on   September   3,   1968. 



The   question   for   consideration   in   this   case   before   this 



Court   was   whether   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement 



passed   against   the   appellant   satisfied   the   requirements   of 



the   Constitution.     While   allowing   the   appeal,   this   Court 



held   that   the   impugned   order   of   premature   retirement 



passed   by   the   Governor   without   having   before   him   the 



recommendation of the Administrative Committee or of the 



Full Court was void and ineffective.  What is ruled is that it 



is   for   the   High   Court,   on   the   basis   of   assessment   of 



performance and all other aspects germane to the matter to 



come   to   the   conclusion   whether   any   particular   judicial 



officer   under   its   control   is   to   be   prematurely   retired   and 



once   the   High   Court   comes   to   the   conclusion   that   there 



should   be   such   retirement,   the   Court   recommends   to   the 



Governor to do so, and the conclusion is to be of the High 



Court   since   the   control   vests   therein.     After   noticing   the 



Rules   obtaining   in   the   Allahabad   High   Court,   this   Court 



                                                                          11



held   that   the   Administrative   Committee   could   act   for   and 



on behalf of the Court but the Administrative Judge could 



not   have   done   so   and   therefore   his   agreeing   with   the 



Government   proposal   was   of   no   consequence   and   did   not 



amount   to   the   satisfaction   of   the   requirement   of   Article 




235.     After   noting   that   it   was   only   after   the   Governor 



passed   the   order   on   the   basis   of   such   recommendation, 



that   the   matter   was   placed   before   the   Administrative 



Committee   before   the   order   of   retirement   was   actually 



served on the appellant, this Court held that the deviation 



was   not   a   mere   irregularity   which   could   be   cured   under 



Rule   21   of   the   Rules   of   Court,   1952   by   the   ex   post   facto 



approval   given   by   the   Administrative   Committee   to   the 



action   of   the   Governor   after   the   order   of   premature 



retirement   had   been   passed   and   the   error   committed   was 



an incurable defect amounting to an illegality.   This Court 



took notice of the decision of the Court in 
State of U.P. Vs. 


Batuk   Deo   Pati   Tripathi
,   (1978)   2   SCC   102,  and   ruled 


therein that the Governor can pass an order of compulsory 



retirement only on the recommendation made by the High 



                                                                            11



   Court   or   the   Administrative   Committee.     Further,   in 



   paragraph 18 of the reported decision, this Court observed 



   that   in   view   of   the   control   over   the   members   of   lower 



   judiciary vested in the High Court by virtue of 
Article 235
 of 



   the   Constitution,   the   Governor   is   bound,   in   each   case,   to 



   act   in   accordance   with   the   recommendation   of   the   High 



   Court.     This   decision   also   takes   the   firm   view   that   the 



   recommendation made by the High Court is binding on the 



   Governor.




81.Thus, it is fairly well settled by catena of decisions of this 


   Court   that   in   the   matter   of   compulsory   retirement   of   a 



   Judicial Officer the Governor cannot act on the aid and the 



   advice   of   Council   of   Ministers   but   has   to   act   only   on   the 



   recommendation   of   the   High   Court.     Though   the   Lt. 



   Governor is a party to these appeals, he has not raised any 



   plea   that   the   recommendation   made   by   the   Delhi   High 



   Court was not binding on him and he could have acted in 



   the   matter   only   on   the   aid   and   advice   of   his   Council   of 



   Ministers.  Thus the order of the Lt. Governor compulsorily 



                                                                        11



retiring the appellants without seeking aid and advice of his 



Council of Ministers is neither ultra vires nor illegal and is 



rightly   sustained   by   the   High   Court.     The   Governor   could 



not have passed any order on the aid and advice of Council 



of Ministers in this case.  The advice should be of no other 



authority   except   that   of   the   High   Court   in   the   matter   of 



judicial officers.  This is the plain implication of 
Article 235.




Reliance  on 
Article  239AA(4)
  is  entirely  out of place  so far 



as   the   High   Court   is   concerned,   dealing   with   the   judicial 



officers.     To   give   any   other   interpretation   to   
Article 



239AA(4)
   will   be   to   defeat   the   supreme   object   underlying 




Article   235
   of   the   Constitution,   specially   intended   for 



protection   of   the   judicial   officers   and   necessarily 



independence of the subordinate judiciary.   It is absolutely 



clear   that   the   Governor   cannot   take   the   aid   and   advice   of 



his Council of Ministers in the case of judicial officers and 



accept its advice and act according to it.  There is no room 



for   any   outside   body   between   the   Governor   and   the   High 



Court.     Therefore,   this   Court   does   not   find  any  substance 



in this contention also and the same is rejected. 



                                                                      11


82.The   next   point   which   was   argued   on   behalf   of   the 


   appellants   was   that   the   appellants   were   made   to   retire 



   compulsorily   from   service   without   affording   them   an 



   opportunity to make representation against the ACR of the 



   year   2000   wherein   they   were   graded   as   "`C'   doubtful 



   integrity",   which   was   the   basis   for   their   compulsorily 



   retirement,   and,   therefore,   the   orders   retiring   them 



   compulsorily from service are liable to the set aside.  It was 



   vehemently   contended   that   in   such   circumstances   when 



   ACR   of   2000   wherein   the   appellants   were   graded   as   "`C' 



   doubtful integrity" which was the sole basis of passing the 



   order   of   compulsory   retirement,   the   respondents   were 



   under legal obligation to look into the representation of the 



   appellants   against   those   adverse   remarks   but   before   the 



   appellants could made the representation against  the said 



   ACR,   orders   retiring   them   compulsorily   from   service   were 



   passed,   and,   therefore,   the   orders   impugned   should   be 



   regarded as arbitrary, unfair and unreasonable.  



                                                                     12


83.In the appeal arising from SLP No. 27028 of 2008 deceased 


   Mr. R.S. Verma had stated that adverse remark for the year 



   2000   was   communicated   to   him   vide   letter   dated 



   September 21, 2001 by the Registrar, Vigilance, Delhi High 



   Court which was received by him on September 25, 2001, 



   whereas on the same date i.e. on September 21, 2001 the 



   Screening   Committee   had   taken   decision   to   retire   him 



   prematurely   from   service   which   was   accepted   by   the   Full 



   Court   in   its   meeting   held   on   September   22,   2001   and 



   though in the letter communicating ACR it was mentioned 



   that   he   was   entitled   to   made   representation   within   six 



   weeks, the order of compulsory retirement against him was 



   passed   on   September   27,   2001   which   was   communicated 



   to  him  on  September  28,  2001  and  as he  was deprived of 



   making   any   representation   against   the   ACR   for   the   year 



   2000, the order retiring him from service compulsorily was 



   bad in law. 



84.In the Appeal arising from Special Leave Petition No.27200 


   of  2008  it  was  contended by M.S.  Rohilla that in the ACR 



                                                                             12



    for   the   year   2000,   recorded   by   the   Full   Court   on   May   24, 



    2001,   he   was   graded   `C-Integrity   doubtful'   and   he   was 



    communicated the said ACR and was asked to submit his 



    representation   within   six   weeks,   but   within   three   days 



    thereafter i.e. on September 27, 2001 decision was taken to 



    retire   him   compulsorily   from   service   and,   therefore,   the 



    order retiring him compulsorily from service was illegal.  



85.In  Appeal   arising   out   of   Special   Leave   Petition   No.   314   of 


    2009   it   was   contended   on   behalf   of   P.D.   Gupta   that   the 



    Full Court had recorded  remarks  `C-Integrity Doubtful' for 



    the   year   2000,   in   his   case,   which   was   communicated   to 



    him   vide   letter   dated   September   22,   2001   and   he   was 



    asked to file his representation against the remarks within 



    six weeks, but without waiting for the representation to be 



    filed   by   him,   the   High   court   upon  the   adverse   remarks   of 



    2000 had recommended his premature retirement to the Lt. 



    Governor   under   F.R.   56(j)   read   with   Rule   33   of   the   DJS 



    Rules,   and   therefore   the   order   retiring   him   from   service 



    should have been set aside by the High Court.  



                                                                           12


86.As   against   this   it   was   emphasized   on   behalf   of   the 


   respondents   that   this   Court   not   only   has   taken   the   view 



   that a single adverse entry reflecting on the integrity of the 



   officer is sufficient because there has to be constant vigil by 



   the   High   Court   over   subordinate   judiciary   but   this   Court 



   has   further   taken   the   view   that   it   is   not   necessary   that 



   such an entry should have been communicated or that the 



   officer   concerned  should   have   an  opportunity   to  represent 



   against   the   said   adverse   entry   or   that   before   it   could   be 



   taken   into   consideration   and   acted   upon,   the 



   representation should have been considered or rejected.  



87.The   High   Court   in   the   impugned   judgment,   while 


   considering this plea raised on behalf of the appellants, has 



   inter alia held that action under FR 56(j) need not await the 



   final disposal of such representation.  It may be mentioned 



   that in support of their respective contentions, the learned 



   counsel have cited several decisions for the guidance of the 



   Court   but   this   Court   proposes   to   refer   to   only   those 



   judgments which are relevant for deciding the issue.  



                                                                          12


88.Compulsory retirement from service is not considered to be 


   a   punishment.     Under   the   relevant   rules,   an   order   of 



   dismissal   is   a   punishment   laid   on   a   Government   servant 



   when it is found that he has been guilty of misconduct or 



   the like.  It is penal in character because it involves loss of 



   pension which under the Rules have accrued in respect of 



   the service already put in.  An order of removal also stands 



   on the   same   footing  as  an   order   of dismissal  and   involves 



   the   same   consequences,   the   only   difference   between   them 



   being  that while  a servant who  is  dismissed is  not eligible 



   for re-appointment, one who is removed is.   A compulsory 



   retirement is neither dismissal nor removal and differs from 



   both   of   them,   in   that   it   is   not   a   form   of   punishment 



   prescribed   by   the   rules   and   involves   no   penal 



   consequences, in as much as the person retired is entitled 



   to   pension   and   other   retiral   benefits,   proportionate   to   the 



   period of service standing to his credit.  



89. As   explained   by   a   Bench   of   three   Hon'ble   Judges   of   this 



   Court   in  
State   of   U.P.  vs.  Shyam   Lal   Sharma
  AIR   1971 



                                                                         12



SC 2151, in ascertaining, whether the order of compulsory 


retirement  is  one  of punishment,  it  has to  be  ascertained, 



whether   in   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement   there   was 



any   element   of   charge   or   stigma   or   imputation   or   any 



implication   of   misbehaviour   or   incapacity   against   the 



officer   concerned.     Secondly,   the   order   of   compulsory 



retirement will be indicative of punishment or penalty if the 



order  will   involve  loss  of  benefits  already   earned.     Thirdly, 



as order of compulsory retirement on the completion of 25 



years of service or an order of compulsory retirement made 



in   the   public   interest   to   dispense   with   further   service   will 



not amount to an order for dismissal or removal as there is 



no   element   of   punishment.     Fourthly,   an   order   of 



compulsory retirement will not be held to be an order in the 



nature of punishment or penalty on the ground that there 



is   possibility   of   loss   of   future   prospects,   namely,   that   the 



officer   will   not   get   his   pay   till   he   attains   the   age   of 



superannuation,   or   will   not   get   an   enhanced   pension   for 



not   being   allowed   to   remain   a   few   years   in   service   and 



being compulsorily retired.  So far as the present cases are 



                                                                        12



concerned, this Court finds that there are no words in the 



orders   of   compulsory   retirement,   which   throw   any   stigma 



against   the   two   appellants   and   the   deceased   officer.




Therefore, it is not necessary for this Court to make inquiry 



into  the   Government   files  to   discover   whether   any   remark 



amounting   to   stigma   could   be   found   in   the   files.     The 



reason   is   that   it   is   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement, 



which alone is for examination.   If the order itself does not 



contain   any   imputation   or   charge   against   the   two 



appellants   and   the   deceased   officer,   the   fact   that 



considerations   of   misconduct   or   misbehaviour   weighed 



with   the   High   Court   in   coming   to   its   conclusion   to   retire 



them   compulsorily   does   not   amount   to   any   imputation   or 



charge against them.  It is not established from the order of 



compulsory retirement itself that the charge or imputation 



against the appellants was made a condition for exercise of 



the   power.     Therefore,   the   orders   of   retirement   cannot   be 



considered to be one for dismissal or removal in the nature 



of penalty or punishment.



                                                                           12


90.Now,   the   policy   underlying   
Article   311(2)
   of   the 


   Constitution   is   that   when   it   is   proposed   to   take   action 



   against   the   servant   by   way   of   punishment   and   that   will 



   entail   forfeiture   of   benefits   already   earned   by   him,   he 



   should   be   heard   and   given   an   opportunity   to   show   cause 



   against   the   order.     The   confidential   reports   provide   the 



   basic and vital inputs for assessing the performance of an 



   officer   and  his  advancement   in  his  career  as  also  to  serve 



   the   data   for   judging   his   comparative   merits   when   the 



   questions   arise   for   his   confirmation,   promotion,   grant   of 



   selection   grade,   crossing   E.B.,   retention   in   service   beyond 



   the   age   of   50   years   etc.     Maintenance   of   such   records   is 



   ordinarily regulated by administrative rules or instructions. 



   Writing   the   confidential   report  is   primarily   and   essentially 



   an administrative function.  Normally tribunals/Courts are 



   loath   to   interfere   in   cases   of   complaints   against   adverse 



   remarks   and   to   substitute   their   own   judgment   for   that   of 



   the   reporting   or   reviewing   officers.     It   is   because   these 



   officers   alone   are   best   suited   to   judge   the   qualities   of 



   officials working under them and about their competence in 



                                                                       12



the   performance   of   official   duties   entrusted   to   them. 



Despite   fear   of   abuse   of   power   by   prejudiced   superior 



officers in certain cases, the service record contained in the 



confidential   reports,   by   and   large,   reflects   the   real 



personality of the officer.  The object of writing confidential 



reports and making entries therein is to give an opportunity 



to the public servant to improve excellence.   
Article 51
 A(j) 



of  the   Constitution  enjoins   upon  every  citizen  the   primary 



duty   to   constantly   endeavour   to   prove   excellence, 



individually   and   collectively,   as   a   member   of   the   group. 



Therefore, the officer entrusted with the duty to write C.R. 



has   a   public   responsibility   and   trust   to   write   the   C.R. 



objectively,   fairly   and   dispassionately   while   giving,   as 



accurately as possible the statement of facts on an overall 



assessment   of   performance   of   the   subordinate   officer. 



Opportunity   of   hearing   is   not   necessary   before   adverse 



remarks   because   adverse   remarks   by   themselves   do   not 



constitute   a   penalty.     However,   when   the   order   of 



compulsory   retirement   is   passed,   the   authority   concerned 



has   to   take   into   consideration   the   whole   service   record   of 



                                                                          12



   the   officer   concerned   which   would   include   non-



   communicated adverse remarks also.   Thus it is settled by 



   several   reported   decisions   of   this   Court   that   un-



   communicated   adverse   remarks   can   be   taken   into 



   consideration   while   deciding   the   question   whether   an 



   official should be made to retire compulsorily or not.  



91. 
In  
State of U.P. and Another  Vs.  Bihari Lal
  (1994) Supp 



   (3)   SCC   593,   this   Court   has   taken   the   view   that   even  an 


   adverse   entry   which   has   been   set   aside   in   appeal   on 



   technical   grounds   could   also   be   taken   into   consideration.




   The plea that since the last entry, i.e., `C-Integrity Doubtful' 



   for   the   year   2000   was   communicated   almost   around   the 



   same   time   when   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement   was 



   communicated and as the appellants had no opportunity to 



   represent against the same, it ought not to have been taken 



   into   consideration   and   that   the   consideration   of   the   said 



   last   adverse   entry   vitiates   the   order   of   compulsory 



   retirement   has   no   merits.     This   Court   has   consistently 



   taken   the   view   that   an   order   of   compulsory   retirement   is 



                                                                         12



   not a punishment and does not have adverse consequence 



   and,   therefore,   the   principles   of   natural   justice   are   not 



   attracted.  What is relevant to notice is that this Court has 



   held   that   an   un-communicated   adverse   A.C.R.   on   record 



   can be taken into consideration and an order of compulsory 



   retirement   cannot   be   set   aside   only   for   the   reason   that 



   such   un-communicated   adverse   entry   was   taken   into 



   consideration.     If   that   be   so,   the   fact   that   the   adverse 



   A.C.R.   was   communicated   but   none   of   the   appellants   had 



   an   opportunity   to   represent   against   the   same,   before   the 



   same   was   taken   into   consideration   for   passing   order   of 



   compulsory   retirement,   cannot   at   all   vitiate   the   order   of 



   compulsory retirement.  



92. In  State   of   U.P.   and   another  vs.  Biharilal  (supra),   this 



   Court has ruled  that before exercise  of the power  to  retire 



   an employee compulsorily from service, the authority has to 



   take   into   consideration   the   overall   record,   even   including 



   some of the adverse remarks, though for technical reasons, 



   might have been expunged on appeal or revision.   What is 



                                                                        13



emphasised   in   the   said   decision   is   that   in   the   absence   of 



any   mala   fide   exercise   of   power   or   arbitrary   exercise   of 



power,   a   possible   different   conclusion   would   not   be   a 



ground for interference by the Court/Tribunal in exercise of 



its power of judicial review.   According to this Court, what 



is needed to be looked into is whether a bona fide decision 



is taken in the public interest to augment efficiency in the 



public service.  
Again, a three Judge Bench of this Court in 



Union   of   India  vs.  V.P.   Seth   and   another
  1994   SCC 


(L&S)   1052,   has   held   that   uncommunicated   adverse 


remarks can be taken into consideration while passing the 



order of compulsory retirement.
 
The bench in the said case 



made reference to  
Baikuntha Nath Das  vs.  Chief District 


Medical   Officer,  Baripada
  (1992)   2   SCC   299,   as   well   as 



Posts and Telegraphs Board  vs.  C.S.N. Murthy
  (1992) 2 


SCC   317,   and   after   reiterating,   with   approval,   the 


principles stated therein, has laid down firm proposition of 



law that an order of compulsory retirement is not liable to 



be   quashed   by   a   Court   merely   on   the   showing   that   while 



passing   it,   uncommunicated   adverse   remarks   were   also 



                                                                      13



taken   into   consideration.     Applying   the   
ratio   
laid   down   in
 



the   above-mentioned   two   cases  to   the  facts   of  the   present 



cases, this Court finds that the authorities concerned were 



justified in relying upon the adverse entry made against the 



two   appellants   and   the   deceased   officer   in   the   year   2000 



indicating that their integrity was doubtful alongwith other 



materials.  Here in these cases, the ACRs for the year 2000 



were   communicated   to   the   three   officers   but   before   they 



could   exercise   the   option   given   to   them   to   make 



representation against the same, the orders of compulsory 



retirement   were   passed.     When   an   uncommunicated 



adverse   entry   can   be   taken   into   consideration,   while 



passing order of compulsory retirement, there is no reason 



to   hold   that   adverse   entry   communicated,   against   which 



opportunity  of making representation is  denied, cannot be 



taken   into   consideration   at   the   time   of   passing   order   of 



compulsory retirement.  Merely because the two appellants 



and   the   deceased   officer   had   no   opportunity   to   make 



representation   against   the   said   entry   or   that   the 



representation made against the same was pending, would 



                                                                          13



   not   render   consideration   of   the   said   entry   illegal,   in   any 



   manner, whatsoever.




93. 
In     
Baidyanath   Mahapatra  Vs.  State   of   Orissa   and 


   Another
  (1989)   4   SCC   664,   the   Review   Committee 


   constituted   by   the   Government   of   Orissa   in   October   1983 



   to   determine   the   appellant's   suitability   for   retention   in 



   service   after   his   completing   the   age   of   50   years, 



   recommended   the   appellant   to   be   compulsorily   retired 



   under   Rule   71(1)(a)   of   the   Orissa   Service   Code.     The 



   Committee   took   into   account   for   formulating   its   opinion, 



   the   entries   awarded   to   him   for   the   years   1981-82   and 



   1982-83 which had been communicated to the appellant on 



   July   5,   1983   and   August   9,   1983   respectively.     The 



   appellant   made   representations   against   entries   on 



   November   1,   1983   but   without   disposing   them   of,   the 



   Government   made   an   order   on   November   10,   1983 



   compulsorily retiring the appellant from service, which was 



   upheld by the State Administrative Tribunal.   Allowing the 



   appeal this Court held that the appellant had right to make 



                                                                           13



   representation   against   the   adverse   entries   within   six 



   months, and, therefore, the adverse entries awarded to him 



   in   the   years   1981-82   and   1982-83   could   not   have   been 



   taken   into   account   either   by   the   Review   Committee   or   by 



   the   State   Government   in   forming   the   requisite   opinion   as 



   contemplated   by   Rule   71(1)(a)   of   the   Orissa   Service   Code, 



   before the expiry of the period of six months.  According to 



   the   Court,   the   proper   course   for   the   Review   Committee 



   should   have   been   not   to   consider   those   entries   or   in   the 



   alternative,   the   Review   Committee   should   have   waited   for 



   the   decision   of   the   Government   on   the   appellant's 



   representation.  This Court in 
the said decision
 emphasized 



   the   purpose   of   communicating   adverse   entries   and   held 



   that   delay   in   communication   of   adverse   entries   should   be 



   avoided.     This   Court   finds   that  the   said   case   did   not  deal 



   with entry which had adverse reflection on the integrity of 



   the official concerned.

In  
S.   Maheswar   Rao  Vs.  State   of   Orissa   and   Another
 



   1989   Supp   (2)   SCC   248               the   appellant   was   a 



                                                                              13



Superintending   Engineer.     His   case   was   considered   under 



the   first   proviso   to   Rule   71(a)   of   the   Orissa   Service   Code 



and on the basis of adverse remarks awarded to him for the 



last   three   years,   i.e.,   for   the   years   1980-81,   1981-82   and 



1982-83, the Review Committee had made recommendation 



for   his   premature   retirement.                        At   that   time   his 



representation against the  adverse remarks  relating  to  the 



first  year  was pending.    Against the remarks  for  the other 



years, he made representations subsequently and the State 



Government had without disposing of these representations 



compulsorily           retired         him.               The         Bhubaneswar 



Administrative   Tribunal   disapproved   the   taking   into 



consideration   of   the   remarks   for   the   first   year   but 



sustained the impugned order of compulsory retirement on 



the   basis   of   remarks   for   the   subsequent   years.     While 



allowing   the   appeal   this   Court   observed   that   adverse 



entries for the years 1981-82 and 1982-83 could not have 



been taken into consideration for the premature retirement 



of   the   appellant,   and   the   Review   Committee   should   have 



deferred the consideration of his case till his representation 



                                                                           13



   against the aforesaid adverse entries was disposed of or in 



   the   alternative   the   State   Government   itself   should   have 



   considered   and   disposed   of   the   representation   before 



   issuing   the   order   for   premature   retirement.     However,   in 



   this case also, this Court finds that this was not a case of 



   consideration   of   adverse   entry   relating   to   the   integrity   of 



   the officer concerned.




95. Though   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   have   relied 



   upon   decision   in  
V.K.   Jain  Vs.  High
   Court   of   Delhi 


   through   Registrar   General   and   Others,   (2008)   17   SCC 


   538, this Court finds that basically 
the said decision
 deals 


   with   expunction   of   adverse   remarks   made   by   the   High 



   Court   against   a   judicial   officer   while   setting   aside   his 



   judicial   order   granting  bail  to   an  accused.     It emphasizes, 



   the judicial restraints to be exercised by the High Courts in 



   judicial   functions.     It   does   not   deal   with   compulsory 



   retirement   of   a   judicial   officer   or   how   to   write   his   ACR.




   Therefore, detailed reference to the same is avoided.  



                                                                           13


96. However,   this   Court   finds   that   in  
Union   of   India  Vs.  Col
.




   J.N.   Sinha   and   Another,   1970   (2)   SCC   458,   the 


   respondent was compulsorily retired by the Government of 



   India   under   Fundamental   Rule   56(j).     The   said   order   was 



   challenged by the respondent amongst other things on the 



   ground   that   the   lack   of   opportunity   to   show   cause 



   amounted   to   denial   of   natural   justice.     The   said   plea   was 



   accepted   by   the   High   Court   and   High   Court   had   issued   a 



   writ   of   certiorari   quashing   the   said   order.     In   appeal   this 



   Court   held   that   a   Government   Servant   serving   under   the 



   Union   of   India   holds   his   office   at   the   pleasure   of   the 



   President, but this `pleasure' doctrine is subject to the rules 



   or law made under 
Article 309
 as well as to the conditions 



   prescribed  under   
Article   311.
     This   Court   firmly   held   that 



   rules of natural justice are not embodied rules nor can they 



   be   elevated  to   the   position   of   fundamental   rights,   and   the 



   Court   cannot   ignore   the   mandate   of   the   Legislature   or   a 



   statutory   authority.     After   holding   that   the   compulsory 



   retirement   involves   no   civil   consequences   and   that   a 



   Government   servant   does   not   lose   any   of   the   rights 



                                                                           13



   acquired   by   him   before   retirement,   it   was   held   that 



   Fundamental   Rule   56   (j)   holds   the   balance   between   the 



   rights   of   the   individual   Government   servant   and   the 



   interests   of   the   public.     According   to   this   Court,   while   a 



   minimum service is guaranteed to the Government servant, 



   the   government   is   given   power   to   energize   its   machinery 



   and   make   it   more   efficient   by   compulsorily   retiring   those 



   who   in   its   opinion   should   not   be   there   in   public   interest. 



   Thus the plea of breach of principles of natural justice was 



   not accepted by this Court in the said case.

In  
Baikuntha   Nath   Das   and   Another  Vs.  Chief   District 



   Medical   Officer,   Baripada   and   Another
,   (1992)   2   SCC 


   299, the three Judge Bench of this Court had occasion to 


   consider the question of effect of uncommunicated adverse 



   remarks   taken   into   consideration   while   passing   order   of 



   compulsory   retirement   against   the   appellants   of   that   case 



   and   scope   of   judicial   review   of   the   order   retiring   an 



   employee compulsorily from service.   The appellants in the 



   appeals   were   compulsorily   retired   by   the   Government   of 



                                                                          13



Orissa   in   exercise   of   the   power   conferred   upon   it   by   the 



first Proviso to sub-rule (a) of Rule 71 of the Orissa Service 



Code.     The   appellant   Mr.   Baikuntha   Nath   Das   was 



appointed   as   a   Pharmacist   by   the   Civil   Surgeon, 



Mayurbhanj   on   March   15,   1951.     By   an   order   dated 



February   13   1976   the   Government   of   Orissa   had   retired 



him  compulsorily.     The  said  Order  was  challenged  by   him 



in the High Court of Orissa by way of a Writ Petition.   His 



case was that the order was based on no material and that 



it   was   the   result   of   ill-will   and   malice,   the   Chief   District 



Medical   Officer   bore   towards   him.       According   to   him   he 



was transferred by the said officer from place to place and 



was   also   placed   under   suspension   at   one   stage,   but   his 



entire   service   had   been   spotless   and   that  at   no   time   were 



any   adverse   entries   in   his   confidential   character   rolls 



communicated   to   him.     In   the   counter   affidavit   filed   on 



behalf   of   the   Government   it   was   submitted   that   the 



decision   to   retire   him   compulsorily   was   taken   by   the 



Review Committee and not by the Chief Medical Officer and 



it   was   stated   that   besides   the   remarks   made   in   the 



                                                                     13



confidential   character   rolls,   other   material   was   also   taken 



into consideration by the Review Committee and that it had 



arrived   at   its   decision   bona   fide   and   in   public   interest 



which   decision   was   accepted   and   approved   by   the 



Government.  In the Counter the allegation of mala fide was 



denied.  The High Court had looked into the proceedings of 



the   Review   Committee   and   the   confidential   character   rolls 



of   the   appellant   and   dismissed   the   writ   petition   holding 



that an order of compulsory retirement after putting in the 



prescribed  qualifying period  of  service  does  not amount to 



punishment.   The High Court had observed that the order 



in   question   was   passed   by   the   State   Government   and   not 



by the Chief Medical Officer and did not suffer from vice of 



malice.     It was further  held by the  High Court  that it  was 



true   that   the   confidential   character   roll   of   the   appellant 



contained   several   remarks   adverse   to   him   which   were,   no 



doubt,   not   communicated   to   him.
 
On   behalf   of   the 



appellants   who   were   compulsorily   retired   reliance   was 



placed   upon   the   decisions   of   this   Court   in

SCC 188 and 



                                                                   14



Baidyanath   Mahapatra
           (Supra)   in   support   of   the 



contention   that   it   was   not   permissible   to   the   respondent 



Government to order compulsory retirement on the basis of 



material   which   included   uncommunicated   adverse 



remarks, whereas on behalf of the respondent Government 



reliance   was   placed   upon   the   decision   in  
Union   of   India 



Vs.  M.E. Reddy
, (1980) 2 SCC 15, to contend that it was 



permissible   to   the   Government   to   take   into   consideration 



uncommunicated   adverse   remarks   also   while   taking   a 



decision   to   retire   a   Government   servant   compulsorily.
 
A 



study of the decision rendered by the three Judge Bench of 



this   Court   makes   it   evident   that   not   less   than   twenty 



reported   decisions   of   this   Court   were   taken   into 



consideration   and   thereafter   the   Court   has   overruled   the 



decision   in  
Baidyanath   Mahapatra  Vs.  State   of   Orissa
 


(1989)   4   SCC   664,          which   took   the   view   that 



uncommunicated   adverse   remarks   cannot   be   taken   into 



consideration   while   passing   an   order   of   compulsory 



retirement against a Government servant.




                                                                                    14

In  
Baikuntha  Nath Das
  case,  after  referring  to decision  of 



   this   Court   in  
Brij   Mohan   Singh   Chopra  Vs.  State   of 


   Punjab
 (1987) 2 SCC 188,  where a three Judge Bench of 


   this Court has specifically affirmed the decision rendered in 


   
Union   of   India  Vs.  M.E.   Reddy
   (1980)   2   SCC   15,  this 


   Court has laid down following firm proposition of law stated 



   in paragraph 34 of the reported decision:




     "34. The following principles emerge from the above 

     discussion:



     (i)      An   order   of   compulsory   retirement   is   not   a 

              punishment.   It   implies   no   stigma   nor   any 

              suggestion of misbehaviour.





     (ii)     The order has to be passed by the government 

              on forming the opinion that it is in the public 

              interest   to   retire   a   government   servant 

              compulsorily.   The   order   is   passed   on   the 

              subjective satisfaction of the government.



     (iii)    Principles   of   natural   justice   have   no   place   in 

              the   context   of   an   order   of   compulsory 

              retirement.   This   does   not   mean   that   judicial 

              scrutiny is excluded altogether. While the High 

              Court   or   this   Court   would   not   examine   the 

              matter   as   an   appellate   court,   they   may 

              interfere   if   they   are   satisfied   that   the   order   is 

              passed  (a)  mala   fide   or   (b)  that   it   is   based   on 

              no evidence or (c) that it is arbitrary -- in the 

              sense   that   no   reasonable   person   would   form 

              the requisite opinion on the given material; in 

              short, if it is found to be a perverse order.



                                                                                  14


      (iv)    The  government   (or  the  Review  Committee,  as 

              the   case   may   be)   shall   have   to   consider   the 

              entire record of service before taking a decision 

              in   the   matter   --   of   course   attaching   more 

              importance   to   record   of   and   performance 

              during   the   later   years.   The   record   to   be   so 

              considered would naturally include the entries 

              in   the   confidential   records/character   rolls, 

              both   favourable   and   adverse.   If   a   government 

              servant   is   promoted   to   a   higher   post 

              notwithstanding   the   adverse   remarks,   such 

              remarks   lose   their   sting,   more   so,   if   the 

              promotion is based upon merit (selection) and 

              not upon seniority.



      (v)     An order of compulsory retirement is not liable 

              to   be   quashed   by   a   Court   merely   on   the 

              showing           that         while         passing         it 


              uncommunicated   adverse   remarks   were   also 

              taken   into   consideration.   That   circumstance 

              by itself cannot be a basis for interference.



      Interference   is   permissible   only   on   the   grounds 

      mentioned in (iii) above.."



99.In   view   of   the   two   three   Judge   Bench   decisions   of   this 


   Court   mentioned   above   the   contention   that   adverse 



   remarks   relating   to   integrity   regarding   which   no 



   opportunity   of   making   representation   was   provided   or 



   pending representation was not considered and, therefore, 



   orders of compulsory retirement were bad in law cannot be 



   accepted.  Therefore, the said contention is hereby rejected. 



                                                                          14


100.Another   point   which   was   canvassed   for   consideration   of 


   the   Court   was   that   Rule   31A   of   DJS   Rules   incorporated 



   since   1.1.1996   covers   entire   field   of  age   of   retirement   and 



   premature   retirement   of   Delhi   Judicial   Officers   and, 



   therefore, premature retirement of the appellants could not 



   have been made before their attaining the age of 58 years. 



   According   to   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   Rule 



   31A was added by notification dated 1.1.1996 issued by Lt. 



   Governor   on  the   recommendation   of   the   Delhi   High   Court 



   under 
Article 309
 of the Constitution to DJS Rules on the 



   subject   of   retirement,   providing   the   normal   age   of 



   retirement   as   60   years   with   proviso   of   compulsory 



   retirement   at   the   age   of   58   years   and   for   voluntary 



   retirement at the age of 58 years and after addition of this 



   Rule, Rule 33 of DJS Rules could not have been invoked for 



   application of Fundamental Rules, on the subject of normal 



   age   of   retirement,   age   of   premature   retirement   and 



   assessment   of   performance   as   well   as   age   of   voluntary 



   retirement.        What   was   emphasized   was   that   after 



   introduction   of   Rule   31A   in   DJS   Rules   the   subject   of 



                                                                         14



   premature   retirement   cannot   be   considered   to   be   a 



   residuary matter for which no Rule exists in DJS rules and, 



   therefore, premature retirement of the appellants could not 



   have been ordered before they attained the age of 58 years.



101.The   learned   counsel   for   the   High   Court   argued   that   this 



   point   was   given   up   before   the   High   Court   and,   therefore, 



   the   Court   should   not   permit   the   appellants   to   agitate   the 



   same   in   appeals   arising   from   grant   of   special   leave.     
In 



   support   of   this   submission   reliance   was   placed   by   the 



   learned   counsel   for   the   High   Court   on:   (
1)  State   of 


   Maharashtra Vs. Ramdas Shrinivas Nayak & Anr.
, (1982) 


   2   SCC   463,   (2)  Shankar   K.   Mandal   &   Ors.  Vs.  State   of 


   Bihar   &   Ors.,  (
2003)   9   SCC   519,   (3)  Mount   Carmel 


   School   Society  Vs.  DDA

   Bhavnagar University  Vs.  Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. & 


   Ors.
, (2003) 2SCC 111.




102.Without prejudice to the above contention, it was argued by 



   the   learned   counsel   for   the   High   Court   that   in

                                                                        14



SCC 119, this Court directed that the age of retirement of 


the judicial officers be increased to 60, and when a review 



was filed, this Court in 
All India Judges' Association and 


others  vs.  Union of India and others
  (1993) 4 SCC 288, 


while maintaining that the judicial officers be permitted to 



serve up to the age of 60 years, imposed a condition that all 



judicial   officers   would   not   be   entitled   to   the   said   benefit 



automatically,   but  only  those   who  were  found  fit   after   the 



evaluation   of   their   fitness   would   be   permitted   to   go   up   to 



60   years   and   this   Court   expressed   the   view   that   the 



standard of evaluation could be the same as for compulsory 



retirement.     The   learned   counsel   emphasized   that   while 



giving   the   said   direction,   this   Court   expressly   and 



specifically provided that the ordinary provisions relating to 



compulsory retirement at earlier stages were not dispensed 



with   and   they   will   continue   to   operate,   and,   therefore, 



incorporation of Rule 31A in the Delhi Judicial Service was 



made   but   it   is   wrong   to   contend   that   Rule   31A   overrides 



the other provisions of the Rules and in particular, Rule 33 



read   with   Fundamental   Rules   which   provide   for 



                                                                           14



   compulsory   retirement   after     a   judicial   officer   attains   the 



   age  of  50   years.     According   to   the   learned   counsel   for   the 



   respondent,   Rule   31A   has   no   bearing   and   impact   in 



   deciding   whether   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement 



   against   the   appellant   in   terms   of   Rule   33   read   with   F.R. 



   56(j) is valid or not.




103.Though   High   Court   in   paragraph   45   of   the   impugned 


   judgment   has   observed   that   the   plea   taken   in   the   writ 



   petition filed by Mr. Gupta that FR 56(j) read with Rule 33 



   of the DJS Rules is not applicable after the introduction of 



   Rule   31   of   the   DJS   rules,   was   dropped   at   the   time   of 



   argument   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellant 



   conceding that the order could have been passed under the 



   aforesaid   provision,   this   Court   finds   that   this   was   a 



   concession   on   point   of   law   which   would   not   bind   the 



   appellants.  Further in the interest of justice it is necessary 



   to settle the controversy once for all and, therefore, though 



   in   view   of   decisions   cited   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the 



   High Court, it is accepted as correct by this Court that the 



                                                                                     14



   point   sought   to   be   argued   was   dropped   before   the   High 



   Court, it would not be in the interest of justice to preclude 



   the   learned   counsel   for   the   appellants   from   agitating   this 



   point   before   this   Court.     Under   the   circumstances,   the 



   Court proposes to examine the said contention on merits. 



104.It is well known fact that in 
All India Judge's Association
 



   (Supra),   this   Hon'ble   Court   in   paragraph   63(iii)   directed 



   that :




     "Retirement   age   of   judicial   officers   be   raised   to   60 

     years   and   appropriate   steps   are   to   be   taken   by 

     December 31, 1992." 





105.In   Second  All   India   Judge's   Association   &   Others  Vs. 



   Union   of   India   &   Others,   (1993)   4   SCC   288,   this   Court 


   clarified in paragraph 30 of the said judgment as under :



     "The benefit of the increase of the retirement age to 

     60 years, shall not be available automatically to all 

     judicial   officers   irrespective   of   their   past   records   of 

     service and evidence of their continued utility to the 

     judicial         system...................The         potential         for 

     continued utility shall be assessed and evaluated by 

     appropriate Committees of Judges of the respective 

     High   Courts   constituted   and   headed   by   the   Chief 

     Justice of the High Courts and the evaluation shall 

     be   made   on   the   basis   of   the   judicial   officer's   past 



                                                                             14



      record   of   service,   character   rolls,   quality   of 

      judgments and other relevant matters." 





106.In   paragraph   31   of   the   reported   decision   this   Court   has 


   inter alia observed that the standard of evaluation shall be 



   as   applicable   to   compulsory   retirement.     However   what   is 



   relevant   to   notice   is   paragraph   52   wherein   this   Court 



   observed and directed as under:-



      "The assessment directed here is for evaluating the 

      eligibility  to continue in  service beyond 58 years of 

      age   and   is   in   addition   to   and   independent   of   the 

      assessment   for   compulsory   retirement   that   may 

      have   to   be   undertaken   under   the   relevant   Service 

      Rules, at the earlier stage/s."





107.In  Nawal   Singh  Vs.  State   of   U.P.   &   Another
,   (2003)   8 



   SCC   117,   this   Court   had   again   occasion   to   consider   the 


   observations   made   in  
All   India   Judge's   Association
  case 



   (second)   and   after   making   reference   to   
the   said   decision
 



   this Court observed as under :-




            "..........there   is   no   embargo   on  the   competent 

            authority   to   exercise   its   power   of   compulsory 

            retirement under  Rule 56  of  the  Fundamental 

            Rules.  As stated above, we have arrived at the 

            conclusion   that   because   of   the   increase   in 

            retirement  age,   rest  of  the   Rules   providing   for 



                                                                            14



            compulsory   retirement  would   not   be   nugatory 

            and are not repealed." 





108.Again  in  
Ramesh   Chandra   Acharya  Vs.  Registrary,   High
 



   Court   of   Orissa   and   Another,   (2000)   6   SCC   332,   this 


   Court observed in paragraph 8 of the reported decision that 



   "the   Court   thereafter   clarified   that   the   assessment   at   the 



   age of 58 years is for the purpose of finding out suitability 



   of the officers concerned for the entitlement of the benefit of 



   the   increased   age   of   superannuation   from   58   years   to   60 



   years; it is in addition to the assessment to be undertaken 



   for   compulsory   retirement   and   the   compulsory   retirement 



   at the earlier stage/s under the respective service rules."




109.In   view   of   the   direction   contained   in  
All   India   Judge's 



   Association
  case Rule 31 was inserted in DJS Rules with 


   effect   from   1.1.1996   providing   that   the   normal   age   of 



   retirement of the Delhi Judicial Officers governed by D.J.S. 



   Rules   would   be   60   years.     The   potential   for   continued 



   utility   was   to   be   assessed   and   evaluated   at   the   age   of   58 



   years because the benefit of the increase of the retirement 



                                                                          15



age   to   60   years   was   not   available   automatically   to   all 



judicial officers irrespective of their past records of service.




Though this Court observed that the standard of evaluation 



for determining the potential for continued utility should be 



the   same   as   for   compulsory   retirement   but   it   was 



specifically made clear that the assessment directed was for 



evaluating   the   eligibility   to   continue   in   service   beyond   58 



years of age and was in addition to and independent of the 



assessment   for   compulsory   retirement   that   might   have   to 



be   undertaken   under   the   relevant   Service   Rules   at   the 



earlier stage/s.   The clarification made by this Court in 
All 


India Judge's Association
  case No. 2 leaves the matter in 


no doubt that the independent assessment for compulsory 



retirement   to   be   undertaken   under   the   relevant   Service 



Rules is not affected at all in any manner whatsoever. It is 



true   that   the   performance   of   a   judicial   officer   is   to   be 



evaluated  for determining his utility  to  continue in service 



upto   the   age   of   60   years   but   it   is   wrong   to   contend   that 



Rule   31   overrides   Rule   33,   which   deals   with   residuary 



matters which includes compulsory retirement of a judicial 



                                                                                15



   officer   after   he   attains   the   age   of   50   years.     It   is   rightly 



   contended   by   the   learned   counsel   for   the   High   Court   that 



   Rule 31A has bearing and impact in deciding the question 



   whether   the   order   of   compulsory   retirement   against   the 



   appellant in terms of Rule 33 read with F.R. 56(j) is valid or 



   not.  The newly added rule does not deal with the aspect of 



   compulsory   retirement   at   all.     In   terms   of   Rule   33   the 



   subject of compulsory retirement did remain residuary even 



   after   the   introduction   of   Rule   31A   in   DJS   Rules   and, 



   therefore, the question of premature retirement will have to 



   be considered only under FR 56(j) and not under the newly 



   added   Rule   31A.     Thus   consideration   of   the   case   of   the 



   appellant   for   premature   retirement   before   he   attained   the 



   age of 58 years cannot be regarded as illegal in any manner 



   at   all.     This   Court   does   not   find   any   substance   in   this 



   contention raised on behalf of the appellant and, therefore, 



   the same is rejected.




110.Another   point   which   was   pressed   into   service   for 


   consideration   of   the   Court   was   that   the   procedure   of 



                                                                       15



recording   ACR   wherein   the   appellants   were   given   adverse 



remarks   was   in   violation   of   rules   of   principles   of   natural 



justice   and   as   there   was   no   material   which   would   justify 



adverse entries in ACR's of the appellants, the same could 



not   have   been   taken   into   consideration   while   passing 



orders of compulsory retirement.  On behalf of the deceased 



Mr.   Verma   it   was   argued   that   there   was   no   material   to 



retire   him   prematurely   and   it   was   admitted   by   the   High 



Court   in   his   case   that   premature   retirement   was   not 



ordered   because   of   complaints,   but   on   the   bona   fide 



impression and opinion formed by the High Court.   It was 



also argued on behalf of Mr. Verma that no inspection was 



made, of the judicial work done by him for the years 1998, 



1999   and   2000   and   as   this   fact   was   not   denied   in   the 



counter affidavit filed by the High Court, the order retiring 



him compulsorily from service suffers from vice of malice in 



law, and should have been set aside by the High Court on 



judicial   side.     Mr.   Rohilla   who   had   argued   his   appeal   in 



person   had   contended   that   the   order   of   compulsory 



retirement was expected to have been passed on the basis 



                                                                         15



of all the material available prior to the passing of the order 



but   the   material   in   respect   of   which   he   had   made 



representation   which   was   pending   to   be   replied   or 



representation against the material which was still required 



to   be   submitted,   could   not   have   been   relied   upon   for 



passing order of compulsory retirement.  According to him, 



the so called material relied upon was only one-sided view 



and was not the wholesome exercise which was required to 



be   undertaken   before   passing   order   of   compulsory 



retirement.   Mr. Rohilla had further argued that there was 



no   record   of   any   complaints   either   oral   or   in   writing   nor 



there   was   any   record   to   show   whether   the   complaints 



related   to   his   judicial   work   on   the   basis   of   which   ACR   of 



the year 2000 were recorded.   The oral communication by 



members   of   the   Bar   or   by   office   bearers   of   the   Bar 



Association   was   thoroughly   irrelevant   in   the   absence   of 



particulars mentioned in the ACR and, could not have been 



taken into consideration while passing order of compulsory 



retirement. 



                                                                           15


111.On   behalf   of   the   appellant   Mr.   P.D.   Gupta,   it   was 


   contended   that   for   the   year   2000   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice 



   M.S.A. Siddique was appointed as Inspecting Judge by the 



   High Court but Hon'ble Mr. Justice Siddique had retired on 



   29.5.2001 without giving any Inspection Report and he had 



   not   inspected   his   Court   during   the   year   at   all,   whereas 



   during the year 2001, three Judges had been appointed as 



   Inspecting   Judges   namely   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   Dalveer 



   Bhandari   (as   he   then   was),   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   Mukul 



   Mudgal   (as   he   then   was)   and   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   R.C. 



   Chopra, but the report for the year 2000 in his respect was 



   given   by   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   K.S.   Gupta   who   was   not  the 



   Inspecting   Judge   either   for   the   year   2000   or   for   the   year 



   2001   and   as   Hon'ble   Mr.   Justice   Gupta   had   visited   his 



   Court   on   7.9.2001   and   stayed   only   for   ten   minutes   and 



   asked   him   to   send   three   judgments   delivered   in   the   year 



   2000   which   were   sent   by   the   appellant   on   10.9.2001,   the 



   report given  by  Hon'ble  Mr.  Justice  Gupta  grading  him  as 



   an   average   officer   could   not   have   been   taken   into 



   consideration by the High Court while passing the order of 



                                                                           15



   compulsory   retirement.     It   was   further   pointed   out   on   his 



   behalf that Hon'ble Mr. Justice Gupta had observed in his 



   report   dated   11.9.2001   that   on   inquiry   from   the   cross 



   section of Bar, he had come to know that Mr. Gupta did not 



   enjoy   good   reputation   and   on  the   basis   of   this   report,   the 



   Full Court in its meeting held on 21.9.2001 had graded his 



   ACR   as   `C'   (integrity   doubtful)   without   supplying   the 



   material   to   him   and,   therefore,   order   retiring   him 



   compulsorily from service was bad in law.  



112.In reply to abovementioned contentions it was argued by 


   the learned counsel for the High Court that a single adverse 



   entry indicating that the integrity of the officer is doubtful 



   is sufficient to order his compulsory retirement, even if the 



   said adverse entry relates to a distant past and in respect 



   of all the three appellants the last ACR for the year 2000 is 



   C "integrity doubtful", which by itself is sufficient to sustain 



   orders of compulsory retirement passed against them. 



113.So far as Mr. M. S. Rohilla is concerned, it was submitted 


   by the learned counsel for the respondent High Court that 



                                                                           15



   there were two adverse ACR's for the years 1993 and 1994 



   indicating   that   his   integrity   was   doubtful   and   the 



   representations   made   by   him   against   the   same   were 



   considered   and   rejected,   which   decisions   were   not 



   challenged by him by way of a writ petition before the High 



   Court nor there was any challenge to the ACRs either in the 



   earlier   writ   petition   filed   by   him   challenging   his   reversion 



   from the Delhi Higher Judicial Service to the Delhi Judicial 



   Service   nor   in   the   writ   petition   challenging   the   order   of 



   compulsory   retirement   and,   therefore,   order   retiring   him 



   compulsorily cannot be regarded as illegal or arbitrary.  



114.While dealing with the arguments  advanced  on behalf  of 


   the   appellant   Mr.   P.D.   Gupta   it   was   stressed   that   for   two 



   years   i.e.   1994   and   1995   his   ACRs   were   C   "Integrity 



   Doubtful"   which   were   challenged   by   him   by   filing   a   Writ 



   Petition   and   though   the   learned   Single   Judge   of   the   High 



   Court had allowed the Writ Petition, the Division Bench in 



   appeal   had   set   aside   the   judgment   of   the   learned   Single 



   Judge and upheld the adverse ACRs "C Doubtful Integrity" 



                                                                          15


   for the years 1994 and 1995, against which Special  Leave 



   Petition   filed   by   Mr.   P.D.   Gupta   was   also   dismissed   after 



   which   Review   Petition   was   filed   by   him   against   the 



   judgment   of   the   Division   Bench   in   Letters   Patent   Appeal, 



   which   was   also   dismissed   and   thus   those   entries   having 



   become   final,   it   would   be   wrong   to   contend   that   order   of 



   compulsory  retirement  passed in his case was liable  to be 



   set aside.   





115.On consideration of rival submissions, this Court finds that 



   there   is   no   manner   of   doubt   that   the   nature   of   judicial 



   service is such that the High Court cannot afford to suffer 



   continuance   in   service   of   persons   of   doubtful   integrity. 



 
Therefore, in  High of Judicature at Bombay Through its 


   
Registrar  Vs.  Shirishkumar Rangrao Patil and Another
, 


   (1997)   6   SCC   339,   this   Court   emphasized   that   it   is 


   necessary   that   there   should   be   constant   vigil   by   the   High 



   Court   concerned   on   its   subordinate   judiciary   and   self 



   introspection.   It is well settled by a catena of decisions of 



   this Court that while considering the case of an officer as to 



                                                                        15



whether he should be continued in service or compulsorily 



retired,   his   entire   service   record   upto   that   date   on   which 



consideration is made has to be taken into account.   What 



weight should be attached to earlier entries as compared to 



recent   entries   is   a   matter   of   evaluation,   but   there   is   no 



manner of doubt that consideration has to be of the entire 



service   record.     The   fact   that   an   officer,   after   an   earlier 



adverse   entry,   was   promoted   does   not   wipe   out   earlier 



adverse   entry   at   all.     It   would   be   wrong   to   contend   that 



merely for the reason that after an earlier adverse entry an 



officer   was   promoted   that   by   itself   would   preclude   the 



authority from considering the earlier adverse entry.  When 



the law says that the entire service record has to be taken 



into consideration, the earlier adverse entry, which forms a 



part   of   the   service   record,   would   also   be   relevant 



irrespective   of   the   fact   whether   officer   concerned   was 



promoted   to   higher   position   or   whether   he   was   granted 



certain  benefits like increments  etc.
 
Therefore, this  Court 



in  
State
               of   Orissa  and
                                    Others
                                                Vs.  Ram   Chandra   Das
, 


(1996)   5   SCC   331,   observed   as   under   in   paragraph   7   of 



                                                                             15



   the reported decision :-




      "........   it   is   settled   law   that   the   Government   is 

      required to consider the entire record of service......

      ....   We   find   that   selfsame   material   after   promotion 

      may   not   be   taken   into   consideration   only   to   deny 

      him   further   promotion,   if   any.     But   that   material 

      undoubtedly would  be available  to  the  Government 

      to   consider   the   overall   expediency   or   necessity   to 

      continue the government servant in service after he 

      attained   the   required   length   of   service   or   qualified 

      period of service for pension."





116.Thus   the   respondent   High   Court   was   justified   in   taking 


   into   consideration   adverse   ACRs   reflecting   on   integrity   of 



   Mr. M.S. Rohilla for the years 1993, 1994 and 2000 while 



   considering   the   question   whether   it   was   expedient   to 



   continue   him   in   service   on   his   attaining   the   age   of   50 



   years.     Similarly,   in   so   far   as  appellant   Mr.   P.D.   Gupta   is 



   concerned for two years that is 1994 and again in 1995 his 



   ACRs   were   C   "Integrity   Doubtful"   and   again   in   the   year 



   2000,   the   position   was   the   same.     Further,   for   two   years, 



   i.e.,   1994   and   1995   his   ACRs   "C   Integrity   Doubtful"   were 



   upheld   by   the   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   against 



   which   his   Special   Leave   Petition   was   dismissed.     At   this 



                                                                            16



   stage   it   would   be   relevant   to   notice   certain   observations 



   made   by   Division   Bench   of   the   High   Court   while   allowing 



   the   Letters   Patent   Appeal   filed   by   the   High   Court   against 



   the   judgment   of   the   learned   Single   Judge   by   which   the 



   ACRs for two years were set aside, which are as follows: -  



     "To summarize, it is held: 





     a)     The   adverse   remarks   recorded   by   the   High 

            Court   in   the   Confidential   Reports   of 

            respondent  No.1  for  the years 1994 and 1995 

            were   not   without   any   `material'.     They   were 

            recorded   on   the   basis   of   material   on   record 

            and the  judgment  of the  learned  Single Judge 

            quashing those remarks is hereby set aside.  



     b)     The learned Single Judge should not and could 

            not have graded B+ to respondent No.1 as it is 

            the   function   of   the   High   Court   to   assign 

            appropriate   grading.     Therefore,   the   matter 

            should have been referred to the Full Court for 

            giving   appropriate   grading.     This   direction   of 

            the   learned   Single   Judge   is   accordingly   set 

            aside.  





     c)     Direction   of   the   learned   Single   Judge   in 

            treating   the   petitioner   as   promoted   w.e.f.   18th 

            May,   1996   is   not   correct   in   law   and   is 

            therefore, set aside."





117.The above findings would indicate that the appellant Mr. 


   Gupta is not justified in arguing that there was no material 



                                                                          16



   on   the   basis   of   which   adverse   entries   could   have   been 



   made   against   him   for   the   years   1994   and   1995   nor   is   he 



   justified in urging that the order of compulsory retirement 



   also  based on those  two  adverse  entries   is  liable  to  be  set 



   aside. 



118.In  S.D.   Singh  vs.  Jharkhand   High
   Court   through   R.G. 



   and   others  (2005)   13   SCC   737,   benefit   of   enhanced 


   retirement   age   from   58   to   60   years   was   denied   to   the 



   appellant.     The   Evaluation   Committee,   after   perusing   his 



   service   record,   recommended   that   he   should   not   be 



   continued in service beyond the age of 58 years.   The Full 



   Court,   on   assessment   and   evaluation   of   service   record, 



   resolved that the benefit of extension in age up to 60 years 



   should not be extended to him.   The appellant relied upon 



   his   promotional   order   superseding   several   senior   officers.




   However,   he   had   not   alleged   mala   fide   against   any   one. 



   The Evaluation Committee had, after considering his ACR, 



   noted   that   he   was   an   average   officer   and   the   vigilance 



   proceedings   initiated   against   him   were   dropped.     While 



                                                                         16



   dismissing   his   appeal,   this   Court   has   held   that   there   was 



   material, on the basis of which, an opinion was formed and 



   promotion   would   not   indicate   that   he   was   fit   to   be 



   continued   after   the   age   of   58   years.     The   material, 



   according to this Court, against the appellant 
in that case
, 



   was   that   he   was   an   average   officer   and   the   vigilance 



   proceedings initiated were  dropped.   If  on  these materials, 



   benefit   of   enhanced   retirement   was   denied   to   Mr.   S.D. 



   Singh,   this   Court   has   no   hesitation   in   concluding   that 



   having   regard   to   the   service   record   of   the   two   appellants 



   and   the   deceased   officer,   the   High   Court   was   justified   in 



   compulsorily retiring them from service.



119.The argument that material was not supplied on the basis 


   of   which   "`C'   Doubtful   Integrity"   was   awarded   to   the 



   appellants   and,   therefore,   the   order   of   compulsory 



   retirement   is   liable   to   be   set   aside   has   no   substance. 



   Normally   and   contextually   word   `material'   means 



   substance,   matter,   stuff,   something,   materiality,   medium, 



   data, facts, information, figures, notes etc. When this Court 



                                                                           16



   is examining as to whether there was any `material' before 



   the High Court on the basis of which adverse remarks were 



   recorded   in   the   confidential   reports   of   the   appellants,   this 



   `material'   relates   to   substance,   matter,   data,   information 



   etc.  While considering the case of a judicial officer it is not 



   necessary to limit the `material' only to written complaints 



   or `tangible' evidence  pointing finger at the  integrity of  the 



   judicial officer.   Such an evidence may not be forthcoming 



   in such cases.  



120.As   observed   by   this   Court   in  
R.L.   Butail  Vs.  Union   of 



   India and Others
, (1970) 2 SCC 876, it is not necessary 


   that an opportunity of being heard before recording adverse 



   entry   should   be   afforded   to   the   officer   concerned.     In   the 



   said   case,   the   contention   that   an   inquiry   would   be 



   necessary before an adverse entry is made was rejected as 



   suffering   from   a   misapprehension   that   such   an   entry 



   amounts to the penalty of censure.   It is explained by this 



   Court in 
the said decision
 that making of an adverse entry 



   is   not   equivalent   to   imposition   of   a   penalty   which   would 



                                                                           16



   necessitate an enquiry or giving of a reasonable opportunity 



   of   being   heard   to   the   concerned   Government   servant.




   Further   in   case   where   the   Full   Court   of   the   High   Court 



   recommends compulsory retirement of an officer, the High 



   Court on the judicial side has to exercise great caution and 



   circumspection   in   setting   aside   that   order   because   it   is   a 



   complement of all the judges of the High Court who go into 



   the   question   and   it   is   possible   that   in   all   cases   evidence 



   would   not   be   forth   coming   about   doubtful   integrity   of   a 



   Judicial Officer.  



121.As   observed   by   this   Court   in  High   Court   of   Punjab   & 



   Haryana   through   R.G.  Vs.  Ishwar   Chand   Jain   and 


   Another,  (1999) 4 SCC 579,  at times, the Full Court has 


   to act on the collective wisdom of all the Judges and if the 



   general reputation of an employee is not good, though there 



   may   not   be   any   tangible   material   against   him,   he   may   be 



   given compulsory retirement in public interest and judicial 



   review of such order is permissible only on limited grounds. 



   The   reputation   of   being   corrupt   would   gather   thick   and 



                                                                           16



   unchaseable   clouds   around   the   conduct   of   an   officer   and 



   gain   notoriety   much   faster   than   the   smoke.     Sometimes 



   there may not be concrete or material  evidence to make it 



   part of the record.  It would, therefore, be impracticable for 



   the   reporting   officer   or   the   competent   controlling   officer 



   writing   the   confidential   report   to   give   specific   instances   of 



   shortfalls, supported by evidence. 



122.Normally,   the   adverse   entry   reflecting   on   the   integrity 


   would   be   based   on   formulations   of   impressions   which 



   would  be  result  of  multiple  factors  simultaneously   playing 



   in the mind.  Though the perceptions may differ in the very 



   nature   of   things   there   is   a   difficulty   nearing   an 



   impossibility   in   subjecting   the   entries   in   the   confidential 



   rolls   to   judicial   review.     Sometimes,   if   the   general 



   reputation   of   an   employee   is   not   good   though   there   may 



   not   be   any   tangible   material   against   him,   he   may   be 



   compulsorily retired in public interest.   The duty conferred 



   on   the   appropriate   authority   to   consider   the   question   of 



   continuance of a judicial officer beyond a particular age is 



                                                                            16



   an   absolute   one.     If   that   authority   bona   fide   forms   an 



   opinion that the integrity of a particular officer is doubtful, 



   the correctness of that opinion cannot be challenged before 



   courts.     When   such   a   constitutional   function   is   exercised 



   on   the   administrative   side   of   the   High   Court,   any   judicial 



   review   thereon   should   be   made   only   with   great   care   and 



   circumspection   and   it   must   be   confined   strictly   to   the 



   parameters set by this Court in several reported decisions. 



   When   the   appropriate   authority   forms   bona   fide   opinion 



   that compulsory retirement of a judicial officer is in public 



   interest,   the   writ   Court   under   
Article   226
   or   this   Court 



   under 
Article 32
 would not interfere with the order.  



123.Further this Court in  
M.S. Bindra
's  case (Supra) has used 



   the   phrase   `preponderance   of   probability'   to   be   applied 



   before   recording   adverse   entry   regarding   integrity   of   a 



   judicial   officer.     There   is   no   manner   of   doubt   that   the 



   authority   which   is   entrusted   with   a   duty   of   writing   ACR 



   does   not   have   right   to   tarnish   the   reputation   of   a   judicial 



   officer   without   any   basis   and   without   any   `material'   on 



                                                                        16



record,   but   at   the   same   time   other   equally   important 



interest   is   also   to   be   safeguarded   i.e.   ensuring   that   the 



corruption   does   not   creep   in   judicial   services   and   all 



possible attempts must be made to remove such a virus so 



that   it   should   not   spread   and   become   infectious.     When 



even   verbal   repeated   complaints   are   received   against   a 



judicial   officer   or   on   enquiries,   discreet   or   otherwise,   the 



general   impression   created   in   the   minds   of   those   making 



inquiries or the Full Court is that concerned judicial officer 



does   not  carry   good   reputation,   such   discreet   inquiry   and 



or verbal repeated complaints would constitute material on 



the basis of which ACR indicating that the integrity of the 



officer   is   doubtful   can   be   recorded.     While   undertaking 



judicial   review,   the   Court   in   an   appropriate   case   may   still 



quash the decision of the Full Court on administrative side 



if it is found that there is no basis or material on which the 



ACR   of   the   judicial   officer   was   recorded,   but   while 



undertaking   this   exercise   of   judicial   review   and   trying   to 



find out whether there is any material on record or not, it is 



the   duty   of   the   Court   to   keep   in   mind   the   nature   of 



                                                                             16



   function   being   discharged   by   the   judicial   officer,   the 



   delicate nature of the exercise to be performed by the High 



   Court  on  administrative  side  while   recording  the   ACR  and 



   the mechanism/system adopted in recording such ACR.




124.From   the   admitted   facts   noted   earlier   it   is   evident   that 


   there was first a report of the Inspecting Judge to the effect 



   that   he   had   received   complaints   against   the   appellants 



   reflecting   on   their   integrity.     It   would   not   be   correct   to 



   presume   that   the   Inspecting   Judge   had   written   those 



   remarks   in   a   casual   or   whimsical   manner.     It   has   to   be 



   legitimately   presumed   that   the   Inspecting   Judge,   before 



   making such remarks of serious nature, acted responsibly. 



   Thereafter,   the   Full   Court   considered   the   entire   issue   and 



   endorsed  the view of the  Inspecting Judge while  recording 



   the   ACR   of   the   appellants.     It   is   a   matter   of   common 



   knowledge   that   the   complaints   which   are   made   against   a 



   judicial   officer,   orally   or   in   writing   are   dealt   with   by   the 



   Inspecting   Judge   or   the   High   Court   with   great   caution. 



   Knowing that most of such complaints are frivolous and by 



                                                                        16



disgruntled   elements,   there   is   generally   a   tendency   to 



discard   them.     However,   when   the   suspicion   arises 



regarding integrity of a judicial officer, whether on the basis 



of   complaints   or   information   received   from   other   sources 



and   a   committee   is   formed   to   look   into   the   same,   as   was 



done in the instant case and the committee undertakes the 



task by gathering information from various sources as are 



available to it, on the basis of which a perception about the 



concerned judicial officer is formed, it would be difficult for 



the Court either under 
Article 226
 or for this Court under 




Article   32
   to   interfere   with   such   an   exercise.     Such   an 



opinion   and   impression   formed   consciously   and   rationally 



after   the   enquiries   of   the   nature   mentioned   above   would 



definitely constitute material for recording adverse report in 



respect   of   an   officer.     Such   an   impression   is   not   readily 



formed   but   after   Court's   circumspection,   deliberation,   etc. 



and   thus   it   is   a   case   of   preponderance   of   probability   for 



entertaining a doubt about  integrity  of an  official  which  is 



based on substance, matter, information etc. Therefore, the 



contention   that   without   material   or   basis   the   adverse 



                                                                         17



   entries were recorded in the ACR of the appellants cannot 



   be upheld and is hereby rejected.               



125.On behalf of deceased R.S. Verma his learned Counsel had 



   argued that ACRs for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were 



   written   in  one  go  which   is  arbitrary   and  constitute   malice 



   in   law.     Pointing   out   to   the   Court   that   normal   procedure 



   followed   by   the   Delhi   High   Court   for   communicating   the 



   ACRs   is   referred   to   in   the   circular   dated   4.9.1998, 



   according to which conducting of inspection and making of 



   enquiries   before   condemning   a   judicial   officer   as   regards 



   his integrity is necessary, but this was not done in the case 



   of   the   deceased   and,   therefore,   his   ACRs   for   the   years 



   1997,   1998   and   1999   should   have   been   ignored   while 



   deciding the question whether  he  was fit to be retained  in 



   service on attaining the age of 50 years.  It was emphasized 



   that   all   the   entries   should   be   communicated   within   a 



   reasonable  period  so  that  the  employee   concerned   gets  an 



   opportunity   to   make   representation   and   that   the 



   representation   is   also   decided   fairly   within   a   reasonable 



                                                                        17



period,   but   this   was   not  done   in   the   case   of  the   deceased 



officer.   According to the learned counsel for the appellant, 



the   requirement   to   write   ACR   on   due   date   and 



communication   thereof   to   the   employee   concerned   within 



reasonable   time   flows   from   constitutional   obligation   of 



fairness, non-arbitrariness and natural justice as 
laid down 



in
 
Dev   Dutt  Vs.  Union   of   India
,   2008   (
8)  SCC   725,   and 


Abhijit   Ghosh   Dastidar  Vs.  Union   of   India
,   2009   (16) 


SCC 146,  and as this requirement  was committed  breach 


of   in   case   of   the   deceased,   ACRs   for   the   years   1996   and 



1997   had   lost   their   significance   and   were   irrelevant   while 



considering   case   of   the   deceased   officer   for   compulsory 



retirement.  On behalf of the respondent High Court it was 



submitted   that   it   was   true   that   ACRs   for   the   years   1997, 



1998   and   1999   were   recorded   at   one   point   and 



communicated thereafter, but a detailed note indicating the 



circumstances in which ACRs for the years 1997, 1998 and 



1999 were placed before the Full Court on 13.12.2000 after 



which   ACRs   were   recorded   and,   therefore,   in   view   of   the 



explanation offered in the note which was noted by the Full 



                                                                           17



   Court on 13.12.2000, it is wrong to contend that ACRs for 



   those   three   years   could   not   have   been   taken   into 



   consideration   before   passing   order   of   compulsory 



   retirement against the deceased officer.




126.On consideration of the argument advanced by the learned 



   counsel   for   the   parties,   this   Court   finds   that   it   has   been 



   ruled by this Court that ACRs for several years should not 



   be   recorded   at   one   go   and   communicated   thereafter. 



   Normally,   entries   in   confidential   records   should   be   made 



   within a specified time soon following the end of the period 



   under   review   and   generally   within   three   months   from   the 



   end   of   the   year.     Delay   in   carrying   out   inspections   or 



   making   entries   frustrates   the   very   purpose   sought   to   be 



   achieved.     The   mental   impressions   may   fade   away   or   get 



   embellished.     Events   of   succeeding   years   may   cast   their 



   shadow on assessment of previous years.   In a given case, 



   proper   inspection   might   not   have   been   conducted   nor 



   notes/findings   of   inspection   might   have   been   properly 



   maintained.   In such a case, there is every possibility of a 



                                                                        17



judicial officer  being  condemned  arbitrarily  for no fault  on 



his part.   Therefore, recording of entries for more than one 



year,   later   on,   at   the   same   time   should   be   avoided. 



However, the learned counsel for the respondent is right in 



contending that no decision has taken the view that merely 



for   the   reason   that   ACRs   for   more   than   one   years   are 



recorded at one point of time, the same are bad or that they 



would cease to be ACRs for the relevant years or that they 



should not be taken into consideration for any purpose or 



for   the   purpose   of   compulsory   retirement.     As   stated 



earlier, in the normal course it would not be appropriate to 



record   the   ACRs   of   number   of   years   at   one   point   of   time. 



However, at the same time it is not possible to lay down as 



an   absolute   proposition   of   law   that   irrespective   of   good, 



cogent,   plausible   and   acceptable   reasons,   recording   of 



ACRs   of   number   of   years   at   once   should   always   be 



regarded   as   illegal   and   bad   for   all   purposes.     This   Court, 



while deciding the appeals, has gone through the record of 



the   deceased   officer,   and   other   relevant   documents 



produced by the High Court.   From the record, this Court 



                                                                     17



finds that all the columns of ACR forms for the years 1997, 



1998   and   1999   were   filled   up   by   the   inspecting   judges 



respectively   well   in   time   for   all   these   years,   but   the 



inspecting   judges   had   not   recorded   any   remarks 



concerning   the   judicial   reputation   for   honesty   and 



impartiality   of   the   deceased   officer   as   a   corollary   the 



column   regarding  "Net   Result"   for   these   years   were   left 



blank by them.   Instead the learned inspecting judges had 



observed that these remarks be recorded by the Full Court. 



When   such   a   course   of   action   is   adopted,   the   reason   is 



obvious.     There   was   something   amiss   in   the   estimation   of 



the   learned   inspecting   Judges   which   they   wanted   entire 



Full   Court   to   consider   and,   therefore,   refrained   from 



making their observations.  If everything had been all right, 



nothing   prevented   the   learned   Inspecting   Judges   from 



mentioning that the honesty of the deceased officer was not 



in   doubt   at   all.     However,   when   an   inspecting   judge 



receives certain complaints about the integrity of the officer 



concerned but has no means to verify the same, he leaves 



the matter to the Full Court, which appoints a Committee 



                                                                        17



  to   go   into   the   aspects   and   records   relevant   entries   after 



  report of the Committee is received.   This is what precisely 



  happened   in   the   present   case   as   well.     Because   of   the 



  aforesaid course adopted by the learned Inspecting Judges, 



  the consideration of recording the ACR was deferred by the 



  Full Court and ultimately, in its meeting held on 21.4.2001 



  in respect of the deceased officer the Full Court decided as 



  under :- 



    "Deferred.  Referred to the Committee constituted to 

    look   into   the   allegations   against   the   judicial 

    Officers."





127.The matter was, therefore, examined by the Committee of 


  two learned judges of the Delhi High Court constituted for 



  this   purpose.     This   committee   made   certain   discreet 



  inquiries.     The   concerned   Inspecting   Judge(s)   were   also 



  associated   in   deliberations   by   the   Committee.     The 



  Committee   gave   its   report   dated   6.12.2001   as   per   which 



  the   information   gathered   by   the   Committee   from   various 



  sources   confirmed   the   allegation   of   doubtful   integrity 



  against   the   deceased   officer.     The   matter   was   thereafter 



                                                                           17



placed before the Full Court and the ACRs of the deceased 



officer were recorded for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 on 



13.12.2000.     Thus   there   is   sufficient   explanation   for 



recording the ACRs of three years at one time.   It is wrong 



to   contend   that   the   ACRs   for   the   years   1997,   1998   and 



1999 should have been ignored  while passing the order of 



compulsory   retirement   against   the   deceased   officer. 



Therefore,   the   argument   that   ACRs   for   those   years   could 



not  have  been  taken   into  consideration   while  deciding   the 



question   of   suitability   or   otherwise   to   continue   the 



deceased officer in service on attaining the age of 50 years, 



is   hereby   rejected.     Even   if   it   is   assumed   for   the   sake   of 



argument   that   ACRs   recorded   for   the   three   years,   i.e., 



1997,   1998   and   1999   recorded   at   one   go,   irrespective   of 



reasons,   good,   bad   or   indifferent,   must   be   ignored   for   all 



time to come and for all the purposes, this Court finds that 



the ACRs for the year 1999 were recorded with promptitude 



and without any delay in the year 2000.  It is not argued on 



behalf   of   the   deceased   officer   that   there   was   any   delay   in 



recording ACRs for the year 1999.   For the year 1999, the 



                                                                           17



   deceased   officer   was   assessed   as   "C   Below   Average".     The 



   ACRs   for   the   year   1999   could   have   been   taken   into 



   consideration   while   assessing   the   service   record   of   the 



   deceased   officer   for   determining   the   question   whether   the 



   deceased   officer   was   fit   to   be   continued   in   service   on   his 



   attaining the age of 50 years.  What is the effect of ACRs for 



   the   year   1999   when   taken   into   consideration   along   with 



   other service record is proposed to be considered at a little 



   later stage.



128.On   behalf   of   deceased   officer   Mr.   R.S.   Verma,   it   was 


   argued   that   Mr.   Verma's   ACRs   for   the   years   1997,   1998 



   and   1999,   which   were   written   at   one   go   and   also   were 



   communicated   at   one   go,   suffer   from   arbitrariness, 



   unreasonableness and constitute malice in law.  This Court 



   has   come   to   the   conclusion   that   writing   of   ACRs   for   the 



   years   1997,   1998   and   1999   at   one   time   as   also 



   communication of the same at one time was justified in the 



   circumstances   of   the   case.     Therefore,   it   is   difficult   to 



   uphold   the   contention   raised   on   behalf   of   Mr.   Verma   that 



                                                                           17



   writing   of   ACRs   for   three   years   at   one   go   and 



   communication   of   the   same   at   one   go   suffer   from 



   arbitrariness,   unreasonableness   and   constitute   malice   in 



   law.



129.Similarly,   the   plea   raised   by   Mr.   Rohilla   that   the 


   impugned judgment  is  not  sustainable   in  law  because  the 



   act   of   the   High   Court   in   making   recommendation   to   Lt. 



   Governor for retiring him compulsorily emanates from mala 



   fide,   arbitrariness   and   perversity,   has   no   substance.     The 



   reason   given   by   Mr.   Rohilla   to   treat   the   order   of   his 



   compulsory retirement as mala fide, arbitrary and perverse 



   is  that  while  communicating  adverse  remarks  for   the   year 



   2000   vide  letter  dated  21.9.2001,   High  Court  had   granted 



   six   weeks'   time   to   make   representation,   but   much   before 



   the   representation   could   be   caused,   the   order   of 



   compulsory           retirement         dated         27.9.2001         was 



   communicated, coupled with the fact that on that date, the 



   writ petition filed by him against his reversion was pending. 



   This Court has already taken the view that merely because 



                                                                           17



    Mr.   Rohilla   did   not   get   any   opportunity   to   make 



    representation   against   the   adverse   remarks   for   the   year 



    2000,   those   remarks   could   not   have   been   ignored   by   the 



    competent authority while passing the order of compulsory 



    retirement against him because the settled law is that even 



    uncommunicated   adverse   remarks   can   be   taken   into 



    consideration   while   passing   the   order   of   compulsory 



    retirement.   So far as the writ petition, filed by Mr. Rohilla 



    against his reversion is concerned, this Court finds that the 



    order   of   compulsory   retirement   was   not   passed   to   render 



    the   said   petition   infructuous.     The   order   of   compulsory 



    retirement has been passed on assessment of whole service 



    record   of   Mr.   Rohilla.     Thus,   Mr.   Rohilla   has   failed   to 



    substantiate   the   plea   that   the   order   of   his   compulsory 



    retirement is either mala fide or arbitrary or perverse.



130.Mr.   R.   S.   Rohilla   had   argued   that   the   order   of   the   Lt. 



    Governor   compulsorily   retiring   him   from   service   was   by 



    invoking   FR  56(j)   which   was   not  applicable   to   his  case   as 



    he   was   a   member   of   a   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   and 



                                                                        18



such an order could have been passed only under Rule 27 



of   the   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service   read   with   Rule   16   of 



the Indian Administrative Services and, therefore, the same 



should be set aside.  It is rightly pointed out by the learned 



counsel   for   the   High   Court   that  though   the   said   plea   was 



raised   by   Mr.   Rohilla   the   same   was   given   up   before   the 



High Court, and it is so recorded by the Division Bench in 



paragraph 31 of the impugned  judgment. Thus, in normal 



circumstances,   Mr.   Rohilla   would   not   be   justified   in 



arguing the same point before this Court.  However, even if 



it is taken for granted that he is entitled to argue the point 



before this Court because it is a pure question of law, this 



Court   does   not   find   any   substance   what   so   ever   in   the 



same.  What is relevant to be noticed is that under both the 



Rules there is power to compulsorily retire a judicial officer 



after   he   attains   the   age   of   50   years   in   public   interest. 



Therefore, whether  the Lt. Governor had invoked FR 56 (j) 



or Rule 27 of the DJS is of little consequence since both the 



Rules   make   provision   for   retirement   of   a   judicial   officer 



compulsorily   from   service   after   he   attains   the   age   of   50 



                                                                                18



   years   in   public   interest.     In   fact   Mr.   Rohilla   should   have 



   pointed out to the High Court the relevant and material fact 



   that for two years that is for the year 1993 and for the year 



   1994  he  had  suffered  adverse  ACR  `C'  "Integrity  Doubtful" 



   and   that   the   representations   made   by   him   were   rejected 



   which were not challenged by him before higher forum.   In 



   any   view   of   the   matter,   it   is   settled   law   that   when   power 



   can  be traced to a  valid  source, the fact that  the power is 



   purported to have been exercised under a wrong provision 



   of law, would not invalidate exercise of power.





131.To sum up, this Court finds that so far as deceased officer 


   Mr. Rajinder Singh Verma is concerned, he was appointed 



   in   the   year   1995   and   as   on   21.9.2001   his   ACRs   for   six 



   years   were   available.     The   grading   given   to   him   for   these 



   years was as follows: -



        Year                                     Grading

        1995                "B" (Average)        No   representation   was 

                                                 made           against         this 

                                                 remark,   nor   was   it 

                                                 challenged   before   any 

                                                 authority.

        1996                "B" (Average)        No   representation   was 



                                                                              18



                                                made          against         this 

                                                remark,   nor   was   it 

                                                challenged   before   any 

                                                authority.

        1997              "C" (Below Average)



        1998              "C" (Below Average)



        1999              "C" (Below Average)



        2000              "C" (Integrity doubtful)






132.The   report   dated   September   21,   2001   of   the   Screening 


   Committee   further   reveals   that   the   Screening   Committee 



   had  considered   the   entire   record   relevant  to   his   work  and 



   conduct and found that throughout his career, he had been 



   assessed   and   graded   either   as   "average   officer"   or   "officer 



   below   average"   and   in   the   year   2000,   his   integrity   was 



   found   to   be   doubtful.     The   Screening   Committee   had   also 



   found   that   for   the   year   1998,   the   Inspecting   Judge   of   Mr. 



   Verma had made a remark that the judgments and orders 



   written   by   him   were   just   average;   whereas   the   Inspecting 



   Judges   for   the   year   1996   to   2000   had   not   recorded   any 



   remark  concerning   his   judicial   reputation  for   honesty   and 



                                                                        18



impartiality   and   the   column   "Net   Result"   was   left   to   be 



recorded by the Full Court.   The record further shows that 



the judicial work was withdrawn from him with effect from 



December   8,   2000   upon   the   recommendation   of   the 



Committee of Judges in its report dated December 6, 2000. 



This   decision   was   never   challenged   by   him   before   any 



authority.     It   goes   without   saying   that   withdrawal   of 



judicial work from a judicial officer is a serious matter and 



such   a   drastic   order   would   not   have   been   passed   unless 



the   judicial   work   performed   by   him   was   found   to   be 



shocking   and   perverse.     Later   on,   all   work   including 



administrative   work   was   withdrawn   from   him.     Further, 



pursuant   to   the   decision   taken   by   the   Full   Court   in   its 



meeting   held   on   April   21,   2001   referring   the   matter   to   a 



Committee   of   Judges   to   make   inquiry   into   his   work   and 



conduct,   the   Committee   had   submitted   its   report   dated 



September 8, 2001 in which it was observed and recorded 



that he did not enjoy good reputation and integrity.   There 



was   gradual   down   fall   in   his   performance   as   a   judicial 



officer.     The   service   record   of   the   deceased   officer   is   so 



                                                                      18



   glaring   that   on   the   basis   thereof   any   prudent   authority 



   could have come to a reasonable conclusion that it was not 



   in the public interest to continue him in service and that he 



   should be compulsorily retired from service.  Therefore, the 



   order   of   compulsory   retirement   passed   against   the 



   deceased officer is not liable to be set aside.



133.So far as Mr. Rohilla is concerned, he was appointed as a 


   Civil/Sub-Judge   in   the   Subordinate   Judicial   Services   on 



   May 5, 1972.   On June 17, 1995, he was confirmed as an 



   officer   in   the   Delhi   Judicial   Services.     He   was   granted 



   Selection Grade on June 3, 1980 and was promoted to the 



   Higher Judicial Services as Additional District and Sessions 



   Judge   on   November   1,   1989.     One   anonymous   complaint 



   was received  against  him  and  after   looking  into  the   same, 



   he   was   reverted  to   Subordinate   Judicial   Services   by   order 



   dated February 15, 1995, which was challenged by him in 



   Writ Petition No. 4589 of 1995.   Meanwhile, he was served 



   with a communication from the High Court of Delhi dated 



   October 23, 1997, wherein his ACR for the year 1996 was 



                                                                         18



graded   as   "C",   i.e.,   below   average.     Thereupon,   he   had 



made a representation, which was rejected on December 2, 



1998.     No   steps   were   taken   by   him   to   challenge   
the   said 



decision
   and   thus,   the   grading   awarded   to   him   was 



accepted by him.  Thereafter, he received a communication 



from   the   High   Court   in   the   year   1999,   wherein   he   was 



informed   that   in   his   ACR   for   the   year   1997,   he   was 



awarded   "B"   grade.     Again,   by   a   communication   dated 



February   9,   2000   forwarded   by   the   High   Court,   he   was 



informed that in his ACR for the year 1998, he was graded 



"B".  He made a representation against his ACR for the year 



1998 in the year 2000.  As noticed earlier, in the year 2000, 



he was communicated ACR indicating that his integrity was 



doubtful.   Thus, the service record of Mr. Rohilla indicates 



that   he   was   an   officer   "below   average"   or   at   the   best   an 



average   officer   and   his   integrity   was   doubtful.     Under   the 



circumstances,   the   decision   taken   by   the   competent 



authority   to   retire   him   from   service   cannot   be   said   to   be 



illegal in any manner whatsoever.



                                                                        18


134.So   also,   the   record   of   Mr.   P.D.   Gupta   shows   that   he 


   joined   Delhi   Judicial   Service   on   January   28,   1978. 



   Admittedly,  his  work and  conduct from  1978 to  1992  was 



   graded as "B", which means his performance was that of an 



   average officer.  In the year 1995, the Inspecting Judge had 



   reported that though he had not inspected the court of Mr. 



   Gupta,   he   had   heard   complaints   about   his   integrity   and, 



   therefore, column Nos. 6 and 7 were left blank to be filled 



   up by the Full Court.  On May 18, 1986, the Full Court had  



   recorded   his   ACR   for   the   year   1994-95   as   "C"   (integrity 



   doubtful)  and  on  the   basis   of  the   same,   denied   promotion 



   to him.  He had filed a representation against the same, but 



   it   was   rejected   by   the   High   Court   by   an   order   dated 



   September 5, 1997.  Again on September 26, 1997, the Full 



   Court   of   Delhi   High   Court   had   recorded   his   ACR   for   the 



   year   1996   as  "B".     Against   rejection  of   his  representation, 



   which was made with reference to ACRs for the year 1994-



   95, he had filed  Writ  Petition (C) No. 4334 of 1997 and in 



   the said writ petition he had made a grievance for his non-



   promotion   to   Delhi   Higher   Judicial   Service.     Pending   the 



                                                                            18



   said petition, on May 22, 1998, the Full Court had recorded 



   his ACR for the year 1997 as "B".  The writ petition filed by 



   Mr.   Gupta   was   allowed   by   a   Single   Judge   of   the   High 



   Court,   which   decision   was   set   aside   in   L.P.A.   No.   329   of 



   1999, filed by the High Court administration, and the order 



   passed by the Division Bench was ultimately upheld by this 



   Court   when   the   special   leave   petition   filed   by   Mr.   Gupta 



   against the decision rendered in the L.P.A. was dismissed. 



   In   his   ACR   for   the   year   2000,   he   was   categorized   as   an 



   officer   having   doubtful   integrity.     Thus,   the   record   shows 



   that  for   the  year   1994-95  his   integrity   was  found   to   be  of 



   doubtful character.   For rest of the years, his performance 



   was   that   of   an   average   officer   and   in   the   year   2000,   his 



   integrity   was   again   found   doubtful.                   Under   the 



   circumstances,   the   compulsory   retirement   of   Mr.   Gupta 



   can never be said to be arbitrary or illegal.  



135.Having   regard   to   their   entire   service   record   of   the   three 


   officers,   this   Court   is   of   the   opinion   that   the   competent 



   authority   was   justified   in   passing   the   order   retiring   them 



                                                                        18



compulsorily from service.   Mere glance at the ACRs of the 



deceased   officer   and   two   other   appellants   makes   it   so 



glaring   that   on   the   basis   thereof   the   decision   to 



compulsorily retire them  would clearly be without blemish 



and   will   have   to   be   treated   as   well   founded.     This   Court 



finds   that   before   passing   the   orders   in   question,   whole 



service   record   of   each   of   the   officer   was   taken   into 



consideration.          Keeping   in   view   the   comprehensive 



assessment   of   service   record,   the   Screening   Committee 



rightly   recommended   that   the   three   officers   should   be 



prematurely   retired   in   public   interest   forthwith.     The   Full 



Court   after   considering   the   report   of   the   Screening 



Committee   and   also   after   taking   into   consideration   the 



record of work and conduct, general reputation and service 



record   of   the   three   officers   correctly   resolved   that   it   be 



recommended to the Lt. Governor of NCT of Delhi to retire 



the judicial officers forthwith in public interest.  The orders 



do   not   entail   any   punishment   in   the   sense   that   all   the 



officers   have   been   paid   retiral   benefits   till   they   were 



compulsorily retired from service.  



                                                                             18


136.On a careful consideration of the entire material, it must 


   be   held   that   the   evaluation   made   by   the   Committee/Full 



   Court,   forming   their   unanimous   opinion,   is   neither   so 



   arbitrary nor capricious nor can be said to be so irrational, 



   so   as   to   shock   the   conscience   of   this   Court   to   warrant   or 



   justify   any   interference.     In   cases   of   such   assessment, 



   evaluation   and   formulation   of   opinions,   a   vast   range   of 



   multiple factors play a vital and important role and no one 



   factor   should   be   allowed   to   be   blown   out   of   proportion 



   either   to   decry   or   deify   an   issue   to   be   resolved   or   claims 



   sought to be considered or asserted.   In the very nature of 



   things, it would be difficult, nearing almost an impossibility 



   to   subject   such   exercise   undertaken   by   the   Full   Court,   to 



   judicial   review   except   in   an   extraordinary   case   when   the 



   Court   is   convinced   that   some   real   injustice,   which   ought 



   not   to   have   taken   place,   has   really   happened   and   not 



   merely   because   there   could   be   another   possible   view   or 



   someone   has   some   grievance   about   the   exercise 



   undertaken   by   the   Committee/Full   Court.     Viewed   thus, 



   and considered in the background of the factual details and 



                                                                         19



  materials   on   record,   there   is   absolutely   no   need   or 



  justification   for   this   Court   to   interfere   with   the   impugned 



  proceedings.     Therefore,   the   three   appeals   fail   and   are 



  dismissed.     Having   regard   to   the   facts   of   the   case,   there 



  shall be no order as to costs.
