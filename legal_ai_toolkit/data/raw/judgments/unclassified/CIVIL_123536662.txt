                           (PER : HONOURABLE MS. JUSTICE SANGEETA K. VISHEN)


                      1.       Captioned civil application no.3285 of 2024 is for seeking
                      leave to file appeal challenging the order as well as consent decree,
                      both dated 11.02.2023 passed by the learned 26th Additional Senior
                      Civil Judge, Vadodara in Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022. Similarly,
                      in civil application no.3288 of 2024, the applicant is seeking leave to
                      file appeal to challenge the order dated 21.01.2023 passed below




                                                                   Page 1 of 22

                            C/CA/3285/2024                                            JUDGMENT DATED: 16/01/2025

                                                                                                                        undefined




                      Exhibit 1 so also the decree of the same date by the learned
                      Additional Senior Civil Judge, Vadodara in Special Civil Suit no.11 of
                      2023. Since both the applications are connected, parties being
                      common so also the issue, they are being disposed of by this
                      common oral judgment. Parties have been referred to as per their
                      status in civil application no.3285 of 2024.



                      2.       Mr Archit P. Jani, learned advocate appearing for the applicant,
                      submitted        that    the    applicant          has      Agreement      to    Sell     dated
                      17.03.2022 in his favour, executed by the respondents, except
                      respondent no.10. It is submitted that Special Civil Suit no.277 of
                      2022 was filed by the respondents against the respondent no.10,
                      seeking cancellation of the alleged Agreement to Sell executed on
                      01.01.2013, only with a view to nullifying the rights of the applicant.
                      Another Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2022 was filed by the respondent
                      no.10 seeking specific performance of the said Agreement to Sell
                      dated 01.01.2013 against the rest of the respondents.



                      2.1      It is submitted that it is surprising to note that the Special Civil
                      Suit no.11 of 2023 was filed on 11.01.2023 and respondent no.9
                      appeared on 13.01.2023 on his behalf and on behalf of the others
                      and immediately within a span of 10 days i.e. on 21.01.2023, it was
                      disposed of on the ground of settlement. Similarly, the Special Civil
                      Suit no.277 of 2022 was disposed of on 11.02.2023. It is further
                      submitted that the applicant was not made party in any of the suits
                      filed by the respondents individually or jointly.



                      2.2      It is next submitted that respondent no.9 preferred a Special
                      Civil Suit no.14 of 2023 seeking cancellation of the registered
                      Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022; however, subsequently, on
                      14.07.2023 it came to be withdrawn simplicitor. It is submitted that
                      the details of the suits and the Agreement to Sell were missing;
                      however, the suit was withdrawn with an assurance that the sale

                                                                                                                       NEUTRAL CITATION

                                                                                                                       undefined




                      deed would be executed in favour of the applicant.



                      2.3      It is submitted that after the passing of the consent decree,
                      Execution Petition was filed and as a result, on 08.04.2023, order
                      has been passed by the learned Additional Senior Civil Judge
                      appointing the Court Commissioner. It is thereafter, that the
                      registered        sale    deeds      have         been      executed     by     the      Court
                      Commissioner. It is submitted that the applicant having no option
                      had to file a Special Civil Suit no.299 of 2023 seeking specific
                      performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 and is
                      pending. It is submitted that the applicant is severely prejudiced by
                      the consent decree inasmuch as, it had paid consideration of Rs.50
                      lacs and when there is a registered Agreement to Sell coupled with
                      the consideration, the respondents i.e. original owners have no
                      option but to execute sale deed in his favour.



                      2.4      It is submitted that it is also not in dispute that at the time of
                      execution of the registered Agreement to Sell, there were no civil
                      cases pending by the original owners or against the original owners.
                      So far as the so called Agreement to Sell dated 01.01.2013 in favour
                      of the respondent no.10 is concerned, the same also creates a
                      doubt inasmuch as, for almost 10 years, no steps were taken and
                      only in the years 2022 and 2023, the suit proceedings were
                      initiated. It is submitted that the suits were filed only with a view to
                      seeing that the rights of the applicant is prejudiced. Surreptitious
                      filing of the suits by the respondents, inter se, was nothing but an
                      abuse of process of law.

                                                                                                                    undefined

                      of compromise and is aggrieved by the decree passed by the Court
                      under 
Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908
                      (hereinafter referred to as "the Code"), the remedy available to him
                      is to either approach very same Court seeking review or to file an
                      appeal with the leave of the Court under the provisions of sub-
                      section (1) of 
Section 96
 of the Code. It is submitted that while
                      summarizing, the Full Bench, has held and observed that if the
                      aggrieved party was not the party to the suit, the remedy available
                      to him, to challenge the decree passed by the Court on the basis of
                      the compromise between the parties to the suit (consent decree),
                      would be to file an appeal under sub-section (1) of 
Section 96
 of the
                      Code with the leave of the appellate court or to file a review
                      application before the Court which passed the decree, as may be
                      permissible under 
Section 114
 read with Order 43 of the Code. It is
                      therefore submitted that the remedy available to the applicant, is to
                      challenge the compromise deed, after seeking the leave of this
                      Court. It is submitted that the option to file suit, is not available.


Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of 
Praash Robin
                      Nayudu vs. Rev. Imanuel S. Kant
 reported in 2023 (2) GLR 1319.

                      consent decree, to challenge the compromise decree on the ground
                      that the decree was not lawful, has to approach the same Court
                      which recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the
                      consent decree, would not be maintainable.

                                                                                                                      undefined




                      2.7      Further reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of

 
Pushpa Devi Bhagat vs. Rajinder Singh and Others
 reported in
                      (2006) 5 SCC 566. Specific reference is made to paragraph 17
                      wherein, while referring to the amended provisions of Order 23 of
                      the Code, inter alia, it has been held and observed that no appeal is
                      maintainable against the consent decree having regard to the
                      specific bar contained in sub-section (3) of 
Section 96
 of the Code.
                      Besides, no independent suit can be filed for setting aside a
                      compromise decree on the ground that the compromise was not
                      lawful; in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A of the Code.




                      2.8      While summing up, it is contended that there was a registered
                      Agreement to Sell in favour of the applicant. Moreover, the applicant
                      has paid an amount of Rs.50 lacs. It was only keeping in dark the
                      applicant, that the suits were filed and settlements were arrived at.
                      Respondent no.9 was fully aware about the Agreement to Sell and
                      hence, the suits filed by the respondents were nothing but fraud
                      played upon the Court. In the circumstances, the applicant be
                      permitted a leave to file the appeal.



                      3.       Per contra, Mr S. P. Majmudar, learned advocate appearing
                      with Mr Hardik J. Karathiya, learned advocate for the respondent
                      no.10,      submitted       that     the       application,   suffers     from      vice     of
                      suppression of material fact inasmuch as, the applicant has chosen
                      not to disclose the factum of filing of the suit by him seeking specific
                      performance of the Agreement to Sell. Though reference is made of
                      all other suit, the details of the suit filed by the applicant is missing
                      and hence, the application deserves to be rejected only on the
                      ground of suppression of material fact.



                      3.1      It is further submitted that clearly, the applicant, is mere
                      holder of the Agreement to Sell and has no other interest in the
                      property and therefore, appealable interest is not in favour of the

                      applicant owing to passing of the consent decree. It is further
                      submitted that it is settled that under the provisions of the 
Transfer
                      of Property Act, 1882
 (hereinafter referred to as "
TP Act
"),
                      Agreement to Sell does not create any interest. As against this,
                      there is a registered sale deed executed in favour of respondent
                      no.10. Also, the applicant is neither a necessary nor a proper party.
                      If at all, the applicant is aggrieved or has any grievance, it has to
                      prove his case independently and on its own merits, without
                      referring to the proceedings or the documents executed between
                      the respondents.



 
3.2      Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of 
Patel
                      Vinodbhai Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai Kacharabhai
 reported in
                      2021 (3) GLR 2601. It is submitted that the issue stands fully
                      covered by the principle 
laid down in
 
the said judgment
. Not only
                      the principle but the facts, were also identical. This Court, has
                      considered the aspect of aggrieved person so also the appealable
                      interest      of       the   aggrieved         person.      Coordinate      Bench,        after
                      considering various judgments on the point so also the provisions of
                      
Section 96
 and Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code, has held and observed
                      that in order to acquire the status of the aggrieved party, the person
                      must have legal interest and enforceable right which would in turn
                      allow him to question the decree or order by preferring appeal
                      though, he may not be a party to the suit or the proceedings. It has
                      also been held and observed that the applicants who claim their
                      interest on the basis of the Agreement to Sell, could not be said to
                      be holding any interest in the property to be within the definition of
                      "legally aggrieved or prejudiced persons".




 
3.3      For the proposition that Agreement to Sell does not confer any
                      interest, reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of

                      (2012) 1 SCC 656. It has been held and observed that any
                      agreement to sell which is not a registered deed of conveyance
                      would fall short of the requirements of 
Sections 54
 and 
55
 of the TP
                      Act and will not confer any title or transfer any interest in
                      immovable property. 
Section 54
 defines the term 'sale' and would
                      mean a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or
                      promised or part-paid and part-promised. The provision also
                      envisages that such transfer in the case of tangible immoveable
                      property can be made only by a registered instrument.




 
3.4      Reliance is also placed on the judgment in the case of
                      
Venigalla Koteswaramma vs. Malampati Suryamba
 reported in
                      (2021) 4 SCC 246. It is submitted that law enunciated by the Apex
                      Court, is that as per the provisions of 
Section 54
 of the TP Act, an
                      agreement for           sale of immoveable property does not, of itself,
                      create any interest in or charge on such property; a person having
                      an agreement for sale in his favour does not get any right in the
                      property, except the right of obtaining sale deed on that basis.




 
3.5      In support of the submission of suppression of material fact,
                      reliance is placed on the judgment in the case of 
HMT Ltd. vs.
                      Rukmini and Others
 reported in AIR 2024 SC 4677. The Apex Court,
                      in no uncertain terms, stated that a person seeking equitable relief,
                      must come with clean hands, put forward all facts before the Court
                      without concealing or suppressing anything and seek appropriate
                      relief. It is submitted that when a person does not disclose all the
                      correct facts, he would be guilty of misleading the Court. In the
                      present case, though the applicant has mentioned about all the
                      suits, has chosen not to state about the suit filed by him against the
                      respondent no.9 seeking specific performance. The applicant has
                      already initiated the proceedings of specific performance and he has
                      to prove his rights independently and on the strength of his own

                      case.




                      3.6      It is further submitted that the judgment of Full Bench will not
                      apply to the applicant, as the applicant cannot be said to be
                      aggrieved party. It is only the party who has the appealable interest,
                      can be permitted to file the appeal. The applicant, has to satisfy that
                      he has an appealable interest. In view of mere Agreement to Sell,
                      the applicant, cannot claim that he has the appealable interest. It is
                      therefore urged that the applications do not deserve to be
                      entertained and may not be accepted.



                      4.       In a brief rejoinder, Mr Archit P. Jani, learned advocate for the
                      applicant, submitted that suppression, has to be of a material fact.
                      In the present case, the filing of the suit would not be material or
                      connected with the issue raised. Even otherwise, in the appeal
                      memo, there is a specific reference of the suit filed by the applicant
                      and hence, by no stretch of imagination, it can be construed that
                      there was a suppression by the applicant. It is also submitted that
                      Agreement to Sell does not confer any right but, the applicant can't
                      wait until the order of consent decree is set aside. The applicant,
                      would not get any relief unless the consent decree is challenged and
                      is quashed and set aside. It is submitted that if the suit were to be
                      allowed then there is nothing left to be executed in favour of the
                      applicant and hence, consent decrees have to go.

Reliance is

V. N. Krishna Murthy and
                      Another vs. Ravikumar and Others
 reported in (2020) 9 SCC 501.




                      4.2      It is therefore urged that the applicant is very much aggrieved
                      party and hence, be permitted the leave to challenge the order and
                      consent decree, both dated 21.01.2023 as well as order and decree
                      both dated 11.02.2023 passed by the Court below.



                      5.       Heard the learned advocates appearing for the respective
                      parties. Considered the facts, the law and the record made
                      available.



                      6.       Tersely stated are the facts. Discernibly, Special Civil Suit
                      no.277 of 2022 was filed by the respondents except respondent
                      no.10 seeking declaration that the Agreement to Sell dated
                      13.01.2022 as well as the possession receipt be declared as illegal
                      and bad as the same has been executed without the knowledge of
                      the plaintiffs. Subsequent thereto, the respondent no.10 filed
                      Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2023, inter alia, seeking specific
                      performance of the Agreement to Sell dated 01.01.2013 and for
                      consequential relief of possession, pursuant to the possession
                      receipt dated 22.01.2016.



                      7.       Apparently, in the Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022, the
                      parties have submitted compromise purshis - Exhibit 13 and the
                      learned Judge, has passed an order dated 11.02.2023 in terms of
                      the compromise purshis. Decree was drawn accordingly of the same
                      date. On the other hand, in Special Civil Suit no.11 of 2023
                      compromise purshis - Exhibit 8 was filed with the Court below and
                      the order has been passed dated 21.01.2023, disposing of the suit
                      in terms of the purshis. Decree was passed accordingly of the same
                      date.

                      8.      Apropos the above referred two orders and decrees, that
                      execution proceeding no.4 of 2023 was initiated. Order dated
                      08.04.2023 came to be passed below Exhibits 1, 6 and 8 appointing
                      the Court Commissioner for the purpose of executing the sale deed
                      and order dated 19.04.2023 below Exhibits 1, 6, 9 and 23 for
                      appointing Court Commissioner and executing sale deed. After the
                      proceeding, ultimately registered sale deeds have been executed by
                      the Court Commissioner. It is the compromise deed; the orders
                      passed thereon and the consequential order dated 08.04.2023 and
                      sale deeds executed in the execution proceedings, which have
                      given rise to the captioned application by the applicant seeking
                      leave to challenge the order and consent decree both dated
                      11.02.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022 as well as
                      order and decree both dated 21.01.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit
                      no.11 of 2023.



                      9.      While adverting to the facts touching the applicant, notably,
                      Agreement to Sell was executed by the respondent nos.1 to 9 dated
                      17.03.2022. It is the case of the applicant that when there was an
                      Agreement to Sell, the suits filed, could not have been settled
                      between the parties, as the rights of the applicant have been
                      prejudicely affected. The applicant has also filed Special Civil Suit
                      no.299       of    2023      against         the   respondents    seeking         specific
                      performance of the Agreement to Sell as well as challenging the
                      registered sale deeds in favour of the respondent no.10. Clearly, it is
                      the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022, on the basis whereof, the
                      applicant is claiming his right so as to challenge the orders passed
                      in the suits. Hence, one needs to ascertain as to whether any rights
                      can be said to have been invested or conferred upon the applicant
                      so as to take out the captioned proceedings. Thus, few judgments
                      on the point are worth referring to.

                      10.      
In the case of 
Sakina Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors. vs.
                      Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj & Ors.
 (supra), the full
                      bench, in paragraph 30 of the judgment has stated that when a
                      person aggrieved is third party who was neither a party to suit nor a
                      party to the compromise on the basis of which the decree was
                      passed would not be bound by such decree. Such decree cannot be
                      said to be consent decree qua such party and therefore, either the
                      bar contained in sub-section (3) of 
Section 96
 or bar under Rule 3-A
                      of the Order XXIII, would not be applicable to him. Such an
                      aggrieved party with a leave of the Court can always file an appeal
                      as per the provisions of the Code and can challenge the validity of
                      the compromise decree on the grounds available to him. The full
                      bench, while summing up its reasoning, in paragraph 40 (vii) has
                      observed thus:




                               "(vii) If the aggrieved party was not the party to the suit, the
                               remedy available to him to challenge the decree passed by the
                               Court on the basis of compromise between the parties to the suit
                               (consent decree), would be to file an appeal under 
Section 96(1)
 of
                               C.P.C., with the leave of the appellate Court, or to file a review
                               application before the Court, which passed the decree, as may be
                               permissible under 
Section 114
 read with 
Order XLVII of C.P.C
."



                      11.      Therefore, the aggrieved third party, who is not a party to the
                      suit or compromise, the remedy available to him is to file an appeal
                      with the leave of the Court, as neither the consent decree nor the
                      orders would be binding upon him. The issue then would arises is as
                      to who can be said to be an aggrieved party. A person aggrieved,
                      must be a person who had suffered a legal grievance, against whom
                      a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him
                      of something or wrongfully refused him something or wrongfully
                      affected his title of something and it does not include a person who
                      suffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury. A person
                      aggrieved must therefore necessarily be one whose right or interest

                      has been adversely affected or jeopardized.



                      12.      
In the case of 
Mooman Jafferali Aliji Maknojiya vs. Shia Imami
                      Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj
 (supra), the coordinate bench, while
                      considering the application seeking leave to appeal has held and
                      observed that a stranger cannot be permitted to file an appeal in
                      any proceedings unless he satisfies the Court that he falls within the
                      category of aggrieved person. It is only where the judgment and
                      decree prejudicely affects the person, who is not a party to the
                      proceedings, can prefer an appeal with the leave of the appellate
                      Court. The expression, "person aggrieved" has been lucidly
                      explained to mean that it does not include a person who suffers
                      from a psychological or an imaginary injury; a person aggrieved
                      must therefore, necessarily be one, whose right or interest has been
                      adversely affected or jeopardized. Summarizing the principle, in
                      paragraph 16, this Court, has observed thus:




                               16. The principles governing grant of leave to appeal may be
                               summarised as under :



                               (i) 
Sections 96
 and 
100
 of the CPC provide for preferring an appeal
                               from an original decree or decree in appeal respectively;



                               (ii) the said provisions do not enumerate the categories of persons
                               who can file an appeal;



                               (iii) however it a settled legal proposition that a stranger cannot be
                               permitted to file an appeal in any proceedings unless he satisfies the
                               Court that he falls within the category of aggrieved person;



                               (iv) it is only where a judgment and decree prejudicially affects a
                               person who is not a party to the proceedings, he can prefer an
                               appeal with the leave of the Court;



                               (v) a person aggrieved, to file an appeal, must be one whose right is
                               affected by reason of the judgment and decree sought to be
                               impugned;



                               (vi) the expression person aggrieved does not include a person who
                               suffers from a psychological or an imaginary injury;



                               (vii) it would be improper to grant leave to appeal to every person
                               who may in some remote or indirect way be prejudicially affected by
                               a decree or judgment; and

                               (viii) ordinarily leave to appeal should be granted to persons who,
                               though not parties to the proceedings, would be bound by the
                               decree or judgment in that proceeding and who would be precluded
                               from attacking its correctness in other proceedings."



                      13.      
In the case of 
R. Janakiammal vs. S. K. Kumarasamy
                      (Deceased) Through Legal Representatives and Others
 (supra), the
                      Apex Court, was dealing with the provisions of Order 23, Rule 3 and
                      3-A of the Code. The principle which can be deduced is, that the
                      remedy available to a party to a consent decree to avoid such
                      consent decree is to approach the Court which recorded the
                      compromise and made a decree in terms of it and establish that
                      there was no compromise. In that event, the Court which recorded
                      the compromise will itself consider and decide the question as to
                      whether there was a valid compromise or not. It has been observed
                      that this is so because a consent decree is nothing but a contract
                      between parties superimposed with a seal of approval of the Court.
                      The validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of
                      the agreement or compromise on which it is made. Therefore, the
                      compromise on the basis of which the consent decree is passed, is
                      merely a contract. Consent decree is nothing but a contract
                      between the parties superimposed with a seal of the approval of the
                      Court.




                      14.      The present applicant who is seeking leave to appeal to
                      challenge the order and decree dated 21.01.2023 and order and
                      decree both dated 11.02.2023 passed in Special Civil Suit no.11 of
                      2023 and Special Civil Suit no.277 of 2022, respectively, whether
                      can be said to be an aggrieved party and if yes, what would be the
                      remedy available to the applicant as he was not a party to the suit
                      proceedings. Therefore, the first and foremost threshold to be
                      cleared is that third party should be an aggrieved person.

Sections 5
, 
53A
, 
54
 of the TP Act as well as 
Section 17
 of the
                      Registration Act, 1908. It has been held and observed that 
Section
                      54
 of the TP Act makes it clear that contract of sale, that is, an
                      agreement of sale, does not, of itself, create any interest in or
                      charge on such property. While discussing the provisions of 
Section
                      17
 i.e. requirement of registration of document, it has been held and
                      observed that transfer of immovable property by way of sale can
                      only be by a deed of conveyance and in absence of a deed of
                      conveyance (duly stamped and registered as required by law), no
                      right, title or interest in an immoveable property can be transferred.
                      In paragraph 12, it has been further observed that any contract of
                      sale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed of
                      conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of
                      
Sections 54
 and 
55
 of TP Act and will not confer any title nor
                      transfer any interest in an immovable property (except to the
                      limited right granted under 
Section 53A
 of TP Act). According to TP
                      Act, an agreement of sale, whether with possession or without
                      possession, is not a conveyance as 
Section 54
 of TP Act provides
                      that sale of immoveable property can be made only by a registered
                      instrument. Paragraphs 11 and 12 are reproduced hereinbelow for
                      ready reference.




 
"11. 
Section 54
 of TP Act makes it clear that a contract of sale,
                              that is, an agreement of sale does not, of itself, create any interest
                              in or charge on such property. This Court in 
Narandas Karsondas v.
                              S.A. Kamtam and Anr.
 (1977) 3 SCC 247, observed:




                              A contract of sale does not of itself create any interest in, or
                              charge on, the property. This is expressly declared in 
Section 54
 of
                              the Transfer of Property Act. See Rambaran Prosad V/s. Ram Mohit
                              Hazra [1967]1 SCR 293. The fiduciary character of the personal
                              obligation created by a contract for sale is recognised in 
Section 3

                              of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and in 
Section 91
 of the Trusts Act.
                              The personal obligation created by a contract of sale is described
                              in 
Section 40
 of the Transfer of Property Act as an obligation
                              arising out of contract and annexed to the ownership of property,

In 
Rambhau Namdeo Gajre v. Narayan Bapuji Dhotra
 [2004 (8) SCC
                               614] this Court held:




                               "Protection provided under 
Section 53A
 of the Act to the proposed
                               transferee is a shield only against the transferor. It disentitles the
                               transferor from disturbing the possession of the proposed
                               transferee who is put in possession in pursuance to such an
                               agreement. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the
                               proposed transferor who remains full owner of the property till it is
                               legally conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of
                               the transferee. Such a right to protect possession against the
                               proposed vendor cannot be pressed in service against a third
                               party."



                               It is thus clear that a transfer of immoveable property by way of
                               sale can only be by a deed of conveyance (sale deed). In the
                               absence of a deed of conveyance (duly stamped and registered as
                               required by law), no right, title or interest in an immoveable
                               property can be transferred.



                               12. Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a
                               registered deed of conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of
                               the requirements of 
sections 54
 and 
55
 of TP Act and will not
                               confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable property
                               (except to the limited right granted under 
section 53A
 of TP Act).
                               According to TP Act, an agreement of sale, whether with
                               possession or without possession, is not a conveyance. 
Section 54

                               of TP Act enacts that sale of immoveable property can be made
                               only by a registered instrument and an agreement of sale does not
                               create any interest or charge on its subject matter."



 
16.      Similarly,     in   the     case    of    
Venigalla   Koteswaramma              vs.
                      Malampati Suryamba
 (supra), the Apex Court, has held and
                      observed that as per 
Section 54
 of the TP Act, an agreement for sale
                      of immovable property does not, of itself, create any interest in or
                      charge on such property. A person having an agreement for sale in
                      his favour does not have any right, except the right of obtaining sale
                      deed on that basis. Paragraphs 39 and 39.1 of 
the said judgment
,
                      read thus:




                               "39. Apart from the above, it is also fundamental, as per 
Section 54

                               of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, agreement for sale of
                               immoveable property does not, of itself, create any interest in or

                               obtaining sale deed on that basis8. For ready reference, we may
                               reproduce 
Section 54
 of the Transfer of Property Act that reads as
                               under: -

                               "54. "Sale" defined.- "Sale" is a transfer of ownership in exchange for
                               a price paid or promised or part-paid and partpromised. Sale how
                               made.- Such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of
                               the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a
                               reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered
                               instrument. In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value
                               less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by
                               a registered instrument or by delivery of the property. Delivery of
                               tangible immoveable property takes place when the seller places the
                               buyer, or such person as he directs, in possession of the property.



                               Contract for sale.- A contract for the sale of immoveable property is
                               a contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms
                               settled between the parties. It does not, of itself, create any interest
                               in or charge on such property."



                               39.1. It goes without saying that the alleged agreement for sale did
                               not invest the vendee with title to, or any interest in, the property in
                               question; and the alleged agreement for sale did not invest the
                               vendee with any such right that the plaintiff could not have
                               maintained her claim for partition in respect of the properties left by
                               Annapurnamma without seeking declaration against the agreement.
                               Therefore, this plea about non-maintainability of suit for want for
                               relief of declaration against the said agreement for sale remains
                               totally baseless and could only be rejected."



                      17.      Therefore, it is well settled that the transfer of immovable
                      property by way of sale can only be by a deed of conveyance and
                      deed of conveyance, has to be duly stamped and registered as
                      required by law and in absence thereof, no right, title or interest in
                      an immovable property can be transferred. The law enunciated, is
                      also that any contract of sale which is not registered deed of
                      conveyance would fall short of the requirements of 
Sections 54
 and
                      
55
 of the TP Act and will not confer any title or interest in an
                      immovable property.



                      18.      Concededly and not in dispute, the applicant is claiming right
                      flowing from the Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 executed by
                      the respondents except respondent no.10. Concededly, there is no
                      sale deed executed in favour of the applicant by the respondents.
                      Therefore, the issue which arises for consideration of this Court, is

                      as to whether in absence of any registered sale deed, in tune with
                      the provisions of 
Section 54
 of the TP Act read with 
Section 17
 of the
                      Registration Act, 1908, can it be said that any right or interest has
                      been invested in the applicant. Also, merely on the basis of the
                      Agreement to Sell, whether the applicant can be said to be an
                      aggrieved person. Clearly, answer to both the above referred issues
                      has to be in negative in view of the above referred judgments and
                      principle laid down therein.



 
19.      At this stage, the judgment of the coordinate bench directly
                      on the point, is apt to be referred to. In the case of 
Patel Vinodbhai
                      Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai Kacharabhai
 (supra), the question that
                      fell for consideration and recorded in paragraph 2 was that whether
                      the applicants, not a party to the suit, which resulted into
                      compromise decree, can be said to be an aggrieved party to be
                      entitled to be conferred right to appeal and to be consequently
                      granted leave to appeal. The answer was given in negative by
                      holding that the applicants do not qualify on facts and in law to be
                      the aggrieved persons to be entitled to question the compromise
                      decree between the parties to the suit in question by preferring
                      appeal thereagainst. It has also been held that whatever rights the
                      applicants can claim on the basis of agreement to sell in their
                      favour, they have to establish such rights and the enforceability
                      thereof in an independent proceedings by filing separate suit. The
                      suit for specific performance was filed with respect to Agreement to
                      Sell dated 29.06.2008 read with supplementary agreement dated
                      27.09.2011 executed by the defendants therein. Compromise
                      purshis was filed and decree was passed in terms of the
                      compromise.            The    applicants       were      aggrieved      by     the      said
                      compromise decree on the ground that the plaintiff had executed an
                      agreement to sell dated 05.08.2008 in favour of five persons and
                      those persons, executed an Agreement to Sell in favour of the

                      applicant, and the applicants claimed that they have acquired the
                      interest in the subject property.
 
Reliance was placed on the
                      judgment in the case of 
Sakina Sultanali Sunesara (Momin) & Ors.
                      vs. Shia Imami Ismaili Momin Jamat Samaj & Ors.
 (supra). The
                      coordinate bench, considered the provisions of 
Section 96
, Order 23
                      Rule 3 of the Code. The aspect of aggrieved person was considered
                      in detail and this Court, held that as per the law enunciated, the
                      person filing appeal must have a legal grievance against the
                      decision which wrongfully deprived him of something or affected his
                      title to something. This Court, after considering various judgments,
                      provisions; held that in order to be entitled to prefer an appeal, a
                      person must be one who can be said to be aggrieved against the
                      judgment. The aggrievement has to be a legal aggrievement where
                      the aggrieved person could be said to be prejudicially affected to
                      permit him to prefer appeal even if he is not a party to the suit
                      proceedings. He must have an appealable interest. A party who
                      would be benefited because of the change in the judgment by
                      redressal of the legal injuria is said to have an appealable interest.
                      Paragraph 9 and connected paragraphs read thus:




                              "9.Having discussed the principles of law as above and particularly
                              considering the concept of 'aggrieved person' to be entitled to enjoy
                              the right to appeal, now the basic facts of the case may be
                              recapitulated and reverted to. The plaintiff Patel Pravinbhai
                              Kachrabhai of Special Civil Suit No.31 of 2012 had executed
                              agreement to sell dated 05th August, 2008 in respect of the subject
                              matter property involved in the above Special Civil Suit for specific
                              performance between the plaintiff and the defendants in favour of
                              one Patel Bharatkumar and three others. This Bharatkumar and three
                              others, subsequently on 09th December, 2008 executed another

                              applicants. When the suit was compromised between the parties to
                              the suit, the applicants on the basis of the above agreements dated
                              05th August, 2008 followed by 09th December, 2008 claimed their

                              9.1 In other words, what is fundamental is that in order to be entitled
                              to prefer an appeal, a person must be one who can be said to be
                              aggrieved against the judgment. This aggrievement has to be a legal

                                                                                                                      undefined




                               prejudicially affected to permit him to prefer appeal even if he is not
                               a party to the suit proceedings. He must have an appealable interest.
                               A party who would be benefited because of the change in the
                               judgment by redressal of legal injuria, is said to have an appealable
                               interest. The change in the judgment prayed to be appealed against
                               by the third party, when brings an immediate right or legal benefit,
                               then the person can be said to be having appealable interest. This
                               appealable interest should not be contingent, speculative or
                               futurative. The appealable interest must be substantial and
                               immediate.



                               9.2 In order to acquire the status of aggrieved party, the person must
                               have legal interest and an enforceable right which would in turn
                               allowing him to question the decree or order by preferring appeal,
                               though he may not be a party to the suit or proceedings. The
                               applicants who claim their interest on the basis of the agreements to
                               sell as above could not be said to be holding any interest in the
                               property to be within the definition of legally aggrieved or prejudiced
                               persons. As the applicants are not 'aggrieved party' vis-a-vis the
                               compromise decree having regard to their legal status, they could not
                               be clothed with right to appeal. They do not have 'appelable interest'
                               in connection with the compromise decree."



 
20.      The facts on hand are in close proximity to the facts available
                      in the case of 
Patel Vinodbhai Khodidas vs. Patel Pravinbhai
                      Kacharabhai
 (supra) and 
the said judgment
, would directly apply so
                      also the principle.




 
21.      Contention is also raised that the suit would not be
                      maintainable against the consent decree, in view of the judgment in
                      the case of 
Pushpa Devi Bhagat vs. Rajinder Singh and Others

                      (supra). Pertinently, the facts were that the suit was filed by the
                      landlords       against     the appellant          therein    for    recovery        of    the
                      possession. Recording the submissions of the learned advocate,
                      order was passed disposing of the suit as settled and parties were
                      directed to be bound by the statements made. Subsequently, for
                      some of the respondents appearance was filed. It is thereafter, a
                      fresh decree was drawn in terms of the final order. It is at that point
                      of time, that the appellant therein filed an application for setting
                      aside the decree dated 18.07.2001 on the ground that she had not
                      instructed her counsel to enter into any compromise on her behalf
                      and in absence of any written compromise between the parties, duly

                      signed, there was no lawful agreement or compromise. Application
                      for setting aside the consent decree was not pursued but appeal
                      was filed before the learned District Judge. Consent decree came to
                      be set aside on the ground that there was no agreement or
                      compromise reduced in writing                   and signed by the parties. The
                      matter was remanded to the trial court. The judgment was subject
                      matter of challenge before the Delhi High Court under Order 43 Rule
                      (1-u) of the Code and it allowed the landlord's appeal on the ground
                      that consent decree did not fall under the first part of Order 23 Rule
                      3 requiring an agreement or compromise between the parties to be
                      in writing and signed by the parties but fell under the second part of
                      the said provisions.




                      22.      It is this judgment of the High Court, which was challenged in
                      appeal before the Apex Court and the issues were, (i) whether the
                      appeal filed under 
Section 96
 of the Code against the consent
                      decree was maintainable and (ii) whether the compromise resulting
                      in a consent decree dated 18.07.2001 was not a valid compromise
                      under Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code. With this background, the Apex
                      Court, held that against consent decree no independent suit can be
                      filed for setting aside the consent decree on the ground that
                      compromise was not lawful in view of the bar contained in Rule 3-A
                      of the Code. The Apex Court, in paragraph 17, has observed thus:



                               "17. The position that emerges from the amended provisions of
                               Order 23, can be summed up thus :



                               (i) No appeal is maintainable against a consent decree having regard
                               to the specific bar contained in 
section 96(3)
 CPC.



                               (ii) No appeal is maintainable against the order of the court
                               recording the compromise (or refusing to record a compromise) in
                               view of the deletion of clause (m) Rule 1 Order 43.



                               (iii) No independent suit can be filed for setting aside a compromise
                               decree on the ground that the compromise was not lawful in view of
                               the bar contained in Rule 3A.



                               (iv) A consent decree operates as an estoppel and is valid and

                               binding unless it is set aside by the court which passed the consent
                               decree, by an order on an application under the proviso to Rule 3 of
                               Order 23.



                               Therefore, the only remedy available to a party to a consent decree
                               to avoid such consent decree, is to approach the court which
                               recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms of it, and
                               establish that there was no compromise. In that event, the court
                               which recorded the compromise will itself consider and decide the
                               question as to whether there was a valid compromise or not. This is
                               so because a consent decree, is nothing but contract between
                               parties superimposed with the seal of approval of the court. The
                               validity of a consent decree depends wholly on the validity of the
                               agreement or compromise on which it is made. The second
                               defendant, who challenged the consent compromise decree was
                               fully aware of this position as she filed an application for setting
                               aside the consent decree on 21.8.2001 by alleging that there was no
                               valid compromise in accordance with law. Significantly, none of the
                               other defendants challenged the consent decree. For reasons best
                               known to herself, the second defendant within a few days thereafter
                               (that is on 27.8.2001), filed an appeal and chose not to pursue the
                               application filed before the court which passed the consent decree.
                               Such an appeal by second defendant was not maintainable, having
                               regard to the express bar contained in 
section 96 (3)
 of the Code."



                      23.      It has been held that the only remedy available to a party to a
                      consent decree to avoid such consent decree is to approach the
                      Court which recorded the compromise and made a decree in terms
                      of it and establish that there was no compromise. Therefore, the bar
                      is to a party to a consent decree and the remedy available to the
                      party is to approach the Court which recorded the compromise;
                      however
, 
the said judgment
, did not deal with the right of a third
                      party who was neither a party to the agreement nor the suit nor the
                      consent decree. The said judgment, therefore, would not apply to
                      the facts of the present case.



                      24.      It is noteworthy that it is not in dispute that there is an
                      Agreement to Sell dated 17.03.2022 in favour of the applicant
                      which, as is by now well settled would not create or invest any right
                      in favour of the applicant. When there is no right invested, simply
                      because the order which has been passed as a result of the
                      compromise decree, is not the liking of the applicant, would not
                      make a person aggrieved, much less any appealable right in his
