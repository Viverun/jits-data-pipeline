    6.         Now, the moot question is whether in view of the




    involvement of the petitioner in so many cases, can he still





    be released on parole.



    7.         It is more than settled that the grant of remission





    or parole is not a right vested with the prisoner. It is a

    privilege available to the prisoner on fulfilling certain

    conditions. This is a discretionary power which has to be

    exercised by the authorities conferred with such powers

    under the relevant rules/regulations. The Court cannot

    exercise these powers, though once the powers are

                                                              .



 
8.         The Hon'ble Supreme Court has considered                        in

    detail the nature, object, purpose and parameters for grant





    of parole subject to which parole can be granted in 
Asfaq

    versus State of Rajasthan and others
, (2017) 15 SCC





    55, wherein it was observed as under:




               "14. Furlough, on the other hand, is a brief release
              from the prison. It is conditional and is given in case

              of long term imprisonment. The period of sentence

              spent on furlough by the prisoners need not be
              undergone by him as is done in the case of parole.
              Furlough is granted as a good conduct remission.



              15. A convict, literally speaking, must remain in jail
              for the period of sentence or for rest of his life in case




              he is a life convict. It is in this context that his release





              from jail for a short period has to be considered as an
              opportunity afforded to him not only to solve his





              personal and family problems but also to maintain his
              links with society. Convicts too must breathe fresh air
              for at least some time provided they maintain good
              conduct consistently during incarceration and show a
              tendency to reform themselves and become good
              citizens. Thus, redemption and rehabilitation of such
              prisoners for good of societies must receive due
              weightage while they are undergoing sentence of
              imprisonment.

        furlough, few of which are as under:



              (i) Both parole and furlough are conditional
              release.



              (ii) Parole can be granted in case of short term
              imprisonment whereas in furlough it is granted





              in case of long term imprisonment.



              (iii) Duration of parole extends to one month
              whereas in the case of furlough it extends to

              fourteen days maximum.



              (iv)   Parole       is    granted         by      Divisional
              Commissioner and furlough is granted by the


              Deputy Inspector General of Prisons.



              (v) For parole, specific reason is required,




              whereas furlough is meant for breaking the
              monotony of imprisonment.



              (vi) The term of imprisonment is not included in





              the computation of the term of parole, whereas
              it is vice versa in furlough.



              (vii) Parole can be granted number of times
              whereas there is limitation in the case of
              furlough.



             (viii) Since furlough is not granted for any
             particular reason, it can be denied in the
             interest of the society.

, (2000) 3





         SCC 394.




        17. From the aforesaid discussion, it follows that





        amongst the various grounds on which parole can be
        granted, the most important ground, which stands
        out, is that a prisoner should be allowed to maintain





        family and social ties. For this purpose, he has to
        come out for some time so that he is able to maintain
        his family and social contact. This reason finds

        justification in one of the objectives behind sentence

        and punishment, namely, reformation of the convict.
        The theory of criminology, which is largely accepted,
        underlines that the main objectives which a State


        intends to achieve by punishing the culprit are:

        deterrence, prevention, retribution and reformation.
        When we recognise reformation as one of the




        objectives, it provides justification for letting of even
        the life convicts for short periods, on parole, in order





        to afford opportunities to such convicts not only to
        solve their personal and family problems but also to





        maintain    their   links   with   the     society.      Another
        objective which this theory underlines is that even
        such convicts have right to breathe fresh air, al beit
        for periods. These gestures on the part of the State,
        along with other measures, go a long way for
        redemption and rehabilitation of such prisoners. They
        are ultimately aimed for the good of the society and,
        therefore, are in public interest.

        18. The provisions of parole and furlough, thus,
        provide for a humanistic approach towards those




                                                        .

        lodged in jails. Main purpose of such provisions is to





        afford to them an opportunity to solve their personal
        and family problems and to enable them to maintain





        their links with society. Even citizens of this country
        have a vested interest in preparing offenders for
        successful re-entry into society. Those who leave
        prison without strong networks of support, without





        employment     prospects,     without       a     fundamental
        knowledge of the communities to which they will
        return, and without resources, stand a significantly

        higher chance of failure. When offenders revert to

        criminal activity upon release, they frequently do so
        because they lack hope of merging into society as
        accepted citizens. Furloughs or parole can help



        prepare offenders for success.



        19. Having noted the aforesaid public purpose in




        granting   parole   or    furlough,     ingrained        in    the





        reformation theory of sentencing, other competing
        public interest has also to be kept in mind while





        deciding as to whether in a particular case parole or
        furlough is to be granted or not. This public interest
        also demands that those who are habitual offenders
        and may have the tendency to commit the crime
        again after their release on parole or have the
        tendency to become threat to the law and order of
        the society, should not be released on parole. This
        aspect takes care of other objectives of sentencing,
        namely, deterrence and prevention. This side of the





                                     ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP


                               11





        coin is the experience that great number of crimes
        are committed by the offenders who have been put




                                                        .

        back in the street after conviction. Therefore, while





        deciding as to whether a particular prisoner deserves
        to be released on parole or not, the aforesaid aspects





        have also to be kept in mind. To put it tersely, the
        authorities are supposed to address the question as
        to whether the convict is such a person who has the
        tendency to commit such a crime or he is showing





        tendency to reform himself to become a good citizen.



        20. Thus, not all people in prison are appropriate for

        grant of furlough or parole. Obviously, society must

        isolate those who show patterns of preying upon
        victims. Yet administrators ought to encourage those
        offenders   who    demonstrate        a    commitment            to


        reconcile with society and whose behaviour shows
        that aspire to live as law-abiding citizens. Thus, parole
        program should be used as a tool to shape such




        adjustments.



        21. To sum up, in introducing penal reforms, the State
        that runs the administration on behalf of the society





        and for the benefit of the society at large cannot be
        unmindful of safeguarding the legitimate rights of the
        citizens in regard to their security in the matters of life
        and liberty. It is for this reason that in introducing such
        reforms, the authorities cannot be oblivious of the
        obligation to the society to render it immune from
        those who are prone to criminal tendencies and have
        proved their susceptibility to indulge in criminal
        activities by being found guilty (by a Court) of having





                                     ::: Downloaded on - 29/06/2020 20:21:23 :::HCHP


                              12





        perpetrated a criminal act. One of the discernible
        purposes of imposing the penalty of imprisonment is




                                                      .

        to render the society immune from the criminal for a





        specified period. It is, therefore, understandable that
        while meting out humane treatment to the convicts,





        care has to be taken to ensure that kindness to the
        convicts does not result in cruelty to the society.
        Naturally enough, the authorities would be anxious to
        ensure that the convict who is released on furlough





        does not seize the opportunity to commit another
        crime when he is at large for the time-being under the
        furlough leave granted to him by way of a measure of

        penal reform.



        22. Another vital aspect that needs to be discussed is
        as to whether there can be any presumption that a


        person who is convicted of serious or heinous crime is
        to be, ipso facto, treated as a hardened criminal.
        Hardened criminal would be a person for whom it has




        become a habit or way of life and such a person would
        necessarily tend to commit crimes again and again.



        Obviously, if a person has committed a serious
        offence for which he is convicted, but at the same





        time it is also found that it is the only crime he has
        committed, he cannot be categorised as a hardened
        criminal. In his case consideration should be as to
        whether he is showing the signs to reform himself and
        become a good citizen or there are circumstances
        which would indicate that he has a tendency to
        commit the crime again or that he would be a threat
        to the society. Mere nature of the offence committed
        by him should not be a factor to deny the parole

                              13





        outrightly. Wherever a person convicted has suffered
        incarceration for a long time, he can be granted




                                                       .

        temporary parole, irrespective of the nature of offence





        for which he was sentenced. We may hasten to put a
        rider here, viz. in those cases where a person has





        been convicted for committing a serious office, the
        competent authority, while examining such cases, can
        be well advised to have stricter standards in mind
        while judging their cases on the parameters of god





        conduct, habitual offender or while judging whether
        he could be considered highly dangerous or prejudicial
        to the public peace and tranquillity etc.



 
23. There can be no cavil in saying that a society that
        believes in the worth of the individuals can have the
        quality of its belief judged, at least in part, by the


        quality of its prisons and services and recourse made
        available to the prisoners. Being in a civilized society
        organized with law and a system as such, it is




        essential to ensure for every citizen a reasonably
        dignified life. If a person commits any crime, it does





        not mean that by committing a crime, he ceases to be
        a human being and that he can be deprived of those





        aspects of life which constitute human dignity. For a
        prisoner all fundamental rights are an enforceable
        reality, though restricted by the fact of imprisonment.

              24. It is also to be kept in mind that by the time an
              application for parole is moved by a prisoner, he




                                                             .

              would have spent some time in the jail. During this





              period, various reformatory methods must have been
              applied. We can take judicial note of this fact, having





              regard to such reformation facilities available in
              modern jails. One would know by this time as to
              whether there is a habit of relapsing into crime in
              spite of having administered correctional treatment.



              This habit known as "recidivism" reflects the fact that
              the correctional therapy has not brought in the mind
              of the criminal. It also shows that criminal is hardcore

              who is beyond correctional therapy. If the correctional

              therapy has not made in itself, in a particular case,
              such a case can be rejected on the aforesaid ground
              i.e. on its merits."



    9.        Bearing in mind the aforesaid exposition of law, it

    is evidently clear that even though the purpose of granting




    parole is ingrained in the reformatory theory of sentencing,





    however, the other competing public interest has also to be





    kept in mind while deciding as to whether in a particular

    case parole is to be granted or not. This public interest also

    demands that those who are habitual offenders and may

    have the tendency to commit the crime again after their

    release on parole or have the tendency to become threat to

    the law and order of the society, should not be released on

    parole.



                                                            .



    10.        The grant of parole is not a right vested with the

    prisoner and is rather a privilege available to the prisoner





    on fulfilling certain conditions and in view of the long history

    of cases as set out hereinabove, we really do not find any





    infirmity with the order passed by the respondents rejecting

    the claim of the petitioner for grant of parole.



    11.        Consequently, we find no merit in the instant

    writ petition and the same is accordingly dismissed, leaving

    the parties to bear their own costs. Pending application(s),



    if any, also stand disposed of.
