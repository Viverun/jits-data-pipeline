                             BEFORE
          THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T NANDAKUMAR SINGH

      For the petitioner   :      Mr. K Paul, Adv

      For the respondents :       Mr. SC Shyam, CGC for respdt.No.1 & 2
                                  Mr. S Sen, SC NEHU

      Date of hearing             :      27.05.2014

      Date of Judgment            :      04.06.2014

                   JUDGEMENT AND ORDER


             By the impugned order of the North Eastern Hill University (for

short 'NEHU') Mawlai, Umshing fixed the revised pay of Professors of NEHU

w.e.f. 01.01.2006 according to the fitments table for fixation of salary

prescribed by the University Grants Commission (for short 'UGC') on the

recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission; and none of the

professors of NEHU, whose revised pay are also fixed similar with that of the

present petitioner made any whisper against the impugned revised pay i.e.

against the impugned revision of pay scales and they are fully satisfied with

the revision of their pay scales by the NEHU according to the fitments table

for fixation of salary prescribed by the UGC.



2.           The Apex Court (Constitution Bench) coined the words "litigious

employment" in State of Karnataka vs. Umadevi (3): (2006) 4 SCC 1 and

held that the High Courts acting under 
Article 226
 of the Constitution should

not, therefore, ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularization or

permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made regularly and

in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely, because an employee had

continued under cover of an order of the court, which the Apex Court has

described as "litigious employment", he would not be entitled to any right to

be absorbed or made permanent in the service. The courts must be careful in

ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of




                                                                      Page 2 of 31
 its affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the

instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory

mandates. The Apex Court is not encouraging in granting the relief to the writ

petitioner which would unduly interfere with the economic arrangement of its

affairs by the State or its instrumentalities. The Apex Court further held that

the orders based on sentiments would result in perpetuating illegalities and in

the "jettisoning" of the scheme of the public employment and approving of the

orders passed by the authority in mistakes in favour of the employee would

result in perpetuating illegalities. The ratio laid down by the Apex Court

(Constitution Bench) in Umadevi (3) case (Supra) was also followed by the

Apex Court in State of Karnataka & Ors v. G.V. Chandrashekar: (2009) 4

SCC 342.



3.               It appears from the pleaded case of the petitioner in the writ

petition that the writ petitioner had interpreted the scheme of revision of pay

of teachers and equivalent cadres in the universities and colleges following

the   revision    of   pay   scales   of   Central   Govt.   employees   on     the

recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission under the letter of

the Govt. of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of

Higher Education, New Delhi dated 31.12.2008 to the Secretary, UGC and

the fitments table for fixation of salary prepared by the UGC in pursuance to

the scheme of revision of pay (a) teachers and equivalent cadres and (b)

administrative posts in the universities and colleges following the revision of

pay scales of the Central Govt. employees on the recommendations of the

Sixth Central Pay Commission in such a manner that the revision of pay

scales of Professors of NEHU once made by the authority of NEHU, even if it

is provisional, could not be altered to the disadvantage of the petitioner and

also the petitioner is trying to justify, without any rational reasons, the

provisional fixation of revised pay of Professors by the University-NEHU




                                                                          Page 3 of 31
 before receiving the fitments table for fixation of salary prepared by the UGC

vide Resolution No.6 of the 23rd Emergent Meeting of the Executive Council

of NEHU wherein, the Executive Council resolved to approve the

recommendation of the academic council to accept the revision of pay scales

etc. as per MHRD's letter dated 31.12.2008 and the payment of arrears up to

40% of the total arrears be made latest by Wednesday 25th February, 2009

and also the petitioner by relying on the Circular dated 28.07.2011 issued by

the NEHU claimed for three advance increments for holding Ph.D. degree as

grant for incentives.



4.              Heard Mr. K Paul, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. SC

Shyam, learned CGC for the respondents No.1 & 2. Also heard Mr. S Sen,

Professors is Ph.D. degree and also the fitments table of fixation of salary of

Professors in universities and colleges are mentioned at Table 5 to the UGC

shall be fixed at a stage not below Rs.43,000 in the Pay Band IV of

Rs.37,400-Rs.67,000, with applicable AGP of Rs.10,000" and the said

fitments table 5, fixed the revised pay band of the petitioner at Rs.48,870/-

which correspond to pre-revised basic pay of Rs.21,900/- which the petitioner

 04.12.2009. The basic revised pay band of the petitioner at Rs.48,870/-pm is

not below Rs.43,000/-pm indicated in the said Para 2(xiv) and Para 4.0 of the

              Being aggrieved by the order dated 04.12.2009, the petitioner

in the present writ petition is that the revised pay scale of the petitioner

should be the one provisionally fixed by the NEHU at Rs.51,870/-+10,000/-

as on 01.01.2006.





                                                                        Page 10 of 31


 10.          The further case of the petitioner in the present writ petition is

that as per the Circular dated 28.07.2011 issued by the NEHU for giving

incentives to the teachers for acquiring Ph.D. degree or holding Ph.D.

degree, the petitioner having Ph.D. degree before his appointment as a direct

recruit Professor is entitled to draw three advance increments. The said

Circular dated 28.07.2011 (Annexre-11 to the writ petition) reads as follows:-




                   "NORTH EASTERN HILL UNIVERSITY
                     NEHU CAMPUS SHILLONG ::::: 22


                    No.F.4-2/Estt-II/2009-1968 28th July, 2011



                                C I R C U L A R

             The UGC Regulation 2010 interalia provided incentives in the
             form of advance increments for Ph.D./M.Phil and other higher
             qualifications. On adoption of UGC Regulation 2010 by the
             University, the incentives that will be applicable may read as
             under:-



             1. The effective date for grant of advance increment, in all
             cases, shall be with effect from 1.9.08.



             2. Assistant Professors recruited on or after 1.1.06 with M.Phil
             degree shall be entitled to draw two advance increments.



             3. The Assistant Professors recruited on or after 1.1.06
             possessing Post graduate degree in the professional course
             such       as    LLM/M.Tech/M.Arch./M.E./M.V.Sc/MD.,        etc.
             recognized by the relevant statutory body/council shall also be
             entitled to two advance increments.



             4. Five advance increments shall be admissible at the level of
             recruitment as Asstt. Professors, possessing the degree of
             Ph.D. awarded in the relevant discipline by the University
             following the process of admission, registration, course work
             and external evaluation as prescribed by the UGC. In order to
             grant five advance increments, the concerned teachers are
             required to produce necessary documents in support of their
             claim.



             5. The teachers in service who have already been awarded
             Ph.D. degree before adoption of the UGC Regulation 2010 by
             the University, shall be entitled to draw three advance
             increments. Similarly, the teachers in service who have enrolled
             for Ph.D. and undergone course work as well as evaluation, if
             any, shall also be entitled to draw three advance increments
             even if the University awarding such Ph.D. degree has not yet





                                                                       Page 11 of 31

               been notified by the UGC as having complied with the process
              prescribed by UGC.



              6. One increment shall be admissible to a teacher who acquires
              an M.Phil/M.Litt. degree, while three advance increments shall
              be admissible to a teacher who acquires Ph.D./D.Litt/D.Sc in
              his/her service career. Provided further, the number of
              increments shall not exceed three if a teacher acquires both the
              degrees in his/her service career.



                                                                   Sd/-

                                                                Registrar"





11.           The NEHU i.e. respondents No.3-6 filed joint affidavit-in-

opposition in the present writ petition. It is the case of the respondents No.3-

6 in their joint affidavit-in-opposition stated that as per the enabling provision

of the MHRD Scheme contained in the letter dated 31st December 2008 and

direction of the UGC vide its letter dated 28th February 2009, pending receipt

of Fitment Tables for final fixation of revised pay scale in the pay band and

Academic Grade Pay prepared by the UGC, the basic revised pay scale of

the writ petitioner had been provisionally fixed at Rs. 51,850/- for the purpose

of facilitating the release of 40% of the arrear, however, on receipt of the

Fitment Table the Writ Petitioner had been placed in the appropriate pay

fixation. The representation/appeal of the writ petitioner had been duly

considered, however, the same could not be entertained as the writ petitioner

had been ultimately placed in the appropriate pay fixation to the

corresponding revised pay scale as per the Fitments Table. It is further

stated that incentive like three advance increments is contemplated purely for

additional qualification of a teacher of the University, but Ph.D. is a minimum

requirement for the post of a professor which the Writ Petitioner is holding

and the claim of the writ Petitioner for advance increments for his possessing

Ph.D. is totally misconceived. However, it is stated that "the pay of a directly

recruited professor shall be fixed at a stage not below Rs. 43,000/- in the pay

band IV of Rs. 37,400-67,000, with applicable AGP of Rs. 10,000/-" in





                                                                          Page 12 of 31

 respect of Professor recruited on or after 01.01.2006, as would be evident

from the gazette notifying the UGC Regulation 2010 where in the letter from

Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Human Resource Development addressed to

UGC printed along with Authenticated Fitment Tables. It is stated that the

Fitment Tables are for fixation of pay of existing incumbents who were in

position as on 01.01.2006.





12.           The NEHU in their joint affidavit-in-opposition further stated that

"the University may take action to adopt the above Government of India

Scheme for University and its colleges and payment of pay scales,

enhancement of retirement age and release of 40% arrears during the

current financial year in accordance with these provisions. The commission

was in the process of finalizing Regulations in consultation with the

stakeholders. The Fitment Tables for fixation of salary was likely to be

received from the Central Government shortly which would be circulated to

all Universities and would also be placed on UGC Website. The provisional

payment may be made after taking an Undertaking from every beneficiary

under the scheme to the effect that any excess payment made on account of

incorrect fixation of pay in the Pay Band or Academic Grade Pay shall be

adjusted against the future payments due. Hence, it is amply clear from the

spirit of the said provisional fixation of pay scale of the writ petitioner that

pending receipt of Fitment Tables for final fixation of Pay in the Pay Band or

Academic Grade Pay by the University, 40% of the arrears was released on

provisional fixation basis to the beneficiaries on obtaining an Undertaking

from such beneficiaries to the effect that in case of incorrect fixation, the

same shall be adjusted against the future payments due". The factual matrix

of the subject matter being so, the allegation of "downgrading" as leveled by

the Petitioner holds no merit. The fixation of the Petitioner's Salary at Rs.

51,850/- was a provisional one solely for the purposes of releasing 40% of





                                                                         Page 13 of 31

 the arrears to him pending receipt of Fitment Table from the UGC. The figure

of Rs. 48,870/- was arrived at after final fixation of the Petitioner's pay in the

light of Fitment Tables received subsequently. Similar exercise was done in

case of others who were/are similarly placed with the Petitioner as per terms

and conditions of said UGC and Govt. of India, MHRD letters. Hence, in the

light of the above, describing an appropriate fixation in a grade as

"downgrading" by the Petitioner amounts to blatant misinterpretations and

distortion of facts. In fact, the        Petitioner has misinterpreted and

misrepresented the spirit of the aforesaid letters of the UGC and Govt. of

India, thereby misleading the Hon'ble Court. Further, suppression of vital fact

as to the Petitioner himself executing the Undertaking dated 06.03.2009 in

order to receive 40% of arrears based on provisional fixation as mentioned

earlier, speaks volumes of the ulterior motive with which this Writ Petition has

been filed. The question of giving Show cause notice for placing the Writ

Petitioner in the appropriate revised pay scale as per the Fitment Table does

not arise as the same is not a penal action and the University has merely

acted as per the directives of the UGC/MHRD in so far as the fixation of pay

of teachers are concerned in accordance with the approved Fitment Table in

this regard and for which an Undertaking had been duly executed by the Writ

Petitioner.





13.           It is the further case of the NEHU in their joint affidavit-in-

opposition that as per the provision of Scheme of MHRD for pay revision of

Central   University   teacher    contained    in    Letter    dated    31.12.2008,

recommendation of UGC the revised pay scale of the Petitioner had been

fixed provisionally for the purpose of releasing 40% of the arrear, however,

on receipt of Fitment Table from MHRD the Petitioner had been placed in

appropriate   pay   fixation   corresponding    to    the     revised   scale.    The

representation/appeal filed by the Petitioner had been duly considered,





                                                                            Page 14 of 31

 however, for reasons as stated above the same could not be entertained.

The petitioner cannot claim for the advance increments inasmuch as, every

Pay Commission used to give incentives in the form of advance increments

especially to teachers/Assistant Professors for possessing M.Phil and Ph.D

Degrees. However, the Vth Pay Commission did not provide for any advance

increment for movement into grade of Reader and above for possession of

Ph.D Degree because possession of Ph.D has been prescribed as the

minimum requirement/qualification for the aforesaid posts. In the instant

case, the Petitioner was appointed as Reader in the University on

08.12.1984. Further UGC Regulation 2010 also stipulates that the Ph.D shall

be mandatory qualification for the appointment of Professor and promotion

as Professor. The Petitioner was appointed as Professor in the University on

12.07.1991, thus on the date on which the writ petitioner was appointed as

Reader and Professor, the minimum qualification prescribed by UGC was

Ph.D. Therefore, he is not entitled to the incentives of advance increment.




14.           It is clear from the joint affidavit-in-opposition filed by the NEHU

that the UGC under the letter dated 28.02.2009 to the Vice Chancellor,

NEHU, clearly stated that the University may take action to adopt the Govt. of

India scheme for University and its colleges and its affiliated colleges and

payment of pay scales, enhancement of retirement age and release of 40%

of the arrears during the current financial year in accordance with these

provisions and the fitments table for fixation of salary was likely to be

received from the Central Govt. very shortly. While awaiting the fitments table

for fixation of salary, the NEHU provisionally fixed the revised pay scale of

the petitioner as on 01.01.2006 at Rs.51,850/-+10,000/- and as per the

directions of the UGC under the said letter dated 28.02.2009, the NEHU had

obtained the undertaking from the petitioner that any excess payment made

to him as a result of incorrect fixation of pay in the revised scale of pay or on





                                                                          Page 15 of 31

 account of any other reason which is detected subsequently will be refunded

by him to the University either by way of adjustment against future payment

due to him or otherwise as may be decided by the authority. The said letter of

the UGC dated 28.02.2009 and the said undertaking of the petitioner are

quoted hereunder:-

15.          The UGC also filed affidavit-in-opposition in the present writ

petition. The University Grants Commission (hereinafter to be referred as

"the Commission") has been constituted under the provisions of the


University Grants Commission Act, 1956
 (Act No.3 of 1956) which came into

force w.e.f. 5.11.1956. The Act was enacted to make provisions for the co-



ordination and determination of standards in universities. The Commission

under the provisions of the Act has been entrusted with the duty to take such

steps as it may think fit for the promotion and co-ordination of university

education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of

teaching, examination and research in universities. For the said purpose, the





                                                                      Page 17 of 31

 Commission has been vested with the power to recommend to any university

the measures necessary for the improvement of university education and

advised the universities upon the action to be taken for the purpose of

implementation of such recommendation. The Commission is also authorized

to perform such other functions as may be prescribed or as may be deemed

necessary by the Commission for advancing the cause of higher education in

India or as may be incidental or conducive to the discharge of its functions.



Section 26
 of the Act which gives power to the Commission to make

regulations consistent with the Act, permits the Commission to define the

qualifications that should ordinarily be required of any person to be appointed

to the teaching staff of the university, having regard to the branch of

education in which the applicant is expected to give instruction. The

Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development,

Government of India vide its letter dated 31.12.2008 addressed to the

Secretary, UGC informed regarding the scheme of revision of pay of

teachers and equivalent cadres in universities and colleges following the

revision of pay scales of Central Government employees on the

recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission. In the said letter, it

was informed to the UGC that the Government of India has decided, after

taking into consideration the recommendations made by the UGC based on

the decisions taken at the meeting of the Commission held on 7-8 October,

2008, to revise the pay scales of teachers in the central universities. The

revision of pay scales of teachers shall be subjected to various provisions of

the scheme of revision of pay scales as contained in the letter and

regulations to be framed by the UGC in this behalf in accordance with the

scheme given in the letter. The revised pay scales and other provisions of

the scheme was stipulated in para 1 to 12 of the said letter.



                                                                       Page 18 of 31


 16.           It is further stated that so far as the applicability of the scheme

is concerned, it has been stipulated in para 8 (p) of the letter to the following

effect:-



       8(p)(i) This scheme shall be applicable to teachers and              other
       equivalent cadres of Library and Physical Education in all the Central
       Universities and colleges there-under and the institutions deemed to
       be Universities whose maintenance expenditure is met by the UGC.
       The implementation of the revised scales shall be subject to the
       acceptance of all the condition mentioned in this letter as well as
       Regulations to be framed by the UGC in this behalf. Universities
       implementing this scheme shall be advised by the UGC to amend their
       relevant statutes and Ordinances in line with the UGC Regulations
       within three month from the date of issue of this letter."



              Further, clause 8(P)(v) deals with the applicability of the

scheme to Universities, colleges and other higher educational institutions

which comes under the purview of the state legislature and the following has

been stipulated:-





       8(P)(V): "this scheme may be extended to Universities, colleges and
       other higher educational institutions coming under the purview of the
       state legislatures, provided State Governments wish to adopt and
       implement the scheme subject to the following terms and conditions:-



       (a) Financial assistance from the Central Government to State
           Governments opting to revise pay scales of teachers and other
           equivalent cadre covered under the Scheme shall be limited to the
           extent of 80% (eighty percent) of the additional expenditure
           involved in the implementation of the revision.



       (b) The state government opting for revision of pay shall meet the
           remaining 20% (twenty percent) of the additional expenditure from
           its own sources.



       (c) Financial assistance referred to in sub-clause (a) above shall be
           provided for the period from 1.01.2006 to 31.03.2010.



                                                                         Page 19 of 31


       (d) The entire liability on account of revision of pay scales etc. of
          university and college teachers shall be taken over by the State
          Government opting for revision of pay scales with effect from
          1.4.2010.



      (e) Financial assistance from the Central Government shall be
          restricted to revision of pay scales in respect of only those posts
          which were in existence and had been filled up as on 1.01.2006.



      (f) State Government taking into consideration other local conditions,
          may also decide in their discretion, to introduce scales of pay
          higher than those mentioned in this Scheme, and may give effect
          to the revised bands/scales of pay from a date on or after
          1.01.2006; however, in such cases the details of modifications
          proposed shall be furnished to the Central Government and
          Central assistance shall be restricted to the Pay Bands as
          approved by the Central Government and not to any higher scale
          of pay fixed by the State Government (s).





      (g) Payment of Central assistance for implementing this scheme is
          also subject to the condition that the entire scheme of revision of
          pay scales, together with all the conditions to be laid down by the
          UGC by way of Regulations and other guidelines shall be
          implemented by State Governments and Universities and Colleges
          coming under their jurisdiction as a composite scheme without any
          modification except in regard to the date of implementation and
          scales of pay mentioned herein above.





17.          It is also stated that after receiving the aforesaid letter dated

31.12.2008, the UGC constituted an expert committee to consider the issues

and suggest follow up action as also to frame the regulation as contemplated

in the said letter dated 31.12.2008. Subsequently, in exercise of the powers

conferred under clause (e) and (g) of sub-section (1) of 
Section 26
 of

University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (3 of 1956), and in pursuance of the

MHRD O.M.No. F.23-7/2008-IFD dated 23rd October, 2008, read with





                                                                      Page 20 of 31

 Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) O.M.No.F.1-1/2008-IC

dated 30th August, 2008, and in terms of the MHRD Notification No.1-

32/2006-U.II/U.I(1) issued on 31st December, 2008 and in supersession of

the University Grants Commission (Minimum Qualifications Required for the

Appointment and Career Advancement of Teachers in Universities and

Institutions affiliated to it) Regulations, 2000, issued by University Grants

Commission vide Regulation No. F.3-1/2000 (PS) dated 4th April, 2000,

together with all amendments made therein from time to time, the University

Grants Commission framed the University Grants Commission (Minimum

Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staff in

Universities and Colleges and other Measures for the Maintenance of

Standards in Higher Education) Regulations, 2010.





18.           The NEHU and UGC clearly stated in their respective affidavits-

in-opposition that incentives like three increments are contemplated purely

for additional qualification of a teacher of the University but Ph.D. degree is a

minimum qualification for the post of Professor, which the petitioner is

holding and the claim of the petitioner for advance increments of his

possessing Ph.D. is totally misconceived. There cannot be incentives in the

form of advance increments for possessing minimum qualification of Ph.D.

degree for the post of Professor. The incentives according to the normal

service parlance which the ordinary employee or layman understood is that

the incentives are given to the employee for acquiring additional qualification.

Holding of Ph.D. degree is an additional qualification of a teacher holding the

post of teacher for which Ph.D. degree is not an essential qualification and

there cannot be incentives in the form of advance increments for holding

minimum essential/basic qualification i.e. Ph.D. degree for the post of

Professor. The UGC under the letter dated 24.07.2002 to all the Registrars of

the Universities clarified that these two increments shall not be admissible to





                                                                         Page 21 of 31

 teachers, who were recruited/promoted to a post for which Ph.D. was an

essential qualification. The said letter dated 24.07.2002 of the UGC reads as

follows:-

              Sir, Madam,


                     The UGC vide its letter of even number dated 31.8.2001,
              had extended the benefit of two advance increments to
              teachers who acquired Ph.D. during service prior to 1.1.96 and
              who did not get the benefit of any advance increments as per
              earlier Career Advancement Scheme. These advance
              increments were payable with effect from 27.7.98.



                     It is clarified that these two advance increments shall not
              be admissible to teachers, who were recruited/promoted to a
              post for which Ph.D. was an essential qualification.



                                                         Yours faithfully,
                                                               Sd/-

                                                         Deputy Secretary"



19.           There is no room for interpretation of the incentives in the

manner the petitioner pleaded in the present writ petition that he would be

entitled to receive the advance increments in the form of incentives for

having Ph.D. degree. The said letter dated 24.07.2002 clearly speaks that

the advance increments shall not be admissible to teachers, who were

recruited/promoted to a post for which Ph.D. degree was an essential

qualification. It is fairly well settled law that when the legislature has spoken,

the judges cannot afford to be wiser. (Reference may be made to the

decision of the Apex Court in 
Shri. Mandir Sita Ramji v. Governor of Delhi





                                                                          Page 22 of 31

 & Ors
 reported inAIR 1974 SC 1868). The petitioner, it appears, had

misunderstood the basic principle of construction of statue while interpreting

the scheme of revision of pay of teachers and equivalent cadres in the

universities following the revision of pay scales of Central Govt. employees

on the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission i.e. the said

scheme dated 31.12.2008 and the said Regulations on minimum

qualifications for appointment of teachers and other academic staff in the

universities and colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in

higher education 2010 and the said fitments table for fixation of salary i.e.

Table 5 to the said UGC Regulations 2010.






20.           It is, no doubt, well settled that it is the basic principle of

construction of statute that the same should be read as a whole, then chapter

by chapter, section by section and word by word. Recourse to construction or

interpretation of statute is necessary when there is ambiguity, obscurity, or

in-consistency therein and not otherwise. An effort should be made to give

effect to all parts of the statute and unless absolutely necessary, no part

thereof shall be rendered superfluous or redundant. True meaning of a

provision of law is to be determined on the basis of what it provides by its

clear language, with due regard to the scheme of law (Reference may be

made to 
Bhavnagar University Vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. & Ors
,

reported in (2003) 2 SCC 111.
 
It is cardinal rule of construction that no word

should be construed redundant or surplus in interpreting the provision of a

statute or rule (Ref: 
Dinesh Chandra Sangma Vs. State of Assam & Ors
:


AIR 1978 SC 17). The Apex Court in 
State of Maharashtra & Ors. Vs.

Santosh Shanker Acharya
: (2000) 7 SCC 463 held that it is too well known

principle of construction of statute that the legislature engrafted every part of

the statue for a purpose. The legislative intention is that every part of the

statute should be given effect. Legislature is deemed not to waste its words





                                                                         Page 23 of 31

 or to say anything in vain and a construction which attributes redundancy to

the legislature will not be accepted except for compelling reasons.
 
The Apex

Court in 
Bhavnagar University Vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd. & Ors.
:




(2003) 2 SCC 111 held that it is the basic principle of construction of statute

that statutory enactment must ordinarily be construed according to their plain

meaning and no words should be added, altered or modified unless it is

plainly necessary to do so to prevent a provision from being unintelligible,

absurd, unreasonable, unworkable or totally irreconcilable with the rest of the

statute.



21.          The Apex Court in State of Gujrat & Anr v. Justice R.A.

Mehta (Retired) & Ors: (2013) 3 SCC 1 held that:





             "96. In the process of statutory construction, the court must
             construe the Act before it, bearing in mind the legal maxim ut
             res magis valeat quam pereat which means it is better for a
             thing to have effect than for it to be made void, i.e., a statute
             must be construed in such a manner, so as to make it
             workable. Viscount Simon, L.C. in Nokes v. Doncaster
             Amalgamated Collieries Ltd.: 1940 AC 1014: (1940) 3 All ER
             549 (HL) stated as follows: (AC p.1022)

                    "......if the choice is between two interpretations, the
                    narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest
                    purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a
                    construction which would reduce the legislation to futility
                    and should rather accept the bolder construction based
                    on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the
                    purpose of bringing about an effective result."



             97. Similarly in Whitney v. IRC: 1926 AC 37 (HL), it was
             observed as under: (AC p.52)


                    "...... A statute is designed to be workable, and the
                    interpretation thereof by a court should be to secure that
                    object, unless crucial omission or clear direction makes
                    that end unattainable."





             98. The doctrine of purposive construction may be taken
             recourse to for the purpose of giving full effect to statutory
             provisions, and the courts must state what meaning the statute
             should bear, rather than rendering the statute a nullity, as





                                                                       Page 24 of 31

             statutes are meant to be operative and not inept. The courts
            must refrain from declaring a statute to be unworkable. The
            rules of interpretation require that construction, which carries
            forward the objectives of the statute, protects interest of the
            parties and keeps the remedy alive, should be preferred,
            looking into the text and context of the statute. Construction
            given by the court must promote the object of the statute and
            serve the purpose for which it has been enacted and not efface
            its very purpose. "The courts strongly lean against any
            construction which tends to reduce a statute to futility. The
            provision of the statute must be so construed so as to make it
            effective and operative." The court must take a pragmatic view
            and must keep in mind the purpose for which the statute was
            enacted, as the purpose of law itself provides good guidance to
            courts as they interpret the true meaning of the Act and thus,
            legislative futility must be ruled out. A statute must be
            construed in such a manner so as to ensure that the Act itself
            does not become a dead letter, and the obvious intention of the
            legislature does not stand defeated, unless it leads to a case of
            absolute intractability in use. The court must adopt a
            construction which suppresses the mischief and advances the
            remedy and "to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for
            continuance of the mischief, and pro privato commodo, and to
            add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true
            intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico". The court
            must give effect to the purpose and object of the Act for the
            reason that legislature is presumed to have enacted a
            reasonable statute. (Vide: M. Pentiah v. Muddala
            Veeramallappa: AIR 1961 SC 1107, S.P. Jain v. Krishna

22.        The Apex Court in 
Raghunath Rai Bareja & Anr v. Punjab

National Bank & Ors
: (2007) 2 SCC 230 held that:






 
"40. It may be mentioned in this connection that the first and
            foremost principle of interpretation of a statute in every system
            of interpretation is the literal rule of interpretation. The other
            rules of interpretation e.g. the mischief rule, purposive
            interpretation, etc. can only be resorted to when the plain words
            of a statute are ambiguous or lead to no intelligible results or if
            read literally would nullify the very object of the statute. Where
            the words of a statute are absolutely clear and unambiguous,
            recourse cannot be had to the principles of interpretation other
            than the literal rule, vide 
Swedish Match AB vs. Securities
            and Exchange Board of India
: (2004) 11 SCC 641: AIR 2004





                                                                       Page 25 of 31

               SC 4219.
 
As held in 
Prakash Nath Khanna v. C.I.T.
: (2004) 9
              SCC 686, the language employed in a statute is the
              determinative factor of the legislative intent. The legislature is
              presumed to have made no mistake. The presumption is that it
              intended to say what it has said.
 
Assuming there is a defect or
              an omission in the words used by the legislature, the Court
              cannot correct or make up the deficiency, especially when a
              literal reading thereof produces an intelligible result, vide 
Delhi
              Financial Corpn. v. Rajiv Anand
: (2004) 11 SCC 625.
 
Where
              the legislative intent is clear from the language, the Court
              should give effect to it, vide 
Government of A.P. v. Road
              Rollers Owners Welfare Assn.
: (2004) 6 SCC 210 and the
              Court should not seek to amend the law in the garb of
              interpretation.




 
46. The rules of interpretation other than the literal rule would
              come into play it there is any doubt with regard to the express
              language used or if the plain meaning would lead to an
              absurdity. Where the words are unequivocal, there is no scope
              for importing any rule of interpretation vide 
Pandian Chemicals
              Ltd. v. CIT
: (2003) 5 SCC 590.




 
47. It is only where the provisions of a statue are ambiguous
              that the court can depart from a literal or strict construction vide
              
Nasiruddin v. Sita Ram Agarwal
: (2003) 2 SCC 577: AIR
              2003 SC 1543.
 
Where the words of a statue are plain and
              unambiguous effect must be given to them vide 
Bhaiji v. Sub-
              Divisional Officer
: (2003) 1 SCC 692."




23.           Wisdom and advisability of economic policies are ordinarily not

amendable to judicial review unless it can be demonstrated that the policy is

contrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution. In other words, it is not

for the courts to consider relative merits of different economic policies and

consider whether a wiser or better one can be evolved. In matters relating to

economic issues, the Government has, while taking a decision, right to "trial

and error" as long as both trial and error are bona fide and within limits of

authority. For testing the correctness of a policy, the appropriate forum is

Parliament and not the courts. Here the policy was tested and the motion

defeated in the Lok Sabha on 1-3-2001. (Ref: 
Balco Employees' Union

(Regd) v. Union of India & Ors
: (2002) 2 SCC 333).






                                                                          Page 26 of 31


 
24.          The policy decision/ or decision of the UGC for revision of pay

scales of teachers on the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay

Commission is not amendable to judicial review unless it can be

demonstrated that the policy is contrary to any statutory provision or the

constitution. The Apex Court in 
State of U.P. & Ors v. U.P. State Tax

Officers Grade II Assn.
 reported in (2003) 6 SCC 250 held that the

decision of expert body like the pay commission is not ordinarily subject to

judicial review obviously because pay fixation is an exercise requiring to go

into various aspects of the posts held in various services and nature of duties

of the employees.
 
The Apex Court in 
K.T. Veerappa & Ors v. State of

Karnataka
: (2006) 9 SCC 406 held that Court should interfere with

administrative decision pertaining to pay fixation and pay parity when they

find such a decision to be unreasonable, unjust and prejudicial to a section of

employees and taken in ignorance of material and relevant factors.
 
Para 13

of the SCC in 
K.T. Verrappa
's case (Supra) reads as follows:-


             "13. He next contended that fixation of pay and parity in duties
             is the function of the executive and financial capacity of the
             Govt. and the priority given to different types of posts under the
             prevailing policies of the Government are also relevant factors.
             
In support of this contention, he has placed reliance on State of
             Haryana v. Haryana Civil Secretariat Personal Staff Assn. and
             
Union of India v. S.B. Vohra
.
 There is no dispute nor can there
             be any to the principles as settled in State of Haryana v.
             Haryana Civil Secretariat Personal Staff Assn. that fixation of
             pay and determination of parity in duties is the function of the
             executive and the scope of judicial review of administrative
             decision in this regard is very limited. However, it is also equally
             well settled that the courts should interfere with administrative
             decisions pertaining to pay fixation and pay parity when they
             find such a decision to be unreasonable, unjust and prejudicial
             to a section of employees and taken in ignorance of material
             and relevant factors."



25.          It is the further case of the petitioner that the petitioner was not

given an opportunity of being heard before taking decision of the NEHU for

revision of pay scale of the petitioner by the impugned order dated





                                                                         Page 27 of 31

 04.12.2009. The petitioner clearly misunderstood that in the present case,

there is no question of reducing pay scale of the petitioner vide impugned

order dated 04.12.2009 as a punishment and in such case, there is no

question of giving show cause notice to the petitioner before passing the

impugned order dated 04.12.2009. Over and above, there is no requirement

of giving prior notice to the employees in the case of taking policy decision or

the decision in general for the employees by the State Govt. or its

instrumentalities. The Apex Court in 
Balco Employees' Union
 case (Supra)

held that employees of such PSUs have no right of pre-decisional notice in

taking the policy decision involving the pay scales of the employees. Any

consequential effect of the policy decision the general decision of the

authority to the conditions of service shall be taken as an incidence of

service.
 
Paras 48 & 49 of the SCC in 
Balco Employees' Union
 case (Supra)

read as follows:-






 
"48. Merely because the workmen may have protection of
              
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution, by regarding BALCO as
              a State, it does not mean that the erstwhile sole shareholder
              viz. Government had to give the workers prior notice of hearing
              before deciding to disinvest. There is no principle of natural
              justice which requires prior notice and hearing to persons who
              are generally affected as a class by an economic policy
              decision of the Government. If the abolition of a post pursuant
              to a policy decision does not attract the provisions of 
Article 311

              of the Constitution as held in 
State of Haryana vs. Des Raj
              Sangar
: (1976) 2 SSC 844: 1976 SCC (L&S) 336 on the same
              parity of reasoning, the policy of disinvestment cannot be
              faulted if as a result thereof the employees lose their rights or
              protection under 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution. In other
              words, the existence of rights of protection under 
Articles 14

              and 
16
 of the Constitution cannot possibly have the effect of
              vetoing the Government's right to disinvest. Nor can the
              employees claim a right of continuous consultation at different
              stages of the disinvestment process. If the disinvestment
              process is gone through without contravening any law, then the
              normal consequences as a result of disinvestment must follow.




              49. The Government could have run the industry
              departmentally or in any other form. When it chooses to run an
              industry by forming a company and it becomes its shareholder
              then under the provisions of the 
Companies Act
 as a
              shareholder, it would have a right to transfer its shares. When





                                                                         Page 28 of 31

              persons seek and get employment with such a company
             registered under the 
Companies Act
, it must be presumed that
             they accept the right of the Directors and the shareholders to
             conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with law and
             at the same time they can exercise the right to sell their
             shares."



26.          It is well settled that when there is a conflict between law and

equity, it is the law which has to prevail. The Apex Court in 
Raghunath Rai

Bareja
's case (Supra) held that:






             "29. ................... that it is well settled that when there is a
             conflict between law and equity, it is the law which has to
             prevail, in accordance with the Latin maxim "dura lex sed lex"

             which means "the law is hard, but it is the law". Equity can only
             supplement the law, but it cannot supplant or override it."





27.          The Apex Court in 
Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd., & Anr v. Ajit

Kumar & Ors
: (2008) 11 SCC 591 held that a bona fide mistake does not

confer any right on any party and bona fide mistake can be corrected. In that

case, the respondents are allowed to enjoy wrong payment of D.A. on

account of some errors or bona fide mistakes; and the said bona fide

mistakes had been corrected.
 
Paras 46 & 47 of the SCC in 
Videsh Sanchar

Nigam Ltd.
 case (Supra) read as follows:-






             "46. It is well settled that a bona fide mistake does not confer
             any right on any party and it can be corrected. VSNL vide
             subsequent Office Order bearing Ref. No. HQ-A/01-04/91-PE1
             dated 18-10-1995 had rectified its mistake appearing in earlier
             order dated 3-9-1993 and the said office order was again
             modified by another Office Order bearing No. HQ-8A/01-04/91-
             PE1 dated 19-12-1995 by which Para 2(A) of the Office Order
             dated 18-10-1995 was modified to the extent as stated in the
             earlier part of this judgment. The modified order was a one-time
             exercise for choosing the alternatives of settlement of pension
             and the pensioners were required to submit their consent to the





                                                                      Page 29 of 31

               regional heads in a prescribed format by 15-1-1996. The
              Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances
              and Pension (DP & PW), New Delhi, issued OM dated 22-11-
              1996 (Annexure P-14) which is the nodal department of the
              Government of India for taking policy decisions on pensionary
              matters sent clarificatory order, a copy thereof was sent to the
              Ministry     of     Telecommunications,       Department      of
              Communications, dealing with the subject of payment of
              pension to the employees of erstwhile OCS who were absorbed
              in VSNL.



              47.    
In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the
              benefit of DR of the CDA scales, which had been given to the
              respondent retirees by mistake at the time of their retirement, is
              not to be given again as clarified by the Government of India
              from time to time in their various office memoranda 
referred to
              above
 and the respondent retirees are entitled to pension to be
              calculated on emoluments in the IDA pay scales."




28.           The Apex Court in 
Union of India & Anr v. Narendra Singh
:


(2008) 2 SCC 750 held that mistakes are mistakes and they can always be

corrected by following due process of law. Para 32 of the SCC in 
Narendra

Singh
's case (Supra) reads as follows:-




              "32. It is true that the mistake was of the Department and the
              respondent was promoted though he was not eligible and
              qualified. But, we cannot countenance the submission of the
              respondent that the mistake cannot be corrected. Mistakes are
              mistakes and they can always be corrected by following due
              process of law. In ICAR v. T.K. Suryanarayan: (1997) 6 SCC
              766 it was held that if erroneous promotion is given by wrongly
              interpreting the rules, the employer cannot be prevented from
              applying the rules rightly and in correcting the mistake. It may
              cause hardship to the employees but a court of law cannot
              ignore statutory rules."



29.           For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the considered view

that the petitioner had utterly failed to make out a case that the revision of

pay scale of the petitioner under the decision of NEHU in compliance with the

UGC Regulations, 2010 was in ignorance of material and relevant factors

and also that the NEHU cannot be prevented from correcting the mistake in

the provisional fixation of the revised pay scale of the writ petitioner.





                                                                            Page 30 of 31


 30.   The writ petition is devoid of merit; and accordingly dismissed.
