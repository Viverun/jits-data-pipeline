5.      The petitioners were at the doors of this Court

seeking consideration of their cases for regularization in Writ

Petition No.100103 of 2021, which comes to be disposed by an

order         dated     27.01.2021     directing   consideration       of   the

representations submitted by these petitioners for regularisation

of their services within two months from the date of receipt of

copy of the said order. The result of the direction is the

impugned endorsement dated 12.09.2022, which declines to

accept the claim of these petitioners for regularisation of their

services on the score that the claim runs counter to the

judgment of the Apex Court in the case of 
SECRETARY, STATE

OF KARNATAKA VS. UMADEVI
 (3)1.




 
6.      The petitioners again had approached this Court in

Writ Petition No.100174 of 2023 in which the endorsement dated

12.09.2022 was not challenged. The Co-ordinate Bench of this

Court        disposed    the   writ   petition   reserving   liberty   to   the

petitioners to raise a challenge to the said endorsement. As an

offshoot of the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench in Writ

Petition No.100174 of 2023 comes the impugned endorsement

dated 23.07.2024, rejecting the claim of the petitioners on the

very same ground that the petitioners have not completed 10

years of service as on the cut-off date as obtaining in the

judgment of the Apex Court in the case of 
UMADEVI
 (3)

(supra). It is the aforesaid endorsements that have driven these

petitioners to this Court in the subject petitions.




      7.     Learned counsel Smt. Sanjana S.Mudhol representing

the petitioners would vehemently contend that the petitioners

have been in continuous employment as waterman and driver in

the fourth respondent Municipal Council without any break. It is

more than 20 years each of these petitioners have been working.



The   two    directions   of   consideration    of     their   cases   for

regularisation at the hands of this Court have become no avail

for the reason that the State is now wanting to rely on the

judgment of the Apex Court in the case of 
UMADEVI
 (3)

(supra) to deny the claim of the petitioners.
 
Learned counsel

submits that the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of


UMADEVI
       (3)   (supra)     is     distinguished    in     subsequent

judgments.

8.    Learned   HCGP    would     vehemently   refute   the

submission to contend that as on the date of rendering of the

judgment of the Apex Court in the case of 
UMADEVI
 (3)

(supra), none of the petitioners had completed 10 years of

service. Therefore, the claim of these petitioners cannot be

considered. The other submission is that in the year 2017, the

list of eligible candidates for the purpose of regularisation was

already notified by the Municipal Council, in which the names of

the petitioners were not found. No objections were filed by these

petitioners or their claim was never registered that they are

entitled for regularisation at the relevant point in time and

therefore, learned counsel submits that this Court should not

entertain the plea of these petitioners seeking regularisation at

this juncture.




      9.    Learned counsel Shri Srinand Pachhapure appearing

for respondent No.4 submits that they have recommended the

cases of these petitioners for regularisation and communicated to

the State on 15.01.2025 and therefore submits that he has no

further say in the matter as it is the State which has to pass an

order.

     10.   I have given my anxious consideration to the

submissions of the learned counsel for parties and have perused

the material on record.



 
11.   The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The dates

on which the petitioners entered employment is charted herein

above. The dates are again not in dispute. The issue is whether

these petitioners would become entitled to consideration of their

cases for regularisation or otherwise. The petitioners were twice

over before this Court seeking consideration of their cases for

regularisation, which all come to be rejected by the impugned

endorsements. The endorsement is that the petitioners had not

completed 10 years of service as on the date of the rendering of

the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of 
UMADEVI
 (3)

(supra), which is on 10.04.2006. It is germane to notice that in

identical circumstances this Court in Writ Petition No.107774 of

2023 and connected matters concerning a different Municipal

Council had directed regularisation of those petitioners by the

following order:




             12. "The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute,
     they are all a matter of record, the dates link in the chain
     of events, the appointment of the petitioners, are all
     again a matter of record and undisputed facts. The
     petitioners have as on today rendered 33, 29, 28 & 26

     years respectively in the 4th respondent - Municipality,
     be it in the cadre of cleaner, sweeper, poura karmika or a
     driver, nonetheless they are all working in the 4th
     respondent-Municipality, from the respective dates of
     their appointment. Uninterruptedly, till 2025         i.e.,
     today, the employment of these petitioners, are not
     litigious as their services are never continued on the
     basis of any interim order granted at the hands of this
     Court. They are in continuous employment owing their
     necessity in the 4th respondent- Municipality and the
     necessity still prevails. The 4th respondent has filed its
     statement of objections, where it is admitted that the
     petitioners are working from the dates of the respective
     engagements till today. The contention of the State that
     regularization orders should not be passed for the
     asking is noted only to be rejected as these petitioners
     have toiled in the 4th respondent - Municipality at their
     prime luth right from 33 years, 26 years respectively.
     Today, they are all aged between 56 to 60 years. If today
     they are sent home without any benefit of regularization,
     they would be wondering in their retired life.

In identical circumstances, the Apex Court in
     the case of 
Shripal vs. Nagar Nigam
 reported in 2025
     SSC OnLine SC 221 has held as follows:




                "3. The factual matrix leading              up   to
           the appeal before us is as follows:



                        The Appellant Workmen claim to have
           been engaged as Gardeners (Malis) in the
           Horticulture   Department of the Respondent
           Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam, since the year
           1998 (in some instances, since 1999). According
           to them, they continuously discharged horticultural
           and maintenance duties-- such as planting trees,
           maintaining parks, and beautifying public spaces--
           under the direct supervision of the Respondent
           Employer. They further allege that no formal
           appointment letters were ever issued to them, and
           that they were persistently denied minimum wages,
           weekly offs, national holidays, and other statutory
           benefits.



                           In    2004, the Appellant Workmen,

         employees, raised an industrial dispute (C.B. Case
         No. 6 of 2004) before the Conciliation Officer at
         Ghaziabad, seeking regularization of their services
         and the requisite statutory benefits. They contend
         that, upon learning of this demand, the
         Respondent Employer began delaying their salaries
         and subjected them to adverse working conditions.
         Eventually, around mid-July 2005, the services of
         numerous workmen were allegedly terminated
         orally, without any notice, written orders, or
         retrenchment compensation.



                      Since the above termination took place
         during     the   pendency    of   the   conciliation
         proceedings, the Appellant Workmen argue it
         violated 
Section 6E
 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes
         Act, 1947. Consequently, the State Government
         referred the     disputes   concerning both (i)
         regularization and


               (ii) legality of the alleged termination, to the
         Labour Court, Ghaziabad for adjudication.



                      The Labour Court proceeded to decide
         the references vide two orders:



         (i)    Order dated 03.06.2011 : In numerous
                adjudication cases (e.g., Adjudication Case
                Nos. 448, 451, 467 of 2006, etc.), the Labour
                Court     passed    awards    holding      the
                terminations illegal for want of compliance
                with 
Section 6N
 of the U.P. Industrial
                Disputes     Act,    1947,   and      directed
                reinstatement with 30% back wages.



         (ii)   Order dated 11.10.2011 : However, in
                about 41 other adjudication cases (e.g.,
                Adjudication Case Nos. 269, 270, 272,
                etc.), the Labour Court arrived at a
                contrary conclusion, dismissing the claims
                on the finding that the concerned workmen
                had not been engaged directly by the Nagar
                Nigam but rather through a contractor, and
                hence    had   no    enforceable  right  to
                reinstatement or regularization against the
                Respondent Employer.

                Aggrieved by the adverse portion of the
         awards (i.e., those granting reinstatement), the
         Respondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam,
         filed several writ petitions before the High Court of
         Judicature at Allahabad, challenging the Labour
         Court's findings. On the other hand, the workmen
         whose claims were dismissed by the other set of
         awards also approached the High Court by filing
         their own writ petitions. All these writ petitions
         were heard together, culminating in the common
         judgment dated 01.03.2019, which partly modified
         the Labour Court's conclusions.



               Through the impugned judgment, the
         High Court held that while the Labour Court
         was correct in exercising jurisdiction under
         the 
U.P. Industrial Disputes Act
 (since
         municipalities could be treated as "industry"),
         there remained factual complexities as to
         whether the workmen were genuinely on the
         rolls of the Nagar Nigam or were provided by
         contractors. The High Court also noted that
         the      State     Government       had,    by
         notifications/orders, placed a ban on fresh
         recruitments    in   Municipal    Corporations,
         thereby restricting direct appointments to any
         post.



              Ultimately, the High Court partially
         modified the relief granted, directing re-
         engagement of the workmen on daily wages,
         with pay equivalent to the minimum in the
         regular pay scale of Gardeners, while allowing
         future consideration of their regularization if
         permissible by law.



                4.    Both the Appellant Workmen and the
         Respondent Employer have now approached this
         Court by way of Special Leave Petitions. The
         workmen primarily seek full reinstatement with
         back wages and a direction to secure their
         regularization, whereas the Respondent Employer
         seeks to quash the modifications ordered by the
         High Court on the ground that the High Court
         exceeded its jurisdiction by granting partial relief
         akin    to    regular    employees,  contrary     to

         constitutional provisions and the State's ban on
         recruitment.



              5.  Learned counsel for the Appellant
         Workmen made the following submissions:



         I.    Continuous Service & Comparable Duties
               : The Appellant Workmen had continuously
               discharged horticultural and maintenance
               duties-- like planting trees, upkeep of public
               parks, and general beautification--under the
               direct supervision and control of the
               Respondent Employer for periods often
               exceeding a decade. They insist such
               longstanding, continuous work parallels that
               of permanent Gardeners.



         II.   Direct      Engagement         &      Wage
               Disbursement : They aver that their
               wages, though inadequate, were paid
               directly by the Horticulture Department of
               the Respondent Employer, nullifying the
               Employer's claim of contractual hiring.
               Muster rolls and internal notes are cited to
               show direct employer-employee relations.



         III. Illegal Termination : Alleging violation of
              
Sections 6E
 and 
6N
 of the U.P. Industrial
              Disputes Act, 1947, the Appellant Workmen
              maintain their abrupt termination in July
              2005 (during pendency of conciliation
              proceedings) was devoid of due process and
              statutory payments, rendering it patently
              illegal.



         IV.   Entitlement      to    Reinstatement         &
               Regularization : Given their long service
               and the principle of "equal pay for equal
               work," the Appellant Workmen submit they
               deserve full reinstatement with back wages
               and a legitimate pathway to regularization,
               as opposed to the partial relief of mere daily-
               wage re-engagement prescribed by the High
               Court.



               6.     On the other, the learned counsel for

         the Respondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam
         made the following submissions:



         I.     Compliance         with      Constitutional
                Requirements:          Emphasizing      the
                constitutional scheme of public employment,
                it is urged that there was (and remains) a
                ban on fresh recruitment in Municipal
                Corporations, and no proper selection
                process was ever followed to appoint the
                Workmen on any sanctioned posts.



         II.    No        Direct       Employer-Employee
                Relationship : The Respondent Employer
                contends that all horticulture work was
                carried out through independent contractors
                appointed via tender processes. It claims any
                partial wage documentation cited by the
                Workmen      fails   to    establish    direct
                engagement.



         III.   Inapplicability    of   Regularization :

 
Relying on 
Secretary, State of Karnataka v.
                Umadevi1
, it is asserted that no daily
                wager can claim permanent absorption
                without    adherence     to    constitutional
                requirements and availability of duly
                sanctioned vacancies.




         IV.    Inadequate Proof of 240 Days' Service
                : The Respondent Employer points out that
                the    Workmen      did   not     convincingly
                demonstrate they completed 240 days of
                continuous work in any calendar year, thus
                undermining    the    assertion    that  their
                cessation from service was illegal.



         V.     Challenge to Modified Relief: Finally, it
                argues that the High Court's direction to pay
                minimum-scale wages and to consider the
                Workmen for future regularization oversteps
                legal boundaries, disregards the recruitment
                ban, and fosters an impermissible avenue of
                public   employment.      The    Respondent
                Employer, therefore, seeks the quashing of
                the impugned judgment.

               7.    Having heard the arguments and
         submissions of the learned counsel for the parties
         and having perused the record, this Court is of
         the considered opinion that the nature of
         engagement of the Appellant Workmen, the
         admitted shortage of Gardeners, and the
         circumstances under which their services were
         brought to an end, merit closer scrutiny.



                8.     It is undisputed that, while the
         Appellant      Workmen      were     pressing     for
         regularization and proper wages through pending
         conciliation proceedings, the Respondent Employer
         proceeded to discontinue their services, without
         issuing prior notice or granting retrenchment
         compensation. At this juncture, it is to have a look
         at the requirements of 
Section 6E
 of the U.P.
         Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which has been
         reproduced hereunder:--

         workmen to be recognized as protected workmen
         for the purposes of sub-section (3) shall not exceed
         one per cent of the total number of workmen
         employed therein subject to a minimum number of
         five protected workmen and a maximum number
         of one hundred protected workmen and for the
         aforesaid purpose, the State Government may
         make rules providing for the distribution of such
         protected workmen among various trade unions, if
         any, connected with the establishment and the
         manner in which they may be chosen and
         recognized as protected workmen.



         (5)    Where an employer makes an application to
         a Board, Labour Court or Tribunal under the proviso
         to sub-section (2) for approval of the action taken
         by him, the authority concerned shall, without
         delay,   hear such application and pass, as
         expeditiously as possible, such order in relation
         thereto as it deems fit."



               9.    On a plain reading of this section,
         we can deduce that any unilateral alteration
         in service conditions, including termination, is
         impermissible during the pendency of such
         proceedings unless prior approval is obtained
         from the appropriate authority. The record in
         the present case does not indicate that the
         Respondent Employer ever sought or was
         granted the requisite approval. Prima facie,
         therefore, this conduct reflects a deliberate
         attempt to circumvent the lawful claims of
         the workmen, particularly when their dispute
         over regularization and wages remained sub
         judice.



                10. The Respondent Employer consistently
         labelled the Appellant Workmen as casual
         employees (or workers engaged through an
         unnamed contractor), yet there is no material proof
         of adherence to 
Section 6N
 of the U.P. Industrial
         Disputes Act, 1947, which mandates a proper
         notice or wages in lieu thereof as well as
         retrenchment compensation. In this context,
         whether an individual is classified as regular or
         temporary is irrelevant as retrenchment obligations

14. The Respondent Employer places
         reliance on 
Umadevi
 (supra)2 to contend that
         daily-wage or temporary employees cannot
         claim permanent absorption in the absence of
         statutory rules providing such absorption.
         However,     as    frequently reiterated, Uma
         Devi      itself     distinguishes     between
         appointments that are "illegal" and those that
         are "irregular," the latter being eligible for
         regularization if      they     meet    certain
         conditions.      More importantly, Uma Devi
         cannot serve as a shield to justify exploitative
         engagements persisting for years without the
         Employer undertaking legitimate recruitment.
         Given the record which shows no true
         contractor-based       arrangement     and     a
         consistent need for permanent horticultural
         staff the alleged asserted ban on fresh
         recruitment, though real, cannot justify
         indefinite daily-wage status or continued
         unfair practices.




              15. It is manifest that the Appellant
         Workmen     continuously    rendered   their
         services over several years, sometimes
         spanning more than a decade. Even if certain
         muster rolls were not produced in full, the
         Employer's failure to furnish such records--
         despite directions to do so--allows an
         adverse inference under well-established
         labour jurisprudence. Indian labour law
         strongly disfavors perpetual daily-wage or
         contractual engagements in circumstances
         where the work is permanent in nature.

         Morally and legally, workers who fulfil
         ongoing municipal requirements year after
         year cannot be dismissed summarily as
         dispensable, particularly in the absence of a
         genuine contractor agreement. At this
         juncture, it would be appropriate to recall the
         broader critique of indefinite "temporary"
         employment practices as done by a recent
         judgment of this court in Jaggo v. Union of
         India3 in the following paragraphs:



                           "xxxxxxxxx"

               16.   xxx



               17.   xxx


               18. The impugned order of the High Court,
         to the extent they confine the Appellant Workmen
         to future daily- wage engagement without
         continuity or meaningful back wages, is hereby set
         aside with the following directions:



         I.    The    discontinuation    of    the   Appellant
               Workmen's       services,   effected    without
               compliance with Section 6E and 
Section 6N

               of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is
               declared      illegal.    All     orders     or
               communications terminating their services
               are quashed. In consequence, the Appellant
               Workmen shall be treated as continuing in
               service from the date of their termination,
               for all purposes, including seniority and
               continuity in service.



         II.   The Respondent Employer shall reinstate the
               Appellant Workmen in their respective
               posts (or posts akin to the duties they
               previously performed) within four weeks
               from the date of this judgment. Their entire
               period of absence (from the date of
               termination until actual reinstatement) shall
               be counted for continuity of service and all
               consequential benefits, such as seniority
               and eligibility for promotions, if any.

           III. Considering the length of service, the
                Appellant Workmen shall be entitled to
                50% of the back wages from the date of
                their discontinuation until their actual
                reinstatement.      The     Respondent
                Employer shall clear the aforesaid dues
                within three months from the date of
                their reinstatement.



           IV.   The Respondent Employer is directed to
                 initiate a fair and transparent process
                 for regularizing the Appellant Workmen
                 within six months from the date of
                 reinstatement, duly considering the fact
                 that they have performed perennial
                 municipal duties akin to permanent
                 posts. In assessing regularization, the
                 Employer shall not impose educational
                 or procedural criteria retroactively if
                 such requirements were never applied
                 to the Appellant Workmen or to
                 similarly situated regular employees in
                 the    past.   To   the    extent   that
                 sanctioned vacancies for such duties
                 exist or are required, the Respondent
                 Employer shall expedite all necessary
                 administrative processes to ensure
                 these long-time employees are not
                 indefinitely retained on daily wages
                 contrary to statutory and equitable
                 norms.



                 19. In view of the above, the appeal(s)
           filed by the workmen are allowed, whereas the
           appeal(s) filed by the Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad are
           dismissed."

     3 decades there and directs regularization. The
     petitioners in the case at hand are in service for more
     than 3 decades in certain cases and close to 3 decades in
     certain cases. In that light, the claim of the petitioners
     could not have been denied on a spacious plea that there
     is no resolution of the Town Municipal Council appended
     to the requisition to the Deputy Commissioner.



            14.   The Town Municipal Council has filed its
     objections accepting the fact that the petitioners are in
     employment throughout. If that be so, the very reason
     rendered by the Deputy Commissioner may be inter
     alia. But one of the reasons rendered is unacceptable, nor
     the rejection of the applications of the petitioners, is
     acceptable.

aftermath of the judgment in the case of 
UMADEVI
 (supra),

has held as follows:




 
"14. As observed hereinabove, the Apex Court
         rendered its judgment in the case of UMADEVI (3) on
         10-04-2006. Relevant paragraphs are already quoted
         hereinabove. Subsequent to the judgment of the Apex
         Court in the case of UMADEVI (3), considering the case
         of UMADEVI (3), the Apex Court in several judgments
         held and affirmed the right of several employees for
         regularization under several circumstances. The Apex
         Court     in   the    case   of 
NARENDRA       KUMAR
         TIWARI v. STATE OF JHARKHAND2
, holds as follows:




 
"7. The purpose and intent of the decision
                 in 
Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi

                 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] was
                 therefore twofold, namely, to prevent irregular or
                 illegal appointments in the future and secondly, to
                 confer a benefit on those who had been irregularly
                 appointed in the past.
 
The fact that the State of
                 Jharkhand      continued     with    the    irregular
                 appointments for almost a decade after the
                 decision      in 
Umadevi       (3)     [State      of
                 Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
                 SCC (L&S) 753] is a clear indication that it believes
                 that it was all right to continue with irregular
                 appointments, and whenever required, terminate
                 the services of the irregularly appointed employees
                 on the ground that they were irregularly appointed.


 
This is nothing but a form of exploitation of the
                 employees by not giving them the benefits of
                 regularisation and by placing the sword of
                 Damocles over their head. This is precisely
                 what 
Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi

                 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]
                 and Kesari       [State     of     Karnataka v. M.L.
                 Kesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)
                 826] sought to avoid.

8. If a strict and literal interpretation,
         forgetting the spirit of the decision of the
         Constitution Bench in 
Umadevi (3) [State of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753], is to be taken into consideration
         then no irregularly appointed employee of the State
         of Jharkhand could ever be regularised since that
         State came into existence only on 15-11-2000 and
         the cut-off date was fixed as 10-4-2006. In other
         words, in this manner the pernicious practice
         of     indefinitely     continuing     irregularly
         appointed employees would be perpetuated
         contrary to the intent of the Constitution
         Bench.




               9. The High Court as well as the State of
         Jharkhand ought to have considered the
         entire issue in a contextual perspective and
         not only from the point of view of the interest
         of the State, financial or otherwise - the
         interest of the employees is also required to
         be kept in mind. What has eventually been
         achieved by the State of Jharkhand is to short
         circuit the process of regular appointments
         and instead make appointments on an
         irregular   basis.  This    is  hardly    good
         governance.



               10. Under the circumstances, we are of the
         view that the Regularisation Rules must be given a
         pragmatic interpretation and the appellants, if they
         have completed 10 years of service on the date of
         promulgation of the Regularisation Rules, ought to
         be given the benefit of the service rendered by
         them. If they have completed 10 years of
         service they should be regularised unless
         there is some valid objection to their
         regularisation like misconduct, etc.


 
11. The impugned judgment and order [
Anil
         Kumar Sinha v. State of Jharkhand
, 2016 SCC
         OnLine Jhar 2904] passed by the High Court is set
         aside in view of our conclusions. The State should
         take a decision within four months from today on

                appeals are accordingly disposed of."



                                             (Emphasis supplied)


 
15. Later, the Apex Court in the case of 
SHEO
         NARAIN NAGAR v. STATE OF U.P.3
, holds as follows:




 
"6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf
                of the respondent has relied upon para 44 of the
                decision      in 
Umadevi     (3)      [State      of
                Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
                SCC (L&S) 753], so as to contend that it was not
                the case of irregular appointment but of illegal
                appointment; there was no post available on which
                the services of the appellants could have been
                regularised and appointment were in contravention
                of the reservation policy also; thus, termination
                order was rightly issued and, in no case, the
                appellants were entitled for regularisation of their
                services.




 
7. When we consider the prevailing scenario,
                it is painful to note that the decision in 
Umadevi (3)
                [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC
                1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has not been properly
                understood and rather wrongly applied by various
                State Governments. We have called for the data in

                employees were working on contract basis or ad
                hoc basis or daily-wage basis in different State
                departments. We can take judicial notice that
                widely aforesaid practice is being continued.
                Though this Court has emphasised that incumbents
                should be appointed on regular basis as per rules
                but new devise of making appointment on contract
                basis has been adopted, employment is offered on
                daily-wage basis, etc. in exploitative forms.

         and in the available pay scale. That spirit of
         the 
Umadevi           (3)           [State         of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753] has been ignored and conveniently
         overlooked          by         various          State
         Governments/authorities.
 
We regretfully make the
         observation     that 
Umadevi      (3)    [State    of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753] has not been implemented in its
         true spirit and has not been followed in its pith and
         substance. It is being used only as a tool for
         not regularising the services of incumbents.

         They are being continued in service without
         payment of due salary for which they are
         entitled on the basis of 
Articles 14
, 16
 read
         with 
Article 34(1)(d)
 of the Constitution of
         India as if they have no constitutional
         protection as envisaged in D.S. Nakara v. Union
         of India [D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1
         SCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145 : AIR 1983 SC
         130], from cradle to grave. In heydays of life
         they are serving on exploitative terms with no
         guarantee of livelihood to be continued and in
         old age they are going to be destituted, there
         being no provision for pension, retiral
         benefits, etc. There is clear contravention of
         constitutional provisions and aspiration of
         downtrodden class. They do have equal rights
         and to make them equals they require
         protection     and    cannot     be     dealt    with
         arbitrarily. The kind of treatment meted out is
         not only bad but equally unconstitutional and
         is denial of rights. 
We have to strike a balance
         to really implement the ideology of 
Umadevi
         (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4
         SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753].
 
Thus, the time
         has come to stop the situation where 
Umadevi
         (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4
         SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] can be permitted
         to be flouted, whereas, this Court has
         interdicted such employment way back in the
         year 2006.
 
The employment cannot be on
         exploitative terms, whereas 
Umadevi (3) [State of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi

         back door entry and every post should be filled by
         regular employment, but a new device has been
         adopted for making appointment on payment of
         paltry system on contract/ad hoc basis or
         otherwise. This kind of action is not permissible
         when we consider the pith and substance of true
         spirit     in 
Umadevi      (3)     [State       of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753].




                8. Coming to the facts of the instant case,
         there was a direction issued way back in the year
         1999, to consider the regularisation of the
         appellants. However, regularisation was not done.
         The respondents chose to give minimum of the pay
         scale, which was available to the regular
         employees, way back in the year 2000 and by
         passing an order, the appellants were also
         conferred temporary status in the year 2006, with
         retrospective effect on 2-10-2002. As the
         respondents have themselves chosen to confer a
         temporary status to the employees, as such there
         was requirement at work and posts were also
         available at the particular point of time when order
         was passed. Thus, the submission raised by the
         learned counsel for the respondent that posts were
         not available, is belied by their own action.
         Obviously, the order was passed considering the
         long period of services rendered by the appellants,
         which were taken on exploitative terms.



 
9. The High Court dismissed the writ application
         relying on the decision in 
Umadevi (3) [State of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753]. But the appellants were
         employed basically in the year 1993; they had
         rendered service for three years, when they
         were offered the service on contract basis; it
         was not the case of back door entry; and
         there were no Rules in place for offering such
         kind of appointment. Thus, the appointment
         could not be said to be illegal and in
         contravention of Rules, as there were no such
         Rules available at the relevant point of time,
         when their temporary status was conferred

                 w.e.f.   2-10-2002.     The  appellants      were
                 required to be appointed on regular basis as a
                 one-time measure, as 
laid down in
 para 53
                 of 
Umadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi

                 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. Since
                 the appellants had completed 10 years of
                 service and temporary status had been given
                 by the respondents with retrospective effect
                 from 2-10-2002, we direct that the services of
                 the appellants be regularised from the said
                 date i.e. 2.10.2002, consequential benefits
                 and the arrears of pay also to be paid to the
                 appellants within a period of three months
                 from today."

16. The Apex Court in the case of 
CHANDER
         MOHAN NEGI v. STATE OF H.P.4
, holds as follows:




 
"11. At the outset, it is to be noted that the
                 schemes in question were notified in the years
                 2001 and 2003 under which appointments were
                 made with regard to Primary Assistant Teachers
                 and Teachers in other categories. At the relevant
                 point of time, nobody has questioned either the
                 schemes or the appointments. It is the specific case
                 of the respondent State that such appointments
                 have not affected the writ petitioners and the
                 Department was not in a position to leave the
                 schools, Teachers deficient for long since it would
                 have affected the studies of the students very
                 badly. Therefore, it was the case of the State that
                 Teachers had been appointed under various
                 schemes at that point of time and such
                 appointments have been made up to the year 2007
                 and have no impact on the appellants since they
                 have completed their two-year JBT training in the
                 year 2011. As is evident from the order [
Pankaj
                 Kumar v. State of H.P.
, 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944]
                 under appeal passed by the Division Bench of the
                 High Court, the appellant-writ petitioners have not
                 even chosen to file rejoinder and the stand taken
                 by the State thus has remained uncontroverted.

         Further, it is also to be noted that when such
         appointments were made during the years 2001
         and 2003 the writ petitions came to be filed in the
         years 2012 and 2013. As the writ petitioners have
         claimed interest for their appointment, the Division
         Bench of the High Court has rightly held [
Pankaj
         Kumar v. State of H.P.
, 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944]
         that such petitions cannot be considered as the
         public interest litigation. Such a writ petition which
         was filed by the petitioners who came to be
         qualified only in the year 2011 are not entitled for
         any relief on the ground of unexplained laches and
         inordinate delay of about more than 10 years in
         approaching the court for questioning the
         appointments. Though relief was sought against the
         State to deny the benefit of regularisation to the
         appointed Teachers, they were not even impleaded
         as party respondents. An association was
         impleaded as third respondent but without
         furnishing any material to show that at least
         majority of appointees are members of such
         association.
 
So far as Primary Assistant Teachers
         Scheme of 2003, which was the subject-matter of
         letters patent appeal arising out of CWP No. 3303
         of 2012-A filed by Chander Mohan Negi and others,
         is concerned, the appellants in Civil Appeal No.
         2813 of 2017 except Appellants 1, 2 and 4 have
         withdrawn [
Chander        Mohan    Negi v. State    of
         H.P.
, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 459] the appeal and
         Appellants 1 and 4 are already appointed as JBTs.
         Insofar as the only appellant viz. Appellant 2, Rajiv
         Chauhan is concerned, it is stated that he is
         qualified and there are vacant posts and he can be
         considered if he applies to any of the existing
         vacancies. So far as the Primary Assistant Teacher
         Scheme is concerned, same was notified as early
         as on 27-8-2003. As is evident from the Scheme
         itself, the object of the Scheme appears to be to
         compulsorily enrol children in schools for
         elementary and primary education in the remote
         areas to achieve the goals as set by the
         Government while enacting the Himachal Pradesh
         Compulsory Primary Education Act, 1997 with a
         view to achieve the target of 100% enrolment to
         children. As per the Scheme, the eligibility was

         10+2 from a recognised Board/University and the
         candidates with higher qualifications were also
         eligible    and      candidates    with    professional
         qualifications were to be preferred. As per the
         regular Recruitment Rules the requisite qualification
         for the post of JBT Teacher during the relevant time
         was 10+2 with 50% marks and JBT certificate. As
         submitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing
         for the State that initially though 3500 odd
         Teachers were appointed, as of now there are only
         a total of 3294 Teachers working in this category
         and out of this about 1866 had the qualification of
         10+2 with more than 50% marks at the relevant
         point of engagement. Out of the balance, 1015 had
         10+2 with less than 50% marks, but they had
         higher qualification such as BA/MA/M Sc or B Ed,
         etc. Further, it is also brought to our notice that out
         of all the candidates, 3294 candidates who are
         presently working have acquired the professional
         qualification of diploma in elementary education or
         have      undergone       Professional   Development
         Programme for Elementary Teachers. In that view
         of the matter, we are of the view that when the
         appointees appointed under the scheme have
         completed more than almost 15 years of service
         now and also have acquired the professional
         qualifications, they cannot be denied regularisation
         at this point of time. As the appointments were
         made as per the schemes notified by the
         Government such appointments cannot be treated
         as illegal, if at all they can be considered irregular.
         When it is the plea of the State that in view of the
         hard topography/tribal areas in the State, large
         number of vacancies were there even in single
         teacher schools and to achieve the object of the
         Himachal Pradesh Primary Education Act, 1997
         such steps were taken, there is no reason to
         disbelieve the same, more so, in absence of any
         affidavit by way of rejoinder by the writ petitioners
         before the High Court controverting the allegations
         in the reply filed on behalf of the State.



                12. Even with regard to the Para Teachers
         Policy under which various category of Teachers
         were appointed in the year 2003 pursuant to policy

         notified on 17-9-2003 it is clear from the record
         placed before this Court that all the persons who
         were recruited as Para Teachers were fully qualified
         as per the Recruitment and Promotion Rules i.e.
         the Himachal Pradesh Education Department Class
         III (School and Inspection Cadre) Service Rules,
         1973. In view of the stand of the State that such
         policy was necessitated due to large number of
         vacant posts which have arisen year after year and
         which could not be filled since the State Selection
         Subordinate      Board,    Hamirpur,    which    was
         responsible for the selection of Teachers had come
         under a cloud and the selection process had come
         to a halt, such appointments cannot be rendered as
         illegal. Such aspect is also evident from the policy
         itself. Even in other category of the Grant-in-Aid to
         Parent Teacher Association Rules, all Teachers
         appointed under the Scheme fulfil the educational
         qualifications prescribed in the Rules. For such kind
         of Teachers, the Cabinet has taken decision to take
         over the Teachers on contract basis after
         completion of eight years of service which period
         was later reduced to seven years. It is also brought
         to our notice during the course of arguments that
         out of the total 6799 Teachers, 5017 Teachers were
         already taken over on contract basis by the State
         Government and only 1782 could not be taken over
         in view of the interim orders passed by this Court.



               13. It is true that in the initial schemes
         notified by the Government, there was a
         condition that such appointees should not
         seek regularisation/ absorption but at the
         same time for no fault of them, they cannot be
         denied regularisation/absorption. It is in view
         of the requirement of the State, their services
         were extended from time to time and now all
         the appointees have completed more than 15
         years of service. For majority of the appointed
         Teachers under the various schemes, benefit
         was already extended and some left over
         candidates were denied on account of interim
         orders passed by this Court. With regard to
         Primary Assistant Teachers, it is stated that

         the High Court and further having regard to
         explanation offered by the State about the
         need of framing such policies to meet the
         immediate requirement to fill up single
         teacher schools which were vacant for a very
         long time, having regard to topographical
         conditions, which is not even controverted by
         way of any rejoinder before the High Court. In
         such view of the matter, taking the totality of
         peculiar circumstances of these cases, we are
         of the view that the view expressed by this
         Court in the judgments relied on cannot be
         applied to the facts of the case on hand. All
         the appointed candidates are working for the
         meagre salaries pursuant to schemes notified
         by the Government. Except the vague
         submission that such schemes were framed
         only to make backdoor entries, there is no
         material placed on record to buttress such
         submission. Further it is also to be noted that
         though such schemes were notified as early
         as in 2003, nobody has questioned such
         policies and appointments up to 2012 and
         2013. The writ petition i.e. CWP No. 3303 of
         2012-A was filed in the year 2012 without
         even impleading the appointees as party
         respondents. In the writ petition, there was
         no rejoinder filed by the writ petitioners
         disputing the averments of the State as stated
         in the reply-affidavit. Having regard to the
         nature of such appointments, appointments
         made as per policies cannot be termed as
         illegal. Having regard to material placed
         before this Court and having regard to
         reasons      recorded    in    the    impugned

17. Earlier to the judgment rendered by the Apex
         Court in the afore-quoted judgment, the Apex Court in
         the         case          of 
AMARENDRA          KUMAR
         MOHAPATRA v. STATE OF ORISSA5
, had held as
         follows:




 
"42. The decision in Umadevi (3) case [
State
                 of Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC
                 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753], as noticed earlier,
                 permitted regularisation of regular appointments
                 and not illegal appointments.
 
Question, however, is
                 whether the appointments in the instant case could
                 be described as illegal and if they were not,
                 whether the State could be directed to regularise
                 the services of the degree-holder Junior Engineers
                 who have worked as ad hoc Assistant Engineers for
                 such a long period, not only on the analogy of the
                 legislative enactment for regularisation but also on
                 the principle underlying para 53 of the decision
                 in Umadevi        (3)      case       [
State      of
                 Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
                 SCC (L&S) 753].




 
43. As to what would constitute an
                 irregular appointment is no longer res integra.
                 The decision of this Court in 
State of
                 Karnataka v. M.L.     Kesari
 [(2010)     9    SCC
                 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], has examined
                 that question and explained the principle
                 regarding     regularisation     as    enunciated
                 in Umadevi        (3)     case       [
State     of
                 Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
                 SCC (L&S) 753]. The decision 
in that case

                 summed up the following three essentials for
                 regularisation : (1) the employees have

         worked for ten years or more, (2) that they
         have so worked in a duly sanctioned post
         without the benefit or protection of the
         interim order of any court or tribunal, and (3)
         they should have possessed the minimum
         qualification stipulated for the appointment.
         Subject to these three requirements being
         satisfied, even if the appointment process did
         not involve open competitive selection, the
         appointment would be treated irregular and
         not    illegal   and    thereby   qualify   for
         regularisation. Para 7 in this regard is
         apposite and may be extracted at this
         stage: (M.L.   Kesari   case [(2010)   9   SCC
         247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], SCC p. 250)

                 "7. 
It is evident from the above that there is
         an exception to the general principles against
         'regularisation' enunciated in 
Umadevi (3) [State of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753], if the following conditions are
         fulfilled:




         (i)    The employee concerned should have
                worked for 10 years or more in a duly
                sanctioned post without the benefit or
                protection of the interim order of any court
                or tribunal. In other words, the State
                Government or its instrumentality should
                have employed the employee and continued
                him in service voluntarily and continuously
                for more than ten years.



         (ii)   The appointment of such employee should
                not be illegal, even if irregular. Where the
                appointments are not made or continued
                against sanctioned posts or where the
                persons appointed do not possess the
                prescribed minimum qualifications, the
                appointments will be considered to be illegal.

                But where the person employed possessed
                the prescribed qualifications and was working
                against sanctioned posts, but had been
                selected without undergoing the process of
                open      competitive       selection,   such

               appointments       are     considered   to   be
               irregular."



 
44. It is nobody's case that the degree-
         holder Junior Engineers were not qualified for
         appointment as Assistant Engineers as even
         they    possess    degrees     from    recognised
         institutions. It is also nobody's case that they
         were not appointed against the sanctioned
         post. There was some debate as to the actual
         number of vacancies available from time to
         time but we have no hesitation in holding that
         the appointments made were at all relevant
         points of time against sanctioned posts. The
         information provided by Mr. Nageswara Rao,
         learned      Additional     Solicitor     General,
         appearing for the State of Orissa, in fact,
         suggests that the number of vacancies was at
         all points of time more than the number of
         appointments made on ad hoc basis. It is also
         clear that each one of the degree-holders has
         worked for more than 10 years ever since his
         appointment as ad hoc Assistant Engineer. It
         is in that view difficult to describe these
         appointments of the Stipendiary Engineers on
         ad hoc basis to be illegal so as to fall beyond
         the purview of the scheme envisaged
         in Umadevi       (3)      case       [
State     of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753].




 
45. The upshot of the above discussion is
         that not only because in Umadevi (3) case [
State of
         Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
         SCC (L&S) 753] this Court did not disturb the
         appointments already made or regularisation
         granted, but also because the decision itself
         permitted regularisation in case of irregular
         appointments, the legislative enactment granting
         such regularisation does not call for interference at
         this late stage when those appointed or regularised
         have already started retiring having served their
         respective departments, in some cases for as long
         as 22 years."

18. A three Judges bench of the Apex Court
         considering the case of 
UMADEVI (3
) supra and
         subsequent   judgments,   in   the     case of 
PREM

                                 6

         SINGH v. STATE OF U.P.
 , holds as follows:




 
"36. There are some of the employees who
                have not been regularised in spite of having
                rendered the services for 30-40 or more years
                whereas they have been superannuated. As they
                have worked in the work-charged establishment,
                not against any particular project, their services
                ought to have been regularised under the
                Government instructions and even as per the
                decision     of    this   Court     in 
State    of
                Karnataka v. Umadevi
       (
3)      [State      of
                Karnataka v. Umadevi
 (3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006
                SCC (L&S) 753]. This Court in 
the said decision

                has laid down that in case services have been
                rendered for more than ten years without the
                cover of the Court's order, as one-time
                measure, the services be regularised of such
                employees. In the facts of the case, those
                employees who have worked for ten years or
                more should have been regularised. It would
                not be proper to regulate them for
                consideration of regularisation as others have
                been regularised, we direct that their services
                be treated as a regular one. However, it is
                made clear that they shall not be entitled to
                claiming any dues of difference in wages had
                they been continued in service regularly
                before attaining the age of superannuation.
                They shall be entitled to receive the pension
                as if they have retired from the regular
                establishment and the services rendered by
                them right from the day they entered the
                work-charged establishment shall be counted
                as qualifying service for purpose of pension.




                       37. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the
                U.P. Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that
                services     rendered    in    the   work-charged

                only before the date of the order. Let the

             19. The Apex Court later, in the case of JAGGO v.
         UNION OF INDIA7 has held as follows:



 
"7. They urged the High Court to
                recognize their long and continuous service,
                the nature of their work, and the lack of any
                backdoor or illegal entry. They highlighted
                that they had functioned without any break,
                performed       tasks    equivalent      to  regular
                employees, and had been assigned duties
                essential to the regular upkeep, cleanliness,
                and maintenance of the respondent's offices.
                The High Court, after examining the Tribunal's
                decision and the submissions advanced,
                concluded that the petitioners before it were
                part-time workers who had not been
                appointed against sanctioned posts, nor had
                they performed a sufficient duration of full-
                time service to satisfy the criteria for
                regularization. It relied on the principle laid down
                in 
Secretary,     State     of     Karnataka v. Uma
                Devi3
 holding that the petitioners could not claim a
                vested right to be absorbed or regularized without
                fulfilling the requisite conditions. The High Court
                further observed that the petitioners did not
                possess the minimum educational qualifications
                ordinarily required for regular appointments, and
                additionally noted that the employer had
                subsequently        outsourced       the     relevant
                housekeeping       and     maintenance      activities.
                Concluding that there was no legal basis to grant
                the reliefs sought, the High Court dismissed the

         writ petition. Aggrieved by this rejection, the
         appellants have approached this Court by way of
         these appeals.



              8. On behalf of the appellants, the following
         arguments have been advanced before us:



         (i).     Continuous          and       Substantive
                  Engagement: The appellants emphasize
                  their long, uninterrupted service spanning
                  well over a decade--and in some instances,
                  exceeding two decades. They argue that
                  their duties were neither sporadic nor
                  project-based but permanent and integral to
                  the daily functioning of the respondent's
                  offices.



         (ii).    Nature of Duties: Their responsibilities--

                  such as cleaning, dusting, gardening, and
                  other maintenance tasks--were not casual or
                  peripheral. Instead, they were central to
                  ensuring a clean, orderly, and functional
                  work environment, effectively aligning with
                  roles typically associated with regular posts.



         (iii).   Absence            of          Performance
                  Issues: Throughout     their   tenure,    the

                  appellants were never issued any warning or
                  adverse remarks. They highlight that their
                  work was consistently satisfactory, and there
                  was no indication from the respondents that
                  their performance was not satisfactory or
                  required improvement.



 
(iv).    Compliance          with       'Uma          Devi'
                  Guidelines: The appellants assert that their
                  appointments were not "illegal" but at most
                  "irregular." Drawing on the principles 
laid
                  down         in
 
Secretary,         State        of

 , they submit that
                  long-serving      employees       in     irregular
                  appointments--who           fulfil       essential,
                  sanctioned      functions--are       entitled    to
                  consideration for regularization.

         (v).    Discrimination in Regularization: The
                 appellants point out that individuals with
                 fewer    years    of   service   or   similar
                 engagements have been regularized. They
                 contend that denying them the same benefit,
                 despite their longer service and crucial role,
                 constitutes arbitrary and discriminatory
                 treatment.



         (vi).   Irrelevance          of         Educational
                 Qualifications: The appellants reject the
                 respondents' reliance on formal educational
                 requirements, noting that such criteria were
                 never enforced earlier and that the nature of
                 their work does not inherently demand
                 formal    schooling.    They    argue    that
                 retrospectively imposing such qualifications
                 is unjustified given their proven capability
                 over many years.



         (vii). Equity     and    Fairness: Ultimately,     the
                appellants submit that the High Court erred
                by focusing too rigidly on their initial terms
                of engagement and ignoring the substantive
                reality of their long, integral service. They
                maintain     that   fairness,   equity,    and
                established judicial principles call for their
                regularization rather than abrupt termination


                9. On the other hand, the following primary
         arguments have been advanced before us on behalf
         of the Respondents:



         (i).    Nature of Engagement: The respondents
                 maintain that the appellants were engaged
                 purely on a part-time, contractual basis,
                 limited to a few hours a day, and that their
                 work was never intended to be permanent or
                 full-time.



         (ii).   Absence of Sanctioned Posts: They assert
                 that the appellants were not appointed
                 against any sanctioned posts. According to
                 the    respondents,   without   sanctioned
                 vacancies, there can be no question of

                  regularization or   absorption      into   the
                  permanent workforce.



 
(iii).   Non-Compliance         with    'Uma      Devi'
                  Criteria: Relying heavily on 
Secretary, State
                  of   Karnataka v. Uma      Devi
 (supra),   the
                  respondents argue that the appellants do not
                  meet     the    conditions   necessary      for
                  regularization. They emphasize that merely
                  serving a long period on a part-time or ad-
                  hoc basis does not create a right to be
                  regularized.




         (iv).    Educational              Qualifications: The
                  respondents contend that even if the
                  appellants were to be considered for regular
                  appointments, they do not possess the
                  minimum        educational      qualifications
                  mandated for regular recruitment. This, in
                  their view, disqualifies the appellants from
                  being absorbed into regular service.



         (v).     Outsourcing as a Legitimate Policy
                  Decision: The respondents point out that
                  they have chosen to outsource the relevant
                  housekeeping and maintenance work to a
                  private agency. This, they argue, is a
                  legitimate administrative policy decision
                  aimed at improving efficiency and cannot be
                  interfered with by the courts.



         (vi).    No        Fundamental            Right   to
                  Regularization: Finally, the respondents
                  underscore that no employee, merely by
                  virtue of long-standing temporary or part-
                  time engagement, acquires a vested right to
                  be regularized. They maintain that the
                  appellants' claims are devoid of any legal
                  entitlement and that the High Court was
                  correct in dismissing their petition.



               10. Having given careful consideration
         to the submissions advanced and the material
         on record, we find that the appellants' long
         and    uninterrupted  service,  for  periods

         extending well beyond ten years, cannot be
         brushed aside merely by labelling their initial
         appointments as part-time or contractual. The
         essence of their employment must be
         considered in the light of their sustained
         contribution, the integral nature of their work,
         and the fact that no evidence suggests their
         entry was through any illegal or surreptitious
         route.



                11. The appellants, throughout their tenure,
         were engaged in performing essential duties that
         were indispensable to the day-to-day functioning of
         the offices of the Central Water Commission
         (CWC). Applicant Nos. 1, 2, and 3, as Safaiwalis,
         were     responsible     for   maintaining     hygiene,
         cleanliness, and a conducive working environment
         within the office premises. Their duties involved
         sweeping, dusting, and cleaning of floors,
         workstations, and common areas--a set of
         responsibilities that directly contributed to the basic
         operational functionality of the CWC. Applicant No.
         5, in the role of a Khallasi (with additional functions
         akin to those of a Mali), was entrusted with critical
         maintenance tasks, including gardening, upkeep of
         outdoor      premises,      and    ensuring     orderly
         surroundings.



               12. Despite being labelled as "part-time
         workers," the appellants performed these
         essential tasks on a daily and continuous
         basis over extensive periods, ranging from
         over a decade to nearly two decades. Their
         engagement was not sporadic or temporary in
         nature; instead, it was recurrent, regular, and
         akin   to    the     responsibilities   typically
         associated with sanctioned posts. Moreover,
         the respondents did not engage any other
         personnel for      these tasks      during the
         appellants'    tenure,     underscoring      the
         indispensable nature of their work.



              13. The claim by the respondents that
         these were not regular posts lacks merit, as
         the nature of the work performed by the

                             - 52 -

         appellants was perennial and fundamental to
         the functioning of the offices. The recurring
         nature of these duties necessitates their
         classification as regular posts, irrespective of
         how their initial engagements were labelled.
         It is also noteworthy that subsequent
         outsourcing of these same tasks to private
         agencies after the appellants' termination
         demonstrates the inherent need for these
         services. This act of outsourcing, which
         effectively replaced one set of workers with
         another, further underscores that the work in
         question     was    neither   temporary      nor
         occasional.

                16. The       appellants'      consistent
         performance over their long tenures further
         solidifies their claim for regularization. At no
         point during their engagement did the
         respondents raise any issues regarding their
         competence or performance. On the contrary,
         their services were extended repeatedly over
         the years, and their remuneration, though
         minimal, was incrementally increased which
         was an implicit acknowledgment of their
         satisfactory performance. The respondents'
         belated plea of alleged unsatisfactory service
         appears to be an afterthought and lacks
         credibility.



                17. As for the argument relating to
         educational qualifications, we find it untenable in
         the present context. The nature of duties the
         appellants performed--cleaning, sweeping, dusting,
         and gardening--does not inherently mandate
         formal educational prerequisites. It would be unjust
         to rely on educational criteria that were never
         central to their engagement or the performance of
         their duties for decades. Moreover, the respondents
         themselves have, by their conduct, shown that
         such criteria were not strictly enforced in other

                              - 53 -

         cases of regularization. The appellants' long-
         standing satisfactory performance itself attests to
         their capability to discharge these functions,
         making rigid insistence on formal educational
         requirements an unreasonable hurdle.



               18. xxx


                 19. It is evident from the foregoing that the
         appellants' roles were not only essential but also
         indistinguishable from those of regular employees.
         Their sustained contributions over extended
         periods, coupled with absence of any adverse
         record,     warrant     equitable   treatment    and
         regularization of their services. Denial of this
         benefit, followed by their arbitrary termination,
         amounts to manifest injustice and must be
         rectified.



 
20. It is well established that the
         decision in 
Uma Devi
 (supra) does not intend
         to penalize employees who have rendered
         long years of service fulfilling ongoing and
         necessary functions of the State or its
         instrumentalities. The said judgment sought
         to prevent backdoor entries and illegal
         appointments that circumvent constitutional
         requirements. However, where appointments
         were not illegal but possibly "irregular," and
         where employees had served continuously
         against the backdrop of sanctioned functions
         for a considerable period, the need for a fair
         and humane resolution becomes paramount.
         Prolonged, continuous, and unblemished
         service performing tasks inherently required
         on a regular basis can, over the time,
         transform what was initially ad-hoc or
         temporary into a scenario demanding fair
         regularization.
 
In a recent judgment of this
         Court in 
Vinod Kumar v. Union of India5
, it
         was held that held that procedural formalities
         cannot be used to deny regularization of
         service to an employee whose appointment
         was termed "temporary" but has performed
         the same duties as performed by the regular

         capacity of the regular employee. The relevant
         paras of this judgment have been reproduced
         below:



 
"6. The application of the judgment
               in 
Uma Devi
 (supra) by the High Court does
               not fit squarely with the facts at hand, given
               the specific circumstances under which the
               appellants    were     employed    and   have
               continued their service. The reliance on
               procedural formalities at the outset cannot
               be used to perpetually deny substantive
               rights that have accrued over a considerable
               period through continuous service.
 
Their
               promotion was based on a specific
               notification for vacancies and a subsequent
               circular, followed by a selection process
               involving written tests and interviews, which
               distinguishes     their   case     from    the
               appointments through back door entry as
               discussed in the case of 
Uma Devi
 (supra).




 
7. The judgment in the case 
Uma Devi

               (supra)      also    distinguished     between
               "irregular"     and    "illegal"  appointments
               underscoring the importance of considering
               certain appointments even if were not made
               strictly in accordance with the prescribed
               Rules and Procedure, cannot be said to have
               been made illegally if they had followed the
               procedures of regular appointments such as
               conduct      of   written     examinations  or
               interviews as in the present case..."




                21. The High Court placed undue
         emphasis on the initial label of the appellants'
         engagements and the outsourcing decision
         taken after their dismissal. Courts must look
         beyond the surface labels and consider the
         realities of employment : continuous, long-
         term service, indispensable duties, and
         absence of any mala fide or illegalities in their
         appointments.    In    that    light,   refusing
         regularization simply because their original

         terms did not explicitly state so, or because
         an    outsourcing    policy   was    belatedly
         introduced, would be contrary to principles of
         fairness and equity.



                22. The pervasive misuse of temporary
         employment contracts, as exemplified in this case,
         reflects a broader systemic issue that adversely
         affects workers' rights and job security. In the
         private sector, the rise of the gig economy has led
         to an increase in precarious employment
         arrangements, often characterized by lack of
         benefits, job security, and fair treatment. Such
         practices have been criticized for exploiting workers
         and undermining labour standards. Government
         institutions, entrusted with upholding the principles
         of fairness and justice, bear an even greater
         responsibility    to    avoid    such     exploitative
         employment practices. When public sector entities
         engage in misuse of temporary contracts, it not
         only mirrors the detrimental trends observed in the
         gig economy but also sets a concerning precedent
         that can erode public trust in governmental
         operations.



                 23. The International Labour Organization
         (ILO), of which India is a founding member, has
         consistently advocated for employment stability
         and the fair treatment of workers. The ILO's
         Multinational Enterprises Declaration6 encourages
         companies to provide stable employment and to

               24. The landmark judgment of the United

         Corporation7 serves as a pertinent example from
         the private sector, illustrating the consequences of
         misclassifying employees to circumvent providing
         benefits. In this case, Microsoft classified certain
         workers as independent contractors, thereby

         denying them employee benefits. The U.S. Court of
         Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that these
         workers were, in fact, common-law employees and
         were entitled to the same benefits as regular
         employees.     The     Court    noted   that   large
         Corporations have increasingly adopted the practice
         of hiring temporary employees or independent
         contractors as a means of avoiding payment of
         employee benefits, thereby increasing their profits.
         This judgment underscores the principle that the
         nature of the work performed, rather than the label
         assigned to the worker, should determine
         employment status and the corresponding rights
         and benefits. It highlights the judiciary's role in
         rectifying such misclassifications and ensuring that
         workers receive fair treatment.



                25. It is a disconcerting reality that
         temporary employees, particularly in government
         institutions, often face multifaceted forms of
         exploitation. While the foundational purpose of
         temporary contracts may have been to address
         short-term or seasonal needs, they have
         increasingly become a mechanism to evade long-
         term obligations owed to employees. These
         practices manifest in several ways:



         • Misuse of "Temporary" Labels: Employees
         engaged for work that is essential, recurring,
         and integral to the functioning of an
         institution are often labeled as "temporary" or
         "contractual," even when their roles mirror
         those     of     regular    employees.    Such
         misclassification deprives workers of the
         dignity, security, and benefits that regular
         employees are entitled to, despite performing
         identical tasks.



         • Arbitrary Termination: Temporary employees
         are frequently dismissed without cause or notice,
         as seen in the present case. This practice
         undermines the principles of natural justice and
         subjects workers to a state of constant insecurity,
         regardless of the quality or duration of their
         service.

         • Lack     of   Career     Progression: Temporary
         employees often find themselves excluded from
         opportunities for skill development, promotions, or
         incremental pay raises. They remain stagnant in
         their roles, creating a systemic disparity between
         them and their regular counterparts, despite their
         contributions being equally significant.



         • Using Outsourcing as a Shield: Institutions
         increasingly resort to outsourcing roles
         performed      by     temporary    employees,
         effectively replacing one set of exploited
         workers with another. This practice not only
         perpetuates       exploitation    but     also
         demonstrates a deliberate effort to bypass the
         obligation to offer regular employment.



         • Denial       of      Basic        Rights       and
         Benefits: Temporary employees are often denied
         fundamental benefits such as pension, provident
         fund, health insurance, and paid leave, even when
         their tenure spans decades. This lack of social
         security subjects them and their families to undue
         hardship, especially in cases of illness, retirement,
         or unforeseen circumstances.



 
26. While     the    judgment      in 
Uma
         Devi
 (supra) sought to curtail the practice of
         backdoor entries and ensure appointments
         adhered to constitutional principles, it is
         regrettable that its principles are often
         misinterpreted     or   misapplied    to   deny
         legitimate claims of long-serving employees.
         This judgment aimed to distinguish between
         "illegal" and "irregular" appointments. It
         categorically held that employees in irregular
         appointments, who were engaged in duly
         sanctioned posts and had served continuously
         for more than ten years, should be considered
         for regularization as a one-time measure.
         However, the laudable intent of the judgment
         is being subverted when institutions rely on
         its dicta to indiscriminately reject the claims
         of employees, even in cases where their

                appointments are not illegal, but merely lack
                adherence      to    procedural    formalities.
                Government departments often cite the
                judgment in 
Uma Devi
 (supra) to argue that
                no vested right to regularization exists for
                temporary     employees,    overlooking    the
                judgment's explicit acknowledgment of cases
                where regularization is appropriate. This
                selective application distorts the judgment's
                spirit and purpose, effectively weaponizing it
                against employees who have rendered
                indispensable services over decades.




                       27. In light of these considerations, in our
                opinion,    it  is   imperative   for   government
                departments to lead by example in providing fair
                and stable employment. Engaging workers on a
                temporary basis for extended periods, especially
                when their roles are integral to the organization's
                functioning, not only contravenes international
                labour standards but also exposes the organization
                to legal challenges and undermines employee
                morale. By ensuring fair employment practices,
                government institutions can reduce the burden of
                unnecessary litigation, promote job security, and
                uphold the principles of justice and fairness that
                they are meant to embody. This approach aligns
                with international standards and sets a positive
                precedent for the private sector to follow, thereby
                contributing to the overall betterment of labour
                practices in the country."

         1998 (in some instances, since 1999). According to
         them, they continuously discharged horticultural
         and maintenance duties-- such as planting trees,
         maintaining parks, and beautifying public spaces--
         under the direct supervision of the Respondent
         Employer. They further allege that no formal
         appointment letters were ever issued to them, and
         that they were persistently denied minimum wages,
         weekly offs, national holidays, and other statutory
         benefits.



                3.2. In 2004, the Appellant Workmen, along
         with many other similarly situated employees,
         raised an industrial dispute (C.B. Case No. 6 of
         2004) before the Conciliation Officer at Ghaziabad,
         seeking regularization of their services and the
         requisite statutory benefits. They contend that,
         upon learning of this demand, the Respondent
         Employer began delaying their salaries and
         subjected them to adverse working conditions.
         Eventually, around mid-July 2005, the services of
         numerous workmen were allegedly terminated
         orally, without any notice, written orders, or
         retrenchment compensation.



                3.3. Since the above termination took place
         during    the    pendency   of   the    conciliation
         proceedings, the Appellant Workmen argue it
         violated 
Section 6E
 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes
         Act, 1947. Consequently, the State Government
         referred the disputes concerning both (i)
         regularization and (ii) legality of the alleged
         termination, to the Labour Court, Ghaziabad for
         adjudication.



                3.4. The Labour Court proceeded to decide
         the references vide two orders:

               Labour Court passed awards holding the
               terminations illegal for want of compliance

                reinstatement with 30% back wages.



         (ii)   Order dated 11.10.2011 : However, in about
                41     other   adjudication     cases   (e.g.,
                Adjudication Case Nos. 269, 270, 272, etc.),
                the Labour Court arrived at a contrary
                conclusion, dismissing the claims on the
                finding that the concerned workmen had not
                been engaged directly by the Nagar Nigam
                but rather through a contractor, and hence
                had no enforceable right to reinstatement or
                regularization   against    the    Respondent
                Employer.



                3.5. Aggrieved by the adverse portion of the
         awards (i.e., those granting reinstatement), the
         Respondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam,
         filed several writ petitions before the High Court of
         Judicature at Allahabad, challenging the Labour
         Court's findings. On the other hand, the workmen
         whose claims were dismissed by the other set of
         awards also approached the High Court by filing
         their own writ petitions. All these writ petitions
         were heard together, culminating in the common
         judgment dated 01.03.2019, which partly modified
         the Labour Court's conclusions.



                3.6. Through the impugned judgment,
         the High Court held that while the Labour
         Court was correct in exercising jurisdiction
         under the 
U.P. Industrial Disputes Act
 (since
         municipalities could be treated as "industry"),
         there remained factual complexities as to
         whether the workmen were genuinely on the
         rolls of the Nagar Nigam or were provided by
         contractors. The High Court also noted that
         the      State      Government      had,    by
         notifications/orders, placed a ban on fresh
         recruitments     in   Municipal   Corporations,
         thereby restricting direct appointments to any
         post. Ultimately, the High Court partially
         modified the relief granted, directing re-
         engagement of the workmen on daily wages,
         with pay equivalent to the minimum in the

         regular pay scale of Gardeners, while allowing
         future consideration of their regularization if
         permissible by law.



                4. Both the Appellant Workmen and the
         Respondent Employer have now approached this
         Court by way of Special Leave Petitions. The
         workmen primarily seek full reinstatement with
         back wages and a direction to secure their
         regularization, whereas the Respondent Employer
         seeks to quash the modifications ordered by the
         High Court on the ground that the High Court
         exceeded its jurisdiction by granting partial relief
         akin    to   regular    employees,   contrary     to
         constitutional provisions and the State's ban on
         recruitment.



              5. Learned counsel for the        Appellant
         Workmen made the following submissions:



         I. Continuous Service & Comparable Duties :

         The    Appellant    Workmen    had    continuously
         discharged horticultural and maintenance duties--
         like planting trees, upkeep of public parks, and
         general beautification--under the direct supervision
         and control of the Respondent Employer for periods
         often exceeding a decade. They insist such
         longstanding, continuous work parallels that of
         permanent Gardeners.



         II. Direct Engagement & Wage Disbursement :
         They aver that their wages, though inadequate,
         were paid directly by the Horticulture Department
         of the Respondent Employer, nullifying the
         Employer's claim of contractual hiring. Muster rolls
         and internal notes are cited to show direct
         employer-employee relations.



         III. Illegal Termination : Alleging violation of
         
Sections 6E
 and 
6N
 of the U.P. Industrial Disputes
         Act, 1947, the Appellant Workmen maintain their
         abrupt termination in July 2005 (during pendency
         of conciliation proceedings) was devoid of due
         process and statutory payments, rendering it
         patently illegal.

            IV.     Entitlement     to    Reinstatement       &
            Regularization : Given their long service and the
            principle of "equal pay for equal work," the
            Appellant Workmen submit they deserve full
            reinstatement with back wages and a legitimate
            pathway to regularization, as opposed to the partial
            relief   of    mere   daily-wage    re-engagement
            prescribed by the High Court.



                 6. On the other, the learned counsel for the
            Respondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam
            made the following submissions:



         I. Compliance with Constitutional Requirements :

             Emphasizing the constitutional scheme of public
             employment, it is urged that there was (and
             remains) a ban on fresh recruitment in Municipal
             Corporations, and no proper selection process was
             ever followed to appoint the Workmen on any
             sanctioned posts.



         II. No Direct Employer-Employee Relationship :
            The Respondent Employer contends that all
            horticulture work was carried out through
            independent contractors appointed via tender
            processes.     It   claims   any partial wage
            documentation cited by the Workmen fails to
            establish direct engagement.



         III. 
Inapplicability of Regularization : Relying
            on 
Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi1
, it is
            asserted that no daily wager can claim permanent
            absorption without adherence to constitutional
            requirements and availability of duly sanctioned
            vacancies.




         IV. Inadequate Proof of 240 Days' Service : The
            Respondent Employer points out that the Workmen
            did not convincingly demonstrate they completed
            240 days of continuous work in any calendar year,
            thus undermining the assertion that their cessation
            from service was illegal.

         V. Challenge to Modified Relief: Finally, it argues
            that the High Court's direction to pay minimum-
            scale wages and to consider the Workmen for
            future regularization oversteps legal boundaries,
            disregards the recruitment ban, and fosters an
            impermissible avenue of public employment. The
            Respondent Employer, therefore, seeks the
            quashing of the impugned judgment.



                   7. Having   heard   the    arguments    and
            submissions of the learned counsel for the parties
            and having perused the record, this Court is of the
            considered opinion that the nature of engagement
            of the Appellant Workmen, the admitted shortage
            of Gardeners, and the circumstances under which
            their services were brought to an end, merit closer
            scrutiny.



                   8. It is undisputed that, while the Appellant
            Workmen were pressing for regularization and
            proper    wages     through   pending    conciliation
            proceedings, the Respondent Employer proceeded
            to discontinue their services, without issuing prior
            notice or granting retrenchment compensation. At
            this juncture, it is to have a look at the
            requirements of 
Section 6E

            Disputes Act, 1947 which has been reproduced

               purposes of this sub-section, a
               'protected workman' in relation to an
               establishment, means a workman
               who, being an officer of a registered

         of one hundred protected workmen and for
         the aforesaid purpose, the State Government
         may make rules providing for the distribution
         of such protected workmen among various

               9. On a plain reading of this section, we
         can deduce that any unilateral alteration in
         service conditions, including termination, is
         impermissible during the pendency of such
         proceedings unless prior approval is obtained
         from the appropriate authority. The record in
         the present case does not indicate that the
         Respondent Employer ever sought or was
         granted the requisite approval. Prima facie,
         therefore, this conduct reflects a deliberate
         attempt to circumvent the lawful claims of the
         workmen, particularly when their dispute over
         regularization and wages remained sub
         judice.



                10. The Respondent Employer consistently
         labelled the Appellant Workmen as casual
         employees (or workers engaged through an
         unnamed contractor), yet there is no material proof
         of adherence to 
Section 6N
 of the U.P. Industrial
         Disputes Act, 1947, which mandates a proper
         notice or wages in lieu thereof as well as
         retrenchment compensation. In this context,
         whether an individual is classified as regular or
         temporary is irrelevant as retrenchment obligations
         under the Act must be met in all cases attracting
         Section 6N. Any termination thus effected without
         statutory safeguards cannot be undertaken lightly.



               11. xxxx


               12. xxxx


               13. xxxx


 
14. The Respondent Employer places
         reliance on 
Umadevi
 (supra)2 to contend that
         daily-wage or temporary employees cannot
         claim permanent absorption in the absence of
         statutory rules providing such absorption.
         However,     as    frequently    reiterated, Uma
         Devi itself        distinguishes        between
         appointments that are "illegal" and those that
         are "irregular," the latter being eligible for
         regularization if they meet certain conditions.

         More importantly, Uma Devi cannot serve as a
         shield to justify exploitative engagements
         persisting for years without the Employer
         undertaking legitimate recruitment. Given the
         record which shows no true contractor-based
         arrangement and a consistent need for
         permanent horticultural staff the alleged
         asserted ban on fresh recruitment, though
         real, cannot justify indefinite daily-wage
         status or continued unfair practices.



               15. It is manifest that the Appellant
         Workmen        continuously    rendered      their
         services over several years, sometimes
         spanning more than a decade. Even if certain
         muster rolls were not produced in full, the
         Employer's failure to furnish such records--
         despite directions to do so--allows an adverse
         inference     under    well-established    labour
         jurisprudence. Indian labour law strongly
         disfavors perpetual daily-wage or contractual
         engagements in circumstances where the
         work is permanent in nature. Morally and
         legally, workers who fulfil ongoing municipal
         requirements year after year cannot be
         dismissed       summarily     as    dispensable,
         particularly in the absence of a genuine
         contractor agreement. At this juncture, it
         would be appropriate to recall the broader
         critique of indefinite "temporary" employment
         practices as done by a recent judgment of this
         court in Jaggo v. Union of India3 in the following
         paragraphs:



                     "xxxxxxxxx"



               16. xxx


               17. xxx


                18. The impugned order of the High Court,
         to the extent they confine the Appellant Workmen
         to future daily-wage engagement without continuity
         or meaningful back wages, is hereby set aside with
         the following directions:

         I.     The    discontinuation     of    the  Appellant
                Workmen's      services,     effected   without
                compliance with Section 6E and 
Section 6N

                of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is
                declared illegal. All orders or communications
                terminating their services are quashed. In
                consequence, the Appellant Workmen shall
                be treated as continuing in service from the
                date of their termination, for all purposes,
                including seniority and continuity in service.



         II.    The Respondent Employer shall reinstate the
                Appellant Workmen in their respective posts
                (or posts akin to the duties they previously
                performed) within four weeks from the date
                of this judgment. Their entire period of
                absence (from the date of termination until
                actual reinstatement) shall be counted for
                continuity of service and all consequential
                benefits, such as seniority and eligibility for
                promotions, if any.



         III.   Considering the length of service, the
                Appellant Workmen shall be entitled to
                50% of the back wages from the date of
                their discontinuation until their actual
                reinstatement.      The     Respondent
                Employer shall clear the aforesaid dues
                within three months from the date of
                their reinstatement.



         IV.    The Respondent Employer is directed to
                initiate a fair and transparent process
                for regularizing the Appellant Workmen
                within six months from the date of
                reinstatement, duly considering the fact
                that they have performed perennial
                municipal duties akin to permanent
                posts. In assessing regularization, the
                Employer shall not impose educational
                or procedural criteria retroactively if
                such requirements were never applied
                to the Appellant Workmen or to similarly
                situated regular employees in the past.

                  To the extent that sanctioned vacancies
                  for such duties exist or are required, the
                  Respondent Employer shall expedite all
                  necessary administrative processes to
                  ensure these long-time employees are
                  not indefinitely retained on daily wages
                  contrary to statutory and equitable
                  norms.



                 19. In view of the above, the appeal(s) filed
           by the workmen are allowed, whereas the
           appeal(s) filed by the Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad are
           dismissed."



 
(Emphasis supplied)

            On a coalesce of the judgments rendered by the
     Apex Court in the afore-quoted cases, which were in the
     aftermath of the judgment in the case of 
UMADEVI (3
)
     supra, would in unmistakable terms indicate that
     regularization of employees is not a concept that is
     obliterated, but could be considered on several
     parameters 
laid down in
 the said judgments. One
     unmistakable stream that runs through judicial thinking of
     judgments of the Apex Court is that, regularization of the
     services of the employees engaged to work for the State
     for long years should be considered, failing which, it
     would amount to violation of 
Article 14
 of the Constitution
     of India."




     15.   In the light of the issue standing covered by the

judgments quoted supra, the petition deserves to succeed with

the direction to respondent No.2 to consider the case of these

petitioners for regularization of their services from the date on

which they completed 10 years from the date of their initial

appointment. It is further germane to notice the Subsequent

judgment of the Apex Court in the case of DHARAM SINGH

the Apex Court has held as follows:



                 "8. Moreover, it must necessarily be noted that
         "ad-hocism" thrives where administration is opaque. The
         State Departments must keep and produce accurate
         establishment registers, muster rolls and outsourcing
         arrangements, and they must explain, with evidence, why
         they prefer precarious engagement over sanctioned posts
         where the work is perennial. If "constraint" is invoked, the
         record should show what alternatives were considered,
         why similarly placed workers were treated differently, and
         how        the     chosen      course       aligns      with
         
Articles 14

         of the appellants, the admitted perennial nature of their

         comparator regularisations, we issue the following

                      the Commission and a fresh decision by the
                      State on sanctioning posts for the appellants.

                      For this purpose, the State and the successor
                      establishment (U.P. Education Services
                      Selection     Commission)      shall    create
                      supernumerary posts in the corresponding

                post, with protection of last-drawn wages if
                higher and the appellants shall be entitled to
                the subsequent increments in the pay scale
                as per the pay grade. For seniority and
                promotion, service shall count from the date
                of regularization as given above.



         ii.    Financial          consequences           and
                arrears: Each appellant shall be paid as
                arrears the full difference between (a) the
                pay and admissible allowances at the
                minimum of the regular pay-level for the post
                from time to time, and (b) the amounts
                actually paid, for the period from 24.04.2002
                until           the           date          of
                regularization/retirement/death, as the case
                may be. Amounts already paid under
                previous interim directions shall be so
                adjusted. The net arrears shall be released
                within three months and if in default, the
                unpaid amount shall carry compound interest
                at 6% per annum from the date of default
                until payment.



         iii.   Retired appellants: Any appellant who has
                already retired shall be granted regularization
                with effect from 24.04.2002 until the date of
                superannuation for pay fixation, arrears
                under clause (ii), and recalculation of
                pension, gratuity and other terminal dues.
                The revised pension and terminal dues shall
                be paid within three months of this
                Judgment.



         iv.    Deceased appellants: In the case of
                Appellant No. 5 and any other appellant who
                has died during pendency, his/her legal
                representatives on record shall be paid the
                arrears under clause (ii) up to the date of
                death, together with all terminal/retiral dues
                recalculated consistently with clause (i),
                within three months of this Judgment.

                Secretary, Higher Education Department,

                   Secretary of the U.P. Education Services
                   Selection Commission or the prevalent
                   competent authority, shall file an affidavit of
                   compliance before this Court within four
                   months of this Judgment.



             20. We      have     framed      these      directions
      comprehensively because, case after case, orders of this
      Court in such matters have been met with fresh
      technicalities,     rolling    "reconsiderations,"        and
      administrative drift which further prolongs the insecurity
      for those who have already laboured for years on daily
      wages. Therefore, we have learned that Justice in such
      cases cannot rest on simpliciter directions, but it demands
      imposition of clear duties, fixed timelines, and verifiable
      compliance. As a constitutional employer, the State is
      held to a higher standard and therefore it must organise
      its perennial workers on a sanctioned footing, create a
      budget for lawful engagement, and implement judicial
      directions in letter and spirit. Delay to follow these
      obligations is not mere negligence but rather it is a
      conscious method of denial that erodes livelihoods and
      dignity for these workers. The operative scheme we have
      set here comprising of creation of supernumerary posts,
      full regularization, subsequent financial benefits, and a
      sworn affidavit of compliance, is therefore a pathway
      designed to convert rights into outcomes and to reaffirm
      that fairness in engagement and transparency in
      administration are not matters of grace, but obligations
      under 
Articles 14
, 16
 and 
21
 of the Constitution of India"



      16.   The Apex Court holds that keeping the persons in

continuous ad hoc employment would itself become arbitrary and

violative of the 
Article 14
 of the Constitution of India. In that

light, the direction would ensue to the respondents to consider

the case of these petitioners to regularise their services.



      17.   For the aforesaid reasons, the following:
