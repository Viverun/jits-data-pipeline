Agreement to Sell acquired by it. The said rights of

Agreement of Sale which was acquired by Jalpa Traders

came to be assigned by the said firm through its partners

in       favour       of        M/s.Chhaganlal         and     Company               vide

Agreement to Sell dated 23.11.1973, who entered into an

Agreement of Sale in favour of the plaintiff society to sell

the land under the Agreement of Sale dated 27.12.1974,

under which agreement plaintiff society is said to have

paid        a    sum       of    Rs.15,000/-      to   M/s.Chhaganlal                 and

of Sale dated 27.12.1974 executed by M/s.Chhaganlal and

Company and at the first instance, the agreed price was

Rs.3.25 per sq.meter and it was agreed to be revised

upwards by Rs.2 per sq.meter totaling to Rs.5.25 per

sq.meter. It is also contended that while assigning all

rights over the said land in favour of the plaintiff society

by the defendants, all the defendants have executed their

writings over the Agreement to Sell dated 27.12.1974 and

on 18.04.1976 vacant and peaceful possession of the land

(hereinafter referred to as 'suit schedule property')

agreed to be sold in favour of plaintiff society was handed

over to the plaintiff.





4.                It is further contended by the plaintiff that

defendant trust had received a sum of Rs.20,001/-

towards consideration by Cheque dated 21.10.1982 which

has been duly accepted that it was in lieu of Cheque

dated 11.08.1982 owing to certain mistake in the said

cheque. It is also contended                         that   further sum of

Rs.5,500/-            was   paid    towards         sale    consideration              on

30.12.1982 and a sum of Rs.5,000/- paid on 04.06.1983 by

cheque drawn on Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank.

Thus, plaintiff society claimed that in all it had paid

Rs.30,501/- to the defendant trust.





5.                Plaintiff also claimed that one Shri Babaji

Bapuji          had    been    as    appointed         on     01.10.1976               as

Watchman for the suit schedule property after obtaining

possession and a sum of Rs.4,800/- was paid to him by

Chhaganlal and Company and same had been refunded by

a sum of Rs.4,800/- was paid on 25.09.1978 and on

16.12.1978, further sum of Rs.4,800/-, Rs.5,300/- on

10.06.1980 and Rs.5,300/- on 17.06.1981. Thus, in all a

sum of Rs.25,000/- was claimed to have been paid to the

said Babaji Bapuji by the plaintiff society. It is further

contended             that   plaintiff society        appointed              Shri

Jagbahadur Lagbadahur Thapa as Watchman on monthly

salary and presently Rs.400/- is paid to him towards his

salary. It is contended that a room has been constructed

for the residence of said watchman and as such, plaintiff

claimed to be in possession of the suit schedule property.



6.                Plaintiff has contended that it was desirous of

constructing houses for its members and as such had got

a layout plan drawn by the Engineer which plan was also

Charity Commissioner seeking permission to sell the suit

land as required under 
Section 36
 of the BPT Act. Plaintiff

also contended that defendants have filed Form No.1 at

Gandhinagar as per 
Section 20
 of the Urban Land

(Ceiling and Regulation) Act seeking exemption from the

provisions of said law wherein it is specifically mentioned

that defendant has proposed to sell the suit land to the

plaintiff.





7.                Contending that defendant No.1 trust was

attempting to dispose of the suit land to someone else

owing to price escalation and there is likelihood of

plaintiff being disturbed of possession and despite being

told by the plaintiff to execute the sale, said demand is

not being complied by defendant and as such, plaintiff

initially instituted a Civil Suit No.210 of 1983 for

perpetual             injunction   which           was    withdrawn               with

permission on 17.07.1984 and the present suit was filed

on the same day i.e. on 17.07.1984 seeking for specific

performance of the Agreement of Sale dated 27.12.1984.

      C/FA/3517/2000                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023





8.                On service of suit summons, defendant Nos.1 to

4 and 6 appeared and filed their written statement

denying the averments made in the plaint except to the

extent expressly admitted thereunder. It was contended

that similar suit had been filed earlier and it has been

withdrawn and therefore the present suit was barred by

res judicata. It was also contended that present suit was

barred by limitation. It was specifically contended that

suit is not maintainable as per 
Section 51
 of BPT Act

since written permission from the Charity Commissioner

for filing of the suit was not obtained and on this ground

suit was liable to be dismissed. It was also contended that

Charity Commissioner is a necessary and proper party to

the suit as contemplated under 
Section 51(3)
 of the BPT

Act and for non-joining of necessary party, the suit is

liable to be dismissed. Contending that under 
Section 80


of the BPT Act, the Civil Court does not have jurisdiction

to hear and adjudicate the suit, defendants sought for its

dismissal.





9.                It was also contended that defendants had

entered into Banakhat - Agreement to Sell the sit land to

Pramukhlal and Ambalal but later on the trust and

Pramukhlal made another Banakhat - Agreement to Sell

in favour of Gangaram Pavde which agreement was not

duly signed by all the trustees. It was further contended

that in the earlier Agreement to Sell entered into by the

trust with Pramukhal and Ambalal, it did not contain the

signature of Ambalal and as such, the said Banakhat -

Agreement to Sell was pleaded to be not legal. Denying

the fact that Gangaram Pavde had transferred his

Banakhat rights to third party, the plaintiff has been put

to strict proof of the same. It is further contended that

from amongst the trustees of the first defendant trust,

one of the trustees on advise of the plaintiff had entered

into Agreement to Sell in favour of Mukundbhai on behalf

of Jalpa Traders on 08.05.1972. This Agreement to Sell

was     signed      by      Mr.Kunjbihari         who    had        not        been

authorized         by all    the trustees to enter into such

agreement.          Hence,     contending         that      trust         is     not

responsible or answerable for such transaction and

denying that Kunjbihari being the Managing Trustee of

the trust or having any such unilateral power to enter

into Agreement of Sale, they have denied said agreement.

The agreement dated 03.04.1972 was also pleaded not to

be in the knowledge or not being in the knowledge of

defendants and plaintiff was put to strict proof of the

same. The right of Jalpa Traders transferring their

Banakhat           rights,   defendants           pleaded     their        lack        of

personal knowledge as also the right of Chhaganlal and

Company transferring their Banakhat rights in favour of

the plaintiff. The contention raised by the plaintiff in the

plaint in this behalf has been denied and plaintiff has

been put to strict proof of the same. The fact of

possession having been delivered to the plaintiff by the

trustees is also denied. The execution of the document

with regard to possession of the suit schedule property

having been delivered to the plaintiff is also denied by the

defendants. It was contended that one Mr.Anubhai

Premchand was claiming to be the tenant and the dispute

in this regard was pending before the Revenue Tribunal.

   C/FA/3517/2000                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




The Banakhat - Agreement to Sell between Chhaganlal

and Company and M/s.Jalpa Traders on 13.11.1973 about

delivery of vacant possession is denied. It was specifically

denied that plaintiff was put in possession of the suit

lands.





10.            Plaintiff was put to strict proof with regard to

affixure of signature of defendants with regard to layout

plan. However, defendants admitted to have made an

application before the Charity Commissioner for selling

the suit land and filing the form before the ULC

authorities.





11.            It is also contended that defendant is a public

trust registered under 
BPT Act
 and without obtaining

permission to sell, the suit schedule property cannot be

sold to any private person and this fact is well within the

knowledge of the plaintiff. Hence, the alleged delivery of

possession of suit schedule property in favour of plaintiff

came to be denied. It was contended that suit land is in

possession of the tenants and case was pending before

the Revenue Tribunal. Hence, it was contended that

plaintiff was not in possession of the suit land.



12.            The defendants denied the plaintiff's claim of

having made any oral demand for executing the sale and

contended that there is no direct contact between the

plaintiff and defendants to sell the suit schedule land.

Contending that the trust cannot sell the land to the

plaintiff, as it does not have permission and defendants

are also not bound to sell the suit schedule land. It was

specifically contended that all the trustees have not

affixed their signatures and there is no legal contract

between plaintiff and defendants qua the suit land. On

these grounds amongst others pleaded in the written

statement,         they   sought     for     dismissal       of     the       suit.

Defendant          No.5   and   15       have    filed     their         written

statements as per Exhibits-54 and 126 respectively.

Subsequently, 15th defendant was ordered to be deleted

and accordingly 1st defendant has been deleted. The

Charity Commissioner has not filed any reply. No other

defendants have filed their written statement. Hence,

based on the pleadings of the parties, the learned Trial

Judge framed ten (10) issues for determination. Learned

Trial Judge has answered issue No.1 in the affirmative

and issue Nos.2, 8(a), 9 and 10 partly affirmative. Issue

Nos.3 to 8 in the negative.





13.            In order to substantiate the averments made in

the plaint, one Shri Babulal got himself examined as only

witness on behalf of the plaintiff. His deposition has been

marked as Exhibit-49. No witnesses were examined on

behalf       of    plaintiffs.   On     appreciation         of      oral        and

documentary evidence, learned trial Judge by judgment

and decree dated 23.10.2000 partly decreed the suit and

directed defendant Nos.1 to 8 and defendant No.14 to

refund sum of Rs.25,000/- plus Rs.40,000/- to the plaintiff

with interest at 12% per annum from the date of receipt

of judgment and dismissed the prayer for specific

performance. The relief of perpetual injunction sought for

has been rejected and the interim order which had been

granted on Exhibit-5 application came to be revoked.

Hence, this appeal.

14.               We have heard the arguments of Shri Yatin

Oza, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant

and Shriyuths Shalin Mehta, Mehul S. Shah and Devang

Nanavati, learned Senior Advocates alongwith Shriyuths

Brijesh           Trivedi,   N.M.Kapadia              and     B.M.Mangukiya,

learned advocates for contesting respondents.


14.1              It is the contention of Mr. Yatin Oza, learned

Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant that Trial

Court had committed a serious error in not considering

the pleadings in proper perspective. He would contend

that learned Trial Judge ought to have appreciated the

fact that none of the defendants had tendered any oral

evidence in support of their pleadings and as such the

suit ought to have been decreed as prayed for. He would

contend that trial judge erred in arriving at a conclusion

that there is no existence of agreement of sale in favour

of      the      appellant   warranting           a    decree         of      specific

performance by completely ignoring the fact that Trial

Court itself has accepted that plaintiff had proved that

   C/FA/3517/2000                                CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




part of sale consideration had been paid by the plaintiff to

defendant No.1 trust which would itself indicate the

existence of an agreement of sale.




14.2           He would also contend that if there had been

no intention on the part of the appellant and respondent

No.1 trust to act upon the said agreement of sale, no

steps could have been taken by defendant No.1 as well as

by the appellant and the very fact that requisite

permission from the concerned authorities having been

filed not being in dispute was itself sufficient to arrive at

a conclusion that there was existence of an agreement of

sale and there was no intention on the part of plaintiff

and defendant No.1 not to act upon said agreement.


14.3           He would also contend that in part performance

of the agreement of sale, possession of the suit land had

been handed over to the plaintiff and as such defendant

No.1 is precluded from taking contrary stand in this

Appeal. He would submit that oral testimony of the

plaintiff's        witness   would       get    support          from          the

   C/FA/3517/2000                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




documentary evidence tendered and same has been

completely ignored by the Trial Court and the ones which

have been considered is not accepted without any reasons

being assigned and as such there is no justification for

the learned Trial Judge to have arrived at a conclusion

that plaintiff was not in possession of the suit schedule

property.




14.4           He   would   elaborate         his    submissions                by

contending that learned Trial Judge erred in arriving at a

conclusion that agreement of sale Exhibit 194 through

which the interest possessed by Chhaganlal & Company

was transferred to plaintiff was not having signatures of

all the trustees of respondent No.1 trust would be of no

consequence since way back in the year 1978, i.e. on

11.11.1978, a resolution had been passed by trust which

conclusively disclosed that defendant No.1 had consented

to the sale transaction in favour of Chhaganlal &

Company and thereafter in favour of the appellant,

subject to permission being obtained from the Charity

Commissioner and as such any stand taken contrary to



                             Page 17 of 157

   C/FA/3517/2000                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




the same either by defendant No.1 or by other trustees is

of no consequence.




14.5           He would contend that had it been the case of

the appellant not being ready and willing, it would not

have affected the payment of part consideration and

plaintiff would not have moved the authorities for

obtaining various permissions under provisions of various

statutes, nor would it have deployed its watchman for the

purpose of maintaining the suit land. He would also

contend that the provisions of 
Sections 50
 and 
51
 of the

Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951 would not be attracted to

the facts on hand as defendant No.1 trust is not a public

trust.     He would also contend that provision contained

under 
Section 36A
 of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951

is applicable only to transfer by way of sale, mortgage or

release and not to a transaction of agreement of sale

which is distinct and different from that of transaction of

sale. Hence, he contends that question of obtaining prior

permission would not arise. He would also contend that

the documents produced along with civil applications



                            Page 18 of 157


                                                     Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023

   C/FA/3517/2000                           CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




seeking for additional evidence would clearly disclose the

existence of agreement of sale Exhibit 194 between

plaintiff and defendant No.1 and by referring to various

documents produced along with the plaint which though

produced had not been exhibited but referred to in the

deposition of plaintiff's witness to contend that all the

trustees except defendant No.7 had filed application

under 
Section 36
 of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951

before the Charity Commissioner seeking permission to

sell the suit schedule property to the plaintiff which itself

was sufficient to hold that there was an agreement of sale

executed by defendant No.1 in favour of the plaintiff. He

would draw the attention of the Court to the agreement of

sale marked as Exhibit 194 to contend that pursuant to

the said agreement executed in favour of plaintiff

executed by the said Chhaganlal & Company which had

been endorsed by 5 trustees and subsequently ratified on

18.4.1976 by 4 trustees and as such there being a clear

evidence to said effect, there was no impediment for the

Trial Court to have decreed a suit as sought for.                          He

would also contend that as per the said endorsement

dated 18.4.1976 made by defendant No.1 trust and its

trustees, the possession of the suit schedule property was

handed over to the plaintiff and in furtherance of the

same, defendant No.2 on behalf of defendant No.1 trust

had filed Form No.1 before Urban Land Ceiling Authority

seeking exemption for selling the suit scheduled land. He

would also draw the attention of the Court to the

document           dated    28.8.1978          issued    by       the       District

Panchayat whereunder permission had been granted to

the plaintiff to purchase the suit land. By inviting the

attention of the Court to the order dated 20.10.1978

passed        by    the    Revenue         Department          rejecting            the

application seeking exemption under 
Sections 19
 and 
20


of the Urban Land Ceiling Act, he would contend that

same would reflect that there was an agreement of sale in

favour of the plaintiff. He would further contend that

defendant          No.1    trust    had       passed     a     resolution             on

11.11.1978 resolving to sell the suit land to the plaintiff,

which resolution was duly signed by defendant Nos.2 to 4

and 6 which would evident that there was an agreement

of sale and this when read along with Exhibit 205 to 207

would clearly evidence the fact of there being an

agreement of sale between plaintiff and defendant.


14.6           He would contend that even assuming and

accepting          that   only   few    trustees      have       signed          the

agreement of sale then also appellant would be entitled to

seek specific performance and mere non-execution of the

agreement of sale by other trustees would not render the

agreement of sale invalid. He would contend that when

Form No.1 was filed before the Urban Land Ceiling

Authority for exemption, same was not objected to by any

other trustee and thus, defendant No.2 was held to be

authorised to act for and on behalf of other trustees.

Insofar as finding recorded by the Trial Court with regard

to advance money of Rs.45,000/- paid to defendant No.14,

he would submit that said defendant itself admitted in the

written statement filed to the said effect and as such

finding of the Trial Judge requires to be set aside. He

would also contend that plaintiff has complied with the

                                                          Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023

terms and conditions of the agreement Exhibit 194 and

has paid Rs.25,001/- to defendant No.1 as per the agreed

terms viz. within 6 months. On account of defendants

having not denied this fact, he prays for adverse

inference being drawn against the defendants.


14.7           Insofar as possession of the suit schedule

property is concerned, he would submit that even in the

application filed by the trustees before various statutory

authorities, they admit that plaintiff was in possession of

the suit property and even otherwise Trial Judge failed to

consider the question of possession being immaterial

while adjudicating the suit filed for specific performance

of agreement of sale (Exhibit 194).




14.8           He would also contend that permission under


Section 36
 of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951 not

being there on record was the reason for dismissing the

suit and same is contrary to the principles laid down by

this Court in AIR 1984 GUJ 145 and the judgment of the

Hon'ble Apex Court in 2020 SCC OnLine SC 825. he

would        contend    that     even           otherwise         subsequent

application can be filed and in view of subsequent law viz.


Urban Land Ceiling Act
 having been repealed, question of

obtaining permission under 
ULC Act
 did not arise.


14.9           On the issue of readiness and willingness, he

would submit that very fact that plaintiff has complied

with all terms and conditions of the agreement would

indicate its continuous readiness and willingness having

been exhibited by the plaintiff. He would contend that

very fact that appellant has agreed to pay the revised

rates to the trustees; and has paid consideration towards

the defendant trust as well as defendant No.14 as agreed

to Exhibit 194 is a mirror to the fact that the appellant /

plaintiff has been ready and willing to perform his part of

the contract. He would also contend that though plaintiff

has not stated in actual words and stated to the effect

that he is ready and willing, the very fact that the plaintiff

is ready to pay the balance consideration as stated in the

prayer would suffice for this Court to arrive at a

conclusion that plaintiff has been ready and willing to

perform his part of the contract. Non-consideration of

these      vital    aspects      has resulted          in miscarriage in

administration of justice.





14.10          Mr.Yatin          Oza,     learned          Senior          Counsel

appearing          for     the    appellant         would      contend             that

interlocutory            applications       filed    for      production               of

additional evidence be allowed and the documents

produced along with the said application be admitted in

evidence. He would also contend that no time limit has

been fixed for filing of an application for additional

evidence. He would also contend that some of the

documents have come into existence subsequent to the

filing of the present appeal and as such this Court can

take note of subsequent events. He would also contend

that some of the documents which are prior to the filing

of the appeal were not in the custody of the appellant and

appellant had no knowledge as appellant was not a party

in the proceedings held by the Charity Commissioner and

as such these documents could not have been produced

at earlier point of time. He would submit that even

otherwise for substantial cause the documents can be

taken on record and some of the documents being public

documents, this Court should adopt liberal approach in

receiving the same by way of additional evidence.


14.11          He would further contend that Explanation-II of


Section 16(c)
 will have no application. He would contend

that 
Section 114
 of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act which is

analogous to 
Section 80
 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act

will have no application inasmuch as no Civil Court has

decided any issue and as such a conditional decree can be

passed by this Court. He would contend that escalation of

the price would not be a ground on which plaintiff can be

denied the relief of specific performance and he would

draw the attention of the Court to the judgment of

Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of 
Nirmal Anand Vs.

14.12         Mr.Shalin   Mehta,       learned     Senior          Counsel

appearing for the 6th defendant has contended that

agreements dated 18.08.1966, 21.09.1970, 08.05.1972

and 03.04.1973 as well as agreement dated 13.11.1973

which has been referred to in Exhibit 194 were never

produced and marked as exhibits and as such the very

basis on which plaintiff seeks specific performance has

not been proved, question granting decree for specific

performance does not arise. He would also contend that

plaintiffs have never demanded defendants for execution

of Sale Deed and would draw the attention of the Court to

paragraph 12 of the written statement filed by defendant

Nos.1 to 4 and 6. He would submit that after rejection of

the application by the Charity Commissioner no steps

  C/FA/3517/2000                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




were taken by plaintiffs. He would contend that in the

instant case there were three rejections namely on

27.10.1970,       the   Charity       Commissioner              accorded

permission to sell the suit schedule property within a

fixed time. Subsequently, by order dated 26.02.1986 it

rejected the application filed by Vitthal Mandir Trust,

against which two revisions were filed namely one by the

trust which was subsequently withdrawn and another

revision by Bansilal     Amritlal Parikh which came to be

dismissed on merits on 13.06.2001 which was confirmed

in Special Civil Application No.7360 of 2001. He would

contend that trustees are also pujaris and they have a

hereditary right. He would contend that terms and

conditions of the agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974

(Exh-194) are not fulfilled by the plaintiff and hence

specific performance ought to be rejected. He would

contend permission as required under 
Section 36
 has not

been obtained from the Charity Commissioner for sale of

suit schedule property; time limit as contemplated under

agreement dated 30.11.1973 is not adhered to; plaintiff

was not possessing money as agreed to be paid under

Exhibit 194 and this is evident from the audit report

Exhibit 36.





15.            He   would    submit           that    obtaining             prior

permission under 
Section 36
 is mandatory and till filing of

the suit and even as on date no such permission has been

obtained from the Charity Commissioner by the plaintiff.



16.            He would submit that plaintiff had earlier filed

a suit No.210 of 1983 and withdrew the same without any

opportunity to institute fresh suit. He would contend that

plaintiff has never whispered a word about readiness and

willingness. He would also submit that plaintiff who had

to aver and prove that he has performed or has been

always ready and willing to perform has not been averred

and proved. He would contend that ULC permission has

been rejected and proof of payment of advance amount

has not been proved by the plaintiff.                   Hence, he has

prayed for dismissal of the Appeal. In support of his

submissions, he has relied upon the following judgments :

17.            Shri   Mehul   Suresh           Shah,     learned          Senior

Counsel appearing for 3rd defendant would submit that

there is no cause of action for the suit and the one alleged

in the plaint is without any basis and same is liable to be

rejected. He would also contend that Exhibit 194 is a

contingent         contract   and     cannot        be     enforced.              By

contending that subsequent event is to be taken note of

by relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in

the matter of 
Pasupuleti Venkateswarlu vs. The Motor

& General Traders
 reported in (1975) 1 SCC 770, he

prays for application for additional evidence filed being

allowed. Contending that permission to sell the suit

schedule property was not there and same has not been

obtained by plaintiff. He would contend that there are no

pleading in the plaint with regard to readiness and

willingness and plaintiff has also admitted under Exhibit

208 which is an audit report of the plaintiff society for the

period 01.01.1984 to 30.06.1985 that closing balance as

on 1985 was only Rs.724.70ps.
 which would indicate that

plaintiff society do not have any money, muchless the

balance amount of consideration being available or

possessed by it.





18.            He would submit that a duty is cast on the

Court to protect the public property. In support of his

submission, he has relied upon 1978 GLR 661 and

(2007) 7 SCC 482.





19.            He would submit that plaintiff had examined

only one witness as per the examination-in-chief Exhibit

49 and said witness had no authority and he had been

removed from the membership of society even as on the

date he tendered the evidence, he was not a member of

the plaintiff society. He has relied upon following

for the 4th defendant would contend that plaintiff has not

submit that no issue has been framed by the Trial Court

in this regard and no evidence has also been tendered. In

support of this proposition, he has relied upon AIR 2022

Online SC 998 and 2022 (1) JT 344.

Apex Court in the case of Khasgi (Devi Ahilyabai

854, he would contend that property of public trust

cannot be sold without obtaining permission. He would

also contend that there is no error in the judgment and

decree passed by the Trial Court and plaintiff having

failed to prove his capability to mobilize funds, the

discretionary relief which has not been granted requires

to be affirmed. On the issue of possession of the suit

schedule property, he would contend that the Trial Court

has recorded a clear finding that plaintiff is not in

possession but defendant is in possession of the suit

scheduled          proceeding     which          would      not        call       for

interference. Hence, he prays for dismissal of the appeal.

In support of his submission, he has relied upon following

citations:

               vs. K.K.Rathinavel

22.            Shri N.M. Kapadia, learned counsel appearing

for 5th defendant would draw the attention of the Court to

the written statement filed by defendant Nos.1, 4 and 6.

He would submit that from the date of alleged agreement

of sale till filing of the suit, no demand has been made by

   C/FA/3517/2000                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




the plaintiff and plaintiff has failed to prove its readiness

and     willingness   throughout.      He   would        submit           that

plaintiff's evidence has to be discarded by trial court and

rightly so, inasmuch as said witness had already resigned

as a member of the society on 13.09.1999 and by relying

upon the resolution dated 13.09.1999 passed by the

plaintiff society, he prays this Court should also ignore

the evidence of the plaintiff witness. He would also draw

the attention of the Court to the finding recorded by the

Trial Court on issue Nos.2 and 3 to contend that plaintiff

has made false statements at four places and plaintiff's

witness did not produce authorization to represent the

plaintiff or file the suit or depose before the Court. He

would submit that a specific defence has been taken by

the 5th defendant in paragraph 2 of the written statement

and as such, the evidence tendered by the plaintiff cannot

be looked into by this Court. By relying upon the

judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Man Kaur

(Dead) by Lrs. vs. Hartar Singh Sangha reported in

(2010) 10 SCC 512 (paragraph 17), he would submit

that only person with personal knowledge could have

deposed about the transaction and present witness

Mr.Babulal is not a signatory to Exhibit 194 and none of

the persons who have witnessed the execution of Exhibit

194 have entered the witness-box. Hence, he would

contend that evidence of Babulal need not be looked into.



23.            He would also contend that there is no pleading

to the effect that Kunjbihari Bhagwat was the only trustee

and he was authorized to sign on behalf of all the

trustees. In the absence of pleading no amount of

evidence           will   help   the    party.      
In    support             of     this

proposition, he has relied upon the judgment in the case

of 
Biraji Alias Brijraji and another vs. Surya Pratap

and others
 reported in (2020) 10 SCC 729. He would

also contend that plaintiff is guilty of suppression of facts

namely it has not whispered a word in the pleadings

about the application filed under 
Section 36
 having been

rejected           and    hence,   plaintiff is          not      entitled           for

discretionary relief namely specific performance.
 
In

support of said submission, he has relied upon the

judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in 
Bhaskar Laxman

Jadhav and others vs. Karamveer Kakasaheb Wagh

Education Society and others
, reported in (2013) 11

SCC 531. He would contend that the conduct of the

plaintiff disentitles it to any relief and by drawing the

attention of the Court to the order dated 05.03.1992

passed in CRA No.141 of 1987 as per the Exhibit 134 to

contend that even after direction issued, plaintiff had

obtained 49 adjournments and as such, he prays for

rejection of the appeal. He would contend that when

Gujarat           Revenue   Appellate          Tribunal         in        Appeal

No.TGNAA.33 of 1986 had affirmed the order of the

Charity       Commissioner,     who        had     refused           to     grant

permission to sell the property, question of granting

conditional decree does not arise. Hence, he prays for

rejection of the appeal. In support of his submission, he

24.           Mr.Devang Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate

appearing for applicant in Civil Application No.3 of 2018

would        contend   that   applicants         are    the      holders           of

agreement of sale dated 18.08.1966 for which the Charity

Commissioner had granted permission and claims to be

necessary and proper party to the present proceedings as

the suit schedule property for which the applicants have

initiated proceedings for specific performance.                          Hence,

he prays for the application being allowed. He has relied

upon following judgments : -



      (i)     (2007) 10 SCC 82 - Sumtibai and Others

agency does not bind the trust. He would submit that

trustees and trust have fiduciary relationship. He would

also contend that suit schedule property is an agricultural

land and plaintiffs/purchasers are not agriculturists and

the transaction in question is hit by Section 63 of the

Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act. He would

submit that 
Section 36
 and 
Section 80
 of the Trusts Act

bars Civil Court's jurisdiction to grant any relief, as also


Sections 10
, 
11
 an 14 of the 
Specific Relief Act
. He would

contend that there is no pleadings in the plaint that

transaction is for the benefit of trust and trustees had

acted bonafide in the interest of trust. He would contend

that in the memorandum of appeal, there is no mention

about the finding of the Trial Court being erroneous or

incorrect.





26.            He would also elaborate his submissions by

contending that neither the bye-laws of the plaintiff

society have been produced nor the resolution. He would

submit that the provisions of Order VI Rule 14 and 15 has

not been complied and the plaint presented is not in

learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant has

contended that there is an endorsement in Exhibit 194 of

possession         of   suit   schedule           property       having          been

delivered to the plaintiff and as such proving the contents

of Exhibit 194 does not arise. By referring to Exhibit 205,

he would contend that trustees (three trustees) have

consented for sale of suit schedule property in favour of

the plaintiff. According to him, when defendants have

agreed and admitted that they have consented for sale of

suit schedule property, they cannot take any contrary

stand in this Appeal. He would rely upon Exhibit 205 to

207 to contend that all trustees have declared that all

four trustees have signed and have given approval to the

agreement of sale Exhibit 194 by filing an application

filed before the Charity Commissioner dated 16.04.2001.



28.            He would also submit that defendant Nos.2 to 6

having gone before the Charity Commissioner seeking

permission to compromise and admitting thereunder that

they would be willing to execute the Sale Deed, they

cannot now contend that there are no pleadings with

regard to readiness and willingness. He would draw the

attention of the Court to Civil Application No.2 of 2014

and Civil Application No.6 of 2022 to contend that

plaintiffs have admitted to have filed application before

the Charity Commissioner agreeing and willing to sell the

suit schedule property in favour of plaintiff. Shri Oza,

learned Senior Counsel would contend since 
ULC Act
 has

been repealed, the order of rejection of ULC authorities

would be of no consequences and in support of his

submission, he has relied upon 2020 SCC Online 825.



29.              By relying upon the judgments reported in

2022 SCC Online (SC) 351 and (2016) 14 SCC 161,

he would contend that defendants cannot be allowed to

take contradictory stands namely having taken a stand

before the Charity Commissioner agreeing to sell the suit

schedule property in favour of the plaintiff cannot now

contend and try to find holes in the plaint to stave off the

claim       of     plaintiff.   He     would      also      contend             that

endorsement made on 18.04.1976 in Exhibit 194 by

defendants would clearly go to show that possession of

the suit schedule property was delivered to plaintiff. He

would also submit that issue regarding readiness and

willingness        was   not   framed           and      Court        below         had

committed an error in recording a finding on the said

aspect without framing an issue. In reply to the argument

of Mr.Mangukiya that the suit is hit by Order II Rule 2, he

relies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in

(2004) 11 SCC 219. In reply to the argument that

Exhibit 194 is hit by Section 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy

and Agricultural Lands Act, he would contend that Clause


(c) of the Section 63 was inserted with effect from 1977

namely by Act 30 of 1977 and Section 64A then prevailing

permitted sale of agricultural property in favour of a

cooperative housing society and this provision was

deleted only from 1987 namely by Act 21 of 1987 and as

such, he prays for rejection of the contentions raised by

the respondents and prays for appeal being allowed.

for the parties we are of the considered view that

following points would arise for our consideration :

33.            As noted above, one Mr. Babulal came to be

examined on behalf of plaintiff. Learned trial Judge while

adjudicating issue No. 2 & 3 has held plaintiff had failed

to prove of having made payment of Rs. 30,501/- to

defendant No. 1 to 8 and Rs. 45,000/- to 14 th defendant.



It has been further held defendants have admitted to

having consented to have executed agreement of sale

dated 18.04.1976 and on the ground of defendant Nos. 7

and 8 having not affixed their signatures to sale

agreement, issue No. 2 has been held to have been

proved partly.



34.             On issue No. 3, learned trial Judge has arrived

at a conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to prove the

same namely having paid Rs. 45,000/- to defendant No.

14 and Rs. 30,501/- to defendant Nos. 1 to 8.



35.             Issue No. 4 and 5 related to plaintiff proving its

alleged possession of suit schedule property and same

has been held to have not been proved by plaintiff, by

arriving at a conclusion that plaintiff had failed to prove

possession         of   suit   schedule           property       having          been

delivered by 14 defendant to plaintiff. It has been further

held that form 7/12 for the year 1975-76 would reflect the

name       of      Anubhai     Premchand            in    the      columns             of

possession. It has also been held plaintiff has not

examined the Watchman who according to plaintiff had

been appointed to take care of suit schedule property.



The alleged claim of plaintiff that defendants were

attempting to dispossess the plaintiff from suit schedule

property has been negatived by answering issue no. 5

against plaintiff and it has been further held that plaintiff

had failed to prove alleged threat of defendants and their

attempts to take forcible possession of suit schedule

property.



36.            At regards issue No. 6 to 8 it has been held in

the negative by the trial Court. To prove issue no. 6,

burden was cast on defendants. It was the plea of

defendant that suit schedule property was in possession

of a tenant.       On account of document having not been

tendered before trial Court, it has been held that

defendants had failed to prove said issue. Issue No. 7 & 8

are also held to be not proved by defendants according to

learned trial Judge on the ground that extension of time

was agreed for performance of agreement of sale.



37.            Insofar as issue No. 8-A which related to res

judicata, it came to be held by trial Judge that plaintiff

had filed an application to get itself impleaded in First

Appeal No. 362 of 1976, which came to be rejected by

observing that consent decree passed in Civil Suit No. 16

of 1971 would not affect the right of plaintiff vide order

dated 07.07.1983 passed in Civil Appeal No. 2437 of 1983

(Exhibit 124/1) and considering said order, present suit

was held to be maintainable and it was not barred by res

judicata.



38.            While answering issue No. 9 & 10 in the

negative, learned trial Judge has observed permission of

Charity Commissioner was lacking; permission from

competent authority for selling agricultural land was not

there; all the conditions of agreement of sale is not

satisfied; plaintiff was not ready and willing to pay

balance sale consideration; ULC permission was not

available; on these grounds these two issues were

answered against plaintiffs.



39.            Having regard to the alternative prayer of

refund of advance money paid by plaintiff, same has been

ordered to be re-paid by defendant Nos. 1 to 8 and 14

namely Rs. 25,000/- & 40,000/- respectively with interest

@ 12% p.a. from date of receipt.



40.            In the aforesaid background, we proceed to

adjudicate the points formulated hereinabove.



                   DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

RE : POINT NO. (i)


41.            These applications namely Civil Application No.

2 of 2007, 3 of 2007, 2 of 2014, 3 of 2014, 1 of 2015, 2 of

2022, 3 of 2022, 4 of 2022, 5 of 2022 and 6 of 2022 have

been filed under Order 41 Rule 27 for production of

additional evidence.



42.            Before proceeding to adjudicate as to whether

these applications are to be allowed or dismissed, it

would be apt and appropriate to note the contours of

consideration of such applications.             It is trite law that

jurisdiction of the Appellate Court would be exercised not

only when Clause (a) or Clause (aa) of Sub-Rule (1) of

Rule 27 of Order 41 of the code is attracted but also

where such document is required by the Appellate Court

to pronounce the judgment or for any other substantial



                             Page 60 of 157


                                                      Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023

   C/FA/3517/2000                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




cause. If such additional evidence would have a material

bearing on the crucial issue arising for decision between

the parties, such application would be allowed de hors

the allowable deficiency, if any. If certified copy of public

documents are produced and they have a bearing on the

issue involved in the Appeal or the said document would

throw light on the issue to be adjudicated in the Appeal,

then also appellate Court would be justified in allowing

the application for additional evidence. However, if the

said documents would in no way espouse the cause of

either of the parties or it has some remote connection

which would not be necessary for arriving at ultimate

conclusion, then, such documents would not be permitted

to be taken on record. In the absence of plea raised, no

any amount of evidence tendered would be of any use.



43.            The   Appellate   Court        has   power          to     allow

additional evidence not only if it requires such evidence

"to enable it to pronounce judgment" but also for "any

other substantial cause".         Though general rule is that

  C/FA/3517/2000                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




ordinarily, the Appellate Court would not travel outside

the record of the lower Court and additional evidence,

whether oral or documentary is not admitted, but 
Section

107
 of CPC carves out in exception to the General Rule

and enables the Appellate Court to take additional

evidence or to require such evidence to be taken, subject

to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed

namely as prescribed under Rule 27 of Order 41.



Circumstances under which additional evidence are

adduced are; firstly - the Court from whose decree the

Appeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which

ought to have been admitted [Clause (a) of Sub-Rule (1)],

secondly - the parties seeking to produce additional

evidence establishes that notwithstanding the exercise of

due    diligence   such   evidence         was    not      within          the

knowledge or after exercise of due diligence be produced

by him at the time when the decree appealed against was

passed (Clause (aa) of Sub-Rule (1)); thirdly - the

Appellate Court requires any document to be produced or

any witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce

judgment, or for any other substantial cause (Clause (b)

of Sub-Rule (1).



44.            The scope of Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 27 of Order

41 was examined by Privy Counsel way back in 1931 in

the matter of 
Parsotim Thakur versus Lal Mohar

Thakur
 reported in AIR 1931 PC 143 and held by

observing that provisions of Section 107 is elucidated by

order 41 Rule 27 are not clearly intended to allow litigant

who has been unsuccessful in the Lower Court to patch

up the weak parts of his case and fill up the omissions in

the Court of Appeal.
 
The aforesaid principle was noticed

by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
North Eastern

Railway Administration, Gorakhpur vs. Bhagwan

Das (Dead) by Lrs
. - (2008) 8 SCC 511 and held as

under : -




 
"15.    Again in 
K. Venkataramiah Vs. A. Seetharama
       Reddy & Ors.
 a Constitution Bench of this Court while
       reiterating the afore-noted observations in Parsotim's
       case (supra), pointed out that the appellate court has
       the power to allow additional evidence not only if it
       requires such evidence 'to enable it to pronounce
       judgment' but also for 'any other substantial cause'.
       There may well be cases where even though the court
       finds that it is able to pronounce judgment on the state
       of the record as it is, and so, it cannot strictly say that
       it requires additional evidence 'to enable it to

       pronounce judgment', it still considers that in the
       interest of justice something which remains obscure
       should be filled up so that it can pronounce its
       judgment in a more satisfactory manner. Thus, the
       question whether looking into the documents, sought to
       be filed as additional evidence, would be necessary to
       pronounce judgment in a more satisfactory manner,
       has to be considered by the Court at the time of
       hearing of the appeal on merits."




45.            Thus, irresistible conclusion which can be

drawn is, if appellate Court finds that additional evidence

sought to be admitted, are necessary to pronounce

judgment in a satisfactory manner, it would allow the

application as otherwise it would be dismissed.                               The

caveat on this issue would be that before considering or

adjudicating the Appeal on merits, it would be apt and

appropriate that such application filed for additional

evidence being taken up before taking up the Appeal.

made in the application would indicate that in order to

drive home the inter se disputes then existing amongst

the trustees is sought to be placed on record as already

noticed hereinabove. These documents are not only

photocopies but also not certified copies. Even otherwise

said documents would not be required to adjudicate the

real controversy involved in the present Appeal.                           That

respondent No. 11 and 12 respectively, have stated

before the Charity Commissioner in the proceedings

initiated in Section 35 of the Bombay Public Trust Act and

before AUDA that possession of suit schedule property is

subsequent occasion that the possession of the suit

property is with the appellant. By relying upon the report

of the Court Commissioner made in Regular Civil Suit No.

543 of 1999 they seek to displace the stand of appellant.

It is also the endeavour of fifth defendant to establish

before this Court that plaintiff society is changing the

members and office bearers of the society and to

establish the said fact and prove new members have been

added to the society, this application has been filed

seeking        production   of      documents         specified           in     the

application. The issue relating to possession has to be

adjudicated not only as on date of agreement Exhibit 194

but also as on date of suit. Said exercise can be done

without        looking   into    the     documents         sought          to      be

produced. None of the documents are original or certified

copies and for the reasons already indicated by us while

disposing of Civil Application No. 2 of 2007 and for the

same reasons, this application deserves to be rejected

and accordingly it stands rejected.

contended, though permission had been granted to the

trustees to construct Nursing Home, commercial complex

and residence, but trustees had applied for construction

of commercial units and contending that they are guilty of

fraud perpetrated, they are seeking production of these

documents. None of these documents have any bearing

for deciding the real controversy between the parties

which is a certified copy of the order passed by the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) that too along

with an affidavit dated 30.07.2022.                      All other three

documents are not certified copies, that apart we find

that     these     documents     would          not   be      required            for

Civil Application No. 1 of 2015


57.            This is an application filed for production of the

order dated 13.06.2007 passed by Gujarat Revenue

the said order, tribunal had confirmed the order of the

Charity Commissioner dated 26.02.1986 who had rejected

the application filed seeking permission to sell the suit

schedule property. Since one of the issue involved in the

present Appeal is whether there was a permission by the

Charity Commissioner under 
section 36
 of the Gujarat

Public Trusts Act to sell the suit schedule property by the

first defendant trust or otherwise, we are of the

considered view that said application requires to be

allowed and accordingly it is allowed and the document is

permitted to be marked as Exhibit 223.

58.            This is an application filed for production of

following documents by way of additional evidence : -


        1. Photocopy of the order passed by the
        Charity Commissioner dated 26.06.1967.



        2. Photocopy of the order dated 16.09.1991

        passed in Application No. 1/2001 by the
        Charity Commissioner along with covering

        6. Copy of the order dated 31.01.2004 in
        Application No. 36/59/2003.





59.            The   documents    which      are     sought           to      be

produced as Annexure C to F (as indicated in the Civil

Application) have also been sought for being produced by

the fifth respondent in Civil Application No. 2 of 2014,

which has been allowed by us by order of even date

hereinabove. Thus, what remains to be considered is

whether documents styled as Annexure A and B are to be

produced or not ?          These are two orders which are

passed by the Charity Commissioner and Joint Charity

Commissioner dated 26.06.1967 and 16.09.1991 along

with enclosures thereto to contend that trustees of the

first defendant have given consent for agreement to sell

dated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194) as same is reflected in the

said order.         Both these orders are photocopies and

original or certified copies are not produced.                           On this

ground alone, it is liable to be rejected and accordingly it

stands rejected. Consequently Civil Application No. 2 of

2022 stands rejected.




Civil Application No. 3 of 2022


60.            By   this   application          defendant         intends           to

produce the copy of the scheme dated 06.06.1989 framed

by the learned Charity Commissioner in respect of first

defendant trust. On the short ground, this document was

also sought to be produced by fifth respondent by Civil

Application No. 2 of 2007 (Old Civil Application No. 6794

of 2007), which has already been dismissed vide order of

even date referred to supra, we are of the considered

view that entertaining of this application would not arise

and it stands rejected. It is also noticed said document is

sought for being produced along with Civil Application

No.6 of 2022 and as such it would be examined when we

take-up Civil Application No.6 of 2022.

Civil Application No. 4 of 2022


61.            By this application, fifth defendant has sought

for production of nine documents styled as Annexure A to

I. By these documents, fifth defendant seeks to buttress

the arguments that structure of the plaintiff society has

changed and most of the old members of the society were

removed            and    new     persons           were    inducted.                  The

application filed before the Assistant District Registrar,

Cooperative Society, Ahmedabad, seeking the list and

members            of    the   plaintiff society           and      exchange              of

correspondence between fifth defendant and the officials

of the Corporation Department, is sought to be produced.

In substance, fifth defendant intends to place reliance on

the reply received from Cooperative Department to

contend that old members have resigned and new

members have been inducted to the plaintiff society.

Undisputedly, these documents have come into existence

subsequent to the filing of the suit. It is no doubt true

that subsequent events can be taken note by this Court as

held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M/s.

it requires to be noticed that applicant will have to be

necessarily establish as to how the said evidence would

be of any relevance for adjudication of the issue relating

to the grant of decree for specific performance or not. It

is not doubt true that issue of hardship or exercise of

discretionary      relief   is      concerned,        same         would           be

considered as one of the factors. However, that by itself

would not be sufficient to arrive at a conclusion one way

or the other. In other words, the issue relating to grant

of specific performance or refusal would not hinge upon

these documents and it would not be of any vital

importance for this Court to adjudicate the rival claims

that has been raised in this regard. Hence, we are of the

considered view that these documents would not be of

any relevance for adjudicating the real controversy

between the parties and as such Civil Application No. 4 of

2022 stands rejected.

production of documents specified therein. As could be

RE : POINT NO. (ii)


64.            Civil Application No.1 of 2016 is filed under


section 151
 of CPC read with Order XIV Rule 2(2) praying

this Court to frame the following preliminary issues : -



       "(i) Whether the Suit/Appeal is maintainable in view
       of the absence of and/or are rejection of application
       under section 36 of the Bombay Public Trust Act and
       also dismiss the appeal as barred by law and also by
       holding that cause of action does not survive and also
       in view of the fact the conduct of the respondents 11 to
       13;



       (ii) In the alternative dismiss First Appeal No. 3517
       of 2000 filed by the original applicant, qua prayer of
       specific performance and to confirm the judgment and
       decree passed by the learned trial Judge in the suit."



65.            A perusal of averments made in the application

would indicate fifth defendant is contending inter alia

that on account of application filed under 
section 36
 of

the Bombay Public Trusts Act having been rejected, the

present Appeal would be barred by Law as cause of

action would not survive for consideration.                     This is an

issue which requires to be examined in the Appeal by

examining the correctness and legality of the judgment

rejected and accordingly it stands rejected.


RE. POINT NO. (iii)


66.            Civil Application No.1 of 2022 has been filed by

the plaintiff under 
section 151
 of CPC for deletion of

respondent Nos. 2 to 10 from this Appeal on the ground

that they have either resigned or have been removed

from the trustship of 1st defendant. It is also stated that

first defendant - trust is presently represented by the

existing trustees, who are joined as respondent Nos. 11 to

13 and contending that defendant Nos. 2 to 10 namely

defendants - respondents being ex-trustees are no longer

proper and necessary parties in the present First Appeal.

Plaintiff admit that first defendant - trust is contesting

the present Appeal. It is also admitted by the applicant -

plaintiff that there is dispute amongst the trustees and if

it were to be so, it is for the said parties namely the 1 st

defendant trust and its trustees to work out their rights in

performance inter se dispute even if any between the

trustees or between the trust and the trustees cannot be

is filed by unsuccessful plaintiff being aggrieved by

judgment and decree passed dismissing the suit for

specific performance and decreeing the suit for refund of

money paid by it. Hence, Civil Application No. 1 of 2022

been granted on 27.10.1970 by the learned Charity

Commissioner for sale of suit schedule property in favour

of Shardaben Chimanlal Trust.                      It is contended that

trustees of Vitthal Mandir Trust - defendant No.1

executed           an   agreement      of     sale    in     favour         of      Mr.

Mukundbhai              Chimanbhai       Shah        (Jalpa      Traders)             on

Jalpa Traders executed an agreement in favour of

Chhaganlal & Company - defendant No.14 on 23.11.1973

and this was confirmed by defendant No.1 trust. It is

further stated that Chhaganlal & Company executed an

agreement of sale in favour of the plaintiff society on

27.12.1974. He would contend that defendant No.1 trust

had also executed an agreement to sell on 23.5.1964 in

favour       of     Mr.    Manharlal        Nagindas          Bhandari             and

permission          had    also   been      granted        by      the      Charity

Commissioner on 4.6.1964 to sell the suit schedule

proper in favour of Mr. Manharlal Bhadari and he had

Ishwarlal Prajapati and Sharda Mandir Trust for specific

performance, damages and for the permanent injunction

which came to be dismissed on 17.4.1976 which was

challenged in First Appeal No.362 of 1976, wherein a

settlement was arrived at agreeing thereunder that in

case consent terms were not acted upon, liberty being

reserved to proceed with the suit. Hence, the original

applicants are said to have filed SCS No.68 of 1983 for

specific performance which has been dismissed on

13.9.1996 which was challenged in First Appeal No.5304

of 1996 which appeal came to be transferred to the

District Court and renumbered as RA No.27 of 2006

which       was    then   partly   allowed      on     19.6.2012              and

remanded the matter back to the Trial Court as directed

thereunder. An application filed in the said suit by the

legal heirs of Mr. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and Mr.

Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati came to be dismissed by the

Trial Court on 1.10.2015 and consequently held that

Special Civil Suit No.68 of 1983 had stood abated.

Against the said order, Special Civil Application No.18589

any judgment and decree passed in this appeal would

adversely affect their interest in pending Special Civil

Application No.18589 of 2015, applicants are before this

Court for being impleaded / joined as parties.



68.            Reiterating   the    contentions        raised          in     the

application and grounds urged thereunder, Mr. Devang

Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate seeks for allowing the

said application. 
In support of his submission, he has

relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in

the case of 
Sumtibai and others vs. Paras Finance Co.

and others
 [(2007) 10 SCC 82] and in the case of 
M.P.

State Agro Industries Development Corporation Ltd.

and Another vs. Jahan Khan
 [(2007) 10 SCC 88]. The

general rule for impleadment is that the plaintiff being

the dominus litis would choose the person against whom

he intends to litigate and he cannot be compelled to sue a

person against whom he does not seek any relief. A plain

reading of sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Order 1 would make

it explicitly clear that a court may at any stage of the

proceedings either upon or even if any application, and

on such terms as may appear to it to be just, direct that

any person who ought to have been joined whether as

plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the court

may be necessary in order to enable the court to

effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all

questions involved in the suit, be added as party. In short,

court is given the discretion to add a person as a party

who is found to be necessary parties are proper parties.


 
The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
Mumbai

International Airport Private Limited vs. Regency

Convention Centre and Hotels Private Limited and

Others
 [(2010) 7 SCC 417] has indicated as to who

would the necessary party or a proper party. It has been

held as under:




       "15. A `necessary party' is a person who ought to have
       been joined as a party and in whose absence no
       effective decree could be passed at all by the Court. If a
       `necessary party' is not impleaded, the suit itself is
       liable to be dismissed. A `proper party' is a party who,
       though not a necessary party, is a person whose
       presence would enable the court to completely,
       effectively and adequately adjudicate upon all matters

       in disputes in the suit, though he need not be a person
       in favour of or against whom the decree is to be made.
       If a person is not found to be a proper or necessary
       party, the court has no jurisdiction to implead him,
       against the wishes of the plaintiff. The fact that a
       person is likely to secure a right/interest in a suit
       property, after the suit is decided against the plaintiff,
       will not make such person a necessary party or a
       proper party to the suit for specific performance."



69.            The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kasturi

vs. Iyyamperumal [(2005) 6 SCC 733] has held that

following persons are to be considered as necessary

parties:





       (i)     The parties to the contract which is sought
               to   be     enforced             or       their          legal
               representatives;



       (ii)    Transferee of the property which is the
               subject   matter of the contract.



70.            It has also been held that a person claiming

title adverse to the title of the vendor could not be

impleaded. Keeping these principles in mind when we

turn our attention to the facts on hand it would clearly

indicate that applicants who are claiming to be the legal

heirs of Mr. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and Mr. Ambalal

Ishwarlal          Prajapati    in whose favour               there was an

RE. POINT NO. (v)


71.            Civil Application No.7 of 2022 under 
Order 1

Rule 10 of CPC
 read with 107(2) 
of CPC
 has been filed by

plaintiffs         for   impleading    Shri       Jatin   Rameshchandra

Jalundhwala and Dr. Malay Rameshbhai Mahadeviya,

contending inter alia that after filing of the present

Appeal, respondent Nos. 2 to 10 have either resigned or

have been removed and they are no longer trustees and

one of the newly added trustee namely Yash Kishor

Bhagwat is already on record as respondent No. 6.1.4 and

proposed respondents are necessary and proper parties

to these proceedings. Perusal of averments made in the

application do not indicate as to how they are necessary

and proper parties. Any inter se controversy or dispute

between the trustees cannot be subject matter of

consideration. The first defendant - trust being a party

and represented by Counsel, any inter se dispute between

the trust and trustees can be resolved in appropriate

proceedings and in appropriate forum. Hence, without

expressing any opinion on the claim made and we find

that it is not necessary to issue notice to the proposed

respondents as specified in the present application.

Hence, Civil Application No. 7 of 2022 stands rejected by

reserving liberty to the parties to work out their rights in

accordance with law before proper forum.


POINT NOS. (vi) AND (vii) :



72.            The issues framed by the Trial Court and

adjudicated essentially revolves around these two points.

The incidental points that may arise for consideration

would also be formulated as and when necessary and at

appropriate stage of this judgment and during the course

of our discussion on these two points and while re-

evaluating the evidence tendered before the Court below.



73.            Since above points are interlinked and finding

recorded on one point is likely to overlap with other, we

have taken up these two (2) points together for being

the suit schedule property for Rs. 13.25 paise per sq. yds.

and received Rs. 15,000/- in cash on the date of

to the plaintiff by the defendants.





76.            It is the further case of the plaintiff that first

defendant          has   received   Rs.         20,001/-      towards            sale

consideration by cheque dated 21.10.1982 which has

been duly accepted by the first defendant and same was

paid in lieu of defective cheque dated 11.08.1982. It is

further case of the plaintiff - society in all had paid

Rs.30,501/- to the defendant trust.





77.            Plaintiff also claimed after obtaining possession

of suit schedule property that one Mr. Babji Bapuji,

watchman was appointed to look after the security of suit

schedule property after obtaining possession and he was

being paid salary every month. Subsequently, one Shri

Jagbahadur          Lokbahadur      Thapa          was       appointed              as

Watchman to take care of suit schedule property and he

was residing in the room constructed in the suit schedule

property. It is further case of the plaintiff that a layout

plan was drawn by an Engineer Shri Kantilal R. Patel as

plaintiff society was desirous of constructing houses for

its members and the said plan drawn by the Engineer was

signed by all the trustees of defendant trust.



78.            Plaintiff has further pleaded that defendant

trustees filed an application seeking permission to sell the

suit schedule property before the Charity Commissioner -

16th defendant under 
section 36
 of the BPT Act.                             The

defendants are also said to have filed form No. 1 under


section 20
 of the Urban Land Ceiling Act                                  (then

prevailing), wherein it is said to have been stated

specifically by the defendants that suit land was being

sold to the plaintiff.





79.            Plaintiff has contended that first defendant -

trust was attempting to dispose of the suit land to

someone else, owing to escalation in land price and it

would adversely effect its rights. It was also contended

that plaintiff's possession over the suit schedule property

was sought to be disturbed and attempts were made to

dispossess the plaintiff from suit schedule property by

posing threats. It is contended that defendants were not

executing the sale deed in spite having demanded and a

police complaint was lodged in that regard contending

that trustees of the defendant trust are attempting to sell

the suit schedule property to third party and pleading

that members of the plaintiff society are middle class

person and have invested huge amounts they would be

put to great loss if the defendants were to sell the suit

schedule property to third party or disturb plaintiff's

possession. Hence, plaintiff filed a Civil Suit No. 210 of

1983 for permanent injunction which was withdrawn on

17.07.1984 and thereafter the present suit for specific

performance came to be filed.





80.            On service of suit summons, defendants No. 1

to 4 and 6 appeared and have filed their written

statements denying the averments made in the plaint and

putting plaintiff into strict proof of the same. It has been

specifically       contended    as     noticed      hereinabove,               the

present suit was barred by res judicata since similar suit

filed earlier had been withdrawn without any valid

reason.        It was also contended that suit is barred by

limitation; suit was not maintainable as per 
section 51
 of

BPT Act, since written permission had not been obtained

from the Charity Commissioner for filing the suit. It was

contended that defendant had executed an agreement to

sell the suit schedule property to Mr. Pramukhlal and

Mr.Ambalal and later on first defendant trust and

Mr.Pramukhlal executed another agreement to sell the

suit       land        in     favour   of    Mr.Gangaram            Pavde          which

agreement was not duly signed by all the trustees. It was

also contended that agreement to sell entered into

between               first    defendant        and      Mr.Pramukhlal                 and

Mr.Ambalal did not contain the signature of Mr.Ambalal

and as such it was not a legal and valid document. The

assignment or transfer of the rights by Mr.Gangaram

Pavde to third party was denied and plaintiff was put to

strict proof of the same. It was contended that agreement

to       sell         dated     08.05.1972         executed       in      favour           of

Mr.Mukundbhai on behalf of Jalpa Traders had been

signed by one of the trustees namely Mr. Kunjbihari, who

had not been authorized by all the trustees to enter into

such agreement and as such denied that trust was

answerable and also denied that Kunjbihari being the

managing trustee of the trust was entiteld to enter an

agreement of sale of suit schedule property. Other

averments made in the plaint had also been denied as

already noticed hereinabove.                It was specifically denied

that first defendant being a public trust registered under


BPT Act
, it cannot sell the suit schedule property without

obtaining permission from the 17th defendant and there

was     no         such   permission      granted      by      the       Charity

Commissioner. The delivery of possession of suit schedule

property also came to be denied. As noticed hereinabove

averments made in the plaint has been denied by these

defendants. Sum and substance of the defence put forth

by defendant no. 1 to 4 and 6 have already been noticed

by us hereinabove.





81.            In this background, when judgment passed by

the trial court is looked into, it would emerge therefrom

that on the issue of agreement of sale, the learned trial

Judge has framed to two issues namely issue no. 2 and 3

and has answered partly in the affirmative and partly in

the negative. In this process, the learned Trial Judge has

recorded a finding at paragraph 7 of the judgment, the

substance of which can be formatted as under.



82.            The agreement to sell dated 27.12.1974 marked

as Exhibit 194 has been held to have not been duly signed

by all the trustees; the say of the plaintiff that Exhibit 194

reflects Rs. 5,000/- and there is no mention of plaintiff

having       paid   5,500/-   to     defendants         -    trustees            on

30.12.1982 and no receipts are produced; there is

inconsistency in the pleadings namely at one breath

plaintiff has stated on oath that defendants have not filed

necessary application seeking permission. Whereas in

another breath, namely in the plaint they have contended

necessary applications have been filed by defendants

before the Charity Commissioner and they had also filed

form no. 1 under the Urban Land Ceiling Law; defendant

no. 7 and 8 having not affixed their signatures to Exhibit

194 and thereby the plea of the plaintiff that all the

trustees of the trust having signed Exhibit 194 has been

disbelieved by the trial court.





83.            At the outset, it requires to be noticed that

burden is on the plaintiff to prove the execution of the

agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974. In the instant case,

undisputedly the first defendant has not executed the

agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974 in favour of the

plaintiff and this is an admitted fact or in other words,

plaintiff does not dispute this fact.          On the other hand,

witness examined on behalf of plaintiff namely Mr.

Babubhai who claimed to be the Chairman of the plaintiff

society has clearly admitted in his deposition that

defendants no. 2 to 8 are trustees of the first defendant

trust which is a trust registered under the Bombay Public

Trust Act. He further deposes that defendant no. 1 to 8

executed the agreement of sale dated 18.08.1966 in

favour of Mr. Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh and Mr.

Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati. It is pertinent to note at

this juncture that said agreement of sale dated

18.08.1966 has not seen the light of the day.                                 He

further deposes that Mr. Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh and

the first defendant trust together executed an agreement

of sale on 21.09.1970 in favour of one Shri Gangaram

Bhaskarrao Pavde.     It is pertinent to note at this

juncture that said agreement of sale also has not

seen the light of the day. It is further case of plaintiff

that on 03.04.1972, said Shri Gangaram Bhaskarrao

Pavde assigned the rights of his sale agreement in favour

of a partnership firm M/s. Jalpa Traders represented by

its partner Mr. Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah.                   The said

agreement of assignment dated 03.04.1972 has also

not seen the light of the day. It is further necessary to

notice at this juncture that agreement of sale executed in

favour of Shri Gangaram Bhaskarrao Pavde was by Shri

Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh and the first defendant trust

only. In other words, the other person who possessed the

right by virtue of agreement of sale dated 18.08.1966

namely Shri Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati has not affixed

his signature to the agreement of sale dated 21.09.1970.

Thus, no right flowed in favour of Shri Gangaram

Bhaskarrao Pavde to execute the agreement of sale or

assign his rights in favour of                   M/s. Jalpa Traders, in

respect of suit schedule property that too in respect of

share of Mr.Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh. Thus, what

right flowed to either Jalpa Traders or Mukundbhai

Chimanbhai Shah is only limited right or half of the right

he possessed over the suit schedule property.



84.            Be that as it may. The said Mukundbhai

Chimanbhai Shah partner of M/s. Jalpa Traders is said to

have executed an agreement of sale or assigned the

rights which partnership firm possessed or acquired on

03.04.1972 in favour of Chhaganlal & Company under a

deed of Agreement of Sale dated 23.11.1973.                                   It is

pertinent          to   note   at    this        juncture         that         said

agreement of sale has also not seen the light of the

day. All these deeds, agreements or assignment deed/s

have neither been tendered come before the trial Court

nor it has been tendered by the plaintiff before this Court.

On account of these documents having been denied in

toto by defendant no. 1 to 4 and 6 in their written

statement, burden cast on the plaintiff has not been

discharged. However, for reasons best known, plaintiff

did not produce any of these deeds or documents to prove

the chain of events which culminated in execution of the

subject agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974 Exhibit 194.



85.            Thus, initial burden which was cast upon

plaintiff has not been discharged and on this ground

alone, plaintiff ought to have been non-suited.



86.            Now we turn our attention to the agreement of

sale Exhibit 194 dated 27.12.1974 based on which suit

has been filed. This is an agreement of sale - said to have

been executed by partner of M/s.Chaganlal & Co., in

favour of plaintiff society and plaintiff claims same has

been consented to by the 1st defendant - trust and its

trustees and as such it is binding on them and they are

required to execute the sale deed in favour of plaintiff. It

is contended by the plaintiff that it had paid a sum of Rs.

15,000/- on the date of agreement of sale to its vendor

namely Chhaganlal & Company - 14th defendant. It has

been further pleaded that a sum of Rs. 20,000/- was paid

   C/FA/3517/2000                                CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




on 21.10.1982 and then Rs. 5,000/- is paid on 30.12.1982.

It is also claimed that another sum of Rs. 5,000/- was paid

on 04.06.1983 by cheque. Thus, plaintiff claimed that in

all it had paid Rs. 30,501/- to defendant trust. Whereas

PW-1 claims that plaintiff in all had paid Rs. 45,000/- to

M/s.     Chhaganlal      &   Company,           the    14th      defendant.

Whereas, averments made in the plaint is contrary to

what is stated in plaint. Thus, as rightly pointed out by

the trial Judge, the plea in the plaint itself is not only

inconsistent but also contrary to the plea raised in the

plaint as well as statement made on oath by plaintiff's

witness Mr. Babulal in his deposition.





87.            Thus, plaintiff is claiming right to seek specific

enforcement of agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974

(Exhibit 194). To prove said agreement one Shri Babubhai

has been examined. Perusal of his examination-in-chief

would indicate plaintiffs have tried to trace their right to

seek specific performance based on Exhibit 194, which is

an agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974 executed by the

partner of M/s.Chaganlal & Co., namely Mr. Chhaganlal

reference to agreement to sell dated 18.08.1966 said to

have been executed by trustee and administrator of 1 st

defendant trust in favour of Shri Pramukhlal Jivanlal

holder namely Shri Pramukhlal and Shri Ambalal, one of

them namely Shri Pramukhlal Jivanlal Ambalal along with

one Shri Kunjbihari Madhavdas Bhagvat, Managing

Trustee of 1st defendant trust is said to have executed an

agreement of sale on 21.09.1970 in favour of Shri

Gangaram Baskarrao Pavde (which document has also

not seen light of the day).           It is also contended that by

virtue of said Banakhat dated 21.09.1970, Shri Gangaram

Bhaskarrao Pavde gave away all the rights of Banakhat

and assigned it to Shri Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah,

partner of M/s. Jalpa Traders on 08.05.1972 along with

Shri Kunjbihari Madhavlal Bhagwat. The said M/s. Jalpa

rights in favour of M/s. Chhaganlal & Co.                    Plaintiff has

further pleaded by virtue of the said rights having vested

with M/s. Chhaganlal & Co., they in turn have executed

an agreement to sale dated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194) in

favour of plaintiff. In order to prove the averments made

in the plaint, as noticed hereinabove, plaintiff has got

examined Shri Babubhai, who has stated to the following

effect :



       "Defendant is Vithal Mandir Trust. It is a .....xxx......
       above trust. Defendants 1 to 8 execute sale agreement
       of the said land in favour of Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh
       and Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati on the date
       18.08.1966. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and the trust
       came together and made sale agreement in favour of
       Shri Gangaram Bhaskarrao Pavde on the day
       21.09.1970.       On the day 03.04.1972, Gangaram
       Bhaskarrao Pavade assigns the rights of his sale
       agreement to Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah, a partner
       of the partnership firm in the name of Messers Jalpa
       Traders on the basis of said sale agreement. He made
       sale agreement in favour of Mukundbhai Chimanlal
       Shah. Thereafter, all the rights has been given to
       Messers Chhaganlal & Co. from Shri Mukundbhai
       Chimanlal Shah, a partner of Messers Jalpa Traders on
       the day 23/11/73. On the basis of all the rights in said
       agreement, Chhaganlal & Co. granted all its rights and
       sale said land to plaintiff on the day 27.12.1974. For
       that, plaintiff has given Rs. 15,000/- on the same date
       at the time of sale agreement. Then Rs. 25,000/- is
       given on 20.05.1975, and then Rs. 5,000/- is given on
       15.12.1978. In this way, the plaintiff has paid Rs.
       45,000/- to Messers Chhaganlal & Co. The execution of
       the sale agreement on dated 27.12.74 has been
       continued by the partners of Messers Chhaganlal & Co.
       and all the trustees of the aforesaid defendant trust.
       Defendant No. 1 to 8 have given all the rights of the

       above land to the plaintiffs. The plaintiff is occupying
       the claimed land."



87-A.          Thus,      comparison       of    the     pleadings              and

deposition         wold     clearly     indicate       that         there          is

inconsistencies. On one hand, in the plaint, it has been

stated at paragraph 1 to the effect that plaintiff society

has in all paid Rs. 30,501/- to the defendant trust,

whereas witness examined on behalf of plaintiff has

stated that Rs. 45,000/- is paid to M/s. Chhaganlal & Co.

This inconsistency is at large and staring at face and as

such, we are of the considered view that plaintiff has

failed to prove the plea raised in the plaint or there has

been inconsistency between the pleadings and evidence.



88.            In order to prove its claim the plaintiff has

examined one witness Mr.Babulal who claims that he is the

chairman of the plaintiff society on the date he was

deposing. He is neither signatory to the Agreement of Sale

Exhibit 194 nor witness to the said document. A perusal of

his deposition would indicate as though he is speaking to

facts and being conversant with same or in other words, he

was having personal knowledge of the facts which is

otherwise. Burden is cast on the plaintiff to prove that said

witness had either personal knowledge or he was informed

by any one of the signatories to Exhibit 194 about the facts

of which he has deposing. None of these are present in the

instant case. In his examination-in-chief dated 26.09.2000,

he has deposed to the following effect :





       "I was doing part-time job in Chhaganlal & Co. in the
       year 1973 and in this manner I was connected with the
       said company. Mr.Chhaganlal Girdharlal Patel is the
       main partner of Chhaganlal & Co. I know him very well.
       I saw him writing frequently when I was doing part-time
       job in Chhaganlal & Co. and therefore, I know his
       signature well."



89.    Thus, the witness examined on behalf of plaintiff who

was an employee of Chhaganlal & Co. had no authority to

depose on behalf of the plaintiff society. That apart, there

is no authorization given by the plaintiff society to

Mr.Babulal to depose on behalf of the plaintiff society.

There is no resolution passed by the plaintiff society

authorizing Mr.Babulal to depose before the Court. There

is absolutely no material to show that Mr.Babulal was a

member of the plaintiff society or he was the Chairman of

the plaintiff society. There is no material placed by the

plaintiff to establish that as on 1974 when Exhibit 194

came into existence, Mr.Babulal was a member of the

plaintiff society. On the other hand, the admission in the

examination-in-chief dated 26.04.2000 which is extracted

hereinabove would suggest that as on 1973, he was doing

part-time job in Chhaganlal & Co. (Defendant No.14)



90.            The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Man

Kaur (Dead) by Lrs. vs. Hartar Singh Sangha, reported

in (2010) 10 SCC 512, has held that where a party to the

suit does not appear in the witness-box and states his own

case on oath and does not offer himself to be cross-

examined by the other side, a presumption would arise

that the case set up by him is not correct. It is also held

that only the person with personal knowledge of details of

transaction can depose. It has been further held :



       "17.       To succeed in a suit for specific performance,
       the plaintiff has to prove: (a) that a valid agreement of
       sale was entered by the defendant in his favour and the
       terms thereof; (b) that the defendant committed breach
       of the contract; and (c) that he was always ready and
       willing to perform his part of the obligations in terms of
       the contract. If a plaintiff has to prove that he was

 C/FA/3517/2000                                CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




     always ready and willing to perform his part of the
     contract, that is, to perform his obligations in terms of
     the contract, necessarily he should step into the witness
     box and give evidence that he has all along been ready
     and willing to perform his part of the contract and
     subject himself to cross examination on that issue. A
     plaintiff cannot obviously examine in his place, his
     attorney holder who did not have personal knowledge
     either of the transaction or of his readiness and
     willingness. Readiness and willingness refer to the state
     of mind and conduct of the purchaser, as also his
     capacity and preparedness on the other. One without the
     other is not sufficient. Therefore a third party who has
     no personal knowledge cannot give evidence about such
     readiness and willingness, even if he is an attorney
     holder of the person concerned.



     18. We may now summarise for convenience, the
     position as to who should give evidence in regard to
     matters involving personal knowledge:



     (a)    An attorney holder who has signed the plaint and
     instituted the suit, but has no personal knowledge of
     the transaction can only give formal evidence about the
     validity of the power of attorney and the filing of the
     suit.



     (b)   If the attorney holder has done any act or
     handled any transactions, in pursuance of the power of
     attorney granted by the principal, he may be examined
     as a witness to prove those acts or transactions. If the
     attorney holder alone has personal knowledge of such
     acts and transactions and not the principal, the
     attorney holder shall be examined, if those acts and
     transactions have to be proved.



     (c) The attorney holder cannot depose or give evidence
     in place of his principal for the acts done by the
     principal or transactions or dealings of the principal, of
     which principal alone has personal knowledge.



     (d) Where the principal at no point of time had
     personally handled or dealt with or participated in the
     transaction and has no personal knowledge of the
     transaction, and where the entire transaction has been
     handled by an attorney holder, necessarily the attorney
     holder alone can give evidence in regard to the

       transaction. This frequently happens in case of
       principals carrying on business through authorized
       managers/attorney holders or persons residing abroad
       managing their affairs through their attorney holders.



       (e) Where the entire transaction has been conducted
       through a particular attorney holder, the principal has
       to examine that attorney holder to prove the
       transaction, and not a different or subsequent attorney
       holder.



       (f) Where different attorney holders had dealt with the
       matter at different stages of the transaction, if evidence
       has to be led as to what transpired at those different
       stages, all the attorney holders will have to be
       examined.

       (g) Where the law requires or contemplated the plaintiff
       or other party to a proceeding, to establish or prove
       something with reference to his `state of mind' or
       `conduct', normally the person concerned alone has to
       give evidence and not an attorney holder. A landlord
       who seeks eviction of his tenant, on the ground of his
       `bona fide' need and a purchaser seeking specific
       performance who has to show his `readiness and
       willingness' fall under this category. There is however a
       recognized exception to this requirement. Where all the
       affairs of a party are completely managed, transacted
       and looked after by an attorney (who may happen to be a
       close family member), it may be possible to accept the
       evidence of such attorney even with reference to bona
       fides or `readiness and willingness'. Examples of such
       attorney holders are a husband/wife exclusively
       managing the affairs of his/her spouse, a son/daughter
       exclusively managing the affairs of an old and infirm
       parent, a father/mother exclusively managing the affairs
       of a son/daughter living abroad."



91.            The witness who had been examined on behalf of

the plaintiff Mr.Babulal having no personal knowledge of

the transaction (Exhibit 194) cannot be held to be a person

who knew as to what transpired when the Agreement of

Sale     Exhibit    194   came      into        existence.       Hence,           the

contention raised by the plaintiff that it had proved the

contents of Exhibit 194 also cannot be digested and it has

to be rejected.





92.            As could be seen from the judgment and decree

of the trial Court, the suit has been dismissed essentially

on the following grounds :





        (i) Non-availability         of         permission           from
               Charity Commissioner;



        (ii) Permission       not     obtained          from         ULC
               authorities;


        (iii) All trustees have not signed the agreement
               of sale dated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194);



        (iv) Readiness and willingness has not been
               shown or exhibited by plaintiff;



        (v) Possession of the suit schedule property is
               not with the plaintiff or plaintiff has failed
               to prove said claim.



93.            One of the prime contention raised by both the

sides is that on account of permission from the Charity

Commissioner has not been obtained, the agreement to

sell Exhibit 194 cannot be enforced. In fact in the written

statement filed by defendant Nos. 1 to 4 and 6, it has

been contended in paragraph 12 that defendant had filed

such application before the Charity Commissioner and it

was rejected.        It was also specifically averred in the

written statement to the following effect :



       "12. With regard to para no. 4 ...xxxxx...
       corrospondence with the defendant. The defendant in
       this matter are public trust registered under the
       
Bombay Public Trusts Act
 and as per the provisions
       therein that obtaining legal permission to sell from the
       Government, they cannot sell such land to any private
       person and the plaintiff is aware of the fact very well
       and therefore, without obtaining such permission, the
       question of handing over peaceful possession does not
       arise. ..........xxxx........."



94.            Contention has also been raised in this regard

in this Appeal also. Appeal being continuation of original

proceedings and though there is no much discussion on

this aspect by the learned trial Judge, we have examined

the same on this issue also. In order to adjudicate the

same, we are of the considered opinion that it would be

necessary to extract 
Section 36

             (a) no sale, mortgage, exchange or gift or any

95.            Mr.   Yatin   Oza,       learned      Senior           Counsel

appearing for appellant has contended that even if

permission sought for has been rejected, conditional

decree can be passed and has pressed into service the

Full Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of 
Shah

Jitendra Nanalal Ahmedabad vs. Patel Lallubhai

Ishverbhai Ahmedabad and Ors.
 AIR 1984 Guj. 145.

A perusal of this judgmetn would indicate that in the case

of Shah Jitendra, the Full Bench had formulated question

no. 2 in the background of facts obtained therein and had

opined as under : -






       "13. In this view, in answer to the second question
       referred to us we hold that a conditional decree for
       specific performance subject to exemption being
       obtained under 
section 20
 of the Urban Land (Ceiling
       and Regulation) Act, 1976 (Act No. 33 of 1976) is
       permissible. As we have said earlier, we do not propose
       to answer the first question as it may not be necessary.
       The case will be sent back."



96.            As could be seen from the above judgment, it

has been held that such conditional decree can be passed

subject to exemption being obtained under 
section 20
 of

the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (since

repealed). However, as on date of the suit 
ULC Act
 was

in force and even applying the said principle, it would not

detain us for too long to brush aside the contention

raised by learned Senior Advocate Mr. Yatin Oza for the

reasons more than one; the words and expression found

in Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 36 commences

with non-obstante clause namely with expression "no

sale, mortgage, exchange or gift of any immovable

property", would be valid without the previous sanction

of the Charity Commissioner, if such immovable property

belongs to a Public Trust.





97.            In the instant case, the permission sought for

had been rejected even according to plaintiff. The sole

witness examined on behalf of plaintiff in his evidence

recorded on 26.04.2000, has stated to the following

effect:





       "the trustees of the defendant trust applied to the
       Charity Commissioner for permission to sell claimed
       land. Copy of submitted application is represented at
       Exhibit 129/34. Application is signed by trustees. The
       application Number is 36/8/80."



98.            He has also deposed that an application under


section 20
 of the ULC Act had been filed seeking

exemption. Nowhere he has stated that permission from

ULC had been granted. Even otherwise according to

contention         raised   by    respective        learned          advocates

appearing for parties, the Charity Commissioner rejected

the permission on 26.02.1986. Against which, two

Revision Applications were filed. The revision application

filed by trust challenging the rejection order came to be

dismissed as withdrawn.               One Mr. Banwarlal Amrutlal

Parikh, challenged the order                   of rejection passed by

Charity Commissioner, resulted in its dismissal on merits

on 13.06.2001. This was challenged in Special Civil

Application No. 7360 of 2001, which has been dismissed

on    12.03.2003.      Certified    copy        of   the      order         dated

Appeal No. TEN AA 33/1986 has been produced along

with Civil Application No. 1 of 2015 (Old Civil Application

No. 7389 of 2015), which has been allowed by order of

even date, to be received as additional evidence and

marked as Exhibit 223, it would clearly indicate that

along with Civil Application No. 1 of 2016 (at page 50

dated 13.06.2001 has also been affirmed.



99.            In other words, the order of rejection passed by

Charity Commissioner had attained finality or to put it

differently, there is no order passed by the Charity

Commissioner         as   required       under      section          36       for

permitting the sale of suit schedule property by the first

defendant trust which is a Public Charitable Trust.



100.           The Full Bench of the High Court of Mumbai in

the case of Avinash Kishorchand Jaiswal and Another

vs. Shri Rammandi Deosthan, Pavnar and Others,

reported in 2020 (3) Mh. L.J. 323, has held that

previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner for sale of

property belonging to trust is mandatory and any

alienation of trust property without the same is null and

void. It has been held as under :-





       "8.   In our view, the requirement of obtaining
       previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner under
       Section 36(1)(a) of the said Act to sell or alienate the
       immovable property belonging to a public trust is
       mandatory and the power can be exercised only on the
       application made under Section 36(1)(c) by a trust or
       the trustees, seeking authorization to dispose of such
       property. Any sale or alienation of an immovable
       property of the public trust without such sanction is
       null and void. While deciding such application, the
       Charity Commissioner has to have regard to the
       interest, benefit and the protection of the trust. The
       power cannot be exercised suo motu or on his own by
       the Charity Commissioner. The power to grant sanction
       includes power to refuse sanction on the ground that it
       is not in the interest and benefit of the trust and that
       the property needs to be protected."

being public trust property and both the parties namely

plaintiff and defendant (some of them) being ad idem on

this     had       sought   permission         from       the         Charity

Commissioner to sell the suit schedule property. Even

according to the plaintiff, application had been made by

trustees of defendant No.1 trust way back in the year

1980. The said application though produced along with

the plaint with Mark 129/34 but not marked as exhibit

would clearly indicate that for sale of suit schedule

property, permission had to be obtained from the Charity

Commissioner. The said permission had been sought for

and had been rejected by the Charity Commissioner vide

order dated 26.2.1986, confirmed by the Tribunal by

order dated 13.6.2001 (Exhibit 223) and affirmed in

Special Civil Application No.7360 of 2001 vide order

dated 12.3.2003. Hence, we are of the considered view

that the principle enunciated by the Full Bench in 
Shah

Jitendra
's case referred to supra would be inapplicable as

in the said case, it was a claim simpliciter for grant of

decree of specific specific performance even when such

permission having sought for had been refused.


102.           Even assuming that the said principle as

enunciated by the Full Bench of this Court is to be

accepted, we are of the considered view that it would be

applicable or operate in a situation where there is no

permission sought for and such permission having not

been refused. In a given case where the trust or any one

else on behalf of the trust who were to apply for grant of

permission under 
Section 36
 of the Bombay Public Trusts

Act, 1950 and such permission is refused, in such

circumstances, it cannot be gainsaid that the conditional

decree can be passed. This proposition also gets support

from the authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble

Apex Court in the case of 
M. Meenakshi and Others

vs. Metadin Agarwal (Dead) By LRs and Others


[(2006) 7 SCC 470].






103.           In the instant case, agreement of sale dated

27.12.1974 Exhibit 194 has relied upon by plaintiff for

the relief of specific performance against the defendant,

  C/FA/3517/2000                           CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




on account of alleged defendants refusal to execute the

sale deed. A perusal of the said agreement would clearly

indicate that it has been entered into between plaintiff

society and 14th defendant. Said agreement has been

executed on behalf of society by its Chairman Mr.Patel

Manilal Atmaram (who has not entered the witness-

box). The vendor i.e. 14th defendant who is said to have

executed the said agreement in favour of the plaintiff is

on the strength of agreement of sale dated 13.11.1973,

which has been produced at Mark 193/1. However, same

was not exhibited as already noticed hereinabove. It is

agreed under the said agreement that permission of the

Charity Commissioner to sell the suit schedule property

has to be obtained by the "Owner". This agreement is

said to have been signed by the partner of M/s.

Chhaganlal & Co. and also witnessed by Mr.Mukundbhai

Chimanlal Shah and Mr.Gangarao Bhaskarrao Pavde on

behalf of M/s.Jalpa Traders. However, none of them have

been examined in the instant case. The agreement of sale

marked as Exhibit 194 has been appended with two

additional sheets and the purported first endorsement

dated 18.4.1976 is said to have been signed by the

trustees of 1st defendant. However, the records do not

disclose as to who are all trustees of the first defendant

trust at the relevant point of time. On this issue, we

would be dealing at a later stage. Turning our attention

back to the core issue, namely non-obtaining of the

permission from the Charity Commissioner is concerned,

we notice undisputedly the owner of the suit schedule

property (1st defendant) had to obtain permission from

Charity Commissioner to sell the suit land and in the

written statement filed by defendants 1 to 4 and 6, it has

been specifically contended by them that no such prior

permission had         been    obtained         by   defendant            trust.

Plaintiff's witness in his further examination-in-chief

recorded on 29.03.2000 has also admitted this fact which

is to the following effect :





       "The plaintiff society xxxx land in question. As per the
       terms of the said agreement, necessary permissions, in
       order to get final sale deed registered, were required to
       be obtained by the defendants. The defendants had
       not obtained or made an application to get the
       necessary permission which were required to be

       obtained. Therefore, I had requested the defendants
       to obtain necessary permissions and after obtaining the
       same, to get the final sale deed registered, but the
       defendants did not take any action to obtain
       permissions. And if any such action has been done,
       the defendants had not made me aware thereof. If the
       defendants xxxx willing for the same."       (Emphasis
       supplied by us)



104.          He has also deposed that trustees of the 1 st

defendant trust had submitted an application to the

Charity Commissioner to sell the suit schedule property

as per the application vide Mark-129/34 and they had also

filed a declaration before the ULC authorities as per

application Mark-129/35. However, for reasons best

known both these documents were not marked as an

exhibit. The application marked as 129/34 is a photocopy

of the application submitted to the Charity Commissioner

and is said to have been signed by the trustees of 1 st

defendant trust (not all trustees) seeking for exemption.



Learned advocates appearing for both parties admit that

application filed before the Charity Commissioner on

27.10.1970 (not exhibited) came to be rejected by the

Charity Commissioner vide order dated 26.02.1986,

against which the trust filed a revision application and

   C/FA/3517/2000                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




same was dismissed as withdrawn. Being aggrieved by

the order of rejection, Mr.Banvarilal Amrutlal Parikh had

filed a revision application in Appeal No.TEN AA 33/1996

which came to be dismissed on merits on 13.06.2001 -



Exhibit 223, whereunder it had been observed to the

following effect :



       "10. The learned advocate for the respondent xxxx
       before the Charity Commissioner. The person who is
       the proposed purchaser from the trust has no locus
       standi before the Charity Commissioner. The only
       aggrieved person can be the trust and in this case, the
       trust no longer wishes to proceed with the same. The
       trust had filed a revision application 35 of 1986 before
       this Tribunal. This has been withdrawn by the trust.
       Consequently, the trust is no longer having any
       grievance     against   the order      of  the   Charity
       Commissioner."



105.           It has also been observed by the Tribunal that

from the papers available on record, it is not evident as to

why the properties of           the trust are required to be

disposed of and how the proceeds of the same would be

utilized for the benefit of the trust. It has been further

observed by the tribunal thus :





       "18. It may be noted xxxx also has not succeeded. It
       may, therefore, be said that the matter is now once
       again wide open. It does not appear in the interest of
       the trust to give approval for the erstwhile agreements



                             Page 127 of 157

       made by the earlier trustees, because the interest of
       the trust and reasonableness of the proposals of the
       trust have not been fully explained. The need to dispose
       of the property has also to be fully examined. Under the
       circumstances, I find that the order of the Charity
       Commissioner is quite proper and should not be
       interfered with. I therefore xxxx order."



This would clearly indicate that permission to sell the suit

schedule property sought for was not granted by the

Charity Commissioner and order of rejection had attained

finality.





106.           Appellant - plaintiff has also made an attempt

to produce certain documents during the pendency of this

appeal by way of additional evidence, contending it has

come into existence after the judgment and decree

passed by the trial Court and during the pendency of the

present appeal and said documents have a bearing on the

facts of the present case. Even accepting the same for a

moment and for the limited purpose of looking into the

documents annexed to CA No.6 of 2022 it would clearly

emerge         therefrom   that    the         Charity      Commissioner

rejected the application No.36/59/2003 said to have been

filed by four trustees and said application having been

dismissed vide order dated 31.01.2004. The application

filed for such permission was on 17.04.2001 and it would

indicate that same was filed on account of the proposed

compromise to be entered into in the appeal, whereunder

they had sought permission to sell the suit schedule

property. However, said application also came to be

dismissed on 31.01.2004. Thus, it would emerge from the

records that undisputedly there was no permission

accorded by the Charity Commissioner to sell the suit

land in favour of plaintiff.

Narayamma and others vs. Govindappa and others -

(2019) 19 SCC 42 has held if a decree were to be

granted in favour of the plaintiff on the basis of an illegal

agreement which is hit by statute, it will be rendering an

active assistance by the Court in enforcing an agreement

which is contrary to law. It has been further held :



       "20. It could thus be seen that, although illegality is not
       pleaded by the defendant nor is relied upon by him by
       way of defence, yet the court itself, upon the illegality
       appearing upon the evidence, will take notice of it, and
       will dismiss the action ex turpi causa non oritur actio. It

       has been held, that no polluted hand shall touch the
       pure fountain of justice. It has further been held, that
       where parties are concerned in illegal agreements or
       other transactions, courts of equity following the rule of
       law as to participators in common crime will not
       interpose to grant any relief, acting upon the maxim in
       pari delicto potior est conditio defendetis et

28. Now, let us apply the another test laid down in the
       case of 
Immani Appa Rao
 (supra). At the cost of
       repetition, both the parties are common participator in
       the illegality. In such a situation, the balance of justice
       would tilt in whose favour is the question.
 
As held in
       
Immani Appa Rao
 (supra), if the decree is granted in
       favour of the plaintiff on the basis of an illegal
       agreement which is hit by a statute, it will be rendering
       an active assistance of the court in enforcing an
       agreement which is contrary to law. As against this, if
       the balance is tilted towards the defendants, no doubt
       that they would stand benefited even in spite of their

       course is lesser injurious to public interest than the

permission of Charity Commissioner as held by this Court

     property of Public Trust, Shri Modasa Kadva Patidar
     Trust at Modasa, District: Sabarkantha which is a Trust
     registered under the 
Bombay Public Trusts Act
. The
     aforesaid Public Trust was running the Boarding in the
     suit property in question and there was an open space
     on the front side of the Boarding upon which, the shops
     in question have been constructed and they are in
     occupation and in possession of the respective
     petitioners herein. Respective petitioners claim to be in
     possession of the disputed shops in question as alleged
     and claiming through respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein
     as Trustees of the Trust. It is the case on behalf of the
     respective petitioners that respondent Nos. 2 and 3
     herein as Trustees of aforesaid Trust have leased the
     shops in question to the respective petitioners thereby,
     they have become the tenant of the suit shops in
     question. That as the property in question belongs to
     the Trust registered under the 
Bombay Public Trusts
     Act
, it is subject to restrictions/provisions under the
     
Bombay Public Trusts Act
. 
Section 36
 of the Bombay
     Public Trusts Act creates a clear embargo/bar of
     transferring in any manner whatsoever the Trust
     property without prior sanction of the Charity
     Commissioner.



 
Section 36
 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act reads as
     under:



     36[(1)] [Notwithstanding anything contained in the
     instrument of trust -]


     (a) no sale, mortgage, exchange or gift or any
     immovable property, and

     (b) no lease for a period exceeding ten years in the case
     of agricultural land or for a period exceeding three
     years in the case of non-agricultural land or a building,
     belonging to a public trust, shall be valid without the
     previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner.

     [(2) The decision of the Charity Commissioner under
     sub-section (1) shall be communicated to the trustees
     and shall be published in such manner as may be
     prescribed.

     (3) Any person aggrieved by such decision may appeal
     to the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal within thirty days from
     the date of its publication.

     (4) Such decision shall, subject to the provisions of sub-
     section (3) be final.]

     Therefore any sale, mortgage, exchange or gift of any
     immovable property and/or lease for a period
     exceeding 3 years in the case of non-agricultural land
     or a building belonging to a public trust is void ab
     initio. As held by this Court in the case of Huseinmiya
     Safimiya v. Habibsha Hasamsha Fakir reported in 1985
     (2) GLR 928 any alienation of the immovable property
     of the public trust without express permission of the
     Charity Commissioner as required under 
Section 36
 of
     the Act shall be invalid and is void and not binding to
     the Trust. Similar view has been expressed by this
     Court in the case of Pratik Medicines v. Board of
     Management reported in 2005 (2) GLH (UJ) 15 Page 26
     and it is held that lease of the Trust property without
     prior permission of the Charity Commissioner is void ab
     initio. In the present case, admittedly, before alleged
     lease in favour of the respective petitioners admittedly
     prior permission of the Charity Commissioner is not
     obtained. On the contrary permission under 
Section 36

     of the Act has specifically refused by the Charity
     Commissioner. Under the circumstances, alleged lease
     in favour of the respective petitioners is nullity and void
     ab initio. It is required to be noted that in the present
     case, not only there is no prior permission of the
     Charity Commissioner before the alleged lease in
     favour of the respective petitioners, there was already
     an application submitted by the respondent Nos. 2 and
     3 alleged to be the Trustees at the relevant time when
     the shops in question were leased and submitted the
     application before the Charity Commissioner under
     
Section 36
 of the Act for post-facto permission and to
     regularize the lease in favour of the respective
     petitioners and the Charity Commissioner has
     dismissed the said application and refused to regularize
     the lease in favour of the respective petitioners and
     refused to grant post-facto permission under 
Section 36

     of the Act. It is required to be noted that before the
     Charity Commissioner, the respective petitioners were
     also heard. It is also required to be noted that there
     were objections filed by the respondent Nos. 4 to 11
     who were the Trustees of the Trust and direction was
     sought and the learned Charity Commissioner has
     while rejecting the application submitted by the
     respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein claiming to be the
     Trustees of the Trust at the relevant time when there
     was a lease in favour of the respondent petitioners, has

     specifically observed that respondent Nos. 2 and 3
     through whom the petitioners are claiming the lease in
     their favour and inducted the petitioners, were not the
     trustees of the Trust. There is a specific finding given
     by the Charity Commissioner that respondent Nos. 2
     and 3 who have alleged to have leased the shops in
     question in favour of the petitioners had no authority to
     lease the suit property belonging to the public trust.
     That the learned Charity Commissioner after hearing
     the parties not only dismissed the application
     submitted for post facto permission under 
Section 36
 of
     the Act but has also allowed the objections submitted
     by the respondent Nos. 4 to 11 herein Trustees of the
     Trust and has directed the Trustees of the Trust to get
     back the possession after following due process and
     report to the Charity Commissioner within 60 (sixty)
     days. It is required to be noted that the order passed by
     the Charity Commissioner was challenged by the
     respective petitioners before the Gujarat Revenue
     Tribunal by way of revision application and the said
     revision application is dismissed and the order passed
     by the Charity Commissioner has become final.

     Thus the alleged lease in favour of the respective
     petitioners is not only hit by 
Section 36
 of the Bombay
     Public Trusts Act and is a nullity and void ab initio but
     as observed by the Charity Commissioner, the same
     was by the persons i.e respondent Nos. 2 and 3 who
     were not the Trustees on the PTR of the Trust and that
     they    had    no   Authority    to   lease   shops    in
     question/premises in question on behalf of the Trust.
     Therefore, the rights of the respective parties have
     been adjudicated upon by the Charity Commissioner
     who is the only Competent Authority under the
     provisions of the 
Bombay Public Trusts Act
. Under the
     scheme and provisions of the Bombay Pubic Trusts Act,
     Charity Commissioner is the only Competent Authority
     to decide the dispute with respect to the property of
     the public trust.



     18. Now to appreciate the aforesaid submissions, it is
     required to be noted that admittedly, the property in
     question belong to the public trust. For any dispute
     with respect to the property belonging to the public
     Trust only Charity Commissioner has the jurisdiction
     under the Bombay Public Trust Act. Not only that but
     even with respect to the lease of the property

       belonging to the public trust, prior sanction of the
       Charity Commissioner is must as required under
       
Section 36
 of the Act. Except the Charity
       Commissioner, no other Authority or Court has any
       jurisdiction with respect to the Trust property. As per
       
Section 80
 of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, no Civil
       Court has jurisdiction to decide and deal with any
       question which is by or under 
Public Trust Act
 to be
       decided or dealt with by any officer or authority under
       the 
Bombay Public Trusts Act
 or in respect of which
       decision or order such officer or authority has been
       made final and conclusive."





109.           A plain reading of 
Section 36
 of BPT Act would

indicate that for sale of property owned by a public trust

the condition precedent is previous sanction. Hence, ex-

post facto sanction cannot be obtained after the sale

transaction as it is not a sanction in the eye of law and it

would not be valid. Such grant of prior sanction is not

technical or procedural, but it affects the very right of the

trust and the public who have interest in the suit

property. Hence, the agreement of sale cannot be valid

unless there is a previous sanction. In fact the Hon'ble

Apex Court in the case of Minakshi and other vs.

Metadin Agarwal reported in (2006) 7 SCC 470 has

held conditional decree cannot be granted when the

permission is applied and rejected. It has been further

held:



        "17.     The competent authority under the 1976 Act
        was not impleaded as a party in the suit. The orders
        passed by the competent authority therein could not
        have been the subject-matter thereof. The Plaintiff
        although being a person aggrieved could have
        questioned the validity of the said orders, did not chose
        to do so. Even if the orders passed by the competent
        authorities were bad in law, they were required to be
        set aside in an appropriate proceeding. They were not
        the subject matter of the said suit and the validity or
        otherwise of the said proceeding could not have been
        gone into therein and in any event for the first time in
        the Letters Patent Appeal.



 
39.     Furthermore, 
Section 20
 of the Specific Relief
        Act confers a discretionary jurisdiction upon the courts.
        Undoubtedly such a jurisdiction cannot be refused to
        be exercised on whims and caprice; but when with
        passage of time, contract becomes frustrated or in
        some cases increase in the price of land takes place,
        the same being relevant factors can be taken into
        consideration for the said purpose. While refusing to
        exercise its jurisdiction, the courts are not precluded
        from taking into consideration the subsequent events.
        Only because the Plaintiff-Respondents are ready and
        willing to perform their part of contract and even
        assuming that the Defendant was not entirely vigilant
        in protecting their rights in the proceedings before the
        competent authority under the 1976 Act, the same by
        itself would not mean that a decree for specific
        performance of contract would automatically be
        granted. While considering the question as to whether
        the discretionary jurisdiction should be exercised or
        not, the orders of a competent authority must also be
        taken into consideration. While the court upon passing
        a decree for specific performance of contract is entitled
        to direct that the same shall be subject to the grant of
        sanction by the concerned authority, as was the case in
        
Mrs. Chandnee Vidya Vati Madden v. Dr. C.L. Katilal
        and Others
 [AIR 1964 SC 978] and Nirmal Anand v.
        Advent Corporation (P) Ltd. And Others [(2002) 5 SCC
        481]; the ratio laid down therein cannot be extended to
        a case where prayer for such sanction had been prayed
        for and expressly rejected. On the face of such order,

       which, as noticed hereinbefore, is required to be set
       aside by a court in accordance with law, a decree for
       specific performance of contract could not have been
       granted."




110.           In the instant case the order of the Charity

Commissioner        rejecting   the      application        filed       under


section 36
 of the Act came to be passed on 26.02.1996

which has been confirmed by the Gujarat Revenue

Tribunal on 13.06.2001 (Exhibit 223) and order of the

Tribunal has also been confirmed by the learned Single

Judge of this Court in SCA 7360 of 2001 and as such it

cannot be gainsaid by the appellant that notwithstanding

the orders of the Charity Commissioner refusing to grant

permission to sell the suit schedule property either prior

to entering into agreement to sell or during the pendency

of these proceedings, yet a conditional decree of specific

performance can be passed. Said contention is without

merit and it is liable to be rejected and accordingly, it

stands rejected. In the light of said finding recorded by

us, the judgments relied upon by Mr.Yatin Oza, learned

Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant would not

come to the rescue of the appellant.

111.           Another ground on which the learned Trial

Judge has refused to grant the specific performance of

the agreement to sell dated 27.12.1974 - Exhibit 194 is

on the ground that all the trustees of the 1 st defendant

trust have not affixed their signatures.



112.           It is an undisputed fact that Exhibit 194 has

been entered into between plaintiff and 14 th defendant. It

is also the contention of plaintiff that agreement of sale

executed by 14th defendant in favour of the plaintiff as per

Exhibit-194 have been ratified by the 1st defendant and its

trustees and as such 1st defendant trust and its trustees

defendant Nos. 2 to 8 bound by it. The plea raised by

plaintiff in this regard is traceable to paragraph 1 of the

plaint, which is to the following effect :



       "1.   The plaintiff society xxxx by the defendants. All
       the defendants have executed their writings over the
       agreement to sell dated 27.12.1974. Thereafter, xxxx
       hereinbelow."



113.           In the written statement filed by defendant

Nos. 1 to 4 and 6, it has been specifically contended that

defendants had earlier entered into an agreement to sell

the suit property with Shri Pramukhlal and Shri Ambalal,

who in turn had entered into another Banakhat -

Agreement to Sell on 21.09.1970 in favour of Shri

Gangaram Pavde and in the said agreement all the

trustees have not signed. It was further pleaded that in

the agreement of sale entered into between the 1 st

defendant trust with Shri Pramukhlal and Shri Ambalal, it

did    not         contain   the   signature         of   Mr.Ambalal.              The

defendants have specifically denied of Mr.Gangaram

Pavde having assigned his rights in favour of M/s.Jalpa

Traders under agreement dated 03.04.1977. It was also

specifically pleaded that agreement to sell the suit

schedule property on 08.05.1972 has been entered into

by one trustee only in favour of Jalpa Traders and

admittedly the said agreement did not contain the

signatures of all the trustees and the burden which was

cast on the plaintiff to prove that the sole trustee

Mr.Kunjbihari            Madhavlal           Bhagwat          having             been

authorized by all other trustees has not been proved or in

other words, this factual aspect has remained in vacuum.

Mr. Yatin Oza, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

appellants         has   contended       that      Mr.       Kunjbiharilal

Madhavlal Bhagwat was acting on behalf of all the

trustees and he was authorised to sign all the documents

on behalf of the trust and as such he has affixed the

signature to the agreements and various applications filed

before the statutory authorities. Hence, he contends that

non-signing of the agreement of sale Exhibit 194 or any

other document by all other trustees would not erase the

value of Exhibit 194 or in other words, it can be enforced

against defendant No.1 trust. Such contention cannot be

accepted for reasons more than one. Firstly, there is no

proof of Kunjbiharilal Madhavlal Bhagwat alone being

authorised to act on behalf of defendant No.1 trust.

Except said point having been canvassed during the

course of arguments. In fact, there is no plea also raised

in this regard. The witness examined on behalf of plaintiff

also does not whisper a word on this issue. In the absence

of any cogent material tendered by the plaintiff in this

regard, the contention of Mr. Yatin Oza, learned Senior

Counsel cannot be accepted. 
In the absence of pleadings,

no amount of evidence will assist the parties as held by

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
Biraji Alias

Brijraji and another vs. Surya Pratap and others


[(2020) 10 SCC 729] whereunder it came to be held to

the following effect:






       "8.   Having heard the learned counsels on both sides,
       we have perused the impugned orders and other
       material placed on record. The suit in Original Suit No.
       107/2010 is filed for cancellation of registered adoption
       deed and for consequential injunction orders. In the
       adoption deed itself, the ceremony which had taken
       place on 14.11.2001 was mentioned, hence it was
       within the knowledge of the appellants- plaintiffs even
       on the date of filing of the suit. In the absence of any
       pleading in the suit filed by the appellants, at belated
       stage, after evidence is closed, the appellants have filed
       the application to summon the record relating to leave/
       service of Ramesh Chander Singh on 14.11.2001 from
       the Rajput Regiment Centre Fatehgarh. It is fairly well
       settled that in absence of pleading, any amount of
       evidence will not help the party. When the adoption
       ceremony, which had taken place on 14.11.2001, is
       mentioned in the registered adoption deed, which was
       questioned in the suit, there is absolutely no reason for
       not raising specific plea in the suit and to file
       application at belated stage to summon the record to
       prove that the second respondent- Ramesh Chander
       Singh was on duty C.A.Nos.4883-4884 of 2017 as on
       14.11.2001. There was an order from the High Court
       for expeditious disposal of the suit and the application
       which was filed belatedly is rightly dismissed by the
       Trial Court and confirmed by the Revisional Court and
       High Court."

            1st defendant trust.



            (iv)       The plaintiff has failed to prove that

            Kunjbiharilal       Madhavlal          Bhagwat          alone         was

            empowered to act on behalf of the trust or he

            alone was empowered to execute the agreement

            to sell.



115.           Hence, in our considered opinion, the finding

recorded by the trial Court that plaintiff had failed to

prove all the trustees of 1 st defendant trust have affixed

their     signatures       to   the     agreement           of     sale        dated

24.12.1972 (Exhibit 194) as well as the prior agreements

under which the plaintiff is claiming right has also not

been proved rightly so. In this background, it has to be

necessarily held that either ratification by the new

trustees of the sale agreement executed in favour of the

plaintiff by either giving declaration or approving the

same through any means would be of no consequence. In

that view of the matter, contentions raised by the

appellant in this regard cannot be accepted and it stands

rejected.





116.           The   learned    advocates         appearing            for      the

contesting defendants have vehemently contended that

there is no averment made in the plaint with regard to

readiness and willingness and even in the event of this

Court arriving at a conclusion that reading of all the

averments made in the plaint in toto would indicate such

averments being there, then in such an event it has to be

construed as a conditional plea and it ought not to be

accepted. In fact the defendants 1 to 4 and 6 in their

written statement at paragraph 14 have specifically

pleaded that plaintiff has never shown any willingness nor

made any demand.





117.           
Section 16 (c)
 of the Specific Relief Act would

indicate that specific performance of a contract cannot be

enforced in favour of a person, if he fails to prove that he

has performed or has always been ready and willing to

perform the essential terms of the contract which are to

be performed by him, other than terms the performance

of which he has been prevented or same has been waived

by the defendant. The expression "who fails to prove" was

substituted by Act 18 of 2018 and prior to the same the

words - expression "must aver" was found in 
Section

16(c)
. In other words, the expression "must aver" which

existed earlier was substituted by the words "who fails to

prove". This amendment has come into effect from

19.09.2018. Thus, it is incumbent upon party who wants

to enforce the performance of a contract has to aver and

prove that he has performed or has been always ready

and willing to perform the essential terms of the contract.

A plain ready of 
Section 16(c)
 of the Specific Relief Act

makes it absolutely clear, that plaintiff has to plead

readiness and willingness to perform the essential terms

of the contract and it is a condition precedent for

obtaining relief of specific performance. Plaintiff has to

allege or aver and prove his "continuous" "readiness and

willingness" to perform his part of the contract from the

date of contract.   Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

in 2022 LawSuit (SC) 62, has held : -






       "29. We shall now advert to the respondent‟s conduct
       throughout the sale transaction. The respondent has
       failed to provide any documents or communication
       which would indicate that he called upon the appellants
       to perform their obligations or discharge the mortgage
       within the time period stipulated in the contract. Even
       after the expiry of the six months, the respondent did
       not reach out to the appellants. It is only in response to
       the appellants‟ legal notice that the respondent
       demanded performance of their obligations. Merely
       averring that he was waiting with the balance
       consideration and believed that the appellants would
       clear the encumbrance is insufficient to prove that the
       respondent-plaintiff was willing to perform his
       obligations under the contract."



118.           It would be of benefit to note the judgment of

the Apex Court in the case of 
Syed Dastgir vs T.R.

Gopalkrishna Seatty
 [(1999) 6 SCC 337], whereunder

it has been held that readiness and willingness to perform

essential terms of the contract as required to be pleaded

under 
Section 16(c)
, there cannot be any specific

phraseology. It has been held :




       "9.   So the whole gamut of issue raised is, how to
       construe a plea specially with reference to 
Section
       16(c)
 and what are the obligations which the plaintiff
       has to comply with reference to his plea and whether
       the plea of the plaintiff could not be construed to
       conform to the requirement of the aforesaid Section, or
       does this section require specific words to be pleaded
       that he has performed or has always been ready and is
       willing to perform his part of the contract. In
       construing a plea in any pleading, Courts must keep in

       mind that a plea is not an expression of art and science
       but an expression through words to place fact and law
       of ones case for a relief. Such an expression may be
       pointed, precise, some times vague but still could be
       gathered what he wants to convey through only by
       reading the whole pleading, depends on the person
       drafting a plea. In India most of the pleas are drafted
       by counsels hence aforesaid difference of pleas which
       inevitably differ from one to other. Thus, to gather true
       spirit behind a plea it should be read as a whole. This
       does not distract one from performing his obligations
       as required under a statute. But to test, whether he has
       performed his obligations one has to see the pith and
       substance of a plea. Where a statute requires any fact
       to be pleaded then that has to be pleaded may be in
       any form. Same plea may be stated by different persons
       through different words then how could it be
       constricted to be only in any particular nomenclature
       or word. Unless statute specifically require for a plea to
       be in any particular form, it can be in any form. No
       specific phraseology or language is required to take
       such a plea. The language in 
Section 16(c)
 does not
       require any specific phraseology but only that the
       plaintiff must aver that he has performed or has always
       been and is willing to perform his part of the contract.
       So the compliance of Readiness and willingness has to
       be in spirit and substance and not in letter and form.
       So to insist for mechanical production of the exact
       words of an statute is to insist for the form rather than
       essence. So absence of form cannot dissolve an essence
       if already pleaded. "



119.           Thus,    if it could be gathered from the

averments made in the plaint that averments with regard

to readiness and willingness can be found, it would

suffice and on account of exact words not being found,

the plaintiff cannot be non-suited.

120.          The Apex Court in the case of K.Kupuraj vs M.

Ganeshan - AIR 2021 SC 4652 has held :





       "8.    It is required to be noted that as per the case of
       the original plaintiff, the defendant was required to
       evict the tenants and hand over the physical and vacant
       possession at the time of execution of the sale deed on
       payment of full sale consideration. Even in the suit
       notice issued by the plaintiff, the plaintiff called upon
       the defendant to evict the tenants and thereafter
       execute the sale deed on payment of full consideration
       from the plaintiff. Even when we consider the pleadings
       and the averments in the plaint, it appears that the
       plaintiff was never willing to get the sale deed executed
       with tenants and/or as it is. It was the insistence on the
       part of the plaintiff to deliver the vacant possession
       after evicting the tenants. Therefore, on the basis of the
       pleadings in the plaint and on appreciation of evidence,
       the learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness
       against the plaintiff. However, before the High Court,
       the plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that he is now
       ready and willing to get the sale deed executed with
       respect to the property with tenants and unfortunately,
       the High Court relying upon the affidavit in the first
       appeal considered that as now the plaintiff is ready and
       willing to purchase the property with tenants and get
       the sale deed executed with respect to the property in
       question with tenants, the High Court has allowed the
       appeal and decreed the suit for specific performance.
       The aforesaid procedure adopted by the High Court
       relying upon the affidavit in a First Appeal by which
       virtually without submitting any application for
       amendment of the plaint under 
Order VI Rule 17 CPC
,
       the High Court as a First Appellate Court has taken on
       record the affidavit and as such relied upon the same.
       Such a procedure is untenable and unknown to law.
       First appeals are to be decided after following the
       procedure to be followed under 
the CPC
. The affidavit,
       which was filed by the plaintiff and which has been
       relied upon by the High Court is just contrary to the
       pleadings in the plaint. As observed hereinabove, there
       were no pleadings in the plaint that he is ready and
       willing to purchase the property and get the sale deed
       executed of the property with tenants and the specific

       pleadings were to hand over the peaceful and vacant
       possession after getting the tenants evicted and to
       execute the sale deed. The proper procedure would
       have been for the plaintiff to move a proper application
       for amendment of the plaint in exercise of the power
       under 
Order VI Rule 17 CPC
, if at all it would have
       been permissible in a first appeal under Section 96
       read with 
Order XLI CPC
. However, straightaway to
       rely upon the affidavit without amending the plaint and
       the pleadings is wholly impermissible under the law.
       Therefore, such a procedure adopted by the High Court
       is disapproved.



       The learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness
       against the plaintiff by giving cogent reasons and
       appreciation of evidence and considering the pleadings
       and averments in the plaint. We have also gone through
       the averments and the pleadings in the plaint and on
       considering the same, we are of the opinion that the
       learned Trial Court was justified in holding the issue of
       willingness against the plaintiff. The plaintiff was never
       ready and willing to purchase the property and/or get
       the sale deed executed of the property with tenants. It
       was for the first time before the High Court in the
       affidavit filed before the High Court and subsequently
       when the learned Trial Court held the issue of
       willingness against the plaintiff, the plaintiff came out
       with a case that he is ready and willing to purchase the
       property with tenants. For the purpose of passing the
       decree for specific performance, the plaintiff has to
       prove both the readiness and willingness. Therefore,
       once it is found on appreciation of evidence that there
       was no willingness on the part of the plaintiff, the
       plaintiff is not entitled to the decree for specific
       performance. Therefore, in the present case, the
       learned Trial Court was justified in refusing to pass the
       decree for specific performance."



121.          A plea was raised in the aforesaid case by the

defendant that plaintiff has not pleaded readiness and

willingness, which was rebutted by the plaintiff. It was

agreed      under    the   agreement            of      sale     therein           that

defendant would evict the tenants and hand over physical

and vacant possession of the suit schedule property at the

time of execution of the sale deed. This plea was

considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court as plaintiff therein

was not willing to obtain the sale deed with tenants.

When this principle enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex

Court is applied to the facts of this case and when we

turn our attention to Exhibit 194 namely agreement of

sale      dated    27.12.1974,       it       would      indicate             that

consideration of Rs.25,000/- was paid by the plaintiff to

the 14th defendant (not to the 1st defendant trust) for

purchasing the suit schedule property on the condition

that owner (1st defendant) will have to obtain permission

of the Charity Commissioner for selling the suit schedule

property and title clearance certificate has to be obtained

from the competent authority within six months. It was

also    stipulated   by   the    plaintiff that         necessary             NA

permission, ULC permission will have to be furnished by

the vendor viz., 14th defendant or 1st defendant. These

conditions stipulated under Exhibit 194 would indicate

   C/FA/3517/2000                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023




that plaintiff was only willing to purchase the suit

schedule property conditionally namely if there were to

be permission granted by the Charity Commissioner and

other statutory permissions being available. In other

words, plaintiff was not willing to purchase the suit

schedule property in the absence of these permissions. As

such, the principles enunciated by the Apex Court in

Karuppuraj's case referred to supra would be applicable.



122.           In this background, when we look at the

deposition of PW-1 it would emerge therefrom that there

is not even a whisper by said witness expressing his

readiness and willingness. The principles enunciated by

Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of 
Man Kaur (dead)

by LRS vs Hartar Singh Sanga
 - (2010) 10 SCC 512

would be apposite to be quoted, wherein it has been held

that if plaintiff has to prove readiness and willingness, he

has to step into the witness-box and has to give evidence

that he was all along ready and willing to perform. It has

been further held :

       "17. 
Section 10
 of the Act deals with cases in which
       specific performance of contract is enforceable. It
       provides that except as otherwise provided in that
       Chapter (dealing with Specific Performance of
       Contracts) of the Act, specific performance of any
       contract may, in the discretion of the court, be
       enforced when the act agreed to be done is such that
       compensation in money for its non-performance would
       not afford adequate relief. Explanation (i) to 
section 10

       provides that unless and until the contrary is proved,
       the court shall presume that the breach of a contract to
       transfer immovable property cannot be adequately
       relieved by compensation in money. Sub-sections (2)
       and (5) of 
section 21
 of the Act provide that in a suit for
       specific performance, if the court decides that specific
       performance ought not to be granted, but that there is
       a contract between the parties which has been broken
       by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is entitled to
       compensation for that breach, it shall award him such
       compensation accordingly; and that no compensation
       shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintiff
       has claimed such compensation in his plaint. 
Section 23

       of the Act provides that a contract otherwise proper to
       be specifically enforced, may be so enforced, though a
       sum be named in it as the amount to be paid in case of
       its breach and the party in default is willing to pay the
       same, if the court, having regard to the terms of the
       contract and other attending circumstances, is satisfied
       that the sum was named only for the purpose of
       securing performance of the contract and not for the
       purpose of giving to the party in default an option of
       paying money in lieu of specific performance."



123.           Plaintiff must allege and aver that he was ready

and willing to perform his part of contract from date of

agreement till the date of institution of the suit as held by

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
Sandhya Rani vs

Sudha Rani
 reported in AIR 1978 SC 537. In the instant

case, there is not even whisper in the plaint to the said

effect or averments made in the plaint does not even

remotely suggest about readiness and willingness of the

plaintiff either prior to the suit or at the time of

institution of the suit or thereafter. The evidence of PW-1

is also silent. In totality, there is no averment found

anywhere from the pleadings, for this Court to arrive at a

conclusion that plaintiff has been ready and willing to

perform its part of the contract and defendants had failed

to perform their part of the contract. In the absence of

pleadings and evidence, refusal to grant discretionary

relief by the trial court cannot be found fault with and

said findings have t be necessarily held as just and proper

and same would not call for our interference in appellate

jurisdiction. If two views are possible and the one taken

by the trial Court being in consonance with material

evidence available on record, this Court would not disturb

such finding in exercise of appellate jurisdiction.


124.           It would be further necessary to note yet

another plea has been raised by Mr.Yatin Oza, learned

Senior Counsel appearing for the plaintiff contending that

when there is no issue in this regard framed by trial

Court, there was no need or necessity for plaintiff to

prove the said issue. Though said argument would look

attractive at first blush, it cannot be accepted for reasons

more       than    one.   Firstly,       consent       cannot            confer

jurisdiction. Secondly, 
Section 16(c)
 being mandatory,

absence of plea in the plaint and in the deposition it

would not otherwise cure the glaring defect. Thirdly,

plaintiff has not sought for recasting of the issues but on

the other hand with open eyes, having known the defense

put up by the defendants Nos.1 to 4 and 6 in their written

statement at paragraph-14 has proceeded with the suit

and submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Court and

called for an opinion or judgment in that regard.

Fourthly, the judgment of the trial court would indicate

at paragraph-11 while adjudicating issue No.9 and 10

learned Trial Judge has examined this issue and held that

terms of the agreement would indicate that plaintiff had

expressed or given its conditional willingness, which has

already been noticed by us hereinsupra as impermissible

in the teeth of judgment of the Apex Court in Karuppura's

case supra. Thus, contentions raised in this regard stands

rejected.





125.           While the court exercises the discretionary

power for grant or refusal of a decree of specific

performance, one of the paramount considerations would

be the conduct of the plaintiff which would be taken into

consideration. If the conduct of the plaintiff is such that

which would not inspire confidence, then necessarily the

discretionary power would not be exercised to grant the

relief, but, on the other hand, if the plaintiff has come the

court with clean hands and has played his role with

utmost sincerity, necessarily the discretionary relief

would be granted. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of


Atma Ram v. Charanjit Singh
 [AIR 2020 SC 3413]

has held as under:






       "... ... ... A person issues legal notice on particular year
       claiming readiness and willingness and files a suit for
       mandatory injunction and after three years converts the
       said suit to specific performance suit will not be entitled
       to the relief of specific performance."

126.           Yet another important aspect which the court

would take into consideration while considering the plea

for grant of specific performance would be readiness and

willingness where the balance sheet of the plaintiff does

not reflect of having sufficient fund to discharge the

plaintiff's part of the contract, the discretionary relief

would not be granted as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in

the case of U.N. Krishnamurthy (since deceased) Thr.

Lrs. Versus A.M. Krishnamurthy [AIR 2022 SC 3361].

In the instant case, the plaintiff's balance sheet as per

Exhibit 208 reflects it does not possess any fund and there

is negative profit and as such question of granting specific

performance would not arise. Hence, point Nos. (vi) and


(vii) is answered by holding that judgment and decree

passed in Special Civil Suit No. 167 of 1984 deserves to be

confirmed and there is no error committed by the Trial

Court in dismissing the suit.





127.           This Court places on record its appreciation for

valuable assistance rendered by all the learned advocates

who      appeared     in   the      matter         and    extending             their
