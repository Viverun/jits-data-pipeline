                                                             3                             CRA-10939-2024
                           referring to the   allegation in the FIR and the statement of prosecutrix
                           recorded under 
Section 164
 of Cr.P.C. submits that prosecutrix has alleged
                           incident of 16.9.2022, whereas the report was lodged on 23.9.2022. No
                           plausible explanation was given with regard to delay in lodgement of FIR.
                           Learned counsel further referring to the medico-legal examination report and
                           evidence of Dr. Puja Bhandari (PW-3) submits that at the time of medico-
                           legal examination, the prosecutrix had alleged incident of rape on 22.9.2022.
                           Thus, there is material discrepancy with regard to the alleged incident.
                           Learned counsel further referring to evidence of prosecutrix (PW-1), submits
                           that evidence seems to be improbable as prosecutrix has stated that accused
                           has dragged her when she was sitting with her husband. Learned counsel also
                           submits that all the material witnesses have been examined, therefore, there
                           is no likelihood of tampering with remaining evidence by applicant. Learned
                           counsel further submits that appellant is aged 35 years. He is a labourer by
                           profession. There is no likelihood of his absconsion leaving behind his
                           family, home and job. No criminal antecedents is alleged against the
                           applicant. Trial would take time to conclude. On these grounds, learned
                           counsel prays that learned Special Judge has committed an error in rejecting
                           the application for bail, therefore, the impugned order be set aside and
                           appellant may be extended the benefit of bail.

                                 Per contra, learned counsel for the State opposes the appeal on the
                           ground of gravity of alleged offence and prays for its rejection.

                                  Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case diary.
