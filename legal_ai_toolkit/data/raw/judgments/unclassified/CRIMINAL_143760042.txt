                                                              2                         MCRC-29540-2024
                           of 
IPC
 against Ankit (applicant). Victim was forwarded for medico-legal
                           examination. One contusion with abraded margin was found on her left
                           cheek. Ankit was arrested on 24-04-2024. Statements of witnesses were
                           recorded. Statement of victim was also recorded under 
Section 164
 of CrPC,
                           wherein she made same allegation. Applicant was extended the benefit of
                           bail vide order dated 13-05-2024. Thereafter, supplementary statement of
                           victim was recorded on 15-05-2024, wherein she alleged that Ankit has
                           committed rape on her. Earlier, she could not state due to fear of social
                           disrepute. Prosecution for offence punishable under 
Sections 376
 and 
506
 of
                           IPC was added. Applicant is apprehending arrest in the matter. His
                           application for anticipatory bail under 
Section 438
 of CrPC stands rejected
                           vide order dated 01-07-2024 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Guna.



                                 Learned Counsel for the applicant, in addition to the grounds
                           mentioned in the application, submitted that applicant has been falsely
                           implicated in this matter. No offence, as alleged is committed by the
                           applicant. The allegations of rape are levelled against the applicant after he
                           was extended the benefit of bail. Delay in levelling the allegation
                           substantiates the defence of the applicant that false allegations are levelled
                           against him after pre-meditation and consultation. No further custodial
                           interrogation of applicant is needed in the matter. He is ready to cooperate in
                           the investigation. Learned Counsel further submits that applicant is aged
                           around 21 years. He is labourer by profession. He has not misused the liberty
                           extended vide earlier bail order. No criminal antecedent is reported against
                           him. Therefore, applicant may be extended benefit of anticipatory bail.
