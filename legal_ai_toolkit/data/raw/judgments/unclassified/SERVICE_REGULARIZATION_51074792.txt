A       Introduction


1       This litigation has a long and chequered history. The dispute, a familiar terrain

in service jurisprudence, pertains to the claim for absorption of persons who were

engaged by the Life Insurance Corporation of India1 as temporary/badli/part-time

workers. 
Section 23(1)
 of the Life Insurance Corporation Act 19562 enables LIC to

employ such number of persons as it thinks fit to discharge its functions. Pursuant to

clauses (b) and (d) of 
Section 49(2)
, LIC has framed the Life Insurance Corporation

of India (Staff Regulations) 1960 3. 
Regulation 8
 empowers LIC to appoint persons

on a temporary basis in Class III and Class IV posts. After an amendment which was

notified on 7 August 1971, 
Regulation 8
 provides as follows:



                 “8. Temporary Staff:-



                 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in these Regulations
                 the Managing Director or Executive Director (Personnel), a
                 Zonal Manager or a Divisional Manager may employ staff in
                 classes III and IV on a temporary basis, subject to such
                 general or special directions as may be issued by the
                 Chairman from time to time.



                 (2) No person appointed under sub-regulation (1) shall only
                 by reason of such appointment be entitled to absorption in the
                 services of the Corporation or claim preference for
                 recruitment to any post.”




2       On 31 January 1981, 
Sections 48
 and 
49
 were amended to impart statutory

force to the Staff Regulations. According to LIC, its staff and employees are

governed by the parent enactment and fall outside the purview of the Industrial

PART A

Disputes Act
 1947 4. The validity of the amendment to 
Sections 48
 and 
49
 has been

upheld by this Court in 
A V Nachane v. Union of India
 5.





3       On 13 August 1982, an industrial dispute was raised by the Western Zonal

Insurance Employees Association alleging that LIC had been engaging in unfair

labour practices by employing temporary, badli and part-time workers and was

restricting their employment to short tenures to deprive them of the claim for

permanency.




4       On 20 May 1985, the dispute was referred for adjudication by the Central

Government to the National Industrial Tribunal6, Bombay presided over by Justice R

D Tulpule 7, a former Judge of the Bombay High Court. The terms of reference were

as follows:



                “What should be the wages and other conditions of service of
                badli, temporary and part-time workmen of the Life Insurance
                Corporation of India as well as the conditions of their
                absorption into regular cadre?”




5       On 15 January 1986, the Tulpule Tribunal issued an interim order restraining

LIC from recruiting regular employees and from terminating the services of the ad

hoc workers working with LIC.

6         On 18 April 1986, the Tulpule Tribunal passed an award 8 which was gazetted

on 7 June 1986 stipulating that those ad hoc workers who were in employment

between 1 January 1982 and 20 May 1985 will be entitled for absorption. The

award, inter alia, stipulated that:






      (i) Workers claiming absorption in Class III posts should have worked for 85

          days in a period of two years; and


      (ii) Workers in Class IV posts should have worked for 70 days in a period of three

          years.



The calculation of the number of days worked was to be up to the date of the

reference. The award contemplated that in the future there would be no occasion for

LIC to employ workers in temporary and badli categories, save and except for

occasional and temporary work.




7         On 1 June 1987, LIC issued circulars for implementing the Tulpule Award.

These circulars were disputed by the Unions and Associations representing the

workers. Following this dispute over the LIC circulars, the Central Government

referred the Tulpule Award for interpretation under 
Section 36-A
 of the ID Act to

another NIT presided over by Justice M S Jamdar 9, a former Judge of the Bombay

High Court. The terms of reference were:



                   “Can the Award dated 17/4/1986 special reference to
                   paragraph 44,45,46, 48, 49, 51,52,54,56,57,60,64 and 66 and
                   the interim order dated 14/3/1986 be interpreted to mean that
                   the central office of the Life Insurance Corporation of India is

                                                                                                       PART A

                 empowered to issue instructions/ guidelines, as contained in
                 their circulars issued in this behalf to implement the directions
                 of the Award. If not what could be the correct interpretation of
                 various directions covered by the said paragraphs in the
                 circumstances of the case? Whether the term ‘absorption’
                 referred to at various places in the Award can be interpreted
                 to mean ‘recruitment’?”




8       By an interim order dated 29 June 1987, the Jamdar Tribunal prohibited LIC

from recruiting persons to Class III and Class IV posts from the ‘open market’ during

the pendency of the proceedings. LIC has argued before this Court that on account

of the restraint imposed on it from recruiting regular employees (through the interim

orders dated 15 January 1986 of the Tulpule Tribunal and 29 June 1987 of the

Jamdar Tribunal), a large number of ad hoc workers were appointed to carry out the

day-to-day administration of LIC all over India.




9       The Jamdar Tribunal rendered its award on 26 August 1988 10 and it was

notified in the gazette on 1 October 1988. It held that the absorption contemplated in

the Tulpule Award did not imply recruitment. LIC challenged the interpretation

rendered by the Jamdar Award under 
Article 136
 of the Constitution. This Court

granted leave in the proceedings 11. During the pendency of the proceedings, terms

of compromise were arrived at between LIC and all the Unions representing the

workers, save and except the Akhil Bharatiya Jeevan Bima Nigam Chathurthi Sreni

Karmachari Sangh 12. The terms of compromise envisaged that the Jamdar and

Tulpule Awards should be substituted by the terms and conditions of the

compromise “in relation to the question of regular employment of the workmen

concerned in the said references”. The terms of compromise which were filed before

this Court are extracted below:



             “TERMS OF COMPROMISE

                in from time to time :-





                                              11


                                                                    PART A

                                   12

                                                                                       PART A

                        covered by this Compromise between the parties and the
                        respective rights and obligations of the parties in relation
                        to regular employment of the said workman concerned
                        shall be determined and given effect accordingly, if any
                        controversy may arise.”

                                                                (emphasis supplied)



The terms of compromise were accepted by an interim order of a two-judge Bench

of this Court in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 13 on 1 March 1989. The order is extracted

below:




                   “Special leave is granted. It appears that out of nine Unions
                   eight Unions said to be representing about 99% of the
                   workers have entered into a compromise with the
                   Management. 
In the circumstances pending the final disposal
                   of the appeal, we permit the Management and the members
                   of the said eight Unions to implement the terms of
                   compromise by way of interim measure without however, any
                   prejudice to the rights and contentions of the members of the
                   other Union, who have not entered into such compromise with
                   the management.”



10         On 7 February 1996, the above civil appeal in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra)

was disposed of. This Court accepted the contention of LIC that since eight unions

had already accepted the compromise, the ninth union (Karamchari Sangh) should

fall in line and act on the terms and conditions of the compromise in the interest of

industrial peace.
 
Since the litigating workers in Class IV posts were unable to take

the test during the pendency of the proceedings, LIC was directed to exempt Class

IV workers from appearing for the test and interview, if the management had power

to do so under the regulations or the instructions governing their conditions of


13

     Civil Appeal No 1790 of 1989 (1 March 1989) (
“LIC v. Their Workmen”
)


                                                        13

                                                                                       PART A

service. The Court observed that in the event that the management had no such

power, it had “no doubt” that the test prescribed for the workers would be of a lower

standard than what had been prescribed under the two circulars mentioned in the

compromise. Pursuant to the compromise, LIC appointed 1875 persons to Class III

posts and 1324 persons to Class IV posts in various divisions.


11        The genesis of the present dispute relates to a demand raised by the Unions

on 4 March 1991, pertaining to the claim for regularisation of those workers who

were employed from 20 May 1985 till the date of reference on 4 March 1991. Acting

on the demand, the Central Government made the following reference to the Central

Government Industrial Tribunal 14 under 
Sections 10(1)(d)
 and 
2A
 of the ID Act:


                   “Whether the action of the Management of Life Insurance
                   Corporation of India in not absorbing badli/temporary and
                   part-time workmen employed in the establishment of LIC after
                   20.05.1985 is justified? If not, to what relief the workmen are
                   entitled?”



12        On 18 June 2001, the CGIT which was presided over by Shri K S Srivastav,

pronounced the award 15 by directing the absorption of the temporary/badli workers

on the same terms as the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards, with some modifications.



The Srivastav Award held that:



                   “88. In view of the fact I am of the definite view that such type
                   of workmen belonging to temporary/badly/ part time
                   categories in class III and Class IV service of the corporation
                   who were employed after following the procedure and were
                   allowed to continue service beyond the qualifying period and

     “Srivastav Award”


                                                      14

                                                                                PART A

            were eligible and suitable to every respect should be given
            absorption in the service from date of the vacancy in the
            service in which they could have been absorbed. It will also
            apply to these employees whose service were terminated by
            the corporation.”



13    In its ultimate directions, the Srivastav Award directed that the temporary,

badli and part-time workers who were employed after 20 May 1985 should be

granted absorption on the same terms and conditions as was stipulated in the

Tulpule and Jamdar Awards (in respect of workers who were employed from 1

January 1982 to 20 May 1985). LIC was directed to publish a notice in the

newspapers for inviting applications from individual workers for absorption. If no

regular vacancy was available, the award directed supernumerary posts to be

created. Paragraph 94 of the Srivastav Award is extracted below:


 
“94. In view of the matter I find and conclude that the action of
            corporation        denying      the     absorption     of   these
            temporary/badli/part time workmen as dealt with above in the
            body of this award and employed after 20-05-85 is not
            justified. I further find that these workmen employed after 20-
            5-85 should be given absorption in their job on the same
            terms and conditions as 
laid down in
 the aforesaid two
            awards namely Hon’ble Mr Justice R.D. Tulpule and of
            Hon’ble Mr Justice M.S. Jamdar in respect of the workmen
            employed with effect from 1-1-82 to 20-05-85 and dealt with
            by me as above. It is directed that the corporation shall take
            into consideration for the absorption of the workmen, on their
            eligibility and suitability as dealt with above in the award. The
            case of those workmen belonging to the category of
            temporary, badli, part-time who had become eligible for their
            absorption in their job after completing the qualified period of
            working and were suitable in every respect but their services
            were terminated and they were turned out of the job by the
            corporation should also considered for the absorption of such
            terminated workmen of the corporation shall publish a notice
            in the daily newspaper having wide circulation throughout
            India and if in compliance of the notice the workman


                                               15

                                                                                                 PART A

                concerned consent in writing within stipulated period which
                could be given in the said notice the case of such workman
                should also be considered for their absorption in the regular
                vacancy then existing. At the time of the consideration of
                absorption of such workmen if it is found that no regular
                vacancy is available to such workmen, supernumerary posts
                should also be created and such workmen should be given
                absorption in it. It is also directed that the cases of these
                workmen for absorption in existing vacancies should be taken
                for consideration first irrespective of the regular recruitment if
                taken. The case of the contractual workmen for absorption
                shall be taken into consideration as per observation made in
                the body of the award and on the basis on conditions as
                stated above.”



14      The Srivastav Award was challenged by LIC in a writ petition 16 before the

Delhi High Court.
 
By a judgment dated 15 April 2004, a Single Judge of the Delhi

High Court set aside the award and held that the decisions of this Court in E

Prabavathy v. Life Insurance Corporation of India 17 and 
LIC of India v. G

Sudhakar
 18 directing LIC to formulate a scheme for regularisation were binding on

the CGIT. The judgment of the Single Judge of the Delhi High Court was the subject

matter of a batch of Letters Patent Appeals 19 preferred by six Unions/Associations.




The appeals were dismissed on 21 March 2007 by the Division Bench. The Division

Bench also issued directions for age relaxation and weightage of past service to the

workers:



                “20. In that view of the matter, while dismissing the appeals
                filed by the appellants, we issue directions in the following
                manner:

                     applications, which, if submitted, shall be considered
                     along with all other candidates but giving age relaxation to
                     the appellants and also giving due weightage to the past
                     services rendered by the appellants.



 
21. In terms of the aforesaid order, the appeals stand
                 disposed of.”




15      The judgment of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court was assailed in a

batch of Special Leave Petitions 20 filed by six Unions and Associations representing

the workers. In the meantime, LIC began the process of implementing the judgment

of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court on 21 March 2007 by issuing an

advertisement for recruitment of Assistants, by allowing age relaxations and

weightage for temporary workers to compete with candidates from the open market.

On 11 February 2008, this Court directed the maintenance of status quo. The civil

appeals were eventually disposed of by a two-judge Bench of this Court on 18

March 2015 in 
Tamil Nadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees

Association v. Life Insurance Corporation of India21
 which concluded that the

Srivastav Award was binding. While restoring the Srivastav Award, the judgment of

this Court directed LIC to implement its directions and set aside the judgment of the

Delhi High Court.

16        Following the judgment of this Court, LIC issued an advertisement on 21 July

2015        calling     for   applications    from      workers    who     were   employed   as

badli/temporary/part-time workers in its establishment from 20 May 1985 to 4 March

1991, in terms of the eligibility criteria determined by the award. This led to the

institution of contempt proceedings before this Court on the ground that by

restricting the eligibility for recruitment to workers who were engaged between 20

May 1985 and 4 March 1991, LIC was in breach of the directions of this Court in 
TN

Terminated Employees Association
 (supra).
 
LIC also instituted review petitions

against the judgment in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra). The

review petitions and the contempt petitions were directed to be heard together. On 9

August 2016, the review sought by LIC was partially allowed 22 by restricting the

award of back-wages to 50 per cent. The relevant part of the directions of this Court

is reproduced below:




                  “The temporary and badli workers of LIC, who are entitled for
                  regularisation as permanent workmen in terms of the
                  impugned judgment and order dated 18.03.2015 passed by
                  this Court, by applying the terms and conditions of the
                  modified award dated 26.08.1988 passed by Justice Jamdar,
                  are held to be entitled to full back wages as well. However,
                  keeping in mind the immense financial burden this would
                  cause to LIC, we deem it fit to modify the relief only with
                  regard to the back wages payable and therefore, we award
                  50% of the back wages with consequential benefits. The back
                  wages must be calculated on the basis of the gross salary of
                  the workmen, applicable as on the date as per the periodical
                  revisions of pay scale as stated supra. The computation
                  must be made from the date of entitlement of the
                  workmen involved in these cases, that is, their
                  absorption, till the age of superannuation, if any concerned
                  workman has attained the age of superannuation as per the

     (2016) 9 SCC 366

                regulations of the review petitioner-LIC, as applicable to the
                concerned workman.”

                                                        (emphasis supplied)




17      The curative petitions instituted by LIC challenging the judgment in review

were rejected on 22 February 2017. 
In March 2017, LIC sorted out and distributed

the applications which had been received in pursuance of its notice dated 21 July

2017 through its zonal offices for implementation of the decision in 
TN Terminated

Employees Association
 (supra).
 
On 16 May 2017, LIC issued directions to the

Zonal Managers to implement the Srivastav Award and the order of this Court in the

review of 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra). The circular prescribed

the following norms of eligibility for absorption:






     (i) The worker should have been engaged between 20 May 1985 and 4 March

        1991;



     (ii) The name of the worker should figure in the list submitted by the Unions to

        the CGIT in the industrial reference;



     (iii) Class III workers ought to have been engaged for at least 85 days in two

        calendar years while Class IV workers should have been engaged for at least

        70 days in three calendar years;



     (iv) The Union or the Association should have been an appellant before the

        Supreme Court;





                                                 19

                                                                                                    PART A


     (v) The claimant worker should have submitted a biodata in pursuance of the

        notice issued by the LIC on 21 July 2015 for recruitment in regularised

        positions; and


     (vi) The worker should have been engaged in accordance with the rules prevalent

        in LIC.





18      In 2017, various divisions of LIC found 245 workmen to be eligible and they

were offered absorption by the Zonal Offices. This led to the initiation of contempt

proceedings 23 by the Unions who sought the absorption of all temporary, part-time

and badli workers and daily wagers who were engaged after 20 May 1985 till date.


19      On 11 May 2018, a two-judge Bench of this Court 24 directed the petitioning

Unions in the contempt proceedings to submit material documents to show the

engagement of the workers between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991. This Court

also directed LIC to nominate a senior official to scrutinise the documents and to

take a final decision in accordance with the prescribed conditions. Consequently,

LIC received about eighty-three thousand representations. Upon scrutiny, LIC found

seventy-six workers to be eligible for absorption. By an order dated 7 September

2018, a two-judge Bench of this Court 25 directed the CGIT at New Delhi to decide

upon the eligibility of the claims made by the Unions, Associations and individual

workers within a period of three months. However, the Court found that there was no

breach of the judgment dated 18 March 2015 in 
TN Terminated Employees

Association
 (supra). The order of this Court is extracted below:


             “The crucial dispute in these proceedings is regarding the
             beneficiaries of the Award dated 18.06.2001 in I.D. No.27 of
             1991 of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal (CGIT),
             New Delhi.



 
The Award has been finally upheld by this Court in the
             judgment rendered in 
Tamil Nadu Terminated Full Time
             Temporary LIC Employees Association v. Life Insurance
             Corporation of India and Others
, reported in (2015) 9 SCC 62.

             Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India
             appearing for the respondents/LIC, submits that for want of
             documents/materials, the LIC is not in a position to verify as
             to who are the actual beneficiaries of the Award.
 Learned
             counsel appearing for the Union(s) and the individual
             workers, however, would submit that despite producing the
             records and despite availability of the original records with the
             LIC, no positive decision is taken by it.



              Faced with such a situation, we are of the view that the
             CGIT, New Delhi should look into the matter with regard to
             the claims made by the Union(s)/individual workmen,
             regarding entitlement to the benefits under the Award and
             submit a report to this Court. Accordingly, we direct the CGIT,
             New Delhi to look into the claims made by the
             Union(s)/individual Workmen and submit a report to this Court
             within three months.



             There is also a dispute raised by some of the respondents
             that the benefit of Award should be made available to those
             who have been engaged as Badli workers after 4.3.1991.
             That is a matter for interpretation by this Court. For the time
             being, CGIT, New Delhi would limit its enquiry only to the
             claims of the Badli workers between 20.05.1989 and
             04.03.1991, as already indicated by this Court in the order
             dated 11.05.2018.



             We do not find that it is a case of contempt. Therefore, the
             contempt     notices    are   discharged.   However,     the
             applications/petitions be kept pending for the purpose of
             necessary assistance to the Court.”

On 10 September 2018 26, the above order was modified by the same two-judge

Bench in the following terms:



                 “There is also a dispute raised by some of the respondents
                 that the benefit of Award should be made available to those
                 who have been engaged as Badli/Part-time/Temporary
                 workers after 4.3.1991. That is a matter for interpretation by
                 this Court. For the time being, CGIT, New Delhi would limit its
                 enquiry only to the claims of the Badli workers between

 
20.05.1985 and 04.03.1991, as already indicated by this
                 Court in the order dated 11.05.2018.”

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

20      Thereafter, on 12 December 2018 27, while dealing with the batch of contempt

petitions, a two-judge Bench of this Court directed the CGIT, in terms of this Court’s

previous directions dated 7 September 2018 in the same contempt proceedings, to

“look into the matter with regard to the claims made by the Union(s) individual

workmen”. The CGIT was directed to submit its report within four months, as

contemplated by the order dated 7 September 2018 and modified on 10 September

2018 in the contempt proceedings. Between October 2018 and 16 May 2018, the

CGIT issued notice to the Unions and individuals in the earlier industrial reference to

submit their claims. As many as 15,500 claims were submitted on behalf of the

Unions, Associations and individual workers claiming absorption and the benefit of

the Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001. LIC submitted its responses before the

CGIT. The CGIT submitted its report on 31 May 2019 28 to this Court. The report of

the CGIT will be referred to as the Dogra Report, adopting the name of the presiding

officer.






B      Dogra Report


21     Before the presiding officer of the CGIT, LIC set up the plea that only those


workers whose names were mentioned in the original certified list in the industrial

reference were entitled to the benefit of the Srivastav Award. LIC argued that this

was also the direction issued by the Supreme Court in the contempt proceedings

arising out of a review of 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) on 10

September 2018 and reiterated on 12 December 2018. On the other hand, the

Unions representing the workers, as well as the individual workers, claimed that they

were entitled to the benefit of the award irrespective of whether their claim found

place in the original list as certified before the CGIT in the industrial reference.

Dealing with this aspect, the Dogra Report concluded that though the order dated 10

September 2018 required the CGIT to verify the list which was already on the

record, this did not imply that only those workers whose names figured in the

certified list were entitled to absorption, to the exclusion of others. Paragraphs 24

and 25 of the Dogra Report have a bearing on the present proceedings and are

hence extracted below:




 
“24.     To my mind, answer to this question has to be given
             in the light of backdrop of the circumstances which
             culminated into passing of the Award in ID case No.27 of
             1991 which was admittedly upheld by Hon’ble Supreme Court
             in its judgment dated 18/3/2015 reported as (2015) 9 SCC 62
             – 
Tamil Nadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC
             Employees Vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India
. No doubt,


                                             23

                                                                       PART B

Hon’ble Apex Court in its order dated 10/9/2018 has observed
that this Tribunal will verify the list which is available on
record. But this does not mean that only such workmen
whose names are mentioned in the original/certified list
attached with the reference, are liable to be considered for
absorption, to the exclusion of other workmen. This Tribunal
has to keep in mind that contempt petitions were earlier filed
by members of Various Unions before Hon’ble Supreme
Court and LIC had also filed contempt petitions in High Court
of Delhi against Regional Labour Commissioner. During
pendency of said petition, E. Prabhavati and others were
impleaded as party at the instance of LIC vide order dated
25/9/2008. Thereafter, memo of parties was filed by LIC by
adding Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees
Welfare Association as Respondent No.47. In view of this, the
contention of the LIC that members of E. Prabhavati & others
or Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees Welfare
Association are not entitled to any relief, is not tenable, when
the said Association has been held to be necessary party.
There is not even a whisper in any of the judgment/order of
Hon’ble High Court or Hon’ble Supreme Court that only
workmen whose names are mentioned in the certified/original
list of CGIT Award are to be granted relief. An overall
examination of the order dated 10/9/2018 of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court shows that this Tribunal is required to verify
the list available on record but there is no direction to exclude
members of other Union/workmen inasmuch as Hon’ble the
Apex Court while considering the claims of contempt
petitioners has ordered this Tribunal to consider the claims of
those workers who were employed as Badli workers with the
Management of LIC during the period from 20/5/1985 to
4/3/1991 subject to fulfilment of number of days as mentioned
in the Award.




25.     It is settled principle of law that while considering the
order/judgment of Constitutional Court, this Tribunal is
required to keep in mind entire spectrum of the orders as well
as background of the case. It is not proper to cull out a single
para or a sentence from the order/judgment so as to defeat
the very purpose of the order so passed by Hon’ble Supreme
Court. If the orders dated 11/5/2018, 7/9/2018 and 10/9/2018
are taken into consideration, it is crystal clear that claims of all
such workmen and Union/s who worked as Badli workers
during the period from 20/5/1985 to 4/3/1991 are required to
be considered by this Tribunal. Although I am in full
agreement with the submission made on behalf of the



                                    24

                                                                                PART B

             Management/LIC that initial onus is always upon the
             workmen concerned to prove that they were in the
             employment of the Management at the relevant time,
             however this Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that UC has not
             filed on record any document/record relating to employment
             of various workmen rather has simply taken a plea that same
             being old record is not traceable.”



22    The Dogra Report noted that LIC had admitted that 321 workers were found

to be eligible for absorption in terms of the Srivastav Award. The report found fault

with LIC for making contradictory claims that 321 workers were eligible for

absorption when the records of workers were allegedly old and not traceable. The

Dogra Report drew an adverse inference against LIC for having failed to maintain

the records in pursuance of the burden cast upon it by 
Section 25-D
 of the ID Act,

particularly when the reference was pending since 1991. Paragraph 29 of the report

is extracted below:



             “29) During the course of arguments as well as in the reply
             filed on behalf of the Management/LIC, it is clear that
             Management has admitted that till date 321 Nos. of
             employees were found to be eligible in terms of the Award
             and they were considered eligible for absorption. It is not
             understandable to this Tribunal as to what were the basis for
             the Management/LIC for coming to the conclusion that only
             321 Nos. of workmen/employees were found to be eligible
             and covered by the Award of CGIT in ID case No.27/1991,
             when the Management has come up with a plea that record
             relating to the workmen being old record is not traceable. It is
             worthwhile to mention here that 
Section 25-D
 of the ID Act
             specifically provides that it is the duty of every Employer to
             maintain a muster roll and to provide for the making of entries
             therein by the workmen who may present themselves for
             work at the establishment. This Tribunal has to keep in mind
             a vital fact that since the reference bearing ID No.27/1991 is
             pending before various Courts since 1991, the
             Management/LIC was/is required to keep the record in safe
             custody when the case of such a huge magnitude was


                                               25

                                                                             PART B

             pending before the Courts. In such circumstances, this
             Tribunal is constrained to draw adverse inference against the
             management.”


23    Based on the above hypothesis, the report proceeded to decide “prima facie”

the claims of the Unions and individual workers. While taking up the claims made by

the All India Life Insurance Employees Association and its affiliate, Life Insurance

Employees Association, Delhi, the report notes that 6998 claims had been filed (as

contained in Annexure A). Upon scrutiny, LIC drew the attention of the CGIT to the

fact that 3592 duplicate entries were found in the claims which were submitted (as

contained in Annexure A-1). Noting that the “Unions have not seriously disputed the

same”, the Dogra Report concludes that “such claimants are to be given benefit of

absorption only once”. The Dogra Report also notes that workers who had started

working beyond the cut-off date of 4 March 1991 would not be covered in the

enquiry. 
This observation in the Dogra Report was in view of the order of this Court

in the contempt proceedings arising out of the review of 
TN Terminated Employees

Association
 (supra) on 7 September 2018, which had specifically observed that

whether the benefit of the Srivastav Award should be given to those who had been

engaged as badli workers after 4 March 1991 was a matter for interpretation by this

Court. Hence, for the time being, CGIT had been directed to limit its enquiry only to

the claims for the period between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991 (as contained in

Annexure A-2). In this context, the Dogra Report held that those workers who had

commenced work after 4 March 1991 would not be covered by its enquiry.




                                              26


                                                                                PART B

24      The Dogra Report accordingly found the following workers to be entitled to

absorption:





     a) The All India Insurance Employees Association Calcutta and Western Zone

        Insurance Employees Association had filed a claim on behalf of 3337 workers

        as part of the list contained in Annexure B. LIC argued that in this list of 3337

        workers, 3332 workers did not find mention in the original certified list. The

        Dogra Report perused the documents and found that all 3337 workers were

        entitled to the benefit of absorption;



     b) All India LIC Employees Association had filed claims on behalf of 97 workers

        as a list contained in Annexure C. The Dogra Report found that all 97 workers

        (except one who commenced work post 4 March 1991) were entitled to

        absorption and LIC’s argument of fabrication of documents was baseless

        when considered against the general practice of the Branch Managers at LIC;


     c) National Organization of Insurance Workers filed a claim on behalf of workers

        as a part of Annexure D. The Dogra Report found that all 401 workers in

        accordance with Annexure D were eligible for absorption;


     d) The All India National Life Insurance Federation Bombay filed two claims on

        behalf of 1674 workers of the Nagpur Association (Annexure E) and 371

        workers of the Hyderabad Association (Annexure F). The Nagpur Association

        conceded that approximately 84 entries were blank, and 38 workers who had

        worked after 4 March 1991 and three who worked prior to 1 January 1982

        would not be entitled to any benefit. Thus, the 1590 remaining workers of the



                                             27

                                                                                  PART B

           Nagpur Association were found to eligible for absorption (contained in

           Annexure E-1). The legal heirs of two deceased workers were held to be

           entitled to monetary benefit in lieu of service. As regards the 371 workers of

           the Hyderabad Association, the Dogra Report excludes those who had either

           worked prior to 20 May 1985 or after 4 March 1991 and those eligible for

           absorption were detailed out in Annexure F-1;


       e) The Akhil Bhartiya Jivan Nigam filed claims on behalf of 890 workers as a part

           of a list contained in Annexure G. It was admitted that of the 890 workers, 692

           were engaged after 4 March 1991, there were 8 repeat entries and 2 workers

           were engaged prior to 1985. Consequently, after carrying out the exclusions,

           Annexure G-1 represented the list of eligible workers identified by the Dogra

           Report for absorption;



       f) The Tamil Nadu Terminated Full Time Temporary LIC Employees Welfare

           Association filed claims on behalf of 376 workers in Annexure H. After

           excluding those who had worked prior to or after the cut-off date, a list of

           eligible employees was tabulated by the Dogra Report in Annexure H-1.


           Workers who had reached the age of superannuation were held entitled to

           receive all consequential benefits from LIC; and


       g) Annexure I contained the names of a group of workers, described as the “E-

           Prabhavati workmen” 29 containing 1333 workers. After excluding those who

           had worked less than the requisite number of days for absorption and those

           who had been engaged after 4 March 1991, the Dogra Report found the


29

     Interchangeably referred as “E Prabavathy”


                                                  28

                                                                                PART B

        remaining workers to be eligible for absorption and their claims were

        tabulated in Annexure I (A). The specific case of the E Prabhavati group of

        workers will be dealt with in the course of the present judgment. At this stage,

        it is be material to note that LIC had contended that this batch of workers had

        been specifically excluded by paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award.

        Notwithstanding this, the Dogra Report has held that this batch of workers

        would also be entitled to absorption.




25      Apart from the persons named in the annexures mentioned above, the Dogra

Report has concluded that the following claims by the Union for absorption would

have to be allowed:





     (i) Annexure J filed on behalf of 36 workers by the LIC Workers Union Kanpur –

        where 35 workers were allowed absorption (except 1 worker recruited after

        the cut-off date);



     (ii) Annexure K filed on behalf of 17 workers by the LIC Workers Union, Gujarat

        Unit – where 4 out of the 17 workers were held eligible;


     (iii) Annexure L filed on behalf of 119 workers from the Jodhpur Division of LIC –

        where all were held eligible for absorption (while it was noted that 1 worker’s

        name appeared twice);



     (iv) Annexure M – 22 workers were held entitled to absorption;


     (v) Annexure N – 2 workers out of the 54 were held entitled to absorption since

        only these two worked during the relevant period;

                                                                                 PART C


     (vi) Annexure O – 1 out of 9 workers was held entitled to absorption, since the

        others had been employed after the cut-off date of 4 March 1991;


     (vii) Annexure P – 4 workers were held entitled to absorption;


     (viii) Annexure Q – workers in this list were held not entitled to the benefit of

        absorption as they had worked after the cut-off date of 4 March 1991; and


     (ix) Apart from the above annexures, the Dogra Report scrutinized the claim of

        several individual workers and determined whether they were entitled to

        absorption.





C       LIC’s objections to the Dogra Report


26      Broadly speaking, LIC has urged the following objections to the Dogra Report:



     (i) The CGIT was not entrusted with the task of adjudication but of verification;


 
(ii) The orders passed by this court in the contempt proceedings arising out of the

        review of the decision in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) on

        11 May 2018, 7 September 2018 and 10 September 2018 indicate that:


        (a) In the course of verification, CGIT was not entitled to travel beyond the

           Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001;



        (b) The CGIT had to verify only those claims where the workers were

           engaged between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991; and


        (c) The verification by CGIT was to be confined only to those badli, temporary

           and part-time workers whose names were contained in the original




                                            30

                                                                          PART C

      certified list in the reference leading to the Srivastav Award dated 18 June

      2001;



(iii) The CGIT was duty-bound to verify only the documents produced by LIC to

   determine whether the workers were working during the specified period. The

   Dogra Report has found that almost all the names of workers submitted by

   the Union were eligible without due verification;


(iv) A total of 15,465 claims were submitted, which include:


   (a) Persons who were engaged beyond the stipulated period between 20 May

      1985 and 4 March 1991;



   (b) Persons whose names were not in the certified list before the CGIT in the

      industrial reference; and


   (c) Persons from the E Prabhavati group who were not covered by the

      Srivastav Award, as expressly set out in paragraph 75 of the award;



(v) During the course of the verification by LIC, it was found that the

   documents/material produced by several workers were fabricated and there

   was a duplication of names; and


(vi) Though paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award had categorically held that the

   group of workers described as the “E Prabhavati” group were not entitled to

   relief, the Dogra Report held them to be entitled for absorption. LIC has also

   submitted objections to the certification which has been carried out in respect

   of certain workers whose names are set out in the annexures to the Dogra

   Report.



                                       31


                                                                                  PART D

27    At this stage, it would be material to note that the original certified list of

workers in the reference contained the names of 4024 workers. According to LIC, if

the certification exercise carried out in the Dogra Report were to be accepted, about

11,780 workers would be entitled to absorption.





D     The E Prabavathy Group


28    The Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001 details the history pertaining to this


group of workers. Paragraphs 19-20 and 75 of the Award are extracted below:


             “19.     Thereafter the employees employed as temporary,
             badli and part time after 20th May 1985 raised demand for
             their absorption regularising too in the regular service. When
             their demands were not accepted by the corporation several
             writ petitions in this respect were filed before the Hon’ble High
             Court of Madras. These writ petitions were filed before the
             Hon’ble High Court of Madras between the years 1989 to
             1991. The writ petition No.10367/89 filed was between the
             terminated full time temporary LIC Welfare Association and
             Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Khanjawar. This writ petition
             alongwith other writ petitions total 18 writ petitions were listed
             for hearing before the full bench of Hon’ble High Court of
             Madras. After hearing the parties of all the writ petitions the
             Hon’ble High Court of Madras gave judgment which is
             reported as 1993(1) LLJ 1030 between terminated full
             temporary employees welfare association and Senior
             Divisional Manager, LIC, Khanjawar. All the writ petitions
             were dismissed by the Hon’ble High Court of Madras.


             20.     Parties had then preferred civil appeal before the
             Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against judgment of the
             Hon’ble High Court of Madras. These civil appeals were
             numbered as SLP (C) 10393 to 10413/92 E. Prabhawati and
             others Vs. LIC of India and others. It appears that in the said
             civil appeal on the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court
             Corporation had framed a scheme for the regularization of the
             employees who were granted ad hoc appointments for 85
             days at intervals from time to time was placed before the


                                                32

                                                                                PART D

             Hon’ble Supreme Court. After hearing the parties by means of
             interim order dated 23-10-92 found the scheme as
             reasonable and was approved to the existence of the scheme
             contained in clauses (a) and (d) of paragraph 1 and the
             corporation was directed to proceed to regularise the
             employees eligible in accordance with the scheme. The
             clauses of (a) and (d) of the scheme have been reproduced in
             the order by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. With the
             aforesaid direction all the civil appeals were disposed of by
             the Hon’ble Supreme Court.



             […]


             75.     Now as regard the binding effect of the order dated 23-
             10-92 passed by Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in SLP No.
             10393-10411/92 E. Prabhawathy and others Vs. Life
             Insurance Corporation of India and another confirming the
             scheme of absorption/regularisation as argued on behalf of the
             corporation in my view can be well accepted. The order
             passed I find is between the same parties. E. Prabhawathy
             and other is the party in this proceeding being impleaded at
             the subsequent stage of the proceeding. Statement of claim
             has been filed in the present case by the aforesaid workmen.
             The said order dated 23-10-92 of Hon’ble Supreme Court is
             thus between same parties of the case and in view of the
             circumstances. I find that workmen has no ground to challenge
             the legality of the said order dated 23.10.92. The conditions of
             the workmen made in this regard are not accepted.”



29    At this stage, it would be material to note that on 23 October 1992, a three-

judge Bench of this Court specifically dealt with the above group of workmen in E

Prabavathy (supra). The judgment of this Court is extracted below in its entirety:


                                       “ORDER

             Special Leave granted.



             In State of Haryana & Ors. etc. etc. v. Piara Singh & Ors. etc.
             etc., (JT 1992(5) S.C. 179), this court indicated how
             regularization of adhoc/temporary employees in Government
             and Public Sector Undertakings should be effected. While




                                               33

                                                                    PART D

laying down the guidelines in this behalf, this court observe in
paragraph 43 as under:-



         "The normal rule, of course, is regular
         recruitment through the prescribed agency
         but exigencies of administration may
         sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary
         appointment to be made. In such a situation,
         effort should always be to replace such an
         adhoc/temporary employee by a regularly
         selected employee as early as possible.

         Such a temporary employee may also
         compete along with others for such regular
         selection/appointment. If he gets selected,
         well and good, but if he does not, he must
         give way to the regularly selected candidate.

         The appointment of the regularly selected
         candidate cannot be withheld or kept in
         abeyance for the sake of such an
         adhoc/temporary employee."



The LIC was asked to work out a scheme for the purpose of
regularization of employees who were granted adhoc
appointments for 85 days at intervals from time to time. The
learned counsel for the LIC has placed before us a Scheme
for regularization of such adhoc employees. We have given
our anxious consideration to the Scheme proposed by the LIC
and have also heard both Mr. Ramamurthy and Mr. Salve at
length and we are of the opinion that the Scheme proposed
by LIC is a reasonable one and commands acceptance, save
and except the fact that the recruitment scheduled for
November, 1992 will be postponed by not less than six weeks
to enable the eligible adhoc employees to compete with
others for selection at the said recruitment. We are of the
opinion that the relaxation granted to these adhoc employees
for having worked with the LIC in the past in the matter of age
and qualification suffices. The further provision that if such an
adhoc employee has worked between 20th May, 1985 and till
date for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar years, is a
reasonable stipulation for eligibility for regularization. We are
of the opinion, the scheme is in consonance with the
guidelines which we have laid down in paragraphs 43 to 49 of
Piara Singh's judgment. Mr. Salve, the learned counsel for the
LIC, also informed us that in regard to future adhoc
appointments/regularization the LIC is in the process of
making a scheme consistent with the guidelines laid down in



                                   34

                                                                   PART D

Piara Singh's case so that this device of employment for 85
days which has not been approved may not be resorted to in
future. The Scheme contained in Clauses (a) to (d) of
paragraph 1, which is as under, is approved subject to the
postponement of the recruitment scheduled in November,
1992 by at least six weeks and the LIC will proceed to
regularize the employees eligible under the Scheme;



       (a) All those temporary employees who have worked
       for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar years
       with the Life Insurance Corporation between 20th
       May, 1985 uptill date and who confirmed to the
       required eligibility criteria for regular recruitment on
       the dates of their initial temporary, appointment will be
       permitted to compete for the next regular recruitment
       to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation after
       the regular recruitment for these posts currently
       scheduled for November, 1992.



       (b) These candidates will be considered on their
       merits with all other candidates who may apply for
       such appointments, including those from the open
       market.



       (c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation
       for applying for regular recruitment provided that they
       were eligible on the date of their first temporary
       appointment for securing regular appointment with the
       Life               Insurance               Corporation.



       (d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can
       apply for regular recruitment in the normal course.



This regularization will, in the circumstances, be by selection
for appointment. We make the above clauses of the Scheme
as part of our order.



Mr. Ramamurthy, the learned counsel for the petitioners,
further submitted that certain questions of law in regard to the
interpretation of 
section 84
 of the LIC Act, 1956, as amended
by the 
LIC Amendment Act, 1981
, and 
Section 2(oo) (bb)
 of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, arise for consideration in
the present case in view of the judgment of the Madras High
Court. We may state that we express no opinion on the said
questions of law as they do not survive in view of the scheme



                                  35

                                                                            PART D

            which LIC has worked out and which we have approved. It is
            not necessary for us to go into those questions and we leave
            them open for decision in an appropriate case in future.

            The Civil Appeals will stand disposed of accordingly with no
            order as to costs.”



30    The above order of the three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) indicates

that LIC had been directed by the Court to work out a scheme for the purpose of

regularising workers who were granted ad hoc appointment for a period of 85 days

from time to time. A scheme was prepared by LIC. The three-judge Bench had given

“its anxious consideration to the scheme proposed by the LIC” and having heard

both counsel for the workers and for LIC, held that it was “of the opinion that the

scheme proposed by LIC is reasonable one and commands acceptance”. The only

modification was a postponing of the recruitment which was scheduled on 1

November 1992 to allow eligible ad hoc workers to compete with others for selection

at the recruitment. This Court affirmed the relaxation of age and qualifications

granted by the scheme to eligible ad hoc workers who had worked between 20 May

1985 “till date” in any two calendar years. This Court accepted the scheme which

was proposed by LIC, subject to the modification noted above. This Court held that

regularisation would be by selection for appointment. The clauses of the scheme

were incorporated as a part of the order dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy

(supra). In this backdrop, paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award specifically excluded

the claims of the E Prabavathy workers who were governed by the order of this

Court dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra). The grievance of the LIC is




                                            36

                                                                            PART E

that despite this, the Dogra Report concludes that this group of workers would be

eligible for absorption in terms of the Srivastav Award.



E          Sequel to E Prabavathy


31         Following the order of this Court dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy


(supra), LIC framed the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Employment of

Temporary Staff) Instructions 1993. A contempt petition was moved before this

Court alleging that the scheme which was notified by LIC on 28 June 1993 was not

in accordance with the order in E Prabhavathy (supra). The contempt petition was

dismissed by this Court on 12 July 1993.




32         In 1998, a batch of writ petitions was filed in the High Court of Andhra

Pradesh seeking the relief of absorption on a permanent basis. Among the petitions

was a petition instituted by G Sudhakar and others. A Single Judge of the High

Court of Andhra Pradesh dismissed the petition, placing reliance on the decision in

E Prabavathy (supra). On 3 November 1998, the Division Bench of the High Court

directed LIC to frame a scheme for regularisation. 
LIC preferred a Special Leave

Petition against the judgment of the Division Bench in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra) which

was allowed by this Court 30 on 22 November 2001.
 
A two-judge Bench of this Court

held in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra) that the scheme approved in E Prabavathy (supra)

shall govern the absorption of all ad hoc workers in the country.
 
This Court’s order

dated 22 November 2001 in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra) is extracted below:


30


     Civil Appeal No 2104 of 2000


                                           37

                                                                   PART E

“This appeal is by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (for
short “the Corporation”) against the Division Bench Judgment
of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The Respondents filed a
Writ Petition praying for a mandamus to the corporation for
their absorption on permanent basis which stood dismissed.

On an appeal being carried, the Division Bench of the High
Court disposed of the appeal with a direction to the
corporation to frame a scheme for regularisation of the
employees and regularise their services in accordance with
such scheme. It is this direction of the High Court which is the
subject matter of challenge in this Appeal.



Mr. Salve, the learned Solicitor General appearing for the
Corporation stated that, in fact, in the case of E. Prabhavathy
& Ors. v. The Life Insurance Corporation of India & Anr. (Civil
Appeals arising out of SLPs Nos. 1039-10413/1992), this
Court was in seisin of a similar problem and during the
hearing of that appeal, a tentative scheme was produced
before this Court and the Court framed the terms of those
schemes as a part of the order and disposed of the appeal in
terms of the said scheme on 23rd October, 1992. The four
clauses of the said scheme which formed a part of the order
are quoted hereinbelow in extenso :-



“Scheme                                                     :

(a) All those temporary employees who have worked for 85
days in any two consecutive calendar years with the Life
Insurance Corporation between 20th May, 1985 uptill date
and who conformed to the required eligibility criteria for
regular recruitment on the dates of their initial temporary
appointment will be permitted to compete for the next regular
recruitment to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation
after the regular recruitment for these posts currently
scheduled for November, 1992;



(b) These candidates will be considered on their merits with
all other candidates who may apply for such appointments,
including those from the open market.



(c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation for
applying for regular recruitment provided that they were
eligible on the date of their first temporary appointment for
securing regular appointment with the Life Insurance
Corporation;

(d) If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can apply
for regular recruitment in the normal course.


                                  38


                                                                   PART E


According to the learned Solicitor General, since a scheme is
in existence, it is no longer necessary to evolve a fresh
scheme for these employees who were the parties before the
Andhra Pradesh High Court. He also stated that in the
meantime, a set of instructions have been framed called the
“Life Insurance Corporation of India (Employment of
Temporary Staff) Instructions, 1993” which takes care of such
employees who were continuing for a fairly long period
without being regularised.



Mr. Krishnamurthy, the learned Senior Counsel, on the other
hand, contended that the aforesaid instructions will not
govern the case of the employees who were there before the
High Court, as they were the appointees between 1986 and
1993. He further contended that a similar matter, in the case
of The Management of the LIC of India v. Their Workmen
(C.A. Nos. 1790/89) a Bench of this Court has disposed of
with a direction to consider the case of regularisation
considering the suitability at a lesser standard by its judgment
dated 7th February, 1996 and, therefore, there is no infirmity
with the impugned direction of the High Court.



Having examined the judgment dated 7th February, 1996 of
this Court in C.A. Nos. 1790/89, we find that the earlier 3
judge bench decision dated 23rd October, 1992 has not been
noticed. The aforesaid three-judge bench decision
unequivocally makes the provisions of the scheme as a part
of the order. Necessarily, therefore, the case of regularisation
of the employees of the corporation could be dealt with in
accordance with the said scheme and it would not be
necessary to evolve a fresh scheme for a group of
employees. Mr. Krishnamurthy further contended that the E.
Prabhavathy’s case (supra) relates to the employees of Tamil
Nadu division. But, it is not disputed that they are the
employees of the Corporation. If the Corporation has evolved
a scheme assuming for the Tamil Nadu division, then the
same could be equally applicable to the employees of all
Divisions in the country. 
That being the position, the scheme
which has been approved and formed a part of the order of
this Court dated 23-10-1992 should govern the case of these
respondents who were writ petitioners before the High Court
of Andhra Pradesh

Needless to mention, in the earlier decision of this Court
dated 23-10-1992 this Court has not limited the applicability of



                                  39

                                                                                PART E

               the scheme only to the employees of the Tamil Nadu Division.
               In the aforesaid circumstances, the High Court of Andhra
               Pradesh was not justified in issuing the impugned direction to
               the Corporation to evolve a new set of scheme to govern the
               case of the employees who had filed writ petitions in the High
               Court. We, therefore, set aside the impugned direction of the
               Division Bench of the High Court and substitute the same with
               the direction that the case of regularisation of these
               respondents shall be considered in accordance with the
               scheme which formed a part of the order of this Court dated
               23-10-1992, if not already considered. This appeal
               accordingly stands disposed of.”



33      The above judgment of this Court in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra) lays down that:


     (i) The order dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra) made the scheme

        as a part of its order. Necessarily, the case for the regularisation of the

        workers of LIC would be dealt with in accordance with the scheme. Hence, it

        was not necessary to evolve a fresh scheme for a different group of workers;


     (ii) Though E Prabavathy (supra) dealt with workers of the Tamil Nadu Division,

        the scheme which was evolved by LIC would equally be applicable to workers

        of all divisions in the country;



     (iii) The decision in E Prabavathy (supra) has not limited the applicability of the

        scheme only to the workers of the Tamil Nadu division; and


     (iv) The Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh was not justified in

        evolving a new scheme to govern the workers who had filed a Writ Petition

        and its judgment accordingly stands set aside.

Prabavathy (supra).
 
Subsequently, on 18 January 2011 in 
LIC v. D V Anil Kumar

a two-judge Bench of this Court disposed of the appeal by accepting the terms of the

scheme framed by LIC for the absorption of Class IV workers.
 
The attention of this

Court has also been drawn to an order dated 20 October 2016 of this Court in


Hashmuddin v. LIC
 32 followed by an order dated 15 January 2020, which accepted

a scheme formulated by LIC for workers who had rendered service for more than

sixteen years.






F          Submissions


35         On behalf of LIC, Mr ANS Nadkarni, Senior Counsel, made the following

submissions:



       (i) As a consequence of the Dogra Report, LIC would be required to regularise

           about 11,780 workers who claim to have worked for a limited number of days.

           No verification of these claims has been done either by the LIC or by the

           CGIT in the Dogra Report. This would amount to an illegal backdoor entry,

           which would be contrary to the statutory regulations framed by the LIC.

           Further, LIC would also face the issue of a lack of sanctioned posts for these

           workers;

                                                                          PART F


(ii) The Tulpule Award dated 17 April 1986 and the Jamdar Award dated 26

   August 1988 directed the regularisation of persons working between 1

   January 1982 and 20 May 1985 who: (a) had worked as Class IV workers for

   a minimum period of 70 days in any three calendar years; or (b) had worked

   as Class III workers for a minimum period of 85 days in any two calendar

   years. However, these awards were substituted by a settlement which was

   arrived at in the civil appeals before this Court in 
LIC v. Their Workmen


   (supra), which were finally adjudicated upon by an order dated 7 February

   1996;




(iii) Both the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards directed regularisation and absorption

   without verifying the existence of sanctioned posts. During the pendency of

   the litigation, LIC was injuncted from making fresh recruitment till the awards

   were pronounced. As a result of the interim orders dated 15 January 1986

   and 29 June 1987, LIC could not pursue an open, competitive and

   transparent process for selection on the basis of an advertisement followed by

   a written examination and interview. The last recruitment process took place

   in 1984, and till 1993 there was no fresh recruitment. This necessitated the

   making of temporary appointments between 1985 and 1991 to operate LIC’s

   2048 branches across India;



(iv) The Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001 arose out of a reference dated 4

   March 1991, which required the tribunal to adjudicate whether LIC’s action of

   not absorbing badli/temporary/part-time workers employed after 20 May 1985

   was justified. The award directed the absorption of “the concerned workmen”,


                                      42

                                                                                         PART F

           i.e., those employed after 20 May 1985 (and thus not covered by the Tulpule

           and Jamdar Awards) who had worked as Class III workers for a minimum of

           85 days in two calendar years or who had worked as Class IV workers for a

           minimum of 70 days in three calendar years. The award directed that if

           regular     vacancies         did   not   exist   to   accommodate   these   persons,

           supernumerary posts would have to be created by LIC. Such a direction

           would be contrary to the principles which have been enunciated in the

           decision of this Court in ONGC v. Krishan Gopal 33. LIC as a statutory

           corporation is governed by its regulations, and no appointment beyond the

           vacancies in sanctioned posts can be made;



 
(v) 
The LIC Act
 was amended by Act 1 of 1981. The amendment to Section

           48(2A) stipulates that the regulations which have been framed prior to 1981

           are deemed to be rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc). Further, Section

           48(2C) stipulates that the rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc) would override

           the provisions of the 
ID Act
. The provision has been held to be constitutionally

           valid by this Court in 
M. Venugopal v. LIC
 34;




      (vi) Though LIC is bound by the judgment of this Court in TN Terminated

           Employees Association (supra) which has restored the Srivastav Award

           (subject to its modification in the review petition in regards the quantum of

           back wages), it is also bound by:

           (a) The order dated 23 October 1992 of a three-judge Bench of this Court in E

                Prabavathy (supra) which upheld the scheme formed by LIC for

                absorption of ad hoc workers;



           (b) The order dated 22 November 2001 of a two-judge Bench of this Court in

                G Sudhakar (supra) which held that the scheme which was accepted in E

                Prabavathy (supra) would not be limited only to the workers in that case

                but would be applicable to all the workers of LIC in all its divisions across

                India; and


 
(c) The settlement which substituted the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards, which

                was recorded by this Court while disposing of the civil appeals by its final

                order dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra);


       (vii) On 16 May 2017, LIC issued instructions under 
Regulation 4
 of its Staff

           Regulations to all Zonal Managers to implement the Srivastav Award and this

           Court’s orders. Consequently, 245 workers were offered absorption after

           being found eligible;



       (viii) In terms of the order of this Court dated 18 January 2011 in LIC of India v.


 
D V Anil Kumar
 (supra), LIC framed a scheme to regularise Class IV workers

           who were engaged for 5 years or more and consequently, 4770 persons were

           appointed on regular posts;




       (v) Following the order of this Court dated 11 May 2018 in the contempt

           proceedings 35, LIC received 8300 representations from individuals claiming to

           be covered by the Srivastav Award, which were then scrutinised by a senior

                                                                          PART F

   officer. Subsequently, 76 claimants were found to be eligible for absorption in

   addition to the 245 individual claimants who had been absorbed earlier;


(vi) By the order of this Court dated 7 September 2018 in the contempt

   proceedings arising out a review of 
TN Terminated Employees Association


   (supra), it was expressly made clear that:




   (a) The question whether the benefit of the Srivastav Award should be made

      available to those who were engaged as badli and temporary workers after

      4 March 1991 is a matter for interpretation before this Court;


   (b) The CGIT would limit its inquiry only to the claims of the workers who were

      employed between 20 May 1985 and 4 March 1991; and


   (c) No case in contempt had been established;



(vii) The above position is further clarified by this Court’s order dated 10

   September 2018 in the contempt proceedings arising out the review of 
TN

   Terminated Employees Association
 (supra), in terms of which CGIT was

   directed to verify the list which was available on its record. Thus, the CGIT

   was required to scrutinise the applications claiming the benefit of the award

   against the list of workers who were before the CGIT in the Srivastav Award.

   Hence, LIC scrutinized the claims of only those who were part of the certified

   list before the CGIT in the Srivastav Award and had worked between 20 May

   1985 and 4 March 1991;

   Employees Association and Western Zone Insurance Employees Association

                                                                         PART F

   (R3 and R4 in the Dogra Report), National Organisation of Insurance Workers

   (R7 in the Dogra Report) and All India National Life Insurance Employees

   Federation (R9 in the Dogra Report) were all signatories to the compromise

   which substituted the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards and was noted in this

   Court’s interim order dated 1 March 1989 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra).


Further, by the order of this Court dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their

   Workmen
 (supra), the Karamchari Sangh (R10 in the Dogra Report) was also

   directed to follow the terms of compromise. Hence, these Unions and

   Associations who had entered into the compromise substituting the Tulpule

   and Jamdar Awards are governed by its terms;




(ix) The scrutiny which was envisaged by the order of this Court required the

   CGIT to: firstly, check the presence of the names of the claimants in the CGIT

   list in the Srivastav Award; and secondly, conduct a verification of documents

   such as appointment letters, extension letters and relieving letters to

   scrutinise whether the claimants were actually employed for 70/85 days for

   three/two years respectively. Based on this scrutiny, the 321 eligible workers

   (245+76) who were beneficiaries of the Srivastav Award have already been

   absorbed, and any other claims by the workers individually or through the ten

   Unions are not maintainable;



(x) The Dogra Report has erroneously held that the compromise which was

   arrived at between the parties was in addition to the rights declared in the

   Tulpule and Jamdar Awards. To support its reasoning, the Report relies on

   the findings of this Court at paragraph 39 to 41 of its judgment dated 18


                                     46

   March 2015 in 
TN Terminated Employees Association

However,

   those observations have only adverted to the interim order dated 1 March

   1989 of this Court in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra), and not its final order

   dated 7 February 1996;




(xi) Instead of carrying out the task of verification, the Dogra Report only takes a

   prima facie view and has merely stated that the majority of the workers were

   eligible for absorption without carrying out the process of verification;


(xii) Though the Unions have admitted that they do not possess either the

   residential addresses or other particulars of the claimants situated in various

   regions, the Dogra Report has found 1452 workmen to be eligible across the

   country; and


(xiii) In summary, the Dogra Report is flawed because it:


   (a) Does not consider the CGIT certified list of the Srivastav Award, as

      directed in the order of this Court dated 10 September 2018;


   (b) Ignores that it was not carrying out an adjudicatory function but only a

      verification exercise;



   (c) Initially states that the claimants who had joined after 4 March 1991 are

      not being scrutinised, yet the final directions consider many such claims;


      and


   (d) Ignores paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award and gives benefit to persons

      who are governed by the scheme accepted by this Court in E Prabavathy

      (supra).

36        On behalf of the Unions, Associations and workers, arguments have been

addressed by Dr Manish Singhvi, Mr Pallav Sishodia, Mr R Singaravelan, Mr V

Prakash and Mr Salman Khurshid, Senior Counsel. In addition to the submissions of

Senior Counsel, we have heard Mr Nandakumar, Mr Rakesh Shukla and Mr

Shailesh Madiyal. In addition, Counsel appearing on behalf of the workers in various

Miscellaneous Applications have been furnished with an opportunity of being heard

in seriatim. The submissions which have been urged on behalf of the workers are

summarised below:





 
(i) The present proceedings in the Miscellaneous Applications pertain to the

          implementation of the Srivastav Award dated 22 June 2001. The Srivastav

          Award has been upheld in the decision of this Court in 
TN Terminated

          Employees Association
 (supra);




 
(ii) The review petitions arising from the decision in 
TN Terminated Employees

          Association
 (supra) were dismissed by the judgment in 
T N Terminated Full

          Time Temporary LIC Employees Assn. v. LIC
 36 and the curative petition

          was also dismissed on 22 February 2017. Thus, the Srivastav Award has

          attained finality subject to the modification that the quantum of back-wages

          has been reduced to fifty per cent. The doctrine of res judicata applies

          between the parties and at this stage, it would not be open to set aside or

          alter the contents of the award;

                                                                             PART F


(iii) Though the contempt petitions were disposed of, the CGIT was directed to

   look into the implementation of the Srivastav Award. The Dogra Report dated

   31 May 2019 has been prepared by the CGIT in pursuance of the mandate of

   this Court;



(iv) Four grounds have been advanced on behalf of LIC to assail the Dogra

   report:



   (a) No documents were produced to establish that the workers had worked for

      85 days and 70 days across a period of two and three years respectively;


   (b) The Dogra Report had to consider only the CGIT certified list which was

      part of the reference proceedings;



   (c) The Srivastav Award would not apply to workers who commenced work

      after 4 March 1991; and


   (d) The Dogra Report also permits the absorption of the workers governed by

      the judgment of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra);



(v) In response to the above grounds, it is submitted that the Dogra Report has

   correctly drawn an adverse inference against LIC for not producing the

   records which were in their possession, while approving the lists. Further, the

   report duly notes that a majority of the workers had produced documents,

   which have been accepted after verification;



(vi) In the event, however, that this Court is inclined to remit the proceedings back

   for proper verification of the workers who are covered by the Srivastav Award,

   the following methodology should be adopted:





                                       49


                                                                            PART F


   (a) LIC has now stated before this Court that its divisional offices are in

      possession of the records. LIC must produce in the first instance the

      records available with it for the purpose of verification; and


   (b) The verification to be carried out under the directions of this Court should

      not be confined to any particular document and the primary onus must lie

      on LIC to show whether the workers have actually worked during the

      relevant period;



(vii) The Srivastav Award did not only deal with the cases of workers who had

   actually filed cases in the industrial reference. The award specifies that it

   would apply to all workers, and consequently directed that an advertisement

   be issued for that purpose. If the award was intended to be limited to the

   CGIT certified list, there was no occasion to direct a verification to be carried

   out by the CGIT since the certified list was already available with LIC. Hence,

   the direction in the order of this Court dated 10 September 2018 in the

   contempt proceedings arising out of the review of 
TN Terminated

   Employees Association
 (supra), that the verification would be carried out of

   the CGIT list, cannot be read out of context. Consistent with the principles of

   collective bargaining under the 
ID Act
, all workers who were beneficiaries of

   the Srivastav Award should be granted absorption;


(viii) The plea that workers employed after 4 March 1991 are not entitled to relief

   under the Srivastav Award is contrary to the provisions of 
Section 18(3)(d)
 of

   the ID Act. The purpose of 
Section 18(3)(d)
 is to ensure that an award

   governs not only those who are in service when it is made but to subsequent


                                       50

                                                                          PART F

   workers as well. In any event, at least those workers who were in employment

   on 18 June 2001, when the award was made, should be granted relief;


(ix) The applicability of the orders of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra) and 
G

   Sudhakar
 (supra) has been considered in the judgment of this Court in 
TN

   Terminated Employees Association
 (supra), and that interpretation has

   attained finality. Hence, those orders ought not to become the basis to reopen

   the present proceedings;




(x) As a matter of fact, the Dogra Report suffers from under-inclusion since the

   claims of workers who were engaged after 4 March 1991 have not been

   considered, though they may have applied in pursuance of the advertisement

   issued by the LIC to implement the Srivastav Award;


(xi) The compromise which was arrived at before this Court, as noted in its orders

   dated 1 March 1989 and 7 February 1996, indicates that it was confined to

   persons who worked from 1 January 1982 to 20 May 1985. Hence, it has no

   relevance to the Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001, which relates to

   persons who were engaged after 20 May 1985;



(xii) The terms of reference which resulted in the Srivastav Award related to the

   employment of badli, temporary and part-time workers after 20 May 1985.


   Consequently, there is no warrant for restricting the operation of the award to

   the period up to 4 March 1991 (which was the date of reference). The benefit

   of the award must enure not only to the workers who were engaged as

   temporaries or badlis after 20 May 1985 till the date of reference but the same

   principle must also apply to workers who have been engaged thereafter; and


                                      51

                                                                               PART G


     (xiii) The judgment of this Court has directed the payment of fifty per cent back-

        wages. For the period after the date of the Srivastav Award, full back-wages

        should be granted to those who have been absorbed. Back-wages cannot be

        granted only for the period of 70/85 days, and at the rates which were made

        applicable to the badli workers.




37      The rival submissions would now fall for analysis.




G       Prelude – Tulpule and Jamdar Awards, and their Aftermath


38      The Tulpule Award dated 17 April 1986 was made in the context of a

reference to the NIT pertaining to the absorption of badli/temporary/part-time

workers as regular employees of LIC. The award held that all workers who had

worked in any capacity, temporary, badli or part-time, between 1 January 1982 till 20

May 1985, should be considered as eligible for absorption provided that: (a) Class IV

workers ought to have worked for 70 days in any three calendar years; and (b) Class

III workers ought to have worked for 85 days in any two calendar years.


39      The Jamdar Award dated 26 August 1998 clarified the meaning of the Tulpule

Award dated 17 April 1986. The award discussed the object of the earlier reference,

and indicated that LIC had engaged badli/temporary/part-time workers on a large-

scale and restricted their employment to a particular number of days in order to

prevent them from gaining the status of permanency on the basis of the number of

days worked. Hence, it held that the object of the reference was to put an end to


                                           52

                                                                            PART G

such unfair legal practices, to regularise the employment of persons who would have

been ordinarily absorbed but for such practices and to reduce to a minimum the

disproportionately large contingent of such employees who had been deprived of

security of service. The Jamdar Award noted that the Tulpule Award did not

contemplate that in computing the number of work days only the days worked in

two/three consecutive calendars year should be taken into consideration. Further, it

noted that when the Tulpule Award spoke of “absorption”, it did not mean

“recruitment”.





40    The Tulpule and Jamdar Awards were the subject matter of a challenge

before this Court under 
Article 136
 of the Constitution in 
LIC v. Their Workmen


(supra). On 1 March 1989, this Court while granting leave to appeal recorded that

eight out of the nine Unions, representing about 99 per cent of the workers, had

entered into a compromise with LIC. It was in this backdrop that, pending the

disposal of the civil appeals, this Court permitted LIC and these eight Unions to

implement the terms of compromise, without prejudice to the rights of the ninth

Union. The terms of compromise envisaged that it would operate in substitution of

the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards on the question of the regular employment of the

workers concerned in those references. The terms of the compromise adopted the

norm of employment for 85 days in any two years for Class III workers and

employment for 70 days in any three calendar years for Class IV workers between 1

January 1982 and 20 May 1985. Temporary, part-time and badli workers who had

made applications before a stipulated date were held eligible to be considered for



                                        53

                                                                               PART G

regular employment. The compromise envisaged that the selection of candidates

shall be made on the basis of qualifications, age, written test and interview, and also

having regard to the number of days worked. According to the compromise, initially

a list of selected candidates was to be drawn up, from which regular employment

would be offered in order of merit prospectively from the dates notified, as and when

vacancies in sanctioned posts for regular employment were filled up from time to

time. Further, as a result of the compromise, the process of recruitment for these

candidates would be subject to certain relaxations. Finally, it was envisaged that the

dispute in relation to the workers concerned, which had resulted in the Tulpule and

Jamdar Awards, would no longer survive, and the rights and obligations of the

parties in relation to regular employment would be governed only by the

compromise.






41    The compromise was ultimately adopted in the final order of this Court dated

7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra), which disposed of the civil

appeals. In the order, this Court accepted the submission of LIC that since eight out

of nine Unions (representing an overwhelming majority of workmen) had accepted

the compromise, the ninth Union must also act on the basis of its terms and

conditions. The Court, however, directed that LIC shall exempt Class IV workers

(whom the ninth Union was representing) from a test and interview, if it had the

power to do so under the regulations and instructions governing their conditions of

service. In the alternative, if there was no such power, it directed that the test which





                                          54

                                                                                 PART G

was prescribed for these workers should be of a lower standard than the test

prescribed in the two circulars mentioned in the compromise.


42    There is absolutely no manner of doubt that the compromise which was

arrived at by eight out of nine Unions indicated that the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards

would stand substituted by the terms of the compromise. The compromise clearly

stipulated that the workers who fulfilled the requisite days of work in Class III or, as

the case may be, Class IV posts would be eligible. As and when vacancies would

arise, they would be offered regular appointment.






43    Prior to the final order of this Court in the civil appeals arising from the Tulpule

and Jamdar Awards, the litigation in the E Prabavathy batch was settled by the order

dated 23 October 1992. In the order, the Court found that the scheme for absorption

which was propounded by LIC was reasonable. The scheme envisaged that all

temporary workers who had worked for 85 days in any two consecutive calendar

years with LIC between 20 May 1985 and 23 October 1992 and who conformed to

the required eligibility criteria for regular appointment on the date of their initial

appointment, would be permitted to compete at the next regular recruitment to be

made by LIC. These candidates would be considered on their merit as against the

other candidates who applied for these posts, including from the open market. They

would also be given an age relaxation while applying for a post, if they were eligible

for it on the date of their first temporary appointment. This scheme was approved,

subject to the postponement by at least six weeks of a recruitment scheduled for

November 1992, in order to enable all eligible ad hoc workers to compete with


                                           55

                                                                               PART G

others for selection at that recruitment. The decision in E Prabavathy (supra) was

evidently not noticed in this Court’s order dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their

Workmen
 (supra).






44    The order of a two-judge Bench of this Court dated 22 November 2001 in 
G

Sudhakar
 (supra) noted that in E Prabavathy (supra), a Bench of three-judges had

embodied the clauses of the scheme as a part of their order.
 
Hence, the order in 
G

Sudhakar
 (supra) expressly clarified that though the scheme before this Court in E

Prabavathy (supra) was evolved in relation to a case from the Tamil Nadu Division

of the LIC, it would be equally applicable to the workers of all divisions of LIC in the

country.
 
Consequently, in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra), it was held that the scheme would

apply to workers who were before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh as well, and

there was no occasion for the High Court to direct that a new scheme should be

framed by LIC.





45    It is important to note that the orders of this Court dated 23 October 1992 (in

E Prabavathy (supra)) and 7 February 1996 (disposing the civil appeals challenging

the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards) pre-date the Srivastav Award dated 18 June 2001.


On the other hand, the order in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra), which was dated 22 November

2001, was evidently passed after the Srivastav Award.





                                          56

                                                                              PART H

H     Srivastav Award and the Judgement of this Court


46    The reference before the tribunal leading up to the Srivastav Award was

made on 4 March 1991. The reference was in relation to the justification of LIC’s

non-absorption of persons recruited as temporary, badli and part-time workers after

20 May 1985. The Srivastav Award contains an observation that LIC was not guilty

of unfair labour practices by continuing persons recruited as temporary, badli and

part-time workers as non-regular employees. The above observation in the award

was in view of the submission of LIC (which was not refuted by the workers) that the

workers were continuing in their positions on the basis of injunction orders issued by

tribunals and the court, and due to the pressure of the Unions. However, the award

also noted that the terms of the reference did not encompass this aspect and the

tribunal was not recording a finding.





47    Paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award referred to the order of this Court dated

23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra) which governed the scheme of

absorption/regularisation for that batch of workers. It noted that the E Prabavathy

group of workers were impleaded to the proceedings leading to the award, and had

filed a statement of claim. However, the award concluded that since the order dated

23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra) was between the same parties, the

legality of the order of this Court could not be challenged by the workers before the

tribunal. Hence, the contention of the workers in that regard was not accepted.


48    In paragraph 88, the Srivastav Award concluded:





                                         57


                                                                                  PART H

              “88. In view of the fact, I am of definite view that such type of
              workmen belonging to temporary and part time categories in
              class III and class IV service of corporation who were
              employed after following the procedure and were allowed to
              continue service beyond the qualifying period and were
              eligible and suitable in every respect should be given
              absorption in the service from date of the vacancy in the
              service in which they could have been absorbed. It will also
              apply to those such employees whose services were
              terminated by the corporation”



The award finds that LIC was not justified in denying absorption to those

temporary/badli/part-time workers who were employed after 20 May 1985, and that

they should be given absorption on the terms and conditions which were stipulated

in the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards (which were in respect of workers employed

between 1 January 1982 to 20 May 1985). LIC was directed to take into

consideration their claim for absorption on the basis of their eligibility and suitability,

as dealt with in the Srivastav Award. Thus, all the badli, part-time and temporary

workers who have rendered the qualifying period of service and were suitable would

also have to be considered for absorption by LIC by publishing a notice in the

newspaper. The Srivastav Award directed that in case no regular vacancy was

available, supernumerary posts shall be created by LIC for the purpose of

absorption and that the case for absorption against existing vacancies would be

considered first, irrespective of regular recruitment.



49     The Srivastav Award was set aside by the Single Judge of the Delhi High

Court. The Division Bench affirmed the judgment of the Single Judge. Eventually,





                                                 58

                                                                               PART H

the dispute travelled to and resulted in the decision of this Court in 
TN Terminated

Employees Association
 (supra).






50    The judgment in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra), dated 18

March 2015, arose from concurring judgments of a Single Judge and of the Division

Bench of the Delhi High Court by which the Srivastav Award had been set aside. In

appeal, the principal issue which came for consideration before this Court was:


 
“34.1. (i) Whether the setting aside of the award passed by
             CGIT dated 18-6-2001 by the learned Single Judge by
             placing reliance upon compromise reached between the
             parties in SLP No. 14906 of 1988, which was filed against the
             award of Justice Tulpule, which award was clarified and
             affirmed by Justice SM Jamdar, legal and valid?”



The next issue, in relation to the workers’ claim for relief, was consequential in

nature. After noticing the interim order dated 1 March 1989 passed by this Court in

the proceedings arising out of the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards in 
LIC v. Their

Workmen
 (supra), Justice Gopala Gowda, speaking for the two-judge Bench,

observed:




             “40. From the perusal of the above order of this Court
             in LIC v. Workmen [ SLP (C) No. 14906 of 1988, order dated
             1-3-1989 (SC)] , nowhere has it been stated in the terms of
             the compromise between the parties that the award of Justice
             R.D. Tulpule dated 17-4-1986 which was clarified upon
             reference made by the Central Government under 
Section
             36-A
 of the Act by Justice Jamdar, is either set aside by this
             Court or substituted the compromise terms in the place of the
             award except the order referred to supra passed in the above
             SLP No. 14906 of 1988. In fact, on the other hand it is clearly
             stated that the compromise terms are between the parties to
             the said SLP and that it shall not prejudice the respective
             rights and obligations in relation to the members of the other


                                               59

                                                                              PART H

             union. 
Therefore, the effect of the award of Justice R.D.
             Tulpule with regard to the direction given to the Corporation
             regarding absorption of badli, temporary employees as
             permanent employees has not been substituted by terms and
             conditions of the compromise.”



In the above extract, the Court referred to the interim order of this Court dated 1

March 1989 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra) by which, pending the disposal of the

appeals, eight out of the nine Unions who had entered into terms of compromise

with LIC were permitted to implement it as an interim measure, without prejudice to

the rights and contentions of the remaining Union which had not entered into a

compromise. Relying exclusively on the interim order of this Court, it was held:




             “41. The award of Justice R.D. Tulpule dated 17-4-1986
             reiterated by way of clarification in the award passed by
             Justice Jamdar dated 26-8-1988, in the dispute subsequently
             has been operative even after the compromise arrived at
             between the parties to the compromise in LIC v. Workmen [
             SLP (C) No. 14906 of 1988, order dated 1-3-1989 (SC)]
             before this Court. Therefore, the contention of the learned
             Senior Counsel on behalf of the Corporation that the said
             awards are not in operation and that only the terms and
             conditions of compromise and orders of this Court are binding
             upon the workmen concerned in these appeals is both not
             factually and legally correct. This abovesaid argument of the
             learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the Corporation is not
             tenable in view of the categorical statement made by this
             Court in its orders passed in SLP referred to supra, wherein,
             this Court has permitted the management and members of
             the said 8 unions to implement the terms of compromise by
             way of interim measure without any prejudice to the rights
             and contentions of the members of other union who have not
             entered into compromise with the management of the
             Corporation. It is not the case of the Corporation in these
             appeals either before CGIT or before the High Court or in
             these proceedings the workmen concerned have also
             accepted the said terms and conditions of the compromise
             arrived at between the parties in SLP No. 14906 of 1988. This
             Court in the order passed in the abovesaid SLP which is


                                              60

                                                                                PART H

             extracted hereinabove has made it very clear that the said
             compromise was entered into between unions therein, but it
             does not prejudice the rights and contentions of the workmen
             concerned whose disputes are in relation to their absorption
             in their respective posts who were appointed after 20-5-1985.
             Further, even if some of the workmen are bound under the
             said compromise that arose out of SLP No. 14906 of 1988,
             this in no way deters their right to raise an industrial dispute
             and get the same adjudicated vide order of reference by the
             appropriate Government to CGIT. The award of CGIT was
             concluded after rightly examining the facts, circumstances of
             the case and the legal principles laid down in the awards
             passed by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. More
             importantly CGIT award was passed after rightly appreciating
             the points of dispute referred to it and on the merits of the
             case.”



The interpretation of the interim order which has been placed by the Court emerges

from the following extract:



             “46. Further, by a careful reading of the said order
             in LIC v. Workmen [ SLP (C) No. 14906 of 1988, order dated
             1-3-1989 (SC)] , it has been made clear that the awards
             passed by NIT (by Justice Jamdar and Justice Tulpule) after
             adjudicating the points of dispute in the industrial dispute
             raised by similarly placed workmen is not disturbed by
             substituting the terms and conditions of compromise between
             the parties therein in SLP No. 14906 of 1988. Therefore, the
             awards in relation to the absorption of the workmen as
             permanent workmen in the Corporation have got statutory
             force. This is what is stated by CGIT in its award dated 18-6-
             2001 on the basis of pleadings and evidence on record, which
             was erroneously set aside by the High Court by assigning
             erroneous reasons which is sought to be justified by the
             Senior Counsel on behalf of the Corporation by placing
             reliance upon the orders and the Scheme framed in E.
             Prabavathy [E. Prabavathy v. LIC, SLP (C) No. 10393 of
             1992, order dated 23-10-1992 (SC)] and G. Sudhakar [ Civil
             Appeal No. 2104 of 2000, order dated 22-11-2001 (SC)]
             cases which Scheme has no application to the case of the
             workmen concerned involved in these appeals referred to
             supra.”




                                               61

                                                                                PART H




51      The Court proceeded to hold that both the award of Justice Tulpule, reiterated

by way of the clarificatory award of Justice Jamdar, are operative and they have not

been terminated by either of the parties as provided by 
Section 19(6)
 of the ID Act.

The Court held that the terms of compromise and the scheme formulated in E

Prabavathy (supra) and 
G Sudhakar
 (supra) do not result in the substitution of the

awards made by Justice Tulpule and Justice Jamdar. The Court held that the

Srivastav Award would have to be observed by LIC until it was replaced by another

settlement in relation to the service conditions of the workers under 
Section 12
 read

with 
Section 18(3)
 of the ID Act or by another award following the termination of the

awards which are in operation. The judgment of this Court concluded that:


     (i) The Tulpule and Jamdar Awards continue to remain operative;


 
(ii) The Awards do not stand substituted by the interim order of this court dated 1

        March 1989 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra);




     (iii) The orders of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra) and G Sudhakar (supra)

        would not stand in the way of an adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal; and


     (iv) Unless the awards are substituted either by another award or settlement, the

        Tulpule and Jamdar Awards continue to remain operative and binding.



52      On this basis, the Court concluded that the Srivastav Award was legal and

valid and shall be implemented by LIC by absorption of the workers concerned in

permanent posts. The operative direction which was issued by this Court is

extracted below:





                                           62


                                                                              PART H

             “54. It is needless to mention that since we are of the view
             that the award passed by CGIT in ID No. 27 of 1991 is legal
             and valid, it shall be restored and implemented by the
             Corporation by absorbing the workmen concerned in the
             permanent posts and if they have attained the age of
             superannuation, the Corporation will be liable to pay all
             consequential benefits including the monetary benefits taking
             into consideration the pay scale and revised pay scale from
             time to time by the Corporation.”




53    None of the Counsel appearing on behalf of the workers in the present batch

of cases disputed the factual position, asserted on behalf of LIC, that the judgment

of the two-judge Bench in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra)

affirming the validity of the Srivastav Award contains no reference whatsoever to the

final order dated 7 February 1996 in the batch of civil appeals arising from the

Tulpule and Jamdar Awards in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra).
 
The interim order

dated 1 March 1989 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra), which forms the basis of the

judgment in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra), was passed in the

backdrop of a compromise which was arrived between LIC and eight out of the nine

Unions and Associations representing the workers. Since the appeals were pending

at that stage, the Court granted liberty to the parties to the compromise to implement

its terms as an interim measure, without prejudice to the contentions of the ninth

Union which had not entered into the compromise.
 
But noticeably, there is a clear

omission on the part of the Court in 
TN Terminated Employees Association


(supra) to refer to the admitted position that subsequently on 7 February 1996, this

Court in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra) accepted the submission of LIC that since

eight out of the nine unions (representing nearly 99 per cent of the workers in Class



                                              63

                                                                               PART H

III and Class IV posts) had accepted the compromise, there was no justification for

the ninth Union to object. The Court held that it would be in the interest of industrial

peace that the ninth Union should also fall in line and act on the terms of the

compromise.
 
The civil appeals in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra) were disposed of in

terms of the above order dated 7 February 1996. The terms of compromise clearly

envisaged that the management and the workers had agreed that the awards of the

NIT dated 17 April 1986 (Tulpule Award) and 26 August 1988 (Jamdar Award) “be

substituted by the terms and conditions of compromise in relation to the question of

regular employment of the workmen concerned in the said references”.
 
Once the

awards were substituted by the terms of compromise, it would be an impermissible

interpretation of law to hold that the awards continued to be operative and binding,

notwithstanding the final order of this Court dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their

Workmen
 (supra).
 
The final order dated 7 February 1996 has not been adverted to

by the two-judge Bench in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra). The

factual finding is based only on the interim order dated 1 March 1989.
 
The final order

dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra) had a crucial bearing on

the special leave petitions arising from the judgment of the Delhi High Court setting

aside the Srivastav Award.






54    That having been said, it is necessary to also advert to the interpretation

which was placed on the decisions of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra) and 
G

Sudhakar
 (supra).
 
The two-judge Bench in 
TN Terminated Employees

Association
 (supra) opined that the scheme which was framed in E Prabavathy



                                          64

                                                                               PART H

(supra) was the outcome of an order which was passed in writ petitions filed by the

workers and not in the course of the adjudication of an industrial dispute.
 On this

ground, the Court held that the decision in E Prabavathy (supra) would not come in

the way of an adjudication by the CGIT or NIT while deciding a reference under


Section 10
 of the ID Act. The background of the decision in E Prabavathy (supra)

has already been noticed earlier. The decision was rendered on 23 October 1992 in

a batch of civil appeals which was being considered by a three-judge Bench. During

the pendency of the civil appeals, the Court called upon LIC to formulate a scheme

for the regularisation of workers who had been granted ad hoc employment for at

least 85 days from time to time. The three-judge Bench held, after assessing the

terms of the scheme proposed by LIC, that it was reasonable and commended itself

for acceptance. The scheme proposed by LIC was approved by this Court with a

specific observation that the clauses of the scheme extracted in the order would

form a part of the order of this Court. 
The decision of three Judges in E Prabavathy

(supra) was thereafter interpreted by a two-judge Bench in its order dated 22

November 2001 in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra).
 Noticing that the scheme which has been

accepted in E Prabavathy (supra) governed workers of the Tamil Nadu Division of

LIC, the Court held that the scheme would be equally applicable to the workers of all

divisions of LIC in the country. The Court therefore held that it was not necessary to

evolve a fresh scheme for a different group of workers, in that case under the

directions of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. As a matter of fact, it is also material to

note that in paragraph 75 of the Srivastav Award itself there was a specific finding

that though the E Prabavathy group of workers had been impleaded in the reference


                                          65

                                                                               PART H

and had filed a statement of the claim, having regard to the fact that the order of this

Court dated 23 October 1992 was between the same parties, the workers had no

valid ground to challenge the legality of this Court’s order before the tribunal.


Despite the clear observations in the Srivastav Award, the judgment of the two-judge

Bench in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) has come to the

conclusion that the order of the three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) would

not preclude an industrial adjudication by the tribunal.
 
The two-judge Bench which

delivered the judgment in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) was

bound by the order in E Prabavathy (supra), which was of a larger Bench of three

judges, and the interpretation which was placed on it by another two-judge Bench in


G Sudhakar
 (supra). If the two-judge Bench differed, it had to refer the matter to a

larger Bench but it was not at liberty to take a final view at variance with binding

decisions of a larger Bench and of a co-ordinate Bench.


55    A plea has been urged on behalf of the workers that the judgment in 
TN

Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) has attained finality following the

dismissal of the review petition on 9 August 2016 (save for the modification by which

the quantum of back-wages was reduced to fifty per cent) and the subsequent

dismissal of a curative petition.
 
We are cognizant that the ground, submitting that the

decision ignored the final order dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen


(supra), was specifically pleaded in review. The only observation in the judgment in

review is that LIC has not submitted anything on record to indicate that the judgment





                                          66

                                                                                 PART H

suffers from an error apparent in law. However, having regard to the immense

financial burden, the quantum of back-wages would be reduced to fifty per cent.


56    Now, there cannot be any dispute over the principle that the judgment in 
TN

Terminated Employees Association
 (supra), followed by the order in review dated

9 August 2016, are between the present parties and finality has attached to them.

LIC is, however, before this Court urging that as a statutory entity with a nationwide

presence, it is faced with a situation involving conflicting directions of this Court.
 
LIC

has submitted that while on the one hand, the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards were

substituted by the terms of compromise on 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their

Workmen
 (supra), this was preceded by the order dated 23 October 1992 of a

three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) which accepted the scheme of

absorption proposed by LIC and followed by the order dated 28 November 2001 of a

two-judge Bench in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra) which interpreted the decision in E

Prabavathy (supra) as being applicable to all divisions of LIC.
 
The impact of the

judgment in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) is to substitute and

supplant the schemes which were evolved before this Court for providing absorption

on specified terms. The essence of the schemes which were accepted by this Court

was that those temporary, badli and part-time workers who fulfilled the requirement

of the threshold period of service would be eligible to be considered for the grant of

the permanency, subject to certain conditions. The orders passed by this Court

envisage that these workers would be considered for the grant of permanency in the

course of a recruitment process.
 
The impact of the judgment of the two-judge Bench

                                                                             PART H

in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) is that while on the one hand

the Court’s orders dated 23 October 1992, 7 February 1996 and 22 November 2001

continued to hold the field, on the other hand the restoration of the Srivastav Award

brings in place a regime in conflict with what has been accepted by this Court in

these orders.
 
Faced with this predicament, it is necessary for this Court to step in

and to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice caused by the decision in 
TN

Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) which has been urged to be per

incuriam. The consequence of not doing so is serious.


57    The Court is now confronted with claims on behalf of the workers that the

principle which has been enunciated in the Srivastav Award and which has been

restored by the two-judge Bench in 
TN Terminated Employees Association


(supra) must apply to all workers subsequently engaged by applying 
Section

18(3)(d)
 read with 
Section 17A
 of the ID Act.
 
Hence, a balance will now have to be

drawn by this Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under 
Article 142
 of the

Constitution, which while on the one hand factors in the finality which has attached

to the judgment in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) but on the

other hand also factors in the essential concerns which have been expressed before

this Court by LIC. The formula of providing absorption to part-time, badli or

temporary workers who have put in 85 days in any two calendar years in a Class III

post or 70 days in any three calendar years in a Class IV post will, unless a balance

were to be drawn, become an avenue for disregarding the need for an open and

transparent process of recruitment by a public sector corporation governed by the



                                         68

                                                                                   PART I

rule of law and the mandate of 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution. The judgments

of this Court, in the context of public employment, lay stress on providing equality of

opportunity. As we have recorded earlier in the course of the statements of facts,

LIC had been restrained, due to the interim orders which were passed in the course

of the various proceedings, from taking recourse to recruitment through the open

market. LIC having been restrained by judicial orders from pursuing an open

recruitment process, the situation which has now arisen is that unless a balance

were to be drawn, absorption of part-time and badli workers would become a

substitute for a recruitment process based on sanctioned posts, consistent with the

principles of reservation and pursued on the basis of a structured recruitment which

gives equal opportunities to all applicants. Such a consequence is a serious

detriment to constitutional parameters and to the duty of LIC as a public employer to

follow a process which is fair and in consonance with 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the

Constitution. An open and competitive process for recruitment will enable LIC to

recruit the best among the available talent. Substituting this by a back-door entry will

be detrimental to the interests of the corporation which is governed by statute.




I     Validity of the verification in the Dogra Report


58    Mr ANS Nadkarni, Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of LIC, assailed the

Dogra Report on the ground that the remit before the CGIT was only to verify and

not to adjudicate.
 
There is no doubt about the premise that the task which was




                                          69

                                                                                   PART I

entrusted to CGIT by the order of this Court dated 7 September 2018 in the

contempt proceedings arising out of the review of 
TN Terminated Employees

Association
 (supra) was of verification. But it becomes necessary to consider

whether the remit to the CGIT was only confined to the certified list of workers in the

industrial reference. It is true that by the order of this Court dated 10 September

2018, the CGIT was directed to verify the list on the record. However, an isolated

sentence in the order of this Court cannot be read torn from its context. Paragraph

94 of the Srivastav Award required LIC to also consider the case of those workers

who belonged to the temporary, badli and part-time category, who had completed

the qualified period of working and were suitable in every respect but whose

services had been terminated. LIC was directed to publish a notice in the daily

newspapers so as to enable such workers to lodge their claims for absorption. LIC

issued a public notice in the newspapers on 21 July 2015. Each applicant was

required to submit a form for being considered for absorption, of which item 10(b)

required a disclosure of the details of the petition before the CGIT including whether

the applicant was a petitioner in the industrial reference. The crucial aspect,

however, is that the verification which was carried out by the CGIT was not

specifically restricted to the certified list of workers. The judgment of this Court in the

course of the proceedings in review, records the following submissions being made

on behalf of LIC:




              “6. The learned Attorney General further submits that as on
              31-3-2015, LIC had 55, 427 Class III employees and 5190
              Class IV employees. If LIC is directed to consider the
              absorption of the workmen to the advertisement, then the



                                             70

                                                                                                PART I

                      number of Class III employees will increase by 11.14% and
                      Class IV employees by 56.65% and the same will affect the
                      employee's ratio in addition to the increase in its financial
                      burden and that the same will be contrary to the interests of
                      the policy-holders. The learned Attorney General estimates
                      the financial liability for implementing the order of this Court at
                      approximately Rs 7087 crores, with the annual liability at
                      around Rs 728 crores per year and that this will be a huge
                      financial burden for LIC to bear.”



       The above submission indicates that if LIC were directed to consider the absorption

       of the workers pursuant to the advertisement, the strength of the Class III employees

       would increase by 11.1 per cent and Class IV employees by 56.65 per cent,

       resulting in an annual financial liability of Rs 728 crores. Hence, there is merit in the

       contention of the Counsel for the workers that the above submission, which is

       recorded in paragraph 6 of the judgment in review, does not comport with LIC’s

       present stance that the verification was to be confined only to the certified list.


       59     This having been said, it is evident that the Dogra Report suffers from clear

       and manifest errors. As we have already noted earlier, LIC had drawn the attention

       of the Presiding Officer to the fact that the claims which had been submitted by the

       Unions, Associations and individual workers during the course of the verification

       contained duplicate entries. LIC has produced a chart containing details of various

       workers and claimants. For convenience of reference, the chart is extracted below:

        60       The Dogra Report eventually concludes that the group of workers, who are

        governed by the order of this Court in E Prabavathy (supra), would also be eligible

        for absorption. By considering the workers who are governed by the order in E

        Prabavathy (supra) to be eligible for absorption, the Dogra Report has fallen into a

        clear error. The report has considered those workers who were clearly outside the

        ambit of its remit since they were governed by a specific order of this Court. That

        apart, it is evident that the Dogra Report has proceeded on a generalised

        assumption that a majority of workers had produced documents are eligible for

        absorption (having drawn a negative inference from LIC’s non-production of

        documents). In this backdrop, it would be necessary to bring about a proper

        verification before the claims of the workers can be truly considered. The deficiency

        of the Dogra Report in carrying out a proper verification stands clearly established.

J     The Interplay between the 
Industrial Disputes Act
 1947 and 
Section

48
 of the LIC Act 1956


61    
Section 48
 of the LIC Act confers a rule making power on the Central

Government. Clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) of Section 48 was introduced by Act 1 of

1981 with effect from 31 January 1981. Under clause (cc), the Central Government

is empowered to frame rules dealing with the following matters:


            “(cc) the terms and conditions of service of the employees
            of the Corporation, including those who became employees of
            the Corporation on the appointed day under this Act;”




62    Simultaneously by the 
Amending Act
, sub-Sections (2A), (2B) and (2C) were

introduced into Section 48. These Sections provide as follows:


            “(2A) The regulations and other provisions as in force
            immediately before the commencement of the 
Life Insurance
            Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1981
, with respect to the
            terms and conditions of service of employees and agents of
            the Corporation including those who became employees and
            agents of the Corporation on the appointed day under this
            Act, shall be deemed to be rules made under clause (cc) of
            sub-section (2) and shall, subject to the other provisions of
            this section, have effect accordingly.



            (2B) The power to make rules conferred by clause (cc) of
            sub-section (2) shall include-



            (i)    The power to give retrospective effect to such rules;

            and


            (ii)    The power to amend by way of addition, variation or
            repeal, the regulations and other provisions referred to in sub-
            section (2A), with retrospective effect, from a date not earlier
            than the twentieth day of June, 1979.



 
(2C) The provisions of clause (cc) of sub-section (2) and sub-
            section (2B) and any rules made under the said clause (cc)



                                              74

                                                                               PART J

             shall have effect, and any such rule made with retrospective
             effect from any date shall also be deemed to have had effect
             from that date, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order
             of any court, tribunal or other authority and notwithstanding
             anything contained in the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
 (14 of
             1947), or any other law or any agreement, settlement, award
             or other instrument for the time being in force.”



63    By virtue of sub-Section (2A), the regulations governing the terms and

conditions of service of the employees and agents of LIC which were in force

immediately before 
Amending Act
 1 of 1981, are deemed to be rules made under

clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) and have effect subject to the other provisions of the

Section. By a deeming fiction of law, the regulations which were in existence on the

date of the 
Amending Act
 in relation to the terms and conditions of service are given

the status of rules framed under clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) of Section 48. The

effect of sub-Section (2C) is that the provision of clause (cc) of sub-Section (2) and

any rules made under it with retrospective effect, shall also be deemed to have had

effect from that date notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court,

tribunal or other authority and notwithstanding anything contained in the 
ID Act
, or in

any other law or any agreement, settlement, award or other instrument for the time

being in force. The rules which are framed under Section 48(2)(cc) operate with a

non-obstante clause which prevails, inter alia, notwithstanding anything contained in

the 
ID Act
. The vires of the 
Amending Act
 was upheld in a judgment of a three-judge

Bench of this Court in 
A V Nachane
 (supra). Justice A C Gupta, speaking for

himself and Justice R S Pathak (as the learned Chief Justice then was), repelled the

challenge to the validity of the 
Amending Act
 based on 
Article 14
 of the Constitution.



                                              75

                                                                               PART J

The Court also rejected the submission that sub-Section (2C), which was introduced

into Section 48 by the 
Amending Act
, suffered from the vice of excessive delegation.

While upholding the 
Amending Act
, the Court held:




            “8. The contention that 
Article 14
 is infringed arises on the
            provision of sub-section (2-C) of Section 48 that any rule
            made under clause (cc) of sub-section (2) of that section
            touching the terms and conditions of service of the employees
            of the Corporation shall have effect notwithstanding anything
            contained in the 
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
. It is true that
            after rules are made regarding the terms and conditions of
            service, the right to raise an industrial dispute in respect of
            matters dealt with by the rules will be taken away and to that
            extent the provisions of the 
Industrial Disputes Act
 will cease
            to be applicable. It was argued that there was no basis on
            which the employees of the Corporation could be said to form
            a separate class for denying to them the protection of the
            
Industrial Disputes Act
. The reply on behalf of the Union of
            India and the Life Insurance Corporation was that the
            remuneration that was being paid to Class III and Class IV
            employees of the Corporation was far in excess of what was
            paid to similarly situated employees in other establishments in
            the public sector. Some material was also furnished to
            support this claim though that were certainly not conclusive.
            The need for amending the 
Life Insurance Corporation Act,
            1956
 as appearing from the preamble of the Amendment Act
            and the Ordinance is as follows: “... for securing the interests
            of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and its policy-
            holders and to control the cost of administration, it is
            necessary that revision of the terms and conditions of service
            applicable to the employees and agents of the Corporation
            should be undertaken expeditiously.” Referring to the
            preamble of the Act the Attorney-General appearing for the
            Union of India and the Corporation submitted that the problem
            of mounting cost of administration led to the making of the
            impugned law. He added that it was felt that no improvement
            in the situation was possible by the process of adjudication
            and a policy decision was taken that in the circumstances the
            proper course was legislation and that is why the Amendment
            Act was passed and the impugned Rules were framed. The
            learned Attorney-General submitted that it was for Parliament
            to decide whether the situation was remediable by
            adjudication or required legislation. According to him the Life

                                                                                   PART J

                  Insurance Corporation Act as amended and the Rules made
                  after amendment placed the Corporation in the same position
                  as other undertakings, that the advantages being enjoyed by
                  the employees of the Corporation which were not available to
                  similarly situated employees of other undertakings have been
                  taken away removing what he described as discrimination in
                  favour of the employees of the Life Insurance Corporation.
                  We have already said that the material produced on behalf of
                  the Union of India and the Corporation to show that the terms
                  and conditions of service of the employees in several other
                  undertakings in the public sector compared unfavourably to
                  those of the Corporation employees was not conclusive. 
But
                  the burden of establishing hostile discrimination was on the
                  petitioners who challenged the Amendment Act and the
                  Rules. It was for them to show that the employees of the Life
                  Insurance Corporation and the employees of the other
                  establishments to whom the provisions of the 
Industrial
                  Disputes Act
 were applicable were similarly circumstanced to
                  justify the contention that by excluding the employees of the
                  Corporation from the purview of the 
Industrial Disputes Act

                  they had been discriminated against. There is no material
                  before us on the basis of which we can hold that the
                  Amendment Act of 1981 and the Rules made on February 2,
                  1981 infringe 
Article 14.
 We do not think that on the facts of
                  this case 
Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd. v. Union of
                  India
 [AIR 1958 SC 578 : 1959 SCR 12 : (
1961) 1 LLJ 339] ,
                  and Moti Ram Deka v. General Manager
 [AIR 1964 SC 600 :


                  (1964) 5 SCR 683 : (1964) 2 LLJ 467] relied on by the
                  petitioners, have any application.”




64        The Court, however, held that Rule 3 of the Life Insurance Corporation of

India Class III and Class IV Employees (Bonus and Dearness Allowance) Rules

1981 37 could not nullify the effect of a writ issued by this Court in its earlier decision

in 
LIC v. D.J. Bahadur
 38, which directed LIC to give effect to the industrial

settlement relating to bonus until superseded by a fresh settlement, award or

legislation. Holding that the 
Amending Act
 of 1981 and the Bonus Rules were


37

     “Bonus Rules”

38

     (1981) 1 SCC 315


                                                   77

                                                                                 PART J

relevant legislation, the Court held that these would operative prospectively from the

date of the publication of the rules. There was also a concurring opinion of Justice O

Chinappa Reddy. While dealing with the constitutional validity under 
Article 14
, the

main judgment notes that after rules are made regarding the terms and conditions of

service, the right to raise an industrial dispute in respect of matters dealt with by the

rules is taken away and to that extent the provisions of the 
ID Act
 will cease to be

applicable.






65    In the subsequent decision of another Bench of three-judges of this Court in


M Venugopal
 (supra), the impact of the 
Amending Act
 of 1981 on the application of

the 
ID Act
 came up for consideration. The services of the appellant, who was a

probationary Development Officer in LIC, were terminated on his failure to fulfil the

targets assigned. A writ petition challenging the termination was allowed by a Single

Judge of the High Court on the ground that the termination amounted to a

retrenchment within the meaning of 
Section 2(oo)
 of the ID Act, and that the

termination was void due to the failure to comply with 
Section 25F
. In appeal, the

Division Bench held that as a result of clause (bb) which was introduced in 
Section

2(oo)
 from 18 August 1984, the termination of a probationer would not amount to a

retrenchment within the meaning of 
Section 2(oo)
. 
Regulation 14(2)
 of the Staff

Regulations was, as a consequence of Section 48(2A) as introduced by the


Amending Act
, deemed to be rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc). Clause (4) of


Regulation 14
 permitted LIC to discharge an employee during the period of

probation. Before the introduction of clause (bb) in 
Section 2(oo)
 of the ID Act, there



                                           78

                                                                               PART J

were only three exceptions which excluded a termination of service from the ambit of

retrenchment, namely:






     (i) Voluntary retirement;



     (ii) Retirement on superannuation; and


     (iii) Termination due to continued ill-health.


After the introduction of clause (bb), Parliament excluded from the purview of

retrenchment, in addition, the following:





     (i) Termination as a result of the non-renewal of a contract of employment upon

        its expiry; and


     (ii) Termination of a contract under a stipulation in that behalf contained in the

        contract of employment.



It was held that in this case the termination of the services of the probationer was in

terms of the contract of an employment in terms of the stipulation contained in


Regulation 14
, and hence non-compliance with 
Section 25F
 would not vitiate the

orders of termination.



66      Justice N P Singh, speaking for the three-judge Bench, then went on to

elucidate on the impact of 
Amending Act
 1 of 1981, more particularly the insertion of

clause (cc) into sub-Section (2) and the insertion of sub-Sections (2A), (2B) and (2C)

in Section 48. The Court held that the ID Act and the LIC Act have both been framed

by Parliament, with the amendments introduced from 31 January 1981 in Section 48





                                              79

                                                                               PART J

containing a non-obstante clause in sub-Section (2C) making the intent of

Parliament “apparent and obvious”. The Court held:



            “The framers of the Corporation Act through the amendments
            aforesaid have given the provisions of the Corporation Act an
            overriding effect over the provisions of the 
Industrial Disputes
            Act
, so far as the provisions relating to the terms and
            conditions of employment, which are in conflict with the
            provisions of the 
Industrial Disputes Act
 are concerned.
            Unless the said attempt is held to be ultra vires being in
            conflict with any of the provisions of the Constitution it was
            open to the Parliament to treat the employees and agents of
            the Corporation as a separate class for purpose of fixing their
            terms and conditions of service.”




67    The Court held that earlier the employees were governed by the regulations

framed by LIC under Section 49 as well as by the provisions of the 
ID Act
. Hence, it

was open to the workers to enforce their rights and remedies in terms of the

regulations framed under the 
LIC Act
 or in accordance with the provisions of 
ID Act
.

However, after the amendments which were introduced by Parliament in Section 48,

the employees of LIC would not be entitled to the protection of the 
ID Act
 to which

they were entitled before the enforcement of the amendment. The Court held that

the validity of the amendment had been upheld in the earlier decision in 
A V

Nachane
 (supra), and concluded:




            “14. The amendments introduced in Section 48 of the
            Corporation Act have clearly excluded the provisions of the
            
Industrial Disputes Act
 so far as they are in conflict with the
            rules framed under Section 48(2)(cc). The result whereof will
            be that termination of the service of the appellant shall not be
            deemed to be a “retrenchment” within the meaning of 
Section
            2(oo)
 even if sub-section (bb) had not been introduced in the
            said section. Once 
Section 2(oo)
 is not attracted, there is no
            question of application of 
Section 25-F
 on the basis of which


                                              80

                                                                              PART J

             the termination of the service of the appellant can be held to
             be invalid. The termination of the service of the appellant
             during the period of probation is in terms of the order of
             appointment read with 
Regulation 14
 of the Regulations,
             which shall be deemed to be now Rules under Section
             48(2)(cc) of the Corporation Act.”




68    Therefore, in view of the amended provisions of Section 48(2A) and (2C), the

termination of the service of the appellant was held not to amount to a retrenchment

even when clause (bb) had not been introduced in 
Section 2(oo)
 of the ID Act. Since


Section 2(oo)
 would anyways not stand attracted where the services of a

probationer were terminated under 
Regulation 14(4)
 of the Staff Regulations which,

deemed to be a part of the rules under Section 48(2)(cc), has an overriding effect

over the 
ID Act
 and would prevail.





69    The above provisions of Section 48 were specifically placed before the two-

judge Bench of this Court, as is evident from a bare reading of the judgment in 
TN

Terminated Employees Association
 (supra). However, the Court declined to go

into the submission based on the provisions of Section 48, holding that the Staff

Regulations provided only two types of employment: (i) Regular; and (ii) Temporary.

The Court held that employment in the capacity of badli/part-time workers was not

provided in the Staff Regulations, and there was no specific nomenclature of that

nature in the Staff Regulations.
 
The decision of the two-judge Bench evidently does

not notice either the judgment in 
A V Nachane
 (supra) or the decision in 
M

Venugopal
 (supra), both of which have been delivered by three-judge Benches.

They are binding precedents and could not have been brushed aside.

70    That apart, it becomes necessary at this stage to advert to the provisions of


Regulation 8
 of the Staff Regulations. 
Regulation 8(1)
 deals with temporary staff and

is prefaced with a non-obstante provision. Clause (1) of 
Regulation 8
 is an enabling

provision empowering LIC to employ staff in Classes III and IV on a temporary basis,

subject to such general or specific directions which may be issued by the

Chairperson from time to time. Clause (2) of 
Regulation 8
 stipulates that no person

who is appointed under 
Regulation 8(1)
 is, only by reason of such appointment, to

be entitled to absorption in the service of LIC or to claim preference for recruitment

to any post. The expression “shall only by reason of such appointment be entitled to

absorption” in this sub-clause (2) is crucial. What the expression postulates is that a

person who is appointed on a temporary basis can nether claim an entitlement to

absorption or a preference in recruitment merely by having been appointed on a

temporary basis. In other words, 
Regulation 8(2)
 does not postulate an absolute bar

to a claim for absorption but it stipulates that absorption cannot be claimed merely

on the ground that a person was engaged on a temporary basis. 
Regulation 8(2)
, for

instance, will not preclude a claim for absorption being made in terms of a scheme

which is propounded by LIC, so long as the scheme contains provisions which

facilitate absorption on stipulated terms and conditions. But the mere fact that a

person is appointed in a temporary capacity by LIC, does not entitle such a person

ipso jure to seek absorption merely by virtue of or only by reason of such an

appointment.

71    The impact of the provisions of clause (cc) of sub-Section (2), sub-Section

(2A) and sub-Section (2C) of Section 48 on the clams of the workers appointed after

4 March 1991 must now be considered. The workers who have worked as

temporary, badli or part-time workers after 4 March 1991, seek to assert their claims

on the basis of 
Section 18(3)(d)
 of the ID Act. 
Section 18
 specifies the person on

whom settlements and awards are binding. 
Section 18(3)(a)
 stipulates that a

settlement or award would bind all the parties to the industrial dispute. Further,

clause (d) specifies that where a party to the dispute is composed of workers, the

settlement and award binds not only persons who are employed in the

establishment to which the dispute relates on the date of the dispute but all persons

who subsequently become employees in that establishment or a part of it. 
Section

18(3)(d)
, in other words, extends the applicability of a settlement or award beyond

the workers who were engaged on the date of the dispute to all persons who

subsequently become employees in the establishment. 
Regulation 8
 of the Staff

Regulation expressly permits the engagement of temporary workers and clause (2)

contains a provision to the effect that a person who engaged under its clause (1)

shall not, only by reason of such appointment, be entitled to absorption or to claim a

preference for recruitment on any post. The effect of sub-Section (2A) of Section 48

is that 
Regulation 8
 is deemed to be a rule which is framed under clause (cc) of sub-

Section (2) of Section 48. Moreover, the provisions of Section 48(2C) postulate that

a rule which is made under the clause shall have effect notwithstanding anything

contained in the 
ID Act
. Hence, the workers who have been recruited post 4 March

1991 cannot make a claim for absorption ipso jure under 
Section 18(3)(d)
 of the ID

, as a result of the overriding provision which is contained in sub-Section (2C) of

Section 48.





K      Structuring the Relief


72     For the reasons recorded above during the course of analysis, LIC as a


statutory corporation is bound by the mandate of 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the

Constitution. As a public employer, the recruitment process of the corporation must

meet the constitutional standard of a fair and open process. Allowing for back-door

entries into service is an anathema to public service.


73     In structuring the relief in present proceedings, it is essential to recapitulate

the key legal findings that will govern the determination of rights and equities:



 
(i) On 7 February 1996, a two-judge Bench of this Court in 
LIC v. Their

       Workmen
 (supra) had accepted the terms of compromise which was arrived

       at on 1 March 1989 between the management of LIC and eight Unions, and

       imposed them upon the ninth Union as well. In addition, the two-judge Bench

       of this Court had issued certain directions:


       (a) LIC should exempt Class IV workers from a test and interview, if the

          management has the power to do so under the regulations/instructions

          governing their conditions of service; and


       (b) In the event that the management of LIC does not possess such a power,

          the test to be prescribed for these workers would be of a lesser standard


                                           84

                                                                           PART K

      compared to other applicants from the open market till the next regular

      recruitment;



(ii) On 23 October 1992, a three-judge Bench of this Court, while disposing of the

   civil appeals in E Prabavathy (supra), specifically accepted the scheme

   formulated by LIC for regularising the workers who were engaged on a

   temporary basis. The scheme was also specifically incorporated as a part of

   the order in the following terms:



         “(a) All those temporary employees who have worked for 85
         days in any two consecutive calendar years with the Life
         Insurance Corporation between 20th May 1985 uptil date and
         who confirmed to tehe required eligibility criteria for regular
         recruitment on the dates of their initial temporary appointment
         will be permitted to complete for the next regular recruitment
         to be made by the Life Insurance Corporation after the regular
         recruitment for these posts currently scheduled for November,
         1992.



         (b) These candidates will be considered on their merits with
         all other candidates who may apply for such appointments,
         including those from the open market.



         (c) These candidates will be given an age relaxation for
         applying for regular recruitment provided that they were
         eligible on the date of their first temporary appointment for
         securing regular appointment with the Life Insurance
         Corporation.



         (d)      If these candidates are otherwise eligible, they can
         apply for regular recruitment in the normal course. This
         regularisation will, in the circumstances, be by selection for
         appointment. We make the above clauses of the scheme as
         part of our order.”



   The three-judge Bench in E Prabavathy (supra) held that the scheme

   proposed by LIC is reasonable and that: (a) the regularisation will be by



                                           85

                                                                           PART K

   selection for appointment; and (b) the above clauses of the scheme would

   constitute a part of the order of this Court;



(iii) On 22 November 2001, a two-judge Bench of this Court in 
G Sudhakar


   (supra) directed that though the order dated 23 October 1992 in E

   Prabavathy (supra) applied to the workers of the Tamil Nadu division, the

   scheme would equally be applicable to the workers of all divisions of LIC in

   the country;




(iv) The judgment of the two-judge Bench of this Court dated 8 March 2015 in 
TN

   Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) failed to notice that as a result

   of the final order dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their Workmen
 (supra),

   the Tulpule and Jamdar Awards had been substituted by the terms of

   compromise.
 The two-judge Bench of this Court overlooked the final order

   dated 7 February 1996 in LIC v. Their Workmen (supra) and while adverting

   only to the interim order dated 1 March 1989, it arrived at a palpably

   erroneous conclusion that the Jamdar and Tulpule Awards were still operative

   and binding; and


(v) Though the petition seeking review of 
TN Terminated Employees

   Association
 (supra) and the curative petition stand dismissed, LIC is

   confronted with a situation in which it is equally bound by the earlier decision

   of the three-judge Bench dated 23 October 1992 in E Prabavathy (supra), the

   judgment of the two-judge Bench dated 7 February 1996 in 
LIC v. Their

   Workmen
 (supra) dealing with the appeals arising out of the Tulpule and




                                        86

                                                                                    PART K

        Jamdar Awards and the judgment of the two-judge Bench dated 22 November

        2001 in 
G Sudhakar
 (supra).






74      The position as it now stands, results in a palpable conflict between the two-

judge Bench decision in 
TN Terminated Employees Association
 (supra) dated 18

March 2015 on the one hand and the earlier binding decision of a larger Bench in E

Prabavathy (supra) on 23 October 1992 and of subsequent Benches. This conflict

must be harmonised by taking recourse to the jurisdiction of this Court under 
Article

142
 of the Constitution. In arriving at a conclusion, this Court finds that:


     (i) The remit of the CGIT which resulted in the Dogra Report was confined to the

        process of verification, as distinct from an adjudication of rights and liabilities;


     (ii) The Dogra Report is flawed because:



        (a) The report failed to carry out an accurate verification of only those Class III

           workers who had put in at least 85 days of work in a period of two years

           and Class IV workers who had put in 70 days of work in a period of three

           years;



        (b) The lists which are appended to the report contain patent inconsistencies

           and errors as a consequence of a failure to carry out an adequate

           verification; and


        (c) The report accepted the claims for absorption of those workers who were

           specifically governed by the decision of this Court in E Prabavathy

           (supra), in spite of an express stipulation to the contrary in the order of this





                                             87

                                                                                  PART K

               Court dated 23 October 1992 as well as in paragraph 75 of the Srivastav

               Award;



      (iii) A public employer such as LIC cannot be directed to carry out a mass

          absorption of over 11,000 workers on such flawed premises without following

          a recruitment process which is consistent with the principles of equality of

          opportunity governed by 
Articles 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution. Such an

          absorption would provide the very back-door entry, which negates the

          principle of equal opportunity and fairness in public employment, which has

          been specifically decried by this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka v.



          Umadevi 39.




75        The dispute is now of an antiquity tracing back to nearly four decades. Finality

has to be wrung down on the dispute to avoid uncertainty and more litigation. Nearly

thirty-one years have elapsed since 1991. We have come to the conclusion that the

claims of those workers who are duly found upon verification to meet the threshold

conditions of eligibility should be resolved by the award of monetary compensation

in lieu of absorption, and in full and final settlement of all claims and demands. Thus,

this Court directs the following:





      (i) A fresh verification of the claims of workers who claim to have been employed

          for at least 70 days in Class IV posts over a period of three years or 85 days

          in Class III posts over a period of two years shall be carried out;

(ii) The verification shall be confined to persons who were working between 20

   May 1985 and 4 March 1991;



(iii) All persons who are found to be eligible on the above norm shall be entitled to

   compensation computed at the rate of Rs 50,000 for every year of service or

   part thereof. The payment of compensation at the above rate shall be in lieu

   of reinstatement, and in full and final settlement of all claims and demands of

   the workers in lieu of regularisation or absorption and notwithstanding the

   directions issued by this Court in 
TN Terminated Employees Association


   (supra);




(iv) In carrying out the process of verification, the Committee appointed by this

   Court shall not be confined to the certified list before the CGIT and shall

   consider the claims of all workers who were engaged between 20 May 1985

   and 4 March 1991;



(v) For the purpose of verification, LIC shall make available all the records at the

   Divisional level to the Committee appointed by this Court;


(vi) It will be open to the workers concerned or, as the case may be, the Unions

   and Associations representing them, to make available such documentary

   material in their possession for the purpose of verification;


(vii) The process of verification shall be carried out independently without regard

   to the Dogra Report, which is held to be flawed;


(viii) The payment of compensation in lieu of reinstatement shall be effected by

   LIC within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the report of

   verification by the Committee; and


                                        89

     (ix) The task of verification shall be carried out by a Committee consisting of:


        (a) Mr Justice P K S Baghel, former Judge of the Allahabad High Court; and


        (b) Shri Rajiv Sharma, former District Judge and member of the UPHJS.



LIC shall provide all logistical assistance to the Committee and bear all expenses,

including secretarial expenses, travel and incidental expenses, as well as the fees

payable to the members of the Committee. Justice P K S Baghel shall fix the terms

of remuneration payable to the members of the Committee.


76      The Miscellaneous Applications and the Writ Petitions shall be governed by

the above directions and are disposed of in the above terms.


77      Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
