       ORAL ORDER :


       1.      This is a petition for enforcement and execution of the foreign

       award filed under 
Section 47
, 
48
 and 
49
 of the Arbitration and

       Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, "the 
Arbitration Act
"). The

       respondents have raised a preliminary objection contending that the

       petition is barred by limitation. By this order this objection of the

       respondents is being decided.

 2.      The petitioner-original claimant is seeking enforcement of the

 February 2006, an award dated 24 August 2007 being a quantum and

 petition are combined prayers seeking enforcement and execution of the

 arbitral awards which are required to be noted and read thus:-

 3.      There is a prior history of litigation also before the Indian Courts.

 Respondent No.1 on 27 July 2008, had approached this Court by filing

 a petition under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act, challenging the

 awards in question.           This petition was filed after 90 days however

 within the extended period of 30 days as provided under 
Section 34(3)


 of the Arbitration Act. However as the said petition was filed beyond

 the prescribed period of 90 days, a notice of motion was filed by

 respondent No.1 seeking condonation of delay. The petitioner appeared

 as the respondent in the said petition, and opposed the said notice of

 motion as filed by respondent No.1 as also opposed the 
Section 34


 petition. The petitioner contended that each of the foreign award(s)

 was a separate award and even assuming that 
Section 34
 was to apply,

 the awards were required to be challenged within prescribed limitation

 as provided under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act. The petitioner in

 opposing the 
Section 34
 petition also contended that the respondent's

Section 34
 petition was per se not maintainable as awards in question

 were foreign awards.





 4.      By an order dated 10 June 2013 this Court condoned the delay as

 also held that it had jurisdiction to entertain 
Section 34
 petition filed by

 the respondents.              The petitioner being aggrieved by these orders

 approached the Supreme Court in a Special Leave Petition.                          By an

 interim order dated 19 November 2013, the Supreme Court stayed the

 proceedings of the respondents 
Section 34
 petition pending before this

 Court. The proceedings before the Supreme Court were decided finally

 by an order dated 10 March 2017 whereby the Supreme Court set aside

 the orders passed by this Court, inter-alia holding that this Court had no

 jurisdiction to entertain the 
Section 34
 petition challenging the foreign

 awards. It is thereafter that this petition under 
Section 47
, 
48
 and 
49
 of

 the Arbitration Act was filed by the petitioner on 2 April 2018 seeking

 enforcement and execution of the foreign award(s) in question.




 5.      At the outset, an objection is raised on behalf of respondent No.1

 to the maintainability of this petition on the ground that the petition is

 time barred considering the provisions of 
Article 137
 under the

 
Schedule to the Limitation Act
.               
Article 137
 is a residuary article

 prescribing period of limitation to be 3 years. The title of the 
Article

 reads as: 'any other application for which no period of limitation is

 provided elsewhere in this division ' and time from which period begins

 to run is provided from when the right to apply accrues. Also 
Article

 136
 is relevant as contended to be applicable on behalf of the petitioner.

 It would be appropriate to note the said 
Articles 136
 and 
137
 which

 reads thus:-

            limitation    is   provided
            elsewhere in this division.





 6.      Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for respondent No.1 would contend

 that the delay on the part of the petitioner is apparent to reach to a

 conclusion that this petition is barred by limitation, in as much as the

 impugned foreign awards are dated 9 February 2006, 24 August 2007

 and 27 March 2008 and this petition has been filed on 2 April 2018. It

 is submitted that the scheme of provisions of 
Sections 46
, 
47
, 
48
 and 
49


 falling under 
Part II of the Act
 is quite clear in as much as unless the

 awards are held to be enforceable by this Court in the proceedings of

 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 of the ACA, the award would not be a decree

 available for execution. The contention is that for the purposes of

 limitation an application/proceedings filed for seeking enforcement of a

 foreign award as per requirement of 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 would be an

 application/proceeding falling under 
Article 137 (supra)
 of the

 
Limitation Act, 1963
.





 7.      Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for respondent No.1 would next

 contend that the limitation, for the petitioners to assail the award,

 started running against the petitioner to file the present 
Section 47
 and





::: Uploaded on - 13/11/2019                        ::: Downloaded on - 14/11/2019 03:04:19 :::

                                    7                                    carbp 414-18

 49 proceedings, immediately after the awards were published.                  It is

 submitted that considering the dates of the award, it cannot be held

 that a petition which was filed almost after about 10 years from the last

 award is within the prescribed period of limitation.              Dr. Saraf in

 supporting this contention would refer to the provisions of Sub-Section

 (3) of 
Section 48
 which according to him categorically provides that

 even if an application is made for setting aside or suspension of a

 foreign award before a competent authority as referred to in clause (e)

 of sub-section (1) of 
Section 48
, the Court may, if it considers proper,

 adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award and may also, on

 the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order

 the other party to give suitable security. It is thus contended that, the

 law recognizes that even after proceedings are filed to challenge the

 foreign awards, there is no impediment for the decree holder to file

 proceedings for enforcement of the award.





 8.      Dr. Saraf would submit that there is no application as filed on

 behalf of the petitioner seeking condonation of delay. It is contended

 that even assuming that the petitioner had wrongly approached this

 Court by filing 
Section 34
 proceedings in the year 2008 and ultimately,

 the issue came to be decided by the Supreme Court on 10 March 2017

 holding that the said proceedings filed by respondent No.1 under

                                       8                                  carbp 414-18

 
Section 34
 were not maintainable, however, the pendency of these

 proceedings can in no manner save the limitation as prescribed under

 
Article 137
 to hold that the proceedings are within the prescribed

 limitation.      This according to Dr.Saraf, for the reason that, seeking

 enforcement of an award is governed by substantive provisions of

 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 of the ACA and the party holding a foreign award

 cannot sleep over its enforcement/decreetal rights as arisen under the

 award and not seek enforcement of the award merely because there are

 proceedings filed by the award debtor assailing the awards even before

 a Court not competent to entertain such proceedings. In this context,

 Dr.Saraf would contend that one important facet which is required to be

 considered is the fact that although the 
Section 34
 petition was filed on

 27 July 2008 by respondent No.1 however till such time the delay on

 the said petition was condoned as per provisions of Sub-section (3) of

 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act on 10 June 2013, it was an obvious

 position that there were no proceedings under 
Section 34
 pending in

 the eyes of law. It is contended that unless the delay was condoned it

 could not have been presumed that a 
Section 34
 petition challenging

 the award could be of any consequence. In other words, Dr.Saraf's

 submission is that the law would recognize the pendency of the 
Section

 34
 petition filed by the respondents only after this Court condoned the

 delay on the said petition, that is, when the Court passed an order on

 respondent No.1's notice of motion on 10 June 2013 condoning the

 delay. It is thus, submitted that for the period from 27 July 2008 (date

 of filing of the 
Section 34
 petition) till 10 June 2013 (date when delay

 was condoned) the 
Section 34
 petition cannot be said to be on the file

 of the Court, to assume that filing of 
Section 34
 petition as per the pre-

 amended (prior to amending Act No.3 of 2016 with effect from 23

 October 2015) was to operate as a stay on the execution of the award.

 In supporting all these contentions Dr.Saraf has placed reliance on the

 decisions of learned Single Judge in Noy Vallesina Engineering Spa v/s.

 Jindal Drugs Limited1, M/s.Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse S.A., 29

 v/s. Sakuma Exports Limited2, Hameed Joharan (Dead) & Ors. vs.

 Abdul Salam (Dead) by LRs. 
& 
Ors.3, Assam Urban Water Supply and

 Sewerage Board Vs. Subash Projects And Marketing Limited4
.


 9.       Per contra Dr.Tulzapurkar, learned Senior Counsel for the

 petitioner would submit that the objection as urged on behalf of

 respondent No.1 of the petition being time barred is not well founded.

 At the outset Dr.Tulzapurkar would submit that the respondent's

 contention of applicability of 
Article 137
 of the 
Limitation Act
 is also not

 correct. This principally for the reason that the foreign award itself is

 the petitioner under 
Sections 47
 and 
48
 of the Arbitration Act are

 required to be considered as proceedings for enforcement and execution

 of the foreign award. This according to Dr.Tulzapurkar is also clear

 from     the     prayers      (supra)    as   made    in    the    present       petition.

 Dr.Tulzapurkar would thus submit that it is not 
Article 137
, but 
Article

 136
 of the 
Limitation Act
 which would be applicable when it comes to

 enforcement and execution of a foreign award under the provisions of

 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 of the ACA.                 
Article 136
 provides inter-alia for

 execution of any decree or order of any Civil Court, and prescribes a

 period of limitation of 12 years from the time when the decree or order

 becomes enforceable.





 
10.     Dr.Tulzapurkar would submit that the statutory scheme qua the

 enforcement of a foreign award, falls in two stages. The first stage is

 recognition of the award for enforcement and post recognition

 execution of the award.              It is submitted that thus enforcement and

 execution in the context of 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 are synonymous.

 Referring to the decision of Supreme Court in 
Thyssen Stahlunion

 GMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd.5
, 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.

 would contend that the Supreme

                                    11                                   carbp 414-18

 Court has categorically held that " the foreign award is already stamped

 as a decree." According to Dr.Tulzapurkar, once a foreign award itself is

 a decree and when the provisions of 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 lay down a

 composite scheme for enforcement and execution of a foreign award,

 for the purposes of limitation, the provisions of 
Article 136
 which

 provide a limitation of 12 years from the date of receipt of the award,

 to file such proceedings, are clearly attracted. Dr.Tulzapurkar would

 submit that there can be no other reading of the statutory scheme of

 
Sections 47
 to 
49
, hence the present petition is within the prescribed

 period of limitation.






 
11.     The second limb of Dr.Tulzapurkar's submission is to contend that

 even assuming that the provisions of 
Article 137
 are applicable, the

 petition is nevertheless within the prescribed limitation. This according

 to Dr.Tulzapurkar is for the reason that once the 
Section 34
 petition as

 filed by respondent No.1 on 27 July 2008 albeit the notice of motion for

 condonation of delay, which came to be allowed on 10 June 2013, the

 pendency of such a petition, as the law stood prior to the Arbitration

 Amendment Act, 2015, itself acted as a stay on the enforcement of the

 award. This submission is being supported by contending that the order

 passed by this Court condoning the delay would relate back to the date

 of filing of 
section 34
 petition.      To make good this submissions,

 Dr.Tulzapurkar has placed reliance on the decision of the Single Judge

 of Delhi High Court in 
Delhi Development Authority Vs. Amita Nand

 Agarwal7
.        It is next submitted that the interim order dated 19

 November 2013 passed by the Supreme Court in the petitioner's SLP

 merely stayed the 
Section 34
 proceedings pending before this Court.

 The effect of this order is not that the 
Section 34
 proceedings stood

 extinguished or were no more on the file of High Court, so as to

 consider that there is no stay to the enforcement of the award as

 brought about by pendency of 
Section 34
 petition as per the prevailing

 law. According to Dr.Tulzapurkar, this stay on the proceedings of the

 
Section 34
 petition continued till 10 March 2017 when the Supreme

 Court set aside the orders passed by the High Court holding that the

 
Section 34
 petition as filed by the respondents was not maintainable.

 Thus according to Dr.Tulzapurkar, the awards in question became

 available for enforcement only after 10 March 2017 and therefore even

 if it is assumed that the provisions of 
Article 137
 of the 
Limitation Act


 are to be applied, the present petition being filed on 2 April 2018 is

 required to be held as maintainable.

 Dr.Tulzapurkar has placed reliance on various decisions namely in

 12.      
In rejoinder Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for respondent No.1 would

 submit that the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner that the

 foreign award has a stamp of a decree is the observation of the Supreme

 Court in 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (supra) in a

 different context.            It is submitted that these observations of the

 Supreme Court are required to be read in the context of erstwhile

 
Arbitration Act (Arbitration Act
 of 1940) under which the Court was

 called upon to pass a decree in terms of the award and which is not the

 position under the present 
Arbitration Act
. It is thus contended that

 necessarily an application under 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 for the purpose of

 limitation would fall under 
Article 137.
 
Dr.Saraf, learned Counsel for

 respondent No.1 in supporting this submission would refer to the

 Sakuma Exports Limited (supra). Dr.Saraf would next contend that

 
Articles 136
 and 
137
 prescribe the time from which period begins to

 run, namely that in case of 
Article 136
 when a decree and order

 becomes enforceable and in case of 
Article 137
 when the right to apply

 accrues. The Court's attention is drawn to 
Articles 116
, 126
 and 
137
 to

 point out that these articles provide for the limitation to start running

 from the date of the decree or order. It is submitted if 
Section 49
 of the

 Arbitration Act is considered, it clearly prescribes that only when the

 Court holds that the foreign award is enforceable under the said

 chapter, the award shall be deemed to be decree of the Court and not

 before that. It is hence submitted that considering this clear position,

 
Article 136
 of the 
Limitation Act
 as contended on behalf of the

 petitioner even otherwise is not applicable.






 13.     Having heard learned Counsel for the parties, the short question

 which has arisen for consideration at this stage of the proceeding is as

 to whether the present petition is filed within the prescribed limitation

 or the petition would be required to be held as time barred.




 14.     Some admitted facts are required to be noted. The three awards

 as sought to be executed by the petitioner are the awards dated 9

 February 2006, 24 August 2007 and the final award dated 27 March

 2008 of the ICC London. It is also not in dispute that the respondents

 approached this Court on 27 July 2008 by filing a petition under

 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act challenging these foreign awards. As

 the 
Section 34
 petition was filed beyond the period of 90 days, however,

 within the extended period of 120 days, a delay condonation

 application (Notice of Motion) No.2560 of 2008 was filed by the

 respondents in the said petition.     By an order dated 10 June 2013

 passed by this Court on the said application filed by the respondents,

 this Court condoned the delay in filing 
Section 34
 petition as also it was

 held that the 
Section 34
 petition although it assailed a foreign award(s)

 was maintainable. The petitioner being aggrieved by the said orders

 passed by this Court, approached the Supreme Court in a Special Leave

 Petition. The Supreme Court by an order dated 19 November 2013

 stayed the proceedings of the 
Section 34
 petition. The Supreme Court

 finally by an order dated 10 March 2017 set aside the orders passed by

 this Court holding that this Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the

 
Section 34
 petition. Thereafter on 2 April 2018 the petitioner filed the

 present petition seeking enforcement and execution of the Award.




 15.     The provisions of the 
Arbitration Act
 would be required to be

 given a broader meaning and the Court would not take a narrow

 pedantic approach, more particularly considering the situation in hand

 when the petitioner has foreign awards in its favour, recognised by the

 foreign court and requiring enforcement and execution. The provisions

 of 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 are required to be applied in a meaningful manner

 which would not defeat the substantive and concluded arbitral

 proceedings        between the parties. It is in this perspective, even the

 submission as urged on behalf of the respondents that the petitioner

 should have filed a delay condonation application, praying for

 condonation of delay in filing this petition for enforcement and

 execution of the award would be required to be considered. This for

 more than one reason. Indisputedly it was the respondents who brought

 about a situation by approaching this Court by filing 
Section 34


 proceedings challenging the awards, although with a delay.                       This

 
Section 34
 petition was filed on 27 July 2008. The delay was condoned

 on 10 June 2013. Although there were already proceedings pending

 before this Court from July 2008 till 10 June 2013 when the delay

 condonation was granted, in the facts of the case it cannot be said that

 the awards were instantly available to the petitioner for enforcement

 and execution inasmuch as there was a situation brought about that

 there were substantive proceedings challenging the award(s) were

 pending before this Court. The fate of the award(s) itself was the

 subject matter of consideration before this Court. The order dated 10

 June 2013 condoning the delay would surely relate back to the date on

 which the petition was filed. Considering the provisions of the

 
Arbitration Act
 prior to its amendment by the 2015 Amendment Act

 (with effect from 23 October 2015), filing of the 
Section 34
 petition

 amounted to stay of the award. The law in this regard is well settled. 
In

 
Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade Private Limited Vs. AMCI (India)

 Private Limited & Anr.
 (supra) the Supreme Court held that until

 disposal of the application under 
Section 34
 of the Arbitration Act, there

 is an implied prohibition on the enforcement of the arbitral award as

 the very filing and pending of an application under 
Section 34
, in effect

 operated as a stay on the enforcement of the award. The Court in

 paragraphs 19 and 20 held thus:-




       "20. 
Section 36
 provides that an award shall be enforced in
       the same manner as if it were a decree of the court, but only
       on the expiry of the time for making an application to set
       aside the arbitral award under 
Section 34
, or such application
       having been made, only after it has been refused.

       20. ..........Until the disposal of the application under 
Section
       34
 of the Act, there is an implied prohibition of enforcement
       of the arbitral award. They very filing and pendency of an
       application under 
Section 34
, in effect, operates as a stay of
       the enforcement of the award."

                                         (emphasis supplied)


 
16.     The order dated 10 June 2013 passed by this Court condoning

 delay in filing 
Section 34
 petition would be required to be taken

 relating back to the day on which 
Section 34
 petition was filed that is it

 would relate back to 27 July 2008.. In this context learned Senior

 Counsel for the petitioner would be correct in relying on the decision of

 the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in 
Delhi Development

 Authority Vs. Amita Nand Aggarwal
 (supra) has observed as under:-


       9. ..... ... ... .... .. In the present case, the objections were filed
       though beyond 90 days but within the priod of 120 days and the
       objections raised by the Registry were also removed within the
       period of two weeks. I consider, since the petition / objections
       under 
Section 34
 of the Act was returned for want of court fees
       and certain technical reasons and the objections raised by the
       Registry were complied with and after rectification, the petition
       was re-filed within a reasonable period, the petition must be
       considered to have been filed on the original date when it was filed
       in the Registry and not on the date when it was re-filed after
       removing objections. .. ... ."                (emphasis supplied)



 17.     Hence, the legal position as had arisen was that with effect from

 27 June 2008, the 
Section 34
 petition as filed by the respondents can be

 said to be pending. Thus even if the petitioners were to file a petition

 within three years after the awards, and before the delay was condoned

 i.e. upto 10 June 2013, nonetheless the petitioners were met with a fate

 of stay of the award(s), and the awards were thus not available for

 enforcement and execution.



 18.     The orders passed by this Court dated 10 June 2013 condoning

 the delay and holding that 
Section 34
 petition is maintainable came to

 be challenged by the petitioner. By an order dated 19 November 2013

 the Supreme Court granted stay to the proceedings of the 
Section 34


 petition and finally on 10 March 2017 the Supreme Court set aside the

 orders passed by this Court holding that 
Section 34
 petition was not

 maintainable before this Court, the award(s) being foreign award(s).

 Thus, it is only after 10 March 2017 the award(s) became available to

 the petitioner to be enforced. In my opinion, it is at this juncture, even

 if 
Article 137
 of the 
Limitation Act
 as being pressed into service on

 behalf of the respondents, is applied and a period of three years is to be

 available to the petitioners to file an enforcement petition, this petition

 which was filed on 2 April 2018 would be required to be held to be filed

 within the limitation of three years as prescribed under 
Article 137
, as

 clear from the above facts. It would be required to be held that the

 substantive cause of action had arisen to the petitioner to file the

 present petition only on 10 March 2017 when the Supreme Court set

 asides the order passed by this Court holding the 
Section 34
 petition to

 be not maintainable.



 19.     The respondents have contended that once a stay was granted by

 the Supreme Court to the proceedings of the 
Section 34
 petition, it

 would bring about a situation of the 
Section 34
 petition not being on

 the file of this Court. This may not be a correct proposition for the

 respondents to urge. 
In this context and considering the facts of the

 case, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would be correct in

 placing reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in                     
Shree

 Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. Vs. Church of South India Trust Association CSI

 Cinod Secretariat, Madras
 (supra) to contend that the stay which was

 granted by the Supreme Court on 19 November 2013 to the

 proceedings of 
Section 34
 petition would not have any effect on the

 
Section 34
 petition to say that the same was not on the file of the Court

 or the 
Section 34
 petition in any manner had come to an end or that

 there was no stay on the enforcement of the award. The Supreme Court

 in paragraph 10 of 
the said decision
 has observed thus:-


                  "... ... ... ... The said stay order of the High Court cannot have the
                  effect of reviving the proceedings which had been disposed of by
                  the Appellate Authority by its order dated January 7, 1991. While
                  considering the effect of an interim order staying the operation of
                  the order under challenge, a distinction has to be made between
                  quashing of an order and stay of operation of an order Quashing
                  of an order results in the restoration of the position as it stood on
                  the date of the passing of the order which has been quashed. The
                  stay of operation of an order does not, however, lead to such a
                  result. It only means that the order which has been stayed would
                  not be operative from the date of the passing of the stay order and
                  it does not mean that the said order has been wiped out from
                  existence."



 20.     Apart from the above discussion now it is well settled that a

 foreign award is stamped as a decree and hence, as a decree it can be

 enforced and be executable in one and the same proceeding. In that

 event 
Article 136
 of the 
Limitation Act
 would surely become applicable

 prescribing a limitation of twelve years from the date when award

 becomes enforceable and/or the award directing payment of money as

 specifically provided, under 
Article 136.
 This particularly, when the

 execution of such award is held to be permissible in the same

 proceedings in two parts/stages.               One on its enforcement and the

 second part being the execution. The law in this context is required to

 be noted.





 21.     
In 
Thyssen Stahlunion GMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd.


 (supra) the issue which fell for consideration of the Supreme Court was

 in respect of the arbitral proceedings which commenced before the

 
Arbitration Act,1996
 (brought into force on 25 January 1996), and the

 award being delivered after the commencement of the 
Arbitration Act


 on 24 September 1997. The issue was whether the provisions of the

 
Arbitration Act,1940
 or 
Arbitration Act,1996
 would become applicable

 in regard to enforcement of the foreign award. It is in this context the

 Court considered as to what is the nature of a foreign award. The

 Supreme Court while observing that there is not much difference

 between enforcement of the foreign award under the Old Act and the

 New Act, held that the only difference is that while under the regime of

 
Arbitration Act,1940
 read with               
Foreign Awards (Recognition and

 Enforcement) Act,1961
,              a decree follows, whereas under the

 
Arbitration Act, 1996
 the foreign award is already stamped as a decree.

 It would be appropriate to note the observations of the Supreme Court

 in paragraph 40 of the decision which reads thus:-


                  As a matter of fact if we examine the provisions of Foreign
                  Awards Act and the new Act there is not much difference for the
                  enforcement of the foreign award. Under the Foreign Awards

                  Act when the court is satisfied that the foreign award is
                  enforceable under that Act the court shall order the award to be
                  filed and shall proceed to pronounce judgment accordingly and
                  upon the judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow.
                  Sections 7 and 8 of the Foreign Awards Act respectively
                  prescribe the conditions for enforcement of a foreign award and
                  the evidence to be produced by the party applying for its
                  enforcement. Definition of foreign award is same in both the

Sections 48
 and

 of the new Act correspond to

 and

 respectively of the Foreign Awards Act. While
                  
Section 49
 of the new Act states that where the court is satisfied
                  that the foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter
                  (Chapter I, Part II, relating to New York Convention Awards)
                  the award is deemed to be decree of that court. The only
                  difference, therefore, appears to be that while under the Foreign
                  Awards Act a decree follows, under the new Act foreign award
                  is already stamped as the decree. Thus if provisions of the
                  Foreign Awards Act and the new Act relating to enforcement of
                  the foreign award arc juxtaposed there would appear to be
                  hardly any difference."

22.     The Supreme Court in 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports

 Ltd.
 (supra) again commented on the nature of a foreign award prior to

 the 
Arbitration Act,1996
 coming into force namely during the regime of

 the erstwhile 
Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act,1961
.

 The Supreme Court again held that under the 
Arbitration Act
 1996, the

 foreign award is already stamped as a decree and the party holding the

 foreign award can apply for enforcement of the award but the Court

 before taking further effective step for execution of the award is

 required to proceed under 
Sections 47
 and 
49
. It is held that in one

 proceeding there may be different stages, the first stage being that the

 Court would be required to decide enforceability of the award, having

                                              23                                    carbp 414-18

 regard to the requirement of the said provisions and thereafter once it is

 decided that the foreign award is enforceable, it is to proceed to take

 further effective steps for execution of such an award. There did not

 arise question of making foreign award a rule of court/decree again. It

 is further observed that if the object and purpose of the provisions of

 
Sections 47
 to 
49
 of the Arbitration Act can be served in the same

 proceedings, there is no need to take two separately proceedings

 resulting into multiplicity of litigation. The observations of the Supreme

 Court in paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 are required to be noted which read

 thus:-




                  "30. Alternatively it was contended that a party holding a
                  foreign award has to file a separate application and produce
                  evidence as contemplated under 
Section 47
 and also satisfy the
                  conditions laid down under 
Section 48
 and it is only after the
                  Court decides about the enforceability of the award, it should be
                  deemed to be a decree under 
Section 49
 as available for
                  execution. In other words, the party must separately apply
                  before filing an application for execution of a foreign award. The
                  Arbitration and Conciliation Ordinance, 1996 was promulgated
                  with the object to consolidate and amend the law relating to
                  domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and
                  enforcement of foreign arbitral award and to define law relating
                  to conciliation and for matters connected therewith or incidental
                  thereto. In para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons
                  contained in the Act, the main objects of the Bill are stated. To
                  the extent relevant for the immediate purpose, they are:

                  "i) to comprehensive cover international commercial arbitration
                  and conciliation as also domestic arbitration and conciliation;

                  (ii) --(iv) *          *              *


                  (v) to minimize the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral
                  process;

                  (vi)     *             *              *

                  vii) to provide that every final arbitral award is enforced in the
                  same manner as if it were a decree of the court;"

                                           24                                      carbp 414-18


                  31.     Prior to the enforcement of the Act, the Law of
                  Arbitration in this country was substantially contained in three
                  enactments namely, (1) 
The Arbitration Act, 1940
, (2) 
The
                  Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937
 and (3) 
The
                  Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961
. A
                  party holding a foreign award was required to take recourse to
                  these enactments. Preamble of the Act makes it abundantly clear
                  that it aims at to consolidate and amend Indian laws relating to
                  domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and
                  enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The object of the Act is
                  to minimize supervisory role of court and to give speedy justice.
                  In this view, the stage of approaching court for making award a
                  rule of court as required in 
Arbitration Act, 1940
 is dispensed
                  with in the present Act. If the argument of the respondent is
                  accepted, one of the objects of the Act will be frustrated and
                  defeated. Under the old Act, after making award and prior to
                  execution, there was a procedure for filing and making an award
                  a rule of court i.e. a decree. Since the object of the act is to
                  provide speedy and alternative solution of the dispute, the same
                  procedure cannot be insisted under the new Act when it is
                  advisedly eliminated. If separate proceedings are to be taken,
                  one for deciding the enforceability of a foreign award and the
                  other thereafter for execution, it would only contribute to
                  protracting the litigation and adding to the sufferings of a
                  litigant in terms of money, time and energy. Avoiding such
                  difficulties is one of the objects of the Act as can be gathered
                  from the scheme of the Act and particularly looking to the
                  provisions contained in 
Sections 46
 to 
49
 in relation to
                  enforcement of foreign award. In para 40 of the Thyssen
                  judgment already extracted above, it is stated that as a matter of
                  fact, there is not much difference between the provisions of the
                  1961 Act and the Act in the matter of enforcement of foreign
                  award. The only difference as found is that while under the
                  Foreign Award Act a decree follows, under the new Act the
                  foreign award is already stamped as the decree. Thus, in our
                  view, a party holding foreign award can apply for enforcement
                  of it but the court before taking further effective steps for the
                  execution of the award has to proceed in accordance with
                  
Sections 47
 to 
49
. In one proceeding there may be different
                  stages. In the first stage the Court may have to decide about the
                  enforceability of the award having regard to the requirement of
                  the said provisions. Once the court decides that foreign award is
                  enforceable, it can proceed to take further effective steps for
                  execution of the same. There arises no question of making
                  foreign award as a rule of court/decree again. If the object and
                  purpose can be served in the same proceedings, in our view,
                  there is no need to take two separate proceedings resulting in
                  multiplicity of litigation. It is also clear from objectives
                  contained in para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons,
                  
Sections 47
 to 
49
 and Scheme of the Act that every final arbitral

                                            25                                      carbp 414-18

                  award is to be enforced as if it were a decree of the court. The
                  submission that the execution petition could not be permitted to
                  convert as an application under 
Section 47
 is technical and is of
                  no consequence in the view we have taken. In our opinion, for
                  enforcement of foreign award there is no need to take separate
                  proceedings, one for deciding the enforceability of the award to
                  make rule of the court or decree and the other to take up
                  execution thereafter. In one proceeding, as already stated above,
                  the court enforcing a foreign award can deal with the entire
                  matter. Even otherwise, this procedure does not prejudice a
                  party in the light of what is stated in para 40 of the Thyssen
                  judgment.

                  32.     
Part II of the Act
 relates to enforcement of certain foreign
                  awards. Chapter 1 of this Part deals with New York Convention
                  Awards. 
Section 46
 of the Act speaks as to when a foreign award
                  is binding. 
Section 47
 states as to what evidence the party
                  applying for the enforcement of a foreign award should produce
                  before the court. 
Section 48
 states as to the conditions for
                  enforcement of foreign awards. As per 
Section 49
, if the Court is
                  satisfied that a foreign award is enforceable under this Chapter,
                  the award shall be deemed to be a decree of that court and that
                  court has to proceed further to execute the foreign award as a
                  decree of that court. If the argument advanced on behalf of the
                  respondent is accepted, the very purpose of the Act in regard to
                  speedy and effective execution of foreign award will be
                  defeated. Thus none of the contentions urged on behalf of the
                  respondent merit acceptance so as to uphold the impugned
                  judgment and order. We have no hesitation or impediment in
                  concluding that the impugned judgment and order cannot be
                  sustained."

                                                        (emphasis supplied)

Fuerst Day

 application for enforcement it would be open to a party seeking

 enforcement of a foreign award to apply for execution in the form

 prescribed so that once the court proceeds to hold that the Award is

 enforceable, it can thereafter proceed to execute the decree without

 further procedural requirements.






 
24.     The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has also referred to

 the decision of the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court in

 M/s.Compania 
Naviera 'SODNOC' Vs. Bharat Refineries Ltd. & Anr.


 (supra) in which the court referring to the decision of the Supreme

 Court in 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (supra) rejected

 the contention of the respondent that as the award was passed on 2

 March 2000 the petition to enforce the award should have been filed

 within three years and as the same being filed in the year 2005, the

 relief was barred by limitation. It was held that the foreign award is

 already stamped as a decree and the party having the foreign award can

 straight away apply for enforcement of the foreign award, the party

 would have 12 years time like that of a decreeholder to execute the

 foreign award.          The Court in paragraphs 41 and 42 has made the

 following observations:-




       "41. The next objection of the learned Counsel for the 1st
       respondent is that as the award was passed on 2.3.2000, the
       petition to enforce the award should have been filed within 3 years
       and as the same was filed only in 2005, the relief is barred by
       limitation.



       42. I am unable to accept this submission also. 
Under the Act,
       1996
, the foreign award is already stamped as a decree and the
       party, having a foreign award can straight away apply for
       enforcement of it and in such circumstances, the party having a

       foreign award has got 12 years time like that of a decree holder.
       Therefore it cannot be said that the present petition is barred by
       limitation."



 25.     
In another decision in M/s.Bharat Salt Refineries Ltd. Vs. M/s.

 
Compania Naviera
 (supra) another learned Single Judge of the Madras

 High Court referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in 
Fuerst Day

 Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (supra) rejected the contention that

 the petition for enforcement should have been filed within three years

 from the date of the award. In paragraph 20 the Court held as under:-


 
"20. The contention of the appellant that as the award was made
       on 2.3.2000, the petition for enforcement should have been filed
       within three years therefrom and the petition for enforcement filed
       in the year 2005 is hit by limitation is raised only for rejection.
       Under the 1996 Act, the foreign award is stamped as a decree and
       the party having a foreign award has got 12 years time like any
       other decree for its enforcement or execution. Hence the point of
       limitation is also decided against the appellant, in the sense, the
       petition filed for enforcement is well within the period of
       limitation. Our view is fortified by the ruling of the Apex Court in
       the case of 
M/S FUERST DAY LAWSON LTD. VS. JINDAL EXPORTS
       LTD
 (AIR 2001 Supreme Court 2293), .............. .........."




         ... .. ... ... .



       A reading of the above it is clear that once the Court decides that a
       foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed to take further
       effective steps for execution of the same and also the award shall
       be deemed to be a decree of that Court.





 
26.     It is thus beyond a pale of doubt that enforcement and execution

 can form part of the same proceedings. If this be so then certainly

 
Article 136
 under the 
Limitation Act
 becomes relevant. If the argument

 of non applicability of 
Article 136
 as urged on behalf of the respondent

 is accepted, it would be contrary to the principle of law as 
laid down by


 the Supreme Court in 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.


 (supra) apart from deeply damaging the decreetal interest of the award

 creditors apart from being contrary to the object of 
Section 47
 to 
49
 of

 the Arbitration Act.






 27.     
In fact the above legal position now stands reinforced as seen

 from a recent decision of the Supreme Court in 
M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd.

 Vs. Rioglass Solar SA14
, the Supreme Court taking note of the decisions

 in 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (
supra) and Thyssen

 Stahlunion GMBH Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd.
 (supra) has held that

 the observations of the Supreme Court in 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.

 Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (supra) that "the only difference as found is that

 while under the Foreign Awards Act a decree follows, under the new

 Act the foreign award is already stamped as the decree." to mean that

 the expression "stamped" means "regarded" This means that the foreign

 award is to be regarded as a decree. The following observations of the

 Supreme Court in paragraph 19 read thus:-




 
"One sentence in 
Fuerst Day Lawson
 (supra) reads, "[T]he only
       difference as found is that while under the Foreign Awards Act a
       decree follows, under the new Act the foreign award is already
       stamped as the decree."
 
This sentence does not lead to the

       conclusion, following the judgment in 
Thyssen Stahlunion GMBH
       Vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd.
, (1999) 9 SCC 334, that under the
       1996 Act, a foreign award is considered to be stamped already. All
       that this sentence means is that the foreign award is to be regarded
       as a decree. The expression "stamped" means "regarded". This
       judgment also does not carry us much further."


                                                    (emphasis supplied)





 
28.     Now coming to the contention as urged on behalf of the

 respondents, the main thrust of the respondents' argument is the

 decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Noy Vallesina

 Engineering Spa v/s. 
Jindal Drugs Limited
 (supra). In my opinion

 considering the facts of the present case and as noted above, that the

 Supreme Court on 10 March 2017 set aside the order passed by this

 Court holding that the 
Section 34
 petition filed by the respondents was

 not maintainable and the present proceedings being filed on 2 April

 2018, even by applicability of the provisions of 
Article 137
 of the

 
Limitation Act
, the petition is not barred by limitation.
 
In any case,

 applying the princple of law as 
laid down in
 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.

 Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (
supra) and M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar

 SA
 (supra), the Court cannot overlook the prayers as made by the

 petitioner which are in the nature of a combined petition namely for

 enforcement and for execution of the award. As observed above a

 broader view is required to be taken to advance the object and intention

 of the provisions of the 
Arbitration Act
 and not a hard technical

 approach as urged by the respondents that the petition be held as time

 barred, by applying 
Article 137
 of the 
Limitation Act
 in the absence of a

 delay condonation applicaton and the delay being condoned.
 
This

 contention of the respondents militates against from what the Supreme

 Court has now further clarified in 
M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass

 Solar SA
 (supra)that when it was observed in 
Furest Day Lawson Ltd.

 Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd
 (supra) that the Foreign award is already

 stamped as a decree, it means that "the foreign award is to be regarded

 as a decree." In view of this clear position in law there is no manner of

 doubt and more particularly as seen the prayers as made in the petition

 that this petition cannot be held to be time barred, as contended on

 behalf of the respondents.






 29.     
In so far as the reliance on behalf of the respondents on the

 decision in 
Hameed Joharan (Dead) & Ors. vs. Abdul Salam (Dead) by

 LRs
.
 & Ors.(supra), this decision may not assist the respondents when

 the issue is of enforcement of a foreign award. The Supreme Court in

 this decision has considered as to what would be the purport of the

 word "enforce" as used in 
Article 136
 of the 
Limitation Act
. The

 Supreme Court was considering the meaning of the word "enforce" as

 used in 
Article 136
 of the 
Limitation Act
.

 considering that the award is a foreign award, the reliance on this

 decision is not well founded, more particularly in view of the principles

 of law in regard to the enforceability of a foreign award as laid down in

 
Furest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (
supra) and

 M/S.Shriram EPC Ltd. Vs. Rioglass Solar SA
 (supra).


 
30.     The decision in 
Assam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Board

 Vs. Subash Projects And Marketing Limited
 (supra) would also not

 assist the respondents, as the question which fell for determination of

 the Court was as to whether the appellants were entitled to extension of

 time under 
Section 4
 of the Limitation Act,1963 and the context of the

 words "prescribed period" as used in the said provision. It was held that

 
Section 2(j)
 of the Limitation Act defines the period of limitation and

 when read in the context of 
Section 34(3)
 of the Arbitration Act,1996,

 the prescribed period for making an application for setting aside the

 arbitral award was three months. It was held that the period of 30 days

 mentioned in the proviso that follows sub-section (3) of 
Section 34
 of

 the Arbitration Act is not the "period of limitation" and therefore, not

 the 'prescribed period' for the purpose of making an application for

 setting aside the arbitral award. It was held that the period of 30 days

 beyond three months which the Court may extend on sufficient cause

 being shown under the proviso below sub-section (3) of 
Section 34
 of

 the 
Arbitration Act
 being not a period of limitation (prescribed period),

 and 
Section 4
 of the Limitation Act would thus not be applicable. I

 wonder as to how this decision would at all is applicable in the present

 facts.






 31.      The decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in

 M/s.Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse S.A., 29 v/s. Sakuma Exports

 Limited (supra) would also not assist the respondents. This was a case

 where initially the execution application simplicitor came to be filed

 without filing of an enforcement petition.                        
Subsequently, the

 enforcement petition was filed and the learned Judge referring to the

 decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Noy Vallesina

 Engineering Spa v/s. 
Jindal Drugs Limited
 (supra) and the decision of

 the Supreme Court in 
Furest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs. Jindal Exports Ltd.


 (supra) the Court held that the petition was not barred by limitation.

 Learned Judge in paragraphs 46, 48 and 49 has made the following

 observations:-




 
"46. The Supreme Court in the case of M/s. 
Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd.

       (supra) has held that there is no need to take two separate
       proceedings resulting in multiplicity of proceedings. It is also clear
       from objectives contained in the statement of objects and reasons
       that in view of 
Section 47
 to 
49
 and the scheme of 
Arbitration Act
,
       every final arbitral award is to be enforced as if it were a decree of
       the court. The Supreme Court held the submission that the
       execution petition could not be permitted to convert as an
       application under 
Section 47
 is technical and was of no
       consequence in the view the Supreme Court had taken in the said

                                           33                                      carbp 414-18

       judgment. It is held that in one   proceedings, the court enforcing a
       foreign award can deal with        the entire matter and that the
       procedure does not prejudice a     party. It is not in dispute that the
       said execution application filed   by the petitioner was pending for
       quite some time. No objection      was raised by the respondent by
       filing reply.




       ..... ..... ....



       48. In 
the said judgment
, this Court held that such an application
       for enforcement of the foreign award would attract 
Article 137
 and
       according to that Article, the period of limitation is three years and
       would commence from the date when right to apply occurs. This
       Court has also observed that the least that could be said is that the
       question as to whether any period of limitation is prescribed for
       making an application for enforcement of the foreign award and if
       there is period of limitation prescribed, what would be that period
       of limitation, was not a question free from doubt and this Court
       accordingly, condoned the delay filed by the petitioner. In my view,
       the petitioner has filed the execution application which was within
       four months from the date of the said foreign award and was
       prosecuting the same in good faith and with due diligence. The
       respondent raised an objection about the maintainability of the
       said application for the first time before the Division Bench and not
       earlier. In my view, the petitioner has thus made out a case for
       condonation of delay in filing the petition under 
Section 47
 of the
       Arbitration Act. The judgment of this Court in case of Noy Vallesina
       Engineering Spa (supra) assist the case of the petitioner and not
       the respondent.



 
49. I am not inclined to accept the submission made by learned
       senior counsel for the respondent that 
Section 14
 of the Limitation
       Act, 1963 would not be attracted to Arbitration Petition (No.47 of
       2015) filed by the petitioner. The petitioner filed the said
       application based on the interpretation of the judgment of the
       arbp47-15g Supreme Court in M/s.Fuerst 
Day Lawson Ltd.
 (supra)
       and the said proceedings were pending. The Division Bench of this
       Court did not find the said execution application not maintainable
       but on the contrary directed that if any application is filed under
       
Section 47
 by the petitioner, the same shall be heard along with the
       said execution application. In my view, there is thus no substance
       in the submission of learned senior counsel that 
Section 14
 would
       not be applicable to the facts of this case. I am therefore of the
       view that the delay in filing the arbitration petition deserves to be
       condoned. I shall now deal with the submissions made by both the
       leaned counsel on enforceability of the foreign award."


                                                     (emphasis supplied)


 32.     
In fact the Court has recognized the clear applicability of the well

 settled principle of law as 
laid down in
 
Furest Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.

 Jindal Exports Ltd.
 (supra)


 33.     As a sequel to the above discussion, the respondents objection

 that the petition is required to be held as time barred, cannot be

 accepted. It is held that the present petition is filed within the

 prescribed limitation.
