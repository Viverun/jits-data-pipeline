                                    FACTS IN BRIEF


        3.    Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA

        are that husband of applicant late Shri Nageshwar Kamti was an employee

        of Department of Posts died in harness on 08.07.2010. Applicant is

        aggrieved by two successive letters issued vide letter No.B2-7/CL(TS)

        dated 23.11.2016 (Annexure A-1) containing speaking and reasoned order

        No.B2-07/CL(T/S) dated 14.12.2017 (Annexure A-2) containing revised

        speaking order issued by Superintendent of Post Office, Darbhanga

        Division filed in CP No.050/00114/2015 denying her claim for family

                                         3                OA No. /050/00163/2018




        pension and other retiral benefits because husband of the applicant died in

        harness and was not regularized as Group 'D'.



        4.    The husband of the applicant was initially appointed in the

        Department of Posts vide order dated 30.06.1992 (Annexure A-3) and was

        conferred temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and vide Memo dated

        11.01.2000 (Annexure A-4). As per rules/instructions, husband of the

        applicant was required to be granted the status of a temporary group 'D'

        employee after three years of service as a temporary status employee but

        the same was delayed inordinately and finally the same was granted vide
Patna
Bench
        letter dated 11.01.2000 (Annexure A-4). Thereafter, he was given all the

        benefits pursuant to G.I., Dept. of Posts, Lr.No.66-9/91-SPB.I dated

        30.11.1992 (Annexure A-5). Regularization of husband of the applicant

        was also delayed by the respondents violating the departmental rules and

        unfortunately husband of applicant died in harness on 06.07.2010.



        Husband of the applicant was being given pay scale of a temporary Group

        'D' employee and necessary deductions were being made from his salary

        including all other benefits at par with Group 'D' employee.



        5.    After the death of husband of applicant, applicant was neither

        granted death/pensionary benefits even after rendering about 30 years of

        service by her husband nor was her request for appointment on

        compassionate ground acceded to despite the fact that applicant was

        having no sources of income to take care of the family. Claim of the

        applicant for settlement of family pension as well as payment of retiral

        dues are being denied on the ground that her husband was not regularized

        in the department.

                                         4                OA No. /050/00163/2018


        6.    It is the case of the applicant that the action of the respondents is

        violative of the statutory rules containing benefits for temporary

        employees as well as against the settled norms. Conditions of service of

        temporary employees of the Central Government are regulated under the

        provisions of the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965

        (For brevity herein after referred as Rules, 1965) and under the same

        rules, the applicant is entitled to receive family pension as well as other

        retiral dues of her husband.



        7.    The applicant filed OA No.519/2011 before this Tribunal decided
Patna
Bench
        on 11.03.2014 (Annexure A-9) directing the respondents to consider the

        case of applicant and a reasoned and speaking order to that effect be

        passed within three months. But the respondents did not comply the said

        order. Therefore, applicant had to file CP No.114/2015. Meanwhile,

        respondents passed two successive orders denying her claim for family

        pension and other retiral benefits erroneously, impugned in this OA and

        annexed as Annexure A-1 & A-2. While issuing the impugned orders the

        respondents have purposely suppressed the recent orders passed by the

        Hon'ble High Court, Patna dated 04.09.2017 passed in CWJC No.10978

        of 2017 and order dated 11.09.2017 passed in CWJC No.11435/2017.



        8.    Husband of the applicant died on 08.07.2010, he has been survived

        by applicant, two unmarried daughters and two sons. There is no source of

        income to the family of deceased. The applicant is eligible and entitled to

        family pension as well as retiral dues of her deceased husband but the

        same is being denied to her erroneously and the entire family members of

        the deceased employee are left on the verge of starvation.

                                         5                OA No. /050/00163/2018


        9.    Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have

        filed written statement and stated that Shri Nageshwar Kamti, deceased

        employee, husband of applicant was engaged as Contingent paid casual

        labour, was conferred temporary status in pursuance of Dte's letter dated

        12.04.1991 communicated vide Supdt. Of Post Offices, Darbhanga Memo

        dated 30.06.1992. the deceased employee was given temporary status

        w.e.f. 29.11.1989 vide order dated 11.01.2000 and with temporary status

        expired on 06.07.2010 and not regularized against the post of Temporary

        Status Group 'D' till his death. The applicant and other family members
Patna
Bench   of the deceased employee is not entitled to get pensionary benefits and

        relaxation for appointment under compassionate ground.



        10.   Applicant earlier filed OA No.519/2011 before this Tribunal which

        was decided on 11.03.2014 with a direction to the respondents to pass a

        reasoned and speaking order taking into account the order passed by this

        Tribunal in OA No.164/2008 filed by one Smt. Meena Devi. In

        compliance thereof, respondents passed the impugned order dated

        23.11.2016 (Annexure A-1). Since in the said speaking order direction in

        Smt. Meena Devi's case (supra) was inadvertently overlooked, second

        speaking order taking into account the order passed therein, was passed on

        14.12.2017 (Annexure A-2) clearly stating therein that order in the case of

        Smt. Meena Devi (supra) has been challenged by the department before

        the Hon'ble High Court, Patna by way of CWJC No.7760 of 2015 and

        Hon'ble High Court, Patna, vide order dated 11.05.2016 stayed operation

        of Tribunal's order passed in Smt. Meena Devi's case (supra). Therefore,

                                          6                  OA No. /050/00163/2018




        final decision in the case on hand will be taken after the decision of

        Hon'ble High Court of Patna in Smt. Meena Devi's case (supra).



        11.   It is stated in the WS that deceased husband of applicant was

        conferred with temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 vide SPOs Memo dated

        11.01.2000. It is true that vide order dated 11.01.2000 it was ordered that

        deceased employee would be treated at par with temporary Group 'D'

        employee after completion of three years satisfactory service but it was

        made clear that under Point NO.3 contained in the said Memo dated

        11.01.2000 that he would get pension and terminal benefits only after
Patna
Bench
        regularization of his service in Group 'D' cadre. Since the deceased was

        never regularized as Group 'D' employee, applicant is not entitled to get

        any benefit under existing provisions of departmental rules by reckoning

        of her husband services towards qualifying service entitling her for family

        pension and pensionary benefits. Since services of deceased employee

        could not be regularized as Group 'D' employee, question of considering

        the applicant for appointment on compassionate ground does not arise. It

        is also stated in the WS that the decision of Hon'ble High Court, Patna,

        relied upon by applicant in case of Meena Devi (supra), does not relate to

        this Division and hence not applicable in the case on hand.



                                      SUBMISSIONS

                       and continued with Temporary Status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 but as

                                            CASE - LAW


        16.   Before examining the core issue framed. This Tribunal would first deal
        with binding precedent some of the various judgments settled the law on the
        similar facts and the issue involved not been referred to higher bench. So also
        judgments dealing with pari-materia provisions related to same category of
        employees as under:-

                                  14                     OA No. /050/00163/2018


        (i) The Hon'ble Supreme Court interpreting the scheme and policies as
        applicable in present O.A. of Department of Post in three judge Bench
        decision in case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union and ors. versus Mahanagar
        Telephone Nigam Ltd. And ors in W.P. No. 1119, 1276, 1623 and 1624
        of 1986 decided on 29.11.1989 reported in 1990 Supp SCC 113 has
        observed :-

           "writ petitioner in W.P. No. 1624/1986 working as substitute
           employees and casual labourers in the Department of Posts, Govt. of
           India claimed relief to treat at par with regular employees and be paid
           same emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
           in Para 11 directed as under:-

           "11 The Temporary Status would be available to the casual
           labourers in the Postal Department on completion of one year
           continuous service with at least 240 days of work (2036 days in the
           case of officers observing five days week) and on conferment of
           temporary status, House Rent Allowance and City Compensatory
           Allowance shall be admissible. There would be no justification to
           withhold Maternity Leave as that is an obligation of the employer
           under the law and the state as an ideal employer fulfilling the
           Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in Part-IV of the
           Constitution should provide the same. After rendering three years
           of continuous service with temporary status, the casual labouers
Patna
           shall be treated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the
Bench      Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits
           as are admissible to Group "D" employees on regular basis."

                                                           [Emphasis supplied]

        (ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of Yashwant
        Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in (1996) 7 SCC 113,
        dealing with question for determination "whether appellant is entitled to
        any pensionary benefits since total service of more than eighteen years
        was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The Hon'ble Supreme Court has
        held:-

             "3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
             the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the
             appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of
             quasi-permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was
             necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.
                 It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was
             in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary
             benefits.

                 There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was
             not made permanent even when he had served the Government for
             18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied
             the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a
             permanent employee of the government. The appellant having
             served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to
             treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.

                 Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we
             hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent
             after he served the Government for such a long period. The services
             of the appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he
             shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set
             aside the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to
             treat the appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980
             after serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of
             permanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be
             finalized within six months from the receipt of this order. The
             appellant shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date
             of retirement.

        (iii)  The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical facts
        and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain Singh,
        CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017. Their Lordships was

                                  15                      OA No. /050/00163/2018




        seisin with similar issue as decided by Central Administrative Tribunal
        Bench, Patna in O.A. No. 900 of 2012 vide order dated 18.2.2016 The
        Union of India- Ministry of Communication, Department of Posts taken
        plea as before Tribunal that services of private respondents Temporary
        Status Casual Labour, was never regularized nor worked on a regular
        group 'D' post till his retirement. Therefore he is not entitled to pensioner
        benefits. Their Lordships in case of Kritnarain Singh (supra) affirmed
        view taken by this Tribunal in OA No. 900/2012 based on Hon'ble High
        Court Patna judgement dated 15.12.2015 in CWJC No. 17204/2015. So
        also their Lordships observed that Tribunal has taken correct view
        because in similar and identical circumstances the High Court held in
        favour of an employee and that judgment stands and holds the field and
        writ application dismissed.

                                                              [Emphasis supplied]

 
(iv)    The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical case in
        facts and legal issue in case of 
Union of India versus Smt Ram Kali
        Devi, CWJC No.
 11435 of 2017 decided on 11.9.2017. Their Lordships
        were seisin with similar issue as involved in the present case. The
        Union of India, Department of Posts had challenged order dated
        22.3.2017 passed in O.A. No. 664/2015 (Patna) by this Tribunal to pay
        family pension, retiral dues to widow of deceased employee.


Patna
Bench           Their Lordships observed that husband of petitioner granted
        temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992
        and he died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more
        than 25 years of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in
        temporary status begets the benefits of pension. Failure on part of
        postal department not to regularize services of husband of private
        respondents cannot be appreciated. Their Lordships decided in favour
        of temporary status employee at par with Group 'D' employee and
        upheld order dated 22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna). So
        also observed that in similar and identical cases adjudicated in favour
        of employees in OA No. 113/2006 decided on 21.9.2006, affirmed by
        Patna High Court vide order dated 7.11.2007 in CWJC No. 4475/2007
        and order of the High Court Patna has been affirmed by Hon'ble
        Apex Court on 4.12.2009. So also similar cases travelled from O.A.
        No. 900/2012 (CAT Patna) in CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 and Division
        Bench vide order dated 4.9.2017 had upheld directions by this
        Tribunal extending benefits of pension as employee was granted
        temporary status at par with Group 'D' employee.

                                                              [Emphasis supplied]

        (v)(a) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with similar legal core
        issue as involved in the present case interpreted rules applicable in
        the present OA in hand. 
In the case of 
Union of India and others
        versus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar, CWJC No.
 7760 of 2015
        decided on 8.12.2022 reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 by their
        Lordships affirming order dated 28.3.2013 passed in O.A 164/2008
        (Patna). The Tribunal has granted family pension and other pensionary
        benefits to widow of deceased employee died as temporary employee
        without being regularized.


        Their Lordships dealing with the identical issue "whether deceased
        employee who was appointed as a casual labourer and thereafter stepped

        harness on 15.11.2007 and his legal heirs is entitled to benefit of
        pension/family pension or not ?"



        So also held that sub-clause (3) of clause (2) of Para 5 of Casual
        Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization Scheme is
        crystal clear that temporary employees is entitled to pension and
        retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of service in the
        temporary status followed by regularization. Their Lordships further
        observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs are
        entitled to family pension in light of Rule 10(2) of Temporary Service

                                    16                          OA No. /050/00163/2018

        of 2008 (CAT, Patna) rejecting CWJC No. 7760/2015 of Department of
        Posts. Their Lordships also directed as under :-

                "10. Respondent is a legal heir and she is awaiting for certain monetary
                benefits for more than decade, therefore, the petitioner department is hereby
                directed to calculate monetary benefits in the light of sub-rule (2) of Rule 10
                of Rules 1965 and same shall be extended to the respondent within a period of
                three months from the date of receipt of this order, alongwith interest at the
                rate of 8% p.a. from 1.3.2008 in the light of the fact that respondent's husband
                died on 15.11.1997 and in the light of Apex Court's decision in the case of
                Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of U.P., (2001) 9 SCC 687."

                                                                     [Emphasis supplied]

        (b)     The present case on hand is also identical in facts and legal
        issue and reserved on 24.04.2018 for orders.

Patna
Bench   (vi)     The Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla in
        CWP No. 2299 of 2014, The Sr. Superintendent of Posts offices versus
        Shri Painu Ram decided on 23.7.2018, dealing with identical issue on
        facts and legal points and law as involved in present O.A "whether a part
        timer, who was conferred temporary status was entitled for same benefits,
        as are admissible to reglar employees in terms of instructions dated
        12.4.1991 as amended on 30.11.1992 issued by respondent department
        post or not ?"


 
The writ petition was directed against order dated 31.1.2014
        passed by learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, in
        OA No. 426/HP/2013 Painu Ram Vs Union of India & ors granting
        relief in favour of original applicant therein, The Hon'ble High Court
        considered Department of Post Government of India Plicy dated
        30.11.1992 relied by the learned Tribunal and judgement of Hon'ble
        Supreme Court in 
Jagritti Mazdoor Union (Regd
) (supra) and held that
        after the conferment of the temporary status upon the present respondent,
        he was entitled for benefits which are accrueable to a regular Group 'D'
        employee after completion of three years of service on temporary basis.
        So also considered judgements of various Benches of learned Tribunal
        and upheld the order dated 31.1.2014 in O.A. No. 426/HP/2013
        (Chandigarh).


 
(vii) Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh
        in case of 
Mrs. Alka Sharma versus Union of India
, 2017 (2) SCT 739
        (P&H) (DB) dealing with the issue in the case of widow of the railway
        employee in pari materia provision of family pension "whether widow of
        temporary employee not been subsequently appointed on substantive post
        could be granted pension and family pension under Railway Services
        (Pension) Rules as for no fault of deceased employee on lapses on
        railways could not be considered for regularization". The Hon'ble High
        Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such
        lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The
        Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family
        Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased
        employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary
        capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary
        employee.


                 The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of
        family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by
        notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for
        a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.

        17.   In the other similar and identical situation, The Central Administrative
        Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of original applicants on
        similar facts and legal issue as involved in the present OA in hand and some of
        them are cited as under:-

 
(a)(i) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018
              
Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors
 decided on
              28.10.2021. The said O.A. was filed by Night Guard working in Department of
              Posts seeking pension and other pensionary benefits in terms of Rule 10, CCS
              (TS) Rules 1965 read with GID (3) below Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.


 
The learned Tribunal observed that as per judgement by The Hon'ble Supreme
              Court in 
Uma Devi
's case, Department of Posts has circulated policy in June/July
              2014 for regularization of casual labours having worked for ten years or more and
              vide judgement dated 13.11.2017 Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.
              12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the policy. The applicant Awadhesh
              Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984 on daily wages, conferred
              temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and retired on October, 2019 after 35 years of
              total service as temporary status and not been regularized.


 
The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of clause 5 of
              Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66-9/91-SPB. I dated 30th
Patna         November, 1992- benefits to a casual labour on completion of three years service
Bench         in Temporary status become entitled to be treated at par with temporary Group
              'D' employees of the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
              benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis such as
              counting of service for purposes of pension and terminal benefits as in the case of
              temporary employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and
              retirement benefits after the regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of
              order relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
              case of 
Prem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others
 reported in
              (2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-


                       "35. There are some of the employees who have not been regularized in
                       spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas
                       they have been superannuated. As they have worked in work-charged
                       establishment, not against any particular project, their services ought to
                       have been regularized under the Government instructions and even as per
                       the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma
                       Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court in the said decision has laid down that
                       in case services have been rendered for more than ten years without the
                       cover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be
                       regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those employees
                       who have worked for ten years or more should have been regularized. It
                       would not be proper to regulate them for consideration of regularisation
                       as others have been regularised, we direct that their services be treated as
                       a regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to
                       claiming any dues of difference in wages had they been continued in
                       service regularly before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall be
                       entitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the regular
                       establishment and the services rendered by them right from the day they
                       entered the work-charged establishment shall be counted as qualifying
                       service for purpose of pension.

                       36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement Benefits
                       Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work-charged
                       establishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the aforesaid
                       rule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three
                       years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid

Bench


        18.     In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue "whether deceased
        employee, the husband of the applicant who was appointed as casual lobour and
        thereafter conferred the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and
        died on 06.07.2010 after 30 years of active service and his legal heir-Smt.
        Urmila Devi-the applicant is entitled to benefit of pension or family pension or
        not?"

        19.     Admittedly, husband of the applicant was initially engaged as Casual
        Labour. The department of posts vide instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that
        all daily wagers working in post offices are to be treated as casual labourers.
        The department of posts has made Scheme known as Casual Labourers
        (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization) Scheme effective from
        01.10.1989. The scheme provided provisions for conferment of temporary
        status to casual labourers. So also the scheme specified advantages at part with
        Group 'D' regular employee available on conferment of status of temporary
        employee.

 
20.     The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before
        Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of 
Jagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus
        Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.
 1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that
        substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same
        emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
        "temporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal
        department on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240

                                                 19                      OA No. /050/00163/2018




        days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal
        employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly
        with regular employees in the department".




 
21.    The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in 
Jagrit Mazdoor
        Union
 (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-


                      "After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the
                      casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of
                      the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are
                      admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis."

                                                                             [Emphasis Supplied]

        22.    
In compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
        
Jagrit Mazdoor Union
 (supra). The Department of Posts, Government of
        India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary
        Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been
Patna
Bench
        drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and
        Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously
        pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers
        working continuously for long period.




        23.    The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and
        beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits
        to long continuous working of casual labourers.



        24.    The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual
        labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The husband of the applicant is
        appointee of year 1979 and has been requesting to regularize accordance with
        law as regular employee for no fault of applicant made to suffer and died on
        06.07.2010 violating 
Article 14
, 21
, 31A
 and 
300
 of the Constitution of India.



        25.    The husband of the applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.
        29.11.1989 pursuant to order dated 11.01.2000 (Annexure A-4) and the
        statutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years w.e.f. 29.11.1992 certain
        advantages to temporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum
        of the pay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.
        Para 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a
        Group 'D' employee after completion of one year of service from date of
        conferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of
        increment to a government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent

                                            20                 OA No. /050/00163/2018




        is clear as noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and
        writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as
        social legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The
        Central Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles
        of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating
        temporary status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group
        'D' employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and
        entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on
        regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity
        Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary
        status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on
        absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation
        with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically
Patna
Bench   provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three
        years continuous service as temporary status.



        26.    The husband of the applicant was conferred temporary status w.e.f.
        29.11.1989 (Annexure A-4) and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on
        principles of beneficial construction and harmoniously construing the scheme.
        The husband of the applicant after three years since 29.11.1989 meaning
        thereby since 29.11.1992 has attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees
        and regularly contributed to G.P.F. The applicant was in capacity of temporary
        employee. The applicant having continuously worked as temporary status
        casual labourer since 29.11.1989 and on 29.11.1992 is holder of post of
        temporary employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly by
        the model employer state accordance with guarantee enshrined in the 
Article 14

        and 
21
 of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is of the view whereof that it
        is unfair to continue the applicant such a long 30 years in temporary post and
        without considering for regularizing till death on 06.07.2010.



 
27.    The husband of the applicant acquired status of temporary employee
        Group 'D' of Department of Posts on 29.11.1989 and it is well settled in law
        that entitled for such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on
        regular basis. So also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
Jagrit Mazdoor
        Union
 (supra) and case of applicant squarely covered by judgment of Hon'ble
        High Court, Patna in 
Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar
 (supra).


                                            21                OA No. /050/00163/2018


        28.    The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no
        recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers
        available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged
        statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the
        Constitution of India and husband of the applicant was not regularized as for no
        fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his
        duty and not regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take
        advantages and plea not even considered for regularization available to them
        that since no regularization no pension etc.


        29.    This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in
        the O.A that respondents have not regularized services of husband of the
        applicant on regular post as per law on time, in spite of written requests and
Patna
Bench
        died on 06.07.2010 without being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view
        since respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme
        dated 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization since 1979.
        Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny
        retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee before retirement. The
        matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to
        husband of the applicant and he ought to have at least considered for
        regularization. The husband of the applicant worked since 1979 till his death
        i.e. 06.07.2010 almost more than thirty (30) years in the department in
        Contingency Paid capacity.



        30.    The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein
        above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated
        30.11.1992 (Annexure A-5) Government of India, Department of Posts G.I.
        (5). Benefits of casual labourers on completion of three years service in
        temporary status reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the
        employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away
        by respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication &
        I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure
        of implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also
        envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars
        are substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to
        employee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and
        tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless

                                             22                OA No. /050/00163/2018




        regularized no pensionry benefits. The said contention deserves to be rejected
        and applicant can not be denied relief claimed.



        31.    The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992
        quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal
        department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly
        acquired temporary status in present case w.e.f. 29.11.1989 becomes entitled to
        benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of
        service for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary
        employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and
        retirement benefits after their regularization.



        32.    The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are

Patna
        regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The
Bench
        Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death
        gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as
        are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS
        Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension
        and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2
        CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive
        appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Pension
        Rules 2021.



        33.    The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as
        extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes
        temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021
        are applicable to those temporary employee like husband of the applicant. So
        also the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to
        (6) cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil
        services and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st
        December, 2003, who retired or were retired before having been appointed in
        a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the
        government servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services
        (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as
        admissible to any other public servant and respondents have violated
        fundamental right enshrined in 
Article 14
 and 
21
 of Constitution of India.

                                              23                    OA No. /050/00163/2018


        34.    The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years
        service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992
        provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement
        benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed
        by regularization.



        35.    The husband of the died on 06.07.2010 in harness as temporary
        employee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge
        their duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965
        read with Pension Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of
        pension, family pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee. The
        status of deceased employee was at par with regular employee on long 30 years
        continuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory Rules
Patna
Bench
        1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy decision.
        Applicant is widow of deceased employee entitled for relief under Rules, 1965.



        36.    The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it
        clear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a
        substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type of category of
        temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity,
        death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant same scale as
        admissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent
        provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-

                      (i)     On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation
                              after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent
                              service of not less than 10 years.

                      (ii)    On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of
                              continuous temporary service.

                      (iii)   In event of death while in service.

                                                                        [Emphasis supplied]

        37.    This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes
        clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021
        (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of
        whereof of the firm view that Government of India, Department of Posts
        instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992
        and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read
        conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial
        legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered
        service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes

                                            24                  OA No. /050/00163/2018




        entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the
        part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension
        Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers
        the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state
        as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy
        envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution. The deceased employee is held
        entitled for pension etc. and applicant legal heir-widow entitled for family
        pension under Rules, 1965.



 
38.    Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses
        and for no fault the applicant cannot be made to suffer and applicant entitled to
        receive pension/family pension, arrears and other benefits as if applicant
        husband retired from regular establishment and so also held by Hon'ble
Patna
Bench
        Supreme court in para 36 of judgment in case of 
Prem Singh versus State of
        U.P & Ors
 (2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced herein above.




 
39.    The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in
        case of 
Union of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.
 154 of 2019 decided
        on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in
        O.A. No. 372/2017 (
Bhikhani Devi Vs Union of India
) as Tribunal relied on
        ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against
        same.
 
Their Lordships in case of         
Bhikhani Devi
 (supra) observed that
        judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none
        of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that
        there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'
        unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an
        employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be
        admissible.




 
40.    The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the
        Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal
        issue dealt in detail rules applicable in case of 
Union of India and ors

Bench

        44.    The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants
        are regulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules
        1965. As per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued             for grant of
        pension, retirement gratuity and in the event of death after retirement,
        members of his family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension read
        with    the provisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021
        (Erstwhile Rules 1972). The explanation (6) provides appended to Rule 2
        Applicability Clause of the CCS Pension Rules 2021 to the extend these
        rules shall also apply to the case of government servant appointed in

        Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia provision in Rule
        75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted
        that Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a
        regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari
        Kakkar (supra) has held that it would be travesty of justice if retiree
        denied pensionary benefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent
        employee not regularized after served for 18 ½ years.

        working as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in

        etc. 
This Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008
        (
Meena Devi vs. Union of India
) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC

        and issue pension, family pension and benefits with arrears.

                                           28                 OA No. /050/00163/2018


        48.   
In case of 
Shiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others

        O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -
        whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status
        at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other
        retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post
        and applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as
        temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started
        employment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred
        status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,
        family pension.
 This Tribunal in case Shiv Shankar Sah (Supra) considered
        orders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015
        upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on
        part of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private
Patna
Bench   respondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par
        with Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be
        appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978
        of 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing
        respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old
        pension scheme.



        49.   Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above cited judgments observed that as per
        rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on
        regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service
        after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On
        working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'
        employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not
        regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of
        respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise
        meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible
        for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order
        passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not
        regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension. In case of Shiv Chandra Sah
        (Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant
        entitled for pension and pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary
        Status period as Qualifying Service and treating his superannuation on
        03.11.2018, considering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service

                                            29                  OA No. /050/00163/2018




        and to issue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.
        Respondents challenged order dated 21.02.2022 in identical case on hand titled
        Shiv Charndra Shah (supra) in CWJC No.1415 of 2023 Union of India vs.
        Shiv Chandra Shah, upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna vide order dated
        22.08.2024.



        50.    In case of Ratneshwar Singh versus Union of India, O.A.
        No.777/2018, decided on 20.09.2018, This Tribunal was seisin with issue
        applicant engaged as Night Guard as casual worker, conferred with temporary
        status on completion three years as Temporary Status employee confirmed at
        part with Group 'D' and retired as Temporary Status and claim for pension
        denied that his service not regularized and applicant denied to join on
        regularization. This Tribunal observed that fact remains respondents did not
Patna
Bench
        issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right
        accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule
        2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. So also placed reliance in case OA
        No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated 21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of
        2017 in Ratneshwar Singh (Supra) this Tribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018,
        allowed OA and directed for fixation of pension, grant of gratuity and all other
        retiral dues in light of judgment passed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and
        CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and order dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA
        No.372/2017.



        51.    Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018, Union of India
        & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated 03.07.2019 upheld this
        Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA No.777/2016. Their Lordships
        considered argument of respondents department that contention of department
        cannot be accepted that applicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be
        construed that applicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying
        for more than 27 years.



        52.    The present case is similar to cases cited herein above and covered by
        above precedents.

In 
Yashwant Hari Katakkar
 (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court
                     held that there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was
                     not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½
                     years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary
                     benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent
                     employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances
                     appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the
                     government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be

                     appreciated and directed respondents to extend benefits of pension, family

        letters nowhere indicate that the respondent-petitioner had declined to accept
        regularization. In the said circumstances, the combined offer made by
        petitioner to promote him and then to treat him as regularized was not accepted
        by the respondent-petitioner for his personal letters, but that cannot be
        construed to mean that he had declined regularization on the post he was
        occupying. The continuous occupancy of post remained for 27 years undisputed
        in said background judgment in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 as extracted in
