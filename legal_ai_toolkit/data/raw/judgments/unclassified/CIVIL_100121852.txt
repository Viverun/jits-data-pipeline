                                                                            NAVJEET        BUDHIRAJA

 proceedings, defendant no.1 was dropped and defendant no.2
expired on 26 August, 2011 following which her four children
being the legal representatives namely Sh. Sanjay Bansal, Smt.
Neeti Mittal, Smt. Preeti Goel and Smt. Radha Agarwal pursued
the suit. For the sake of convenience, I shall refer defendant no.2
by this identification only instead of referring to her LRs, save in
the final decision.



2.                 The aforesaid prayer of seeking possession of and
injunction in respect of the suit property became redundant in
view of defendant no.2 having given up her control over the suit
property and handing over its possession to the plaintiff in the
proceeding before the High Court of Delhi on 24.02.2020, which
is recorded in the order dated 13.03.2020 of this Court. Needless
to say, the suit proceeded further in regard to the remaining
prayers.



3.                 Before I set to adjudicate on myriad issues flagged
on either side, let me spell out laconically the landscape of the
pleadings.



4.                 The case, as initially set up by the plaintiff, was that
by means of sale deed dated 29.07.1964, registered with Sub-

Registrar II, New Delhi on 03.08.1964, suit property was sold by
DLF to Lieutenant Colonel Harjeet Singh (hereinafter, would be
referred as 'Colonel'), who became the owner thereof. The suit
property is measuring 266 sq. mts. (318 sq. yards), located in R-
Block, facing East and abutting 60 ft. wide road. Colonel
constructed a two and quarter story residential house on the suit

                                                                               by NAVJEET

                                                                   NAVJEET     BUDHIRAJA
                                                                   BUDHIRAJA   Date: 2023.10.09
                                                                               15:43:35 +0530
 property which was let out to 'Mr. Pires's Pvt. School' through
its proprietor Mr. Pires at a monthly rent of Rs.1,800/- w.e.f
01.10.1971 for three years. On expiry of the three years, the lease
was extended and a deed dated 27.09.1974 was executed. The
extended lease period expired in September, 1977 and as the
Colonel was about to retire, he implored Mr. Pires to vacate the
suit property, but in vain.




5.                 Colonel then filed an eviction petition on the ground
of bona fide requirement before the Rent Controller, Delhi, the
petition no. being 965 of 1978, in which Mr. Pires was
summoned, who filed an affidavit seeking leave, which was
granted to him. In the meanwhile, Mr. Pires died on 19.11.1980
leaving behind his son Mr. Alan St John Pires and daughter Ms.
Joyce Pires. The eviction petition remained pending, while the
Colonel also died on 15.01.1982, who was then survived by his
widow Smt. Jitender Kaur, his son Sh. Manjit Inder Singh and
his daughter Ms. Maninderjit Kaur. By the deed dated
25.05.1983, daughter Ms. Maninderjit Kaur relinquished her
right, title and interest in the suit property in favor of her mother
and brother. The eviction petition was continued by them.



6.                 By order dated 08.12.1985, the then Additional Rent
Controller Sh. A.K. Garg dismissed the eviction petition holding
that the purpose of letting being residential cum commercial, the
ground of bona fide requirement was not available. Civil
Revision No. 214 of 1986 was filed there against, which came to
be dismissed in default.

                                                                              Digitally signed

                                                                           by NAVJEET
                                                                 NAVJEET   BUDHIRAJA
                                                                 BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09
                                                                              15:43:44 +0530


 7.                 The widow and the son (who were now the owners
of one-half share each), filed an eviction petition on the ground
of sub-letting. The Colonel's widow also filed a petition for
eviction under Section 14D. (Both these petitions were later
decided against her/successor)



8.                 The plaint further asserts that in the meanwhile Mr.
Pires abandoned the suit property, the precise date of which is
not clear, but in any case it was after 1984. Smt. Seema Bansal,
the original defendant no.2, was an employee of Pires's Pvt.
School, who later self-styled herself as Principal and defendant
no.1 Sh. Surinder K. Bansal was her husband.



9.                 It is further alleged that before the owners could take
over the suit property, the defendant no.2 found it convenient to
unauthorizedly enter in it, which amounted to trespass.
Defendant no.2, ostensibly, started alleging herself to be the
partner of Mr. Pires's Pvt. School and, therefore, a tenant in the
suit property. To avoid the controversy, the previous owners
impleaded defendant no.2 Smt. Seema Bansal as the respondent
to the eviction petitions with the following description:

                       "22.To avoid controversy, the
                       previous owners impleaded Seema
                       Bansal as a respondent to the eviction
                       petitions     with    the    following
                       description:-

                       2 Mrs. Seema Bansal (S. Bansal)
                       alleged partner of Pires's Pvt. School,
                       R-96, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi
                       (The Petitioners, however, do not
                       admit S.Bansal as Partner of Pire's
                       Pvt. School, as alleged by her)."

 10.                Defendant no.2, had in the meantime acquired a
residential house at M-148, Greater Kailash-II, and shifted there
along with her children.



11.                The widow of Colonel sold her interest in the suit
property to the plaintiff who purchased the same by means of
sale deed dated 19.02.1992 and the son of the Colonel also sold
his one-half share to the plaintiff. Thus, w.e.f 19.02.1992, the
plaintiff became the absolute owner of the suit property. When
the plaintiff apprised the defendants having become the owner of
the suit property, it was replied that when the Colonel and his
wife could not evict them, the plaintiff should have little hope,
but there was an offer to increase the rent from Rs.1,800/- to
Rs.3,498/- per month.



12.                The plaintiff, after some investigation, found out
that the claim of defendant no.2 being a partner in the school was
false. The plaintiff attempted to reason out with her to get back
the possession of the suit property but to no avail. Accordingly,
the plaintiff was left with no option, but to bring the present suit.



13.                The plaint is contested on behalf of defendant no.2
with vehemence. The preliminary objections flagged are that the
plaint does not disclose any cause of action, is vague and
misconceived. The present suit is barred by time and is also bad
for mis-joinder of parties. The suit of the plaintiff is based on the
sale deed dated 19.02.1992, alleged to have been executed by
Smt. Jitender Kaur, but necessary particulars of its registration in
the office of Sub-Registrar have not been disclosed. The plaintiff

 has no locus standi to file the present suit as Smt. Jitender Kaur
from whom the plaintiff has alleged to have purchased the suit
property was not the owner on 19.02.1992 as defendant no.2
Smt. Seema Bansal became the owner by adverse possession in
October 1989, which in fact started from October 1977, when
there was a positive act of ouster on her part and when she got
the exclusive possession of the suit property and when she
asserted hostile title and from that time onwards her possession
had been open, continuous, hostile, peaceful and uninterrupted.



14.                It is further canvassed that the fact of adverse
possession of defendant no.2 is also evident from the pleadings
of the plaintiff where it is alleged that the suit property was
abandoned by Mr. Pires. The plaintiff has intentionally omitted to
give the date of abandonment and the time of actual, physical
and hostile possession of defendant no.2 started w.e.f October
1977. It is further alleged that the title of defendant no.2 was
even perfected against LRs of deceased Colonel and, thus,
plaintiff cannot be said to have acquired any right, title or interest
with respect to the suit property. The school was being run by
defendant no.2 in the suit property in her own right, without any
interference from anybody. It is also alleged that neither the site
plan of the suit property nor its boundaries have been given in
the plaint so as to identify it.

15.                The further combat is to the effect that in the
petition under 
section 14 (1) (b)
 of Delhi Rent Control Act [
DRC
Act
] the plaintiff has stated against the ground for eviction that
without any consent in writing                              of the plaintiff and her
predecessors, the erstwhile tenant, sub-let, assigned and parted

                                                                                       15:44:11 +0530
 with possession to respondent no.2 (Defendant no.2 herein)
subsequent to 1974 and had accordingly prayed before the Rent
Controller that the eviction order with costs be passed in favor of
the petitioner and against the respondent. The said petition was
dismissed on 17.05.1996, a date well after the filing of plaint,
written statement, replication and framing of issues. This had
necessitated filing of amended written statement under 
Order 6
Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908 [
CPC
]. The present
suit is barred in view of 
Section 50
 of DRC Act, read with other
provisions read with averments in the plaint, amended written
statement. The judgment dated 17.05.1996 even otherwise
operates as res-judicata and the present suit cannot be tried.




16.                On merits, defendants have substantially dis-
affirmed the contents of the plaint. It is reiterated that defendant
no.2 is holding the suit property in adverse possession without
any interruption since October 1977 onwards. Mr. Maurice
Wilfred Pires died on 19.11.1980 and the Colonel died on
15.01.1982 and the said Smt. Jitender Kaur, Sh. Manjit Inder
Singh and Ms. Maninderjit Kaur were the legal heirs of the
Colonel. It is though denied that any right was relinquished vide
deed dated 25.05.1983.



17.                It is further alleged that the widow and Smt. Jitender
Kaur were not the owners of the suit property and the eviction
petition was filed on false averments, which eventually came to
be dismissed on 17.05.1996. The eviction petition, prior to this,

examined on behalf of the plaintiff. Defendant no.2 also got
examined DW2 Sh. Tanuj Kumar Bhatnagar vide his affidavit
Ex.DW2/A and his report Ex.DW2/1, who was also cross
examined on behalf of the plaintiff. Defendant's evidence was
thereafter put to rest, paving the path for final arguments.



27.                Ld. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff Dr. Arun Mohan
broached the case by narrating and relating the facts of the plaint,
the written statement and the replication. Ld. counsel also
attracted the attention of the court to the history of the case by
adumbrating upon various time lines and how the case unfolded
over three decades. Ld. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff also
riveted the attention of the court to the germane extracts of the
cross examination of defendant witnesses and argued for the
grant of the mesne profits and the compound interest with the
support of various case laws of High Court and Supreme Court.



28.                Ld. Senior counsel for the plaintiff highlighted the
manner in which the defendant no.2 allegedly abused the process
of the law for almost thirty years and how the defendant no.2
held on to the possession of the suit property on the pretext of a
false, flimsy and frivolous ground of adverse possession. Ld.
Senior Counsel carved out a distinction between the defence of
denial and affirmative false claim which has been put forth by

 the defendant and which in his view tantamount to gross abuse of
the process of the law and further stressed that no one can be
permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. Ld. Counsel for
the plaintiff also adverted to the affidavit of DW1/LR of the
defendant to punch holes in the defence sought to be projected on
behalf of defendant no.2.




29.                In order to embolden the submissions advanced, Ld.
Senior counsel for the plaintiff also took the court through the
excerpts of various judgments to emphasize that where the
litigants, on the strength of false pleadings and documents,
manage to procrastinate the litigation, the court must apply the
principle of restitution in a pragmatic manner in order to do real
and substantial justice.

                            restitution of, or for, property or
                           benefits received under such
                           circumstances as to give rise to a
                           legal or equitable obligation to
                           account therefor. It is a general
                           principle, underlying various legal
                           doctrines and remedies, that one
                           person should not be permitted
                           unjustly to enrich himself at the
                           expense of another, but should be
                           required to make restitution of or
                           for property or benefits received,
                           retained, or appropriated, where it
                           is just and equitable that such
                           restitution be made, and where
                           such action involves no violation
                           or frustration of law or opposition
                           to public policy, either directly or
                           indirectly."


                           179. Unjust enrichment is basic to
                           the subject of restitution, and is
                           indeed       approached      as     a
                           fundamental principle thereof.

                           They are usually linked together,
                           and restitution is frequently based
                           upon the theory of unjust
                           enrichment. However, although
                           unjust enrichment is often referred
                           to or regarded as a ground for
                           restitution, it is perhaps more
                           accurate to regard it as a
                           prerequisite, for usually there can
                           be no restitution without unjust
                           enrichment. It is defined as the
                           unjust retention of a benefit to the
                           loss of another or the retention of
                           money or property of another
                           against the fundamental principles
                           of justice or equity and good
                           conscience. A person is enriched if
                           he has received a benefit, and he is
                           unjustly enriched if retention of the
                           benefit would be unjust. Unjust
                           enrichment of a person occurs
                           when he has and retains money or
                           benefits which in justice and
                           equity belong to another.

34.                Ld. Senior Counsel for plaintiff, to further
emphasize on the aspect of measure of damages in case of illegal
trespass, alluded to the judgment of High Court of Madras in 
K
Pandurangan Vs. Mrs. C Parimala
, date of decision
23.12.2021. Ld. Senior Counsel for plaintiff devoted sufficient
time to take the court through this judgment to hammer home the
point that a trespasser's liability should be one of reparation of
which restitution is a part.




35.                In so far as arguments on behalf of defendant no.2
are concerned, Ld. Counsel Sh. Pawan Mathur also advanced
marathon and comprehensive arguments, which I shall advert to
in the discussion indicated infra. In the written submissions on
behalf of defendant no.2 also, it is noticed that some of the
arguments were duplicative, beyond pleadings and not relevant
to the facts in issue. Therefore, I deem it prudent to only allude to
relevant arguments.



36.                At the outset, I decide the objections raised on
behalf of defendant no.2 at the time of tendering of evidence by
PW1. With regard to general power of attorney Ex.PW1/1,
photographs Ex.PW1/2 (colly) and Ex.PW1/3 (colly), no
objection was raised. With regard to google satellite image
Ex.PW1/4, an objection was raised that it is not accompanied by

 certificate under 
Section 65B
 of Indian Evidence Act, which
objection is found to be valid and is accepted as this document
appears to be a computer generated and the certificate is
mandatory. With regard to the four visiting cards Mark PW1/5
(colly) also, an objection was raised on the ground that PW1 is
not the author/witness to the same nor the same was part of the
pleading or record. This objection is also valid and these visiting
cards cannot be read in evidence. A letter dated 08.09.2016 Mark
PW1/6 also was objected to on the same ground, which objection
is also found to be valid and this document also cannot be read in
evidence. With regard to valuation report dated 28.03.1996
Ex.PW1/7 of Sh. T S Ratnam also, an objection was raised,
however, this objection is rejected as pointed out by Ld. counsel
for plaintiff that the said valuation report was filed by defendant
himself. With regard to 54 certified lease deeds also, an objection
was raised but which objection was removed by examining PW2
and exhibiting the lease deeds through the registrar office.




37.                Before I get poised to render finding on the two
issues framed vide order dated 13.03.2020 as already noted in the
preceding discussion, I would like to throw a succinct outline
again, following which, I shall deal with the plethora of the
arguments, factual and legal advanced on behalf of both the sides
and alongside that I shall also dwell upon the evidence led by
both the sides and various case laws on the aspect of mesne
profits.

the plaintiff against defendant no.1 and 2 for seeking possession

 of the suit property, recovery of damages/mesne profits for the
period from 09.02.1992 onwards, among other reliefs. During the
course of the proceedings, defendants contested the suit tooth and
nail. In the meanwhile, defendant no.1 claimed to be unrelated to
the suit property and sought to be subtracted from the array of
parties, and eventually he was dropped. Defendant no.2, wife of
the defendant no.1, proceeded with her contest, who claimed to
have become the owner of the suit property by way of adverse
possession in October 1989, her adverse possession having
started with effect from October 1977. Statement of defendant
no.2 was also recorded under 
Order 10 CPC
 on 15.05.1995
wherein also she postulated to be partners with Sh. Pires in the
school which was a tenant in the suit property and that later she
bought the school from Sh. Pires and after his death, she became
the owner of the school as well as the suit property. She further
claimed having been depositing the rent of the suit property in
the court and stated that though her possession of the suit
property was that of a tenant, but she became the owner being in
occupation of the suit property for more than 12 years. She was
pertinent to clarify that her claim was only on adverse
possession.




39.                During the course of further proceedings, defendant
no.2 sought to amend her aforesaid suit but her attempts were
scotched, particularly vide order dated 10.01.2018 whereby her
application under 
Order 6 Rule 17 CPC
 came to be dismissed
with the cost of Rs.30,000/-. It can be culled out from the
paragraph 4 of the said order that by way of the said application,
defendant sought to make the following amends:

                        "4. By way of present application,
                       following amendments are sought in
                       WS:-

                       "(a) The defendant as an employee of
                       Mr. Pires' Pvt School was authorized
                       to occupy the suit premises. The suit
                       premises has always been and
                       continues to be in possession of Mr.
                       Pires' Pvt School being run by the
                       defendant and hence the Defendant
                       cannot be regarded as trespasser.

                       (b) The Defendant is in occupation as
                       co-tenant.

                       (c) In view of previous proceedings
                       before the Rent Controller instituted
                       by the plaintiff's predecessor in
                       interest, the plaintiff is estopped from
                       alleging that the Defendant is a
                       trespasser. The plaintiff cannot
                       approbate and reprobate.

                       (d) In view of the fact that the
                       defendant was granted leave to defend
                       u/s 25B(4) in the proceedings
 u/s
                       14(1)(e)
, 
14(1)(b)
 and 
14(D)
 of the
                       DRC Act, which was not challenged
                       by the plaintiff's predecessor on the
                       ground that the defendant was a
                       trespasser and the said order having
                       attained finality
 u/s 43
 of the DRC
                       Act, consequently, the existence of
                       landlord-tenant relationship between
                       the parties stands established.

                       (e) In view of the fact that the
                       plaintiff's predecessor obtained orders
                       u/s 15(2) of the 
DRC Act
 for deposit
                       of rent; pursuant thereto the defendant
                       deposited the rent and the plaintiff's
                       predecessor withdrew the rent,
                       therefore, the same conclusively
                       establishes               landlord-tenant
                       relationship between the parties.

                       (f) Even before the Supreme Court,
                       the plaintiff admitted that the
                       defendant is assignee and the term
                       lessee in the lease agreement dated
                       27.09.1974 has been defined to
                       include assignee.

                       (g) In view of the fact that the tenancy
                       was determined in October 1977 and

                       Rent Controller, it has been the
                       consistent case of the defendant that
                       she is co-tenant of the suit premises.

                       The same is true even today."



40.                Post the dismissal of the aforesaid application,
defendant no. 2 challenged the said order before High Court of
Delhi and during the course of the proceedings therein, on
24.02.2020, defendant no.2 agreed to give up the possession of
the suit property and handed over the keys to the plaintiff. The
Hon'ble Judge of the High Court of Delhi then disposed of the
challenge and relegated the parties to the trial court for inquiry
into the claim of mesne profits.



41.                Issue no.1: Whether the plaintiff is entitled for
the relief of mesne profit/damages as claimed? OPP


i.                 The burden to prove this issue was upon plaintiff. I
would broach this issue with the most crucial argument raised on
behalf of plaintiff that in the aforesaid background the plaintiff is
already found entitled to mesne profits in the light of the
defendant no.2 having given up the possession of the suit
property after holding on to it for many years and now only
quantum of mesne profits is to be decided or as contended by Ld.

 Counsel for defendant no.2, the plaintiff has to first establish her
right and entitlement to claim the mesne profits and only then the
court can enter into the realm of quantifying the same. During
the course of in-extenso and comprehensive final arguments
spilling over to months, Ld. Counsel for defendant Sh. Pawan
Mathur was confronted with a query as to in what capacity
defendant no.2 held on to the possession of the suit property for
almost three decades after the institution of the suit and what
made her to finally give up the possession before High Court of
Delhi, to which, Ld. Counsel for would adopt a circuitous route
and eschewed coming up with a clean and clear response.
Though, he kept on harping that defendant no.2 being a partner
of Pires School was occupying the suit property in the capacity
of the tenant and just because she had given up the possession of
the suit property, it would not tantamount to the entitlement of
the plaintiff to claim mesne profits in respect of the suit property,
but, I respectfully differ on this count, as this argument is nothing
but a ruse to scupper the entitlement of the plaintiff to claim
mesne profits for the entire length of the period for which the
defendant no.2 held on to the suit property. But before I build
upon this view, some of the road blocks have to be cleared which
have been placed on behalf of defendant no.2 in the form of legal
arguments.

ii.                The first legal submission on behalf of defendant no.
2, as extracted from the written submission, is as under:

                                     fact that the plaintiff is
                                     pursuing eviction of the
                                     tenant under

                                     the plaintiff has prosecuted
                                     the litigation for the
                                     eviction of the tenant
                                     before the 
DRC Act
"



iii.               In furtherance of the aforementioned first legal
submission, Ld. Counsel for defendant ambitiously assailed the
case of the plaintiff and her pleading in the instant suit on the
back of the previous pleading on behalf of the plaintiff and her
predecessor which were in relation to the eviction of the tenant
by way of various petitions under 
DRC Act
. Ld. Counsel for
defendant argued that when the suit property was purchased by
the plaintiff, admittedly there was litigation pending in various
courts against the tenant Pires Private School, a partnership
concern and defendant no.2, and which fact is also evident from
the contents of sale deed executed in favour of the plaintiff.
Thus, the said tenant Pires Private Limited, a partnership concern
is the necessary and property party to the suit, and it has been
deliberately not impleaded by the plaintiff by the plaintiff with
mala-fide intention and to mislead the court. It is further the
argument that the trespass on the suit property by an alleged third
person after the alleged abandonment by the tenant cannot be
pleaded and proved without the tenant being impleaded as a
party to the suit and no order for possession of the suit property
can be sought.

                                                                                 15:46:45 +0530
 iv.                Ld. counsel for defendant further argued with
vehemence that it is an admitted case of the plaintiff as borne out
from various admitted documents that the tenant i.e. partnership
concern, Mr. Pires Private School was running the school in
which defendant no.2 was the principal and one of the partners.
In the previous litigations by erstwhile owner/landlord Colonel
and Smt. Jitender Kaur (wife), his son Sh. Manjit Inder Singh
and his daughter Ms. Maninderjit Kaur, an eviction petition
under 
Section 14(1)(b)
 of DRC Act was filed which after the
purchase of the suit property was continued by the plaintiff
herein wherein the categorical stand was that defendant no.2 was
a tenant in the suit property. It is further argued that even when
the plaintiff was pursuing this stand before the Ld. Rent
Controller that the tenant of the suit property was a partnership
concern and that defendant no.2 was sublet the suit property,
plaintiff on 10.11.93 filed this present suit on the false and
incorrect premise of the tenant being one individual Mr. Pires
and defendant no.2 being the trespasser, after the suit property
was abandoned by Mr. Pires. Though it is a specific and admitted
case of the plaintiff in paragraph 19 that defendant no.2 was an
employee of the school and was a teacher cum manager who
later called herself the Principal but still her status was shown
and pleaded to be that of trespasser.



v.                 Ld. Counsel for defendant thereafter took the court
through the proceedings of the previous litigation under the 
DRC
Act
 i.e. eviction petition under 
Section 14(1)(e)

instituted by Colonel against Mr. Pires Public School which was
dismissed vide order dated 03.12.1985 Ex.P1, the eviction

 petition filed his LRs under 
Section 14(1)(b)
 of DRC Act, and
eviction petition under 
Section 14(1)(D)
 of DRC Act, also filed
by LRs of Colonel. Ld. Counsel for defendant further argued that
plaintiff is to be held liable for concealment of all these facts and
for projecting the false case against the defendant no.2 of she
being the trespasser into the suit property. Ld. Counsel further
highlighted that an application under 
Order 22 Rule 10 CPC
 was
also filed by the plaintiff in the eviction petition under 
Section
14(1)(b)
 of the DRC Act with the sole intention of the preventing
this court from examining the document which could show that
the case of the plaintiff against defendant No.2 before the Ld.
Rent Controller was that the possession of the suit property was
handed over to defendant no.2 by the tenant and she was not a
trespasser under any circumstances. The said eviction petition
came to be dismissed by the rent court vide order dated
17.05.1996 Ex.D5. On this bedrock, Ld. Counsel further argued
that it is the plaintiff who is guilty of approbating and
reprobating rather than defendant no.2. In support of his
arguments, Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 has referred to the
following judgments:

A. Shyam Telelink Limited Vs. Union of India
, (2010) 10 SCC

165

B. Bharti Cellular Limited Vs. Union of India and Ors,
(2010) 10 SCC 174


vi.                It is further the stand of the defendant no.2 that in
light of the decision in the eviction petition under 
Section 14(1)


(b) of 
DRC Act
, defendant filed for the amendment of the written
statement, which was not opposed by the plaintiff and the

 amendment was allowed vide order dated 03.12.1996, but the
plaintiff deliberately did not file any replication thereto. The
replication dated 07.11.1994 in response to the original written
statement dated 16.08.1994 only goes on to show and
demonstrate that the suit filed by the plaintiff is false.




vii.               This contention, at the first blush, certainly appears
to be meritorious as it is an admitted position which is culled out
from various petitions under the 
DRC Act
, the record of which
has been filed in the present suit, however, Ld. Counsel for
defendant no.2 in his arguments has completely side lined and
abandoned the defence of the defendant no.2 having become
owner of the suit property by way of adverse possession,
probably for the reason that during the course of the proceeding,
defendant no.2 sought to divorce herself from this defence and
rather substitute the same by way of her being in occupation of
the suit property as a tenant. But as has already been noted, those
attempts of defendant no.2 were unsuccessful and she was not
permitted to make any amends.



viii.              The aforesaid legal submissions have also been
strongly opposed on behalf of the plaintiff, and rightly so, as on
the date when the plaintiff purchased the suit property by way of
registered sale deed the defendants herein were in occupation of
the suit property and in the written statement, defendants
nowhere flagged any such objection as to non-impleadment of
Pires Private School, probably for the reason that defendant no.2
projected herself to be the owner of the suit property by way of
adverse possession. 
In paragraph 5 of the written statement, she

 went on to challenge the locus of the plaintiff to file the present
suit on the back of assertions that Smt. Jitender Kaur from whom
the plaintiff alleged to have purchased the suit property was not
the owner on 19.02.1992 as defendant no.2 had become the
owner by way of adverse possession. She also pleaded that there
was a positive act of ouster on her part and when she asserted
hostile title and from that time onwards her possession had been
open, continuous, hostile, peaceful and uninterrupted and she
perfected her title over the suit property by way of adverse
possession even before the execution of the sale deed in favour
of the plaintiff. It is also noticed that at other stages of written
statement also, defendant no.2 tenaciously persisted with the
claim of her ownership over the suit property by way of adverse
possession. But there is nothing in the entire written statement
that the defendants were in occupation of the suit property in the
capacity of being a partner in Pires School and eventually as a
tenant. There is no pleading on the part of the defendant no.2 as
to in what capacity, she came to occupy the suit property. Rather,
in the written statement, she claimed that the school was being
run by her in her own right. Further, all these claims came to
naught and drew blank when the possession of the suit property
was handed over to the plaintiff, which act clearly debunks and
belies the version of defendant no.2 having gained ownership
over the suit property on the basis of adverse possession. Thus,
Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2, in my opinion, had no basis to
argue on this line and prolong the litigation.




ix.                Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 had also laid his
thrust upon the partnership theory by further relying upon the

 partnership deed Ex.D2 dated 07.01.1978 to assert that defendant
no.2 was in fact a partner with Sh. Pires in the Pires School.
However, this would also not advance the cause of defendant
no.2 as already noted that without any pleading in this regard,
this partnership deed cannot be said to be taken to be a
supplement to the said averment. DW1 in his extensive cross
examination also harped on his alleged plea of partnership of
defendant no.2 with Sh. Pires. Though DW1 claimed that
defendant no.2 entered into partnership with Sh. Pires in the year
1974, however, there is no evidence in regard to the inception of
the alleged partnership in the year 1974. Otherwise also as
already stated, since this statement was beyond pleading, the
testimony of DW1 on this score is hardly relevant.




x.                 Though, Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 sought to
find fault with the pleading of the plaintiff in the sense that the
pleading is bereft of the details as to when Mr. Pires abandoned
the suit property and defendant no.2 trespassed the same, and I
also agree with this to the extent that plaintiff ought to have come
clean on the details of the abandonment of the suit property and
wrongful entry of defendant no.2 in the same, but in view of the
aforesaid frivolous and vexatious claim of defendant                     no.2
having not yielded any result in her favour, the said omissions in
the plaint cannot be said to be fatal.



xi.                In so far as the previous petitions under the 
DRC
Act
 on behalf of the plaintiff are concerned, though, there is no
denial that at some point of time, the predecessor in interest of
the plaintiff was pursuing litigation against Pires Private School

 seeking its eviction which proceeding was taken over and
pursued by the plaintiff and which did not see fruition, however,
one of those petitions of 
DRC Act
 was contested by the
defendant on the ground of pendency of the present suit, which
fact was taken cognizance of by the Hon'ble Judge of the High
Court of Delhi in this case vide order dated 09.09.2009 wherein
it opined that the said conduct of defendant no.2 appears to be
mala fide and she cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate
at the same time and cannot oust the plaintiff from the
proceeding for eviction of defendant no.2. Therefore, continuing
with the said view, I am also of the opinion that this court has to
confine itself to the pleadings of the present suit without
embarking upon any inquiry as to the previous petitions between
the parties which may have been filed under the 
DRC Act
. What
is to be seen herein is that the defendant no.2 has taken an
unequivocal stand having been in possession of the suit property
on the basis of the ownership having accrued to her by way of
adverse possession and since defendant no.2 has given up the
possession of the suit property in a related proceeding before the
High Court of Delhi, it is obvious that the stand of the defendant
no.2 was specious, untruthful, and was nothing but a facade to
held on to and retain the illegal possession of the suit property,
thereby denuding the plaintiff of her right to enjoy the suit
property.



xii.               Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 also argued on the
lines that the annexures filed along with the pleadings constitute
the part of the pleadings, and therefore, even if in the written
statement of defendant no.2, there is no pleading qua her

 occupation of the suit property as the tenant, the previous
proceedings of 
DRC Act
 can be taken into consideration. To
assert the point that the annexures to the plaint are part of the
pleadings, reliance is placed on behalf of the defendant no.2 on
the following pronouncements:

xiii.              The aforesaid argument, in the context of the factual
position of the present suit, cannot help the case of the defendant
no.2 as the annexures cannot substitute and take the place of
pleadings. The annexures filed along with the pleadings must
supplement the pleadings rather than run contrary to it. As noted

 above, the written statement on behalf of defendant no.2 does not
contain any pleading as to her occupation of the suit property as
tenant and also that there is no such pleading of the present suit
being bad for non-impleadment of a proper or necessary party,
therefore, I do not find any merit in the aforesaid legal
submission. The Judgments referred are clearly on distinct
setting and are of no help.




xiv.               In this backdrop, I also feel the urge to examine
whether a person can take an alternative plea of adverse
possession and tenancy. The High Court of Delhi had an
opportunity to deal with somewhat similar situation in Hansraj
Vs. Raghubir Singh and others, RFA No. 633/2014, decided
on 09.01.2020. The issue therein in brief was that the
respondents were admitted to be the owners of the suit property
and the appellant/tenants used to pay rental. The appellant later
sought to claim his ownership by way of adverse possession and
challenged the order of Trial Court under 
Order 12 Rule 6 CPC

before the High Court of Delhi on the pretext that the civil court
did not have the jurisdiction as the suit was barred by 
DRC Act
.
The Court therein held that though it is a settled law that the

DRC Act
 proceeds on an assumption that there exists a
relationship of landlord/tenant between the parties and in case of
mere denial of such, rent tribunal is an authority to determine the
such question. But it was further held that there is no cavil with
said proposition of law but that does not mean that the person
claiming to be a landlord cannot proceed by filing a civil suit by
relying upon the pleading of the tenant before the competent
authority. 
Once the appellant claims to be in adverse possession

                                                                         2023.10.09
                                                                         15:47:56 +0530
 of the premise, he cannot allege himself to be a tenant as both
these pleas cannot exist together. The principle that once a tenant
always a tenant ends on taking plea of adverse possession and
ascertaining one's owner right.



xv.                In the instant case also, we are somewhat confronted
with a situation where on one hand predecessor in interest of the
plaintiff and thereafter the plaintiff pursued the proceeding under

Section 14
 of DRC Act wherein defendant no.2 was also
impleaded as an alleged tenant, and on the other hand, plaintiff
has filed the present suit on the bedrock of the defendant no.2
having been in unlawful possession of the suit property being a
trespasser. We have already noted that the Hon'ble Judge of the
High Court of Delhi, when the suit was being dealt with therein,
had held in order dated September 9, 2009 that the plaintiff
cannot be ousted from the jurisdiction of this court in view of the
divergent stand of the defendant no.2. Now since the case is
about to achieve finality, this issue has to be dealt with in
accordance with the legal principle of law. In my view, once the
plaintiff has taken the stand before Ld. Rent Controller in various
petitions under 
Section 14
 of DRC Act that defendant no.2 was a
tenant in the suit property (though plaintiff sought to justify that
she was impleaded as alleged to be a tenant), those proceedings
ought to have been taken to its logical conclusion in Appellate
Court even if the reliefs claimed therein eluded the plaintiff
before the Rent Tribunal, but eventually plaintiff chose to pursue
the present suit, and therefore, now this situation has to be
reconciled on the basis of the respective pleadings of both the
parties. As we have noted in the aforesaid case law of High Court

                                                                         Digitally signed

 of Delhi that the plea of adverse                            possession is mutually
destructive vis a vis the plea of tenancy under the 
DRC Act
 and
on this premise the court had upheld the order of eviction passed
in the civil suit, but in this case, the plaintiff has not complied
with the formalities as envisaged in the Transfer of Properties
Act for forfeiture of the lease, for the reason that the plaintiff in
the present suit has not acknowledged the capacity of the
defendant no.2 being in possession of the suit property as a
tenant. Be that as it may, since defendant no.2 has failed to stick
to her guns of staking her claim over the suit property on the
basis of adverse possession after having given up the physical
possession thereto in favour of the plaintiff, defendant no.2
cannot be accorded the benefit of this flaw in the suit of the
plaintiff. Plaintiff cannot be left in lurch after having fought this
litigation for almost three decades due to the illegal act of
defendant no.2 in continuing in the suit property despite knowing
the legal right of the plaintiff over the suit property.



xvi.               Now before I part with this issue, if I, for once,
assume that defendant no.2 was once a partner with Pires School
of Pires who was a tenant as alleged and later she occupied the
suit property as tenant and that she cannot be termed as a
trespasser, there arise some lingering questions in my mind and
whether defendant no.2 has any valid explanations to those. First
is, after the death of Pires, legally did the partnership survive
between him and defendant no. 2? Second, did defendant no.2
attempt to forge partnership with legal heirs of Pires to take the
alleged partnership forward? Third, did defendant no.2 attempt to
rent the suit property from colonel or his representatives after the

                                                                             2023.10.09
                                                                             15:48:12 +0530
 death of Pires? The answer to all these questions is "No". And
why she did not tread on any of the aforesaid path, because she
was driven by the greed and avarice to take over the entire school
first and eventually the suit property, and it is this wanton greed
which made her audacious enough to even challenge the
ownership of Colonel family, the erstwhile owner and later the
plaintiff's title for more than 25 years. In this view of the matter,
I fail to fathom as to on what grounds defendant no.2 claim to be
exonerated from the liability to compensate the plaintiff.



xvii.              The second legal submission on behalf of defendant
is that the power of attorney was not filed on behalf of the
plaintiff with the leave of the court. It was argued that PW1 Sh.
Sanjay Goel could not have appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in
the present suit and the alleged attorney dated 02.02.2021
Ex.PW1/1            was       not      filed       by        this   witness   with    the
leave/permission of the court. It was argued that the plaintiff had
to file all the documents before the court at the time of filing of
the suit or replication, which was not done and thus, this power
of attorney along with the evidence by way of affidavit of PW1
cannot be read in evidence.



xviii.             The third legal submission is also in regard to power
of attorney only and which is that the same has not been proved
in accordance with law. It is argued that the original of the said
power of attorney has not been filed in the court record and the
photocopy Ex.PW1/1 cannot be said to have been proved in
accordance with law. Further, it is argued that since the plaintiff's
witness has not identified and proved the signatures of the

 plaintiff on the document as required under the provision of 67 of

Indian Evidence Act
 1872, the said special power of attorney
cannot be said to be proved. It is further argued that the executant
of the said attorney has not entered into the witness box nor any
attesting witness has been examined as per 
Section 68
 of Indian
Evidence Act 1872.




xix.               The fourth legal submission is that the said power of
attorney has not been proved as per the 
Notaries Act
 1956 and
the Notaries Rules 1956. The arguments in this regard, as culled
out from the written submission on behalf of the defendant, are
as under:

                       "
Section 8
 of the Notaries Act, 1952

                       Sub-section (a) provides that the
                       function of the Notary is to verify,

 Anr, AIR 2007 SC 2025


xxi.               As against the aforesaid arguments, on behalf of the
plaintiff, it was submitted that since in the present suit, the issues
pertaining to the recovery of the possession of the suit property
have already been dropped in the light of the defendant no.2
having ceded the ground, the only issue remains to be decided is
the quantum of mesne profits and since that is primarily in the
nature of a judicial inquiry, plaintiff being a senior citizen aged
about 66 years, was unable to appear and depose before the court
owing to covid-19 crisis and, therefore, she executed a special
power of attorney in favor of PW1 only for the purpose of
producing certified copies of rent deed and mathematic
calculation.




xxii.              Alongside the discussion on the aforesaid issue,
another legal submission can also be ensnared herein that the
plaintiff has not entered into the witness box herself and not
tendered herself to cross examine and thus, adverse interference
has to be drawn against her.



xxiii.             I, to some extent, concur with the submission of Ld.
Senior counsel for the plaintiff that since defendant no.2 has
already surrendered her alleged claim of ownership in respect of
the suit property and peaceful possession thereto has been handed
over to the plaintiff, the substantial issues framed earlier have
been subtracted and replaced by the two issues which only touch
upon the aspect of the grant of mesne profits and interest thereof
in favour of the plaintiff and therefore, even if the plaintiff

                                                                       by NAVJEET

 herself has not entered into the witness box to depose qua the
same, the cause of action in so far as the mesne profits are
concerned does not get impeded as can be gathered from the
judgment of division bench of High Court of Delhi in 
National
Radio and Electronic Corporation Vs. Motion Pictures
Association
, 122 (2005) DLT 629 that even if no substantial
evidence is led by the plaintiff in respect of the rent of the
properties, judicial notice can be taken thereof to appreciate the
rate of rent and fix the quantum thereto. This would also
somehow strengthen the argument of Ld. Senior Counsel for the
plaintiff that the assessment of grant and quantum of the mesne
profits is in the realm of being an inquiry and thus, it can be
safely concluded that even if there is no evidence led by the
plaintiff who is claiming his/her entitlement to the grant of the
mesne profits, the court can take judicial notice of the prevalent
rate of rent of any particular area and proceed to pass the
necessary order. Therefore, the contention of the defendant that
plaintiff was incumbent upon to enter into the witness box and
subject herself to cross examination, does not hold any water.
The judgments relied upon in this regard are facts centric and
completely distinguishable as in none of those cases, the
testimony of the attorney was limited to the extent of mesne
profits.




xxiv.              In so far as competency of PW1 Sh. Sanjay Goel is
concerned, I take the discussion forward by dealing with the legal
objections raised in regard to the admissibility of power of
attorney Ex.PW1/1. The first submission in this regard is that the
plaintiff had not sought the leave of the court to get PW1

 examined as her special power of attorney holder and, therefore,
his affidavit is of no value to the present suit. Ld. Counsel for
defendant no.2 also argued that PW1 did not have any personal
knowledge relating to the present suit and his testimony is based
on the knowledge gained either from the plaintiff or the counsel.



xxv.               Further, to buttress his arguments that special power
of attorney holder cannot depose on the merits of the case in
place of the plaintiff, reliance is placed upon the following
judgments:

xxvi.              Before coming to grips with this issue, let us have a
glance at the cross examination of PW1 on this aspect. PW1 was
cross examined as to when did he meet the plaintiff for the first
time and where, to which he replied having met the plaintiff
about five to six months before his deposition in the office of
Advocate Sh. Arvind Bhatt. PW1 was then also questioned as to
why did he choose to represent the plaintiff in the present case
which is pending since 1993 despite only knowing her five to six
months, to which he responded that he was associated with

                                                                         15:49:42 +0530
 charitable institution and in connection with a matter similar to
the present case, he entered into discussion with the plaintiff
during which plaintiff desired to donate money for some good
cause if recovered as mesne profits and for this reason, PW1 was
appointed as representative of the plaintiff.




xxvii.             To the query that whatever has been stated in the
affidavit of PW1 was informed to him by the plaintiff or her
counsel, PW1 affirmed that his statement in the affidavit was on
the basis of the information provided by the plaintiff as well as
counsel and also on the basis of the record which he had seen.



xxviii.            There is no yardstick to assess as to when a person
can become competent to appear as a witness for other person.
Thus, the fact that PW1 was acquainted with the plaintiff only for
5-6 months before his deposition is no bar to discard his
testimony. In this regard, I observe that by virtue of 
Section 118

of Evidence Act, 1872, all persons are competent to appear as a
witness who are capable of understanding the questions and
giving rational response thereto. The exception carved out is in
respect of those persons who owing to some disability are unable
to depose before the court. It is not the case herein that PW1 Sh.
Sanjay Goel was incompetent to appear as a witness being unable
to understand the questions and respond thereto. There is no
impediment in him appearing as a witness subject only to the
embargo of not deposing anything about the act or the transaction
of which plaintiff only had the personal knowledge.

 observed in paragraph 10 that evidence of a person is governed
by the 
Evidence Act, 1872
, and any person who is aware of the
facts of the case and whose evidence would be of relevance is
competent to depose. A witness can depose as per facts in his
knowledge or as per records.




xxix.              Keeping in line with the aforesaid view that a
witness can depose as per records, I further rely upon 
Bhimppa
and Ors Vs. Allisab and Ors
, 27.02.2006, Karnataka High
Court, which held in para 15 that it is open to the plaintiff to
examine the power of attorney holder, to produce the documents
through him, mark the same and examine witnesses to prove the
said documents if it is denied.




xxx.               Therefore, the contention that the evidence of a
power of attorney holder cannot prove the case of the plaintiff in
all cases is not correct and that is not the law 
laid down by
 the
Supreme Court in 
Janki Vashdeo Bhojwani Vs. Indusind Bank
Ltd
, (2005) 2SCC 217 which is also relied by Ld. Counsel for
Defendant no.2. But, Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 is correct to
the extent that the testimony of PW1 in this case on the aspects
not within his knowledge, and of which knowledge has been
gained from the plaintiff and her counsel as admitted by him in
his cross-examination, cannot be read in evidence.
 
Thus, the
testimony of PW1 can be read and considered only to the extent
of furnishing the comparable lease deeds on record and nothing
more than that, meaning thereby that his deposition that liability
of the four defendants is joint and several, images of visiting

 Principal Ms. Radha Agarwal Ex. PW1/6, cannot be considered.
The other Judgments relied on behalf of defendant no.2 need not
be referred to as there is no dispute qua the legal position cited
therein.



xxxi.              It has been further argued on behalf of defendant
no.2 that the notarization of special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1
has not been in consonance with the 
Notaries Act
 1952 and the
Notaries Rules. Further, there is no notarial adhesive fee stamp
affixed as per column no.6 of the notarial register as detailed in
Form 15 of the Notaries Rules 1956. Also, it was argued that in
terms of the provision of 
Section 85
 of the Indian Evidence Act,
it cannot be presumed that the special power of attorney
Ex.PW1/1 was executed and authenticated by notary public as
the same does not contain the signature of the notary and the
authentication certificate.



xxxii.             A power of attorney is a mode of creating an express
agency. It is a written instrument executed by a principal to
appoint an agent to act for the principal in one or more
transactions. There is no specific mode prescribed for the
execution of power of attorney. Yet it is not uncommon to
notarize the execution of the power of attorney. An aspect of
notarization is governed by provision of 
Notaries Act
 1952.
Under the said act, a notary is appointed by Centre or State to do
specified acts inter alia to verify authenticate, certify or attest the
execution of any instrument. Further, under the provision of

Section 85
 of Indian Evidence Act, a power of attorney executed
before and authenticated by notary public carries a presumption

 that it was properly executed.



xxxiii.            In Smt. Kamla Rani and Ors Vs. Texmaco Ltd,
MANU/DE/7343/2007, High Court of Delhi explained the
effect of notarization as follows:

                                     "Authentication       by     a
                                     notary public is a solemn
                                     act performed by the notary
                                     public whose duty is to
                                     ensure that the executant is
                                     the person before him and
                                     is    identified     to    his
                                     satisfaction.       Once     a
                                     document is authenticated
                                     by a notary public, it will
                                     be presumed that the
                                     document         was      duly
                                     executed and was in order.

                                     The use of the expression
                                     'shall presume' shows that
                                     the section is mandatory
                                     and the court has to
                                     presume that all necessary
                                     requirements for the proper
                                     execution of the power of
                                     attorney were duly fulfilled
                                     before the notary public. As
                                     observed in AIR 1984 363
                                     E.C. & E. Co. Ltd. v. J.E.
                                     Works, if 2 conditions are
                                     satisfied, firstly the power
                                     of attorney being executed
                                     before a notary public and
                                     secondly         it      being
                                     authenticated by a notary
                                     public, a presumption
                                     would arise under Section
                                     85 about the executant of
                                     the power of attorney.

                                     34. Onus would thus lie on
                                     the opposite party to prove
                                     to the contrary.

                                     35. It is well settled that
                                     authentication would mean
                                     more than mere execution.

 
Where          proof        of
                                     authentication       surfaces,

xxxiv.             While a power of attorney executed before and
authenticated by notary carries a presumption as to its due
execution, the absence of such authentication would not render
the document invalid. Explaining this aspect, Delhi High Court in
case titled as 
Grafitek International Vs. K K Kaura
, 2002
SCC Online DLT held as under:




                                     "Merely because the power
                                     of attorney is not duly
                                     notarized does not mean
                                     that the concerned person
                                     was not authorized to
                                     institute      the        suit.

                                     Notarization            raises
                                     presumption as to its
                                     authentication and no more.

                                     Notarization of power of
                                     attorney is a matter of
                                     procedure and raises the
                                     presumption of authority of
                                     the person to institute the
                                     suit. In other words, it does
                                     not mean that power of
                                     attorney executed in favor
                                     of a particular person but
                                     not duly notarized does not
                                     confer power upon the
                                     person to institute the suit".



xxxv.              It is, thus, clear from the aforenoted judgment that
the authentication of the document by a notary public would raise
a presumption of the document being duly executed and in order.
However, notarization is a matter of procedure and it does not
mean that power of attorney executed in the favour of a particular
person but not duly notarized does not confer any power upon the
said person. The implication of this for the present case would be

 that if the special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1 has been proved
to be duly notarized as per the 
Notaries Act
 1952 and the
Notaries Rules 1956 then a presumption under 
Section 85
 of
Indian Evidence Act can be raised as to its authenticity, thereby
dispensing with the requirement of its formal proof. But the
perusal of the special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1 reveals that
the same is lacking in fulfilling the compliances as per the

Notaries Act
 1952 as pointed out by Ld. Counsel for defendant
no.2 in detail as I do not find any authentication being done by
the concerned notary or any identification being done in the form
of issuing a particular number which gets entered in the notarial
register as per the Notaries Rules 1956. In fact, the attorney does
not reveal the signatures and identification of the Notary. Thus, to
this extent, the arguments advanced on behalf of defendant no. 2
are meritorious and the necessary presumption as enunciated in

Section 85
 of Indian Evidence Act cannot be raised herein.



xxxvi.             The other way to prove the special power of attorney
was to examine its author who is the plaintiff herein to the effect
that she has executed the special power of attorney in favour of
PW1 Sh. Sanjay Goel to depose in the present suit. It is a matter
of record that plaintiff has not examined herself to prove the
special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1 but it is to be seen now
whether at the time of marking and tendering of special power of
attorney in evidence by PW1, any objection was raised on behalf
of defendant no.2 as to mode of proof of the said attorney.



xxxvii.            At this juncture, I deal with the argument of Ld.
Counsel for Defendant no.2 that mere marking or exhibit on a

 document does not amount to its proof and in this regard, he has
relied upon the judgment of Supreme Court of India in 
Life
Insurance Corporation of India and Another Vs Ram Pal
Singh Bisen
, (2010) 4 SCC 491.




xxxviii.           Ld. counsel further highlighted that the parties who
allege any document to be bogus has to prove nothing until the
party relying upon the document establishes its genuineness,
which was held by the Supreme Court of India in 
Subhra
Mukherjee Vs. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd
, AIR 2000 SC 1203.


Ld. counsel further referred to judgment in 
Rajwati Devi Vs.
Joint
 director, AIR 1989 Patna 66, in support of his arguments
that if no witness is examined for proving the document, it
amounts to procedural infirmity.




xxxix.             The examination in chief of PW1 dated 27.02.2021
does not reveal that at the time of tendering the special power of
attorney in evidence as Ex.PW1/1 any objection was raised as to
the mode of proof of this document. It is a settled legal position
that the objection with regard to the mode and manner of proof of
a document has to be raised at the time of marking/exhibition of
the document and in case of failure on the part of the opposite
party to raise any such objection, he/she is precluded to raise it at
the later stage. 
In this regard, I hereby rely upon the judgment of

R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami
& V.P. Temple & Anr
, date of decision 08.10.2003 wherein the
Supreme Court has laid down the following salutary principle
which has been followed in catena of judgments.

                                     was held that this objection

                                     the trial court. It was
                                     observed:


                                     "The defendants have now
                                     appeal to the Majesty in
                                     Council, and the case has
                                     been argued on their behalf
                                     in great detail. It was urged
                                     in the course of the
                                     argument that a registered
                                     copy of the will of 1898
                                     was admitted in evidence
                                     without              sufficient
                                     foundation being led for its
                                     admission. No objection,
                                     however, appears to have
                                     been taken in the first court
                                     against the copy obtained
                                     from the Registrar's office
                                     being put in evidence. Had
                                     such objection being made
                                     at the time, the District
                                     Judge, who tried the case in
                                     the first instance, would
                                     probably have seen that the
                                     deficiency was supplied.

                                     Their lordships think that
                                     there is no substance in the
                                     present contention."

 
Similar is the view
                                     expressed by this Court in

                                     police      reports       were
                                     admitted      in      evidence
                                     without any objection and
                                     the objection was sought to
                                     be     taken     in     appeal
                                     regarding the admissibility
                                     of the reports. Rejecting the
                                     contention it was observed:

                                      "Before leaving this case it
                                     is necessary to refer to one
                                     of the contention taken by
                                     Mr. Ramamurthi, learned
                                     counsel for the respondent.


                                     He contended that the
                                     police reports referred to
                                     earlier are inadmissible in
                                     evidence as the Head-

                                     constables who covered
                                     those meetings have not
                                     been examined in the case.

                                     Those reports were marked
                                     without any objection.

                                     Hence it is not open to the
                                     respondent now to object to
                                     their admissibility - see

                                     Since documents A30 and
                                     A34 were admitted in
                                     evidence      without     any
                                     objection, the High Court
                                     erred in holding that these
                                     documents                were
                                     inadmissible being photo
                                     copies, the originals of
                                     which were not produced.

                                     So is the observation of the
                                     High Court that the
                                     photocopy of the rent note
                                     was not readable. The
                                     photocopy was admitted in
                                     evidence, as already stated.

                                     It was read by the trial
                                     court as also by the first
                                     Appellate Court. None of
                                     the said two courts appear
                                     to have felt any difficulty in
                                     reading the document and
                                     understanding             and
                                     appreciating its contents.

 
May be, that the copy had

                                     matter came up for hearing
                                     before the High Court. The
                                     High Court if it felt any
                                     difficulty in comfortable

 CS DJ no.211236/2016
                                      then should have said so at
                                     the time of hearing and
                                     afforded the parties an
                                     opportunity    of    either
                                     producing the original or a
                                     readable copy of the
                                     document. Nothing such
                                     was done. The High Court
                                     has not even doubted the
                                     factum of the contents of
                                     the document having been
                                     read by the two courts
                                     below, drawn deductions
                                     therefrom and based their
                                     finding of fact on this
                                     document as well. All that
                                     the High Court has said is
                                     that the document was
                                     inadmissible in evidence
                                     being a photocopy and with
                                     that view we have already
                                     expressed               our
                                     disagreement.     Nothing,
                                     therefore, turns on the
                                     observation of the High
                                     Court that the document
                                     was not readable when the
                                     matter came up for hearing
                                     before it...."




xl.                The requirement of raising the objection at the time
of marking/exhibition of the document is essential as that would
apprise the party to take corrective steps to prove the particular
document in regard to which the objection may have raised and,
therefore, in the absence of no objection, other party would be
given an impression that the opposite party has no objection in
regard to the admissibility of this document.



xli.               
In light of the aforesaid position, since on behalf of
defendant, at the time of tendering of the special power of
attorney in evidence and marking the same as Ex.PW1/1, no

53 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 objection was taken as to mode and manner of proof of this
document, at the stage of final arguments this objection cannot be
permitted to be raised.




xlii.              As regards the Judgment in 
LIC of India v. Ram
Pal Singh
, mentioned above, on behalf of defendantno.2, it
though says that mere marking of a document is not the proof of
its contents, there is no dispute about this, but 
in that case
 it was
in the context of admission/denial of documents, and the Court
found that even if documents are admitted, its contents were
proved. But the position is different where document is being
tendered in evidence and no objection is then raised as to its
mode, then that document cannot be discarded.
 
I further stand
fortified on this by another recent judgment of Supreme Court in

Lachhmi Narain Singh v. Sarjug Singh
, 17 August, 2021, para
23 and 24 of which are worth noting here:




 
23. This Court in the
                                     opinion written by Justice
                                     S.        H.        Kapadia
                                     in 
Dayamathi Bai v. KM
                                     Shaffi4
 has similarly held
                                     that objection as to the
                                     mode of proof falls within
                                     procedural law. Therefore,
                                     such objections could be
                                     waived.           Moreover,
                                     objection is to be taken
                                     before the document is
                                     marked as an exhibit and
                                     admitted in Court.


                                     24. 
In view of the
                                     foregoing discussion, it is
                                     clear that plea regarding
                                     mode of proof cannot be
                                     permitted to be taken at the
                                     appellate stage for the first
                                     time, if not raised before
54 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
                                      the trial Court at the
                                     appropriate stage. This is to
                                     avoid prejudice to the party
                                     who produced the certified
                                     copy of an original
                                     document without protest
                                     by the other side. If such
                                     objection was raised before
                                     trial court, then the
                                     concerned party could have
                                     cured the mode of proof by
                                     summoning the original
                                     copy of document. But
                                     such opportunity may not
                                     be available or possible at a
                                     later stage. Therefore,
                                     allowing such objection to
                                     be raised during the
                                     appellate stage would put
                                     the party (who placed
                                     certified copy on record
                                     instead of original copy) in
                                     a jeopardy & would
                                     seriously prejudice interests
                                     of that 4 (2004) 7 SCC 107
                                     party.
 
It will also be
                                     inconsistent with the rule of
                                     fair play as propounded by
                                     Justice Ashok Bhan in the
                                     case         of       
R.V.E.
                                     Venkatachala
 (Supra).




xliii.             On the aspect of the original power of attorney of
PW1, he responded in his cross examination that he had not
brought it that day and sought to bring it on the next day. Ld.
counsel for plaintiff then clarified that the power of attorney in
favour of PW1 was already exhibited while his affidavit was
tendered into evidence and copy of power of attorney was given
exhibit mark after showing the original document. Thereafter, no
such counter suggestion was posed on behalf of the defendant
no.2 that the original of the power of attorney was not shown at
the time of tendering of evidence by PW1. Thus, the grouse of

55 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 assailing the competency of PW1
and non-production of the original power of attorney falls face
down. Needless to say, on the contents of special power of
attorney PW1/1, there is no challenge in the cross-examination of
PW1.




xliv.              The upshot of the aforesaid discourse is that
defendant no.2 has not been able to substantiate the legal
submissions put forth which would warrant the case of the
plaintiff to fail altogether. Defendant no.2 has miserably failed to
justify her occupation of the suit property from the date of the
institution of the suit till 24.02.2020 when the suit property was
handed over to the plaintiff. It is a foregone conclusion that the
unauthorized and illegal occupation of the suit property for the
said period has deprived the plaintiff to enjoy the fruits of the
said property. It is also pertinent to highlight here that after the
death of defendant no.2 on 26.08.2011, who was allegedly
running a Kindergarten school in the suit property, her LRs still
perpetuated in the illegal occupation of the suit property which is
evident from the admission of DW1 in question no.54 of his
cross examination that his sister Ms. Radha Bansal continued to
look after the school. There never was any offer to hand over the
possession of the suit property to its rightful claimant who was
the plaintiff. Thus, defendant no.2 without any iota of doubt, has
to be saddled with the liability to pay damages/mesne profits to
the plaintiff in respect of the suit property.



xlv.               Having now dealt with the entitlement of the
plaintiff to the grant of mesne profits in respect of the suit
56 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 property, the next step would be to assess the quantum and
duration of the same. Though, Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2
argued that issue no.1 merely is to the extent of entitlement of the
plaintiff to claim damages/mesne profits, without any whisper
about its extent, however, the extent of mesne profits, its
quantum and duration are implicit in the entitlement of the
plaintiff to claim the same, and if the plaintiff is found entitled to
the mesne profits, the next logical step would be to ascertain its
quantum.




xlvi.              On the aspect of mesne profits, Ld. Counsel for
defendant further assailed the case of the plaintiff and took
umbrage on the plaintiff invoking the methods of annual
escalation of the property value and expected return on the land
rates as the plaintiff had approached the court seeking damages
from the defendant on the basis of rent of comparable leases. Ld.
Counsel further emphasised that the deposition of PW1 in
paragraph 5, 7, 8 and 10 is beyond the pleading and cannot be
read in evidence.



xlvii.             Ld. Counsel further urged that plaintiff has further
failed to prove that she is entitled to the sum of Rs.50,000/- per
month towards the damages/mesne profits as claimed in the
plaint. Ld. Counsel further highlighted that the lease deeds filed
by DW1 are Ex.DW1/3 and which show the prevalent rent in
respect of the similarly situated properties and even better
properties during the relevant time period i.e.1992-93 and thus
judicial notice cannot be taken and judicial notice of 14%
increase rent every year is not warranted. It was further
57 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 highlighted that the rate of rent of the suit property was Rs.1800/-
per month and when the suit was filed in the year 1993, the
tenancy was still subsisting and rent at that time was Rs.1800/-
only which is also evident from the fact that plaintiff in the year
2022 made categorical statement before MCD that rent of the suit
property has not increased from Rs.1800/- per month. It is further
argued that annexure F has not been proved in accordance with
law as the plaintiff in his examination in chief dated 27.02.2021
has not relied upon it and as such, the same cannot be taken into
consideration. Further, it is pointed out on behalf of the defendant
no.2 that the lease deeds sought to be placed in evidence pertain
to commercial property and the suit property being residential in
nature, lease deeds are of no assistance to the case of the plaintiff.




xlviii.            All the legal systems which govern the civilized
nation of the world agree upon the basic principle of natural
justice to obtain reparation for wrongs or infringement of legal
rights. In other ways, the law of nature gives primary right to a
compensation for injuries. Mesne profit is one such right to
compensation granted against injuria i.e breach of legal right.
Mesne profit is a positive right available against infringement of
private legal right. Main object of awarding mesne profit is to
compensate the actual owner of the property for all the losses
he/she suffered. In other words, the object of awarding of decree
of mesne profit is to compensate a person who has been kept out
of possession and deprived of enjoyment of his/her property even
though he/she was entitled to possession of the property.



xlix.              Mesne profits is defined under 
Section 2(12)
 CPC as
58 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 under:


                                     "(12) "mesne profits" of
                                     property     means    those
                                     profits which the person in
                                     wrongful possession of
                                     such property actually
                                     received or might with
                                     ordinary diligence have
                                     received         therefrom,
                                     together with interest on
                                     such profits, but shall not
                                     include profits due to
                                     improvements made by the
                                     person      in     wrongful
                                     possession;"



l.                 From the analysis of the above stated definition, one
can conclude that mesne profits are the profits which the person
in unlawful possession actually earned or might have earned with
the ordinary diligence.



li.                
In case titled as 
Nataraja Achari Vs. Blanbal
Ammal
, AIR 1980 Madras 2228, taking into the consideration
the definition of mesne profit provided under 
Section 2(12)
 CPC,
High Court observed that there are three different types of cases
in which question of rights of profits areas (I) suit for ejectment
or for recovery of possession of immovable property from a
person in possession without title, together with a claim for past
or past and future mesne profits. (2) Suits for partition by one or
more tenants-in-common against others with a claim for account
of past or past and future profits. (3) Suits for partition by a
member of a joint Hindu family with a claim for an account from
the manager. The court further observed that in the first case the
possession of the defendant not being lawful, plaintiff is entitled
to recover of mesne profits, being in the nature of damages.


59 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 lii.               In the instant case as well, we are dealing with a
situation where the defendant no.2, in contest to the suit sought to
justify her possession over the suit property on the pretext of
ownership being accrued to her by way of adverse possession
being in occupation from 1977 till 1989, and when the present
plaintiff became owner of the suit property and instituted the
present suit to reclaim the possession from defendants, defendant
no.2 persisted to retain the possession but eventually gave up the
same in February 2020. It is obvious that defendant no.2 has
miserably failed to prove her claim of ownership on the basis of
adverse possession, and therefore, her possession right from the
institution of the suit in the year 1993 till February 2020 when
the possession was given up, is found to be unlawful, for which
plaintiff is entitled to claim the mesne profits in the form of
damages/compensation.




liii.              As per the affidavit of PW1 Ex.PW1/A, the suit
property is built on a free hold plot measuring 308 sq yard land
with 2 1/4th storey residential house on it. Photographs of the
same are Ex.PW1/2 and the layout plan of the suit property is
Ex.P6. The suit property is stated to be situated in a prime area
abutting a wide road, is well connected, is three sides open
property, nearby park, market and even police station for security.
In the suit property, admittedly a children play school was being
run by the defendant. But as already noted, PW1 was only
competent to furnish the lease deeds and mark them and at the
most assist in computation, rest all deposition of his is on the
basis of the knowledge obtained from the plaintiff as admitted by

 him in his cross-examination. So, the description and the location
of the suit property given by him in his affidavit cannot be read
in evidence.




liv.               Let us find out from pleadings and other admissible
evidence the measurements of the suit property, location, its
physical structure, existing at the time of institution of the suit.
As per the plaint, the suit property is measuring 318 sq yards
facing east and abutting on 60ft wide road, which is constructed
to be 2 ¼ story in the form of residential house. Though, in the
corresponding written statement, defendant no.2 had oppugned
the identification and aforesaid structure of the suit property,
however, that denial is without any specification. DW1 in his
cross examination also acknowledged that Ex.PW1/2 and
Ex.PW1/3 (colly) are the photographs of the suit property.
Furthermore, DW1 in his affidavit Ex.DW1/A, in paragraph 19
has described the layout of the suit property as under:

                                     "a. Ground Floor: Entrance
                                     Lobby (partly converted

lv.                DW1 has further stated in his affidavit that Mr. Pires
had his residence on the entire ground floor (till when he died)

 excepting the principal office and kindergarten school operating
in the two rooms on the first floor of the suit property. He further
stated that post his demise, the kindergarten school began to
operate from the ground floor of the suit property with first floor
serving as music room and library. He further stated that in
March 2006, Municipal Corporation of Delhi prohibited the use
of the first floor for operating a Kindergarten School and only
ground floor on designated roads can be used for operating the
Kindergarten School and, therefore, since September 2006,
ground floor was used for the purpose of Kindergarten School
only till March 2018. Thus, the position in regard to the physical
structure of the suit property, is clear that it measures 318 sq
yards situated on 60ft wide road comprising of 2 ¼ story.



lvi.               The controversy now boils down to as to what would
be the rate of mesne profits which could be stated to be existing
at the time of institution of the suit i.e. 10.11.1993 in respect of
the suit property.



lvii.              Ld. Senior counsel for the plaintiff pointed out the
cross examination of DW1 in regard to the user of the suit
property. DW1 was questioned as to during the period
10.11.1993 till 24.02.2020, his mother i.e. defendant no.2, he
himself or any of his sisters (Neeta, Priti, Radha) ever resided in
the suit property and if not, who was then residing, upon which
he was unable to state whether his mother or any of his sisters
ever resided in the suit property.



lviii.             DW1 was also queried as to the period between

                                                                           Digitally signed by

In regard to the collection of the fees, he also responded that all
the fees and expenses would be recorded in the books of the bank
account of school and credit and debit to the bank account would
have been made as per the books of account. These books of
accounts have not been produced on record on behalf of
defendant no.2. Thus, it is to be presumed that defendant no.2
had not come clean on the profits received while being in
wrongful possession of suit property.




lix.               Moving further, as already noted above that on
behalf of the plaintiff, the various lease deeds placed on record as
comparables for quantifying mesne profits pertinent to the period
2013 onwards and as such there is no material on behalf of the
plaintiff as to what was the rental/damages existing at the time of
institution of the suit. PW1 also affirmed in his cross-
examination that rent deeds placed on record were only from the
year 2012-13 and not prior to that. In regard to a specific query
as to when the lease deeds filed by PW1 pertain to 2013-14
onwards, would it be correct to say that there are no comparable
rent deeds available for the year 1992-93 upon which PW1
responded that comparison can be made on the basis of 'base
point' and thereby prevailing rent can be calculated. PW1 then
referred to annexure G which was given Mark X to compare the
prevailing rent in the year 1992 with the prevailing rent in the
year 2013.

 deposition of DW1 has placed on record some lease deeds
pertaining to the period between 1992-95 in the form of Mark A3
in his deposition, which have not been repudiated on behalf of
the plaintiff.



lxi.               Now let us examine the lease deeds Mark A3 relied
upon by DW1 in his evidence. Paragraph 40 of his affidavit is
laid herein below:

 area of the aforesaid property to be 360 sq yards plus, although
from none of the said lease agreements, the measurement of built
up area and carpet area is made out. Nevertheless, on bone deep
analysis of those lease agreements, it is noted that these
agreements pertain to single floor of the property and the rent
ranges from Rs.4500/- per month to Rs.10,000/- per month. The
relevant details related to the said lease agreements are extracted
herein below:


                                     The first lease agreement
                                     dated 31.05.1992 is in

                                     stated to be Rs.6000/- per
                                     month.

                                     The       second         lease
                                     agreement               dated
                                     22.07.1992 is in respect of
                                     ground floor of property

                                     Rs.4500/- per month.

                                     The fourth lease agreement
                                     dated 13.10.1993 is in
                                     respect of ground floor of

                                      116, Greater Kailash Part I,
                                     New Delhi and the rental is
                                     stated to be Rs.5000/- per
                                     month.




lxiii.             It can be safely deduced from the aforesaid lease
deeds that all the lease deeds pertain to only ground floor of a
particular property. Furthermore, none of the properties is shown
to be situated at R Block, Greater Kailash Part I, New Delhi as is
the case with the suit property. It is not clear whether any of these
properties was situated on 60ft wide road. Thus, these lease deeds
cannot be considered as a complete yardstick to fix the quantum
of mesne profits in respect of the suit property. Needless to say,
the path to ascertain the mesne profits for the year 1993 i.e three
decades ago, is not easy to tread on. But, in the form of these
lease agreements, we are able to gather some inkling as to the
existing rate of rent in Greater Kailash Part I, New Delhi area
between the period 1992 to 1995 and, thus, some support can be
drawn from it to arrive at a base figure of the rate of mesne
profits which can be fixed at the time of institution of the suit. It
is, however, to be kept in mind of these lease deeds pertain to
only single floor whereas the suit property admittedly comprises
of 2 ¼ floors and the rental would have to be counted and
computed in accordance therewith.



lxiv.              In so far as valuation of the suit property is
concerned, PW1 has relied upon the report Ex.PW1/7 which was
filed on behalf of defendantno.2 dated 28.03.1996 from an
independent valuer Sh. T S Ratnam, Additional Director General,
CPW Retired. The said report records the suit property to be
situated in high class locality with excellent proximity to civic

                                                                       by NAVJEET
                                                             NAVJEET   BUDHIRAJA

                                                                          15:51:56 +0530
 amenities. It also records that the plinth of the suit property on
the ground floor is 1653 sq ft, on first floor is 1655 sq ft and the
second floor is 400 sq ft. The said report valued the suit property
to be Rs.69.89 lacs in February 1992 and Rs.81.48 lacs in the
year 1993.




lxv.               Let us now see what methods PW1 has cited towards
computation of mesne profits. As per the affidavit Ex.PW1/A, the
three methods to compute the quantum of mesne profits are, the
first method is of judicial notice based on various judgments 
laid
down by
 High Court of Delhi; the second method is of exemplars
or renting in the vicinity and the third method is of expected
return on notified land rates.




lxvi.              The admitted rate of rent of the suit property in the
year 1971 was Rs.1800/- per month with effect from 01.10.1971.
The mesne profits are to be quantified from the institution of the
suit onwards till 24.02.2020 when the keys of the suit property
were delivered to the plaintiff before High Court of Delhi.



lxvii.             In so far as the aforenoted second method is
concerned, PW1/plaintiff has relied upon various lease deeds
Ex.PW2/1 to Ex.PW2/54 which were brought on record by PW1
and later on proved by PW2 Sh. Upender, Record Attendant,
Office of Sub-Registrar-VA, Hauz Khas, Mehrauli, New Delhi.
However, these exemplars pertain to the period from 2013
onwards and since we have to assess the mesne profits from the
year 1993 onwards, these exemplars would be of little assistance.

 arrive at base figure of mesne profits in 1993 during his
questioning on behalf of defendant no.2, but that involves too
much of a guess work which is not feasible to adopt. We are now
left with the aforesaid method first or third, either of which can
be brought into picture to assess the quantum of mesne profits in
the present suit along with the comparable lease deeds Mark A3
placed on behalf of defendant no.2.




lxviii.            After having examined various case laws of the
High Courts, it is found that in majority of the cases, the
Supreme Court and High Courts, where the evidence is scant,
have adopted the first method for calculating the mesne profits
on the basis of 10-15% annual escalation in the rate of rent and
interest thereof. I would now like to present some of those case
laws and the relevant observations made therein:

(1) Pradeep Kumar Vs. Hazarilal, date of decision 22.02.2008,
Supreme Court:

                                     "4. We have considered the
                                     arguments advanced by the
                                     learned Counsel for the
                                     parties. In the first place, it
                                     must be borne in mind that
                                     only an interim order is
                                     under challenge before us
                                     and        ordinarily       no
                                     interference should be
                                     made in such a proceeding
                                     under 
Article 136
 of the

                                     too, we are of the opinion
                                     that in the light of the

                                     excessive. We also see
                                     from a bare reading of the
                                     record that the appellant
                                     has managed to delay the
                                     eviction proceedings for
                                     more than 15 years by
                                     resorting to tactics which
                                     are clearly unacceptable.

                                     The submission of the
                                     learned Counsel for the
                                     appellant that though the
                                     appellant had indeed been
                                     transferred from Alwar, yet
                                     his wife and young son
                                     often used the premises, is
                                     again unacceptable. We
                                     find it difficult to believe
                                     that a mere Clerk, such as
                                     the appellant, would be
                                     able     to    justify   the
                                     maintenance of two houses,
                                     one at Alwar and the other
                                     at his place of posting 400
                                     kms. Away. "



Crux- In the aforesaid case, the Supreme Court had appreciated
that where the rent of the premises at one point of time was fixed
at Rs.600/- per month 18 years ago, interim mesne profits at the
rate of Rs.4000/- per month cannot be said to be excessive. The
court also found that the appellant 
in that case
 had managed to
delay the eviction proceedings for more than 15 years by
resorting to tactics which are clearly unacceptable.

                                     4. Before the Trial Court,
                                     the respondent/landlord led
                                     evidence in the form of a
                                     lease     deed      executed
                                     between Bank of Baroda
                                     and its landlord with
                                     respect to a premises No. 9,
                                     LSC Kirti Nagar, Delhi, i.e.
                                     in around the same area
                                     where       the     tenanted
                                     premises are located. The
                                     tenanted premises as also
                                     the premises which were
                                     the subject matter of the
                                     lease deed of Bank of
                                     Baroda with its landlord,
                                     Ex.PW2/3 were thus both
                                     situated in the same Kirti
                                     Nagar Area. Whereas the
                                     premises of the respondent
                                     is on the main road, the
                                     premises taken by Bank of
                                     Baroda under the lease
                                     deed dated Ex.PW2/3 is
                                     admittedly not on the main
                                     road. Mesne profits in this
                                     case have to be calculated
                                     from       1.10.1997      to
                                     31.12.2003 and therefore,
                                     for determining the mesne
                                     profits, what are the mesne
                                     profits which would be
                                     prevalent      in     around
                                     October, 1997 would be an
                                     issue. The lease deed
                                     Ex.PW2/3 is of the year
                                     1995, i.e. about 2 years
                                     prior    to     the   period
                                     commencing from which
                                     the mesne profits have to
                                     be calculated.

 
5. The Trial Court has
                                     noted that rents have fallen
                                     during the relevant period,
                                     and therefore, instead of
                                     granting Rs.43/- per square
                                     feet, mesne profits have

                                                                            15:52:45 +0530
                                      been granted at Rs.25/- per
                                     square feet. In every case
                                     of determination of mesne
                                     profits, some amount of
                                     honest guess work is
                                     always             involved.


                                     Obviously, there cannot be
                                     complete exactness of
                                     evidence led with respect to
                                     rate of rents/mesne profits,
                                     and the Courts have to
                                     make a best judgment
                                     assessment on the basis of
                                     the evidence which is led
                                     before it. I have already
                                     stated above that the suit
                                     premises are situated on the
                                     main road, and surely,
                                     premises on the main road
                                     have far higher rents than
                                     premises located in the
                                     interiors.

                                     6. I therefore do not feel
                                     that the Trial Court has
                                     committed any illegality or
                                     perversity     in   granting
                                     mesne profits at Rs.25/- per
                                     square feet and therefore
                                     there is no ground for
                                     interference in this appeal
                                     so far as the awarding of
                                     the rate of mesne profits
                                     are concerned. In fact I find
                                     that the Trial Court has
                                     been more than liberal to
                                     the           appellant/bank
                                     inasmuch as the rate of
                                     mesne      profits    should
                                     ordinarily    undergo      an
                                     increase      each      year,
                                     however, the rate of mesne
                                     profits which has been
                                     granted continues to be for
                                     a fixed amount for the
                                     entire      period      from
                                     1.10.1997 to 31.12.2003,

                                     years.

                                     filed on 20th October, 1997
                                     and therefore there would
                                     hardly be any mesne profits
                                     which would be payable
                                     with respect to the pre suit
                                     period. The mesne profits
                                     have only accumulated
                                     pendent lite and till
                                     31.12.2003        when      the
                                     premises were vacated.


                                     Therefore it cannot be said
                                     that interest at 9% per
                                     annum can be granted on
                                     the total amount of the
                                     money decree on mesne
                                     profits from the date of
                                     filing     of      the     suit.

                                     Obviously, interest has to
                                     be calculated only from the
                                     end of the month for which
                                     the mesne profits became
                                     payable. Learned counsel
                                     for the respondent could
                                     not very seriously dispute
                                     this illegal position. I
                                     therefore       clarify     the
                                     impugned judgment by
                                     observing that when the
                                     Trial Court has granted
                                     interest at 9% per annum
                                     pendent lite and future,
                                     interest will only be
                                     calculated from the end of
                                     the month from which the
                                     mesne profits would be
                                     payable, and it will not be
                                     that interest will be paid
                                     from the date of filing of
                                     the suit on the total amount
                                     of mesne profits decreed. "

 profits were to be calculated from 01.10.1997 to 31.12.2003. The
premises was found to be situated on the main road and it was
held that premises on the main road have far higher rents than
premises located in the interiors. The trial court granted fixed
amount for the entire period but the High Court observed that
rate of mesne profits should ordinarily undergo an increase each
year. The High Court also upheld the interest of 9% per annum
from the end of the month for which mesne profit became
payable and also clarified that it will not be that interest will be
paid from the date of filing of the suit on the total amount of
mesne profits decreed.

                                     will be over the original

                                     years, however, in terms of

                                     be granted yearly with 10%

Crux- The court had observed that the lease deeds relied upon by
the parties could not be looked into to determine the rate of
rent/mesne profits from January 1991. The court called for the
calculation of the mesne profits on the basis of some honest
guess work and also of taking of judicial notice of increase of
rent by applying the provisions of 
Section 114
 and 
57
 of Indian
Evidence Act, 1872. The court also took note of the ratio of
judgment in 
M C Aggarwal Vs. Sahara India
, (2011) 183 DLT
105 and mentioned about the increase of 15% every year, but in
the context of said case, the court granted 10% increase
compounded annually, as there was a prior agreement of 15%
increase every two years. The court also granted 6% simple
interest rate.

                                      plaintiffs. It is true that no
                                     substantial evidence has
                                     been led by the plaintiffs in
                                     respect of the increase of

                                     that of the suit property.


 
However, it is a well
                                     known fact that the amount
                                     of     rent     for    various
                                     properties in and around
                                     Delhi has been rising
                                     staggeringly and we cannot
                                     see why such judicial
                                     notice could not be taken of
                                     the fact about such increase
                                     of rents in the premises in
                                     and around Delhi which is
                                     a     city     of     growing
                                     importance        being    the

                                     which is a matter of public
                                     history. At this stage we
                                     may appropriately refer to
                                     the Court taking judicial
                                     notice of the increase of
                                     price of land rapidly in the

                                     matters. Even the Apex
                                     Court has taken judicial
                                     notice of the fact of
                                     universal escalation of rent
                                     and even raised rent of
                                     disputed      premises      by
                                     taking such judicial in case

                                     did not commit any
                                     illegality in taking judicial

 CS DJ no.211236/2016
                                      fact that the rent fixed for
                                     the said premises was at
                                     Rs. 6,000.00 per month as
                                     far back as in the year
                                     1974. We may, however,
                                     note here that the learned
                                     Counsel for the appellants
                                     did not seriously challenge
                                     the findings of the learned
                                     Judge that Rs. 10,000.00
                                     per month would be the fair

                                     no substance at all."




Crux - The Court took note of the rising rate of rent in Delhi
around 1990's and upheld the order of Trial Court where it fixed
the rate of monthly rent in respect of the property as Rs. 10,000
per month in 1989 when the admitted rate of rent in 1974 was Rs
6,000 per month.

                                     case of

Vinod Khanna

                                     the trial court had not

                                     taking judicial notice of
                                     increase of rents and

                                     "21. The learned Counsel
                                     for the appellants also
                                     urged before us that the
                                     learned Trial Court was not
                                     justified in taking a judicial
                                     notice of the fact of
                                     increase of rents like the
                                     suit property and also in
                                     providing 10,000/- per
                                     month as fair amount
                                     towards       damages/mesne
                                     profits in favor of the
                                     plaintiffs. It is true that no
                                     substantial evidence has
                                     been led by the plaintiffs in
                                     respect of the increase of
                                     rent in the properties like
                                     that of the suit property.


 
However, it is a well
                                     known fact that the amount
                                     of     rent     for    various
                                     properties in and around
                                     Delhi has been rising
                                     staggeringly and we cannot
                                     see why such judicial
                                     notice could not be taken of
                                     the fact about such increase
                                     of rents in the premises in
                                     and around Delhi which is
                                     a     city     of     growing
                                     importance        being    the
                                     capital of the country
                                     which is a matter of public
                                     history. At this stage we
                                     may appropriately refer to
                                     the Court taking judicial
                                     notice of the increase of
                                     price of land rapidly in the
                                     urban areas in connection
                                     with the land acquisition
                                     matters. Even the Apex
                                     Court has taken judicial
                                     notice of the fact of
                                     universal escalation of rent
                                     and even raised rent of
                                     disputed      premises      by
                                     taking such judicial in case

                                     matter     we     have     no
                                     hesitation in our mind in
                                     holding that the Trial Court
                                     did not commit any
                                     illegality in taking judicial
                                     notice of the fact of

                                     compensation in respect of
                                     the suit premises at

                                     19.1.1989, in view of the
                                     fact that the rent fixed for
                                     the said premises was at
                                     `6,000/- per month as far
                                     back as in the year 1974.
                                     We may, however, note
                                     here that the learned

                                     month would be the fair

                                     21. The essence of the
                                     aforesaid decisions of the
                                     Supreme Court and this
                                     Court is that judicial notice
                                     of the increase of rents in
                                     urban areas can be taken
                                     note of by courts by
                                     applying the provisions of
                                     
Sections 57
 and 
114
 of the

                                     while calculating the mesne
                                     profits, certain amount of
                                     guess work by the court, is
                                     inevitable and acceptable.

                                     22. 
In the present case,
                                     considering the fact that the

                                     situated in one of the prime
                                     residential localities in
                                     Delhi, i.e., Greater Kailash-


                                     I, this Court is of the
                                     opinion that it would be
                                     just, fit and proper if an
                                     increase of 15% per annum
                                     over and above the
                                     contractual rent be awarded
                                     to the plaintiff for the first
                                     year commencing w.e.f.

                                     01.10.2011 till 30.09.2012.

                                     For the second year of
                                     illegal occupation, i.e.,
                                     w.e.f. 01.10.2012 onwards,
                                     the defendant is held liable
                                     to pay an increase of 15%
                                     per annum, over and above
                                     the original contractual rent
                                     plus an additional 15% rent
                                     that has been found to be
                                     payable for the first year.


                                     Same would remain the
                                     standard of calculating
                                     mesne profits for the
                                     subsequent period, till the
                                     demised        premises      is
                                     vacated by the defendant
                                     and possession handed over
                                     to the plaintiff.

                                     23. As regards the claim of
                                     interest, the plaintiff has
                                     sought payment of interest
                                     calculated @ 18 % per
                                     annum on the awarded
                                     amount. However, given
                                     the facts and circumstances
                                     of the present case, the
                                     Court is not inclined to
                                     award interest at the rate as
                                     claimed by the plaintiff.

 
Instead, it is deemed
                                     appropriate       to    award
                                     simple interest @ 10 % per
                                     annum on the aforesaid
                                     amount for the period of
                                     default/delay in making
                                     payment of rent/occupation
                                     charges, till realization.

                                     outstanding rent on a

                                     of the tenanted premises.


                                     Besides the above, the
                                     defendant is held liable to
                                     issue TDS certificates to

Crux- The premises in this case was first and second floor of the
residential premises in Greater Kailash I area.                       The court
concluded that since the demised premises was situated in one of
the prime residential locality in Delhi i.e. Greater Kailash I, it
would be just and proper if an increase of 15% per annum over
and above the contractual rate be awarded along with simple
interest @10% per annum to be calculated on the monthly basis.

                                     discussed the principles
                                     with regard to awarding
                                     mesne profits. The relevant
                                     observations are set out
                                     below:


                                     "25. Mesne profits being in
                                     the nature of damages, no
                                     invariable rule governing
                                     their award and assessment
                                     in every Signature Not
                                     Verified case, can be laid
                                     down and "the Court may
                                     mould to the justice of the
                                     case". Even so, one broad
                                     basic principle governing
                                     the liability for mesne
                                     profits is discernible from
                                     
Section 2(12)
 of the CPC
                                     which      defines      'mesne
                                     profits' to mean "those
                                     profits which the person in
                                     wrongful possession of
                                     property actually received
                                     or might with ordinary
                                     diligence have received
                                     therefrom together with
                                     interest on such profits, but
                                     shall not include profits due
                                     to improvements made by

                                     reading of this definition, it
                                     is clear that wrongful
                                     possession of the defendant
                                     is the very essence of a

 CS DJ no.211236/2016
                                      claim for mesne profits and
                                     the very foundation of the

                                     therefore. As a rule,
                                     therefore, liability to pay
                                     mesne profits goes with
                                     actual possession of the
                                     land. That is to say,
                                     generally, the person in
                                     wrongful possession and
                                     enjoyment        of        the
                                     immovable property is
                                     liable for mesne profits."

When damages are claimed

                                      noted that though mesne
                                     profits are awarded because
                                     the rightful claimant is
                                     excluded from possession

                                     trespasser, it is not what the

                                     such exclusion but what the

                                     which is the measure of
                                     calculation of the mesne

                                     Delhi 11). This basis of
                                     damages for use and

                                     is different from that of

                                     vehemently argued that the
                                     judgment of the learned
                                     Addl. District Judge cannot
                                     be sustained in so far as it
                                     has fixed damages @ Rs.

 
50,000/- per month. It is
                                     submitted that in the plaint

                                     per month and, therefore,
                                     the Trial Court could not go
                                     beyond the said figure

                                     is true that in the plaint the

Crux- The Trial Court reached a conclusion of Rs 50,000 per
month as mesne profits, but the High Court reduced it to Rs
25,000 per month considering that property was 500 sq yds in
prime location of East of Kailash Delhi, in the year 1994, it could
command the rent of Rs 25,000 per month.

Crux- The Court observed that rent of even similarly situated
property cannot be calculated on the basis of last square feet and
to the last rupee. The Court also gave 15 percent escalation
annually given the property to be commercial with 9 percent
simple interest.



9.       
In 
Punjab National Bank v. Delhi Properties
, 10
January, 2011, Delhi High Court, wherein it was concluded
that when the rate in the year 1980 was Rs. 10,952 then surely
after 10 years the plaintiff was justified in claiming rent of Rs.
41,070 per month.




lxix.              The exposition of the aforenoted case laws is that in
case there is no or sketchy evidence produced on record to
establish the rate for the period for which the mesne profits are
being claimed, the court has to brought in some honest guess
work and fix the base price for the year from which the mesne
profits are being claimed. In the case in hand as we have already
noted that there is no evidence from the side of the plaintiff as to
what was the rate of rent in respect of the suit property in the
year 1992 when the plaintiff purchased the suit property, while
defendant no.2 was already in occupation thereto. Though, PW1
has given a computation in various annexures wherein the

 admitted rate of rent of Rs.1800/- per month in the year 1971 has
been taken to be the base price over which 14% annual escalation
has been given till the year 1992, however, I am not inclined to
accept the same. I shall also furnish my reasons to rebuff the
computation done on behalf of the plaintiff in the affidavit of the
PW1. But before I venture into that, some part of questioning and
response of PW1 in relation to computation of mesne profits are
extracted herein below.




lxx.               PW1 affirmed in his cross-examination that rent
deeds placed on record were only from the year 2012-13 and not
prior to that. He also acknowledged that at least 10 properties of
which the certified copies of the lease agreements have been filed
are the properties in the main Greater Kailash Part I, M Block
Market pertain to the commercial properties. He also fessed up
during further questioning that some of the other leases filed by
him of Greater Kailash Part I, B Block, main road properties
have been in use for approved commercial purpose and the same
has been the situation with some of the other leases pertaining to
Greater Kailash Part I, M Block. PW1 also acknowledged that 35
properties of which the lease deeds have been filed are retail
shops and rest of them are either banks or guest house. In regard
to a specific query as to when the lease deeds filed by PW1
pertain to 2013-14 onwards, would it be correct to say that there
are no comparable rent deeds available for the year 1992-93 upon
which PW1 responded that comparison can be made on the basis
of 'base point' and thereby prevailing rent can be calculated.
PW1 then referred to annexure G which was given Mark X to
compare the prevailing rent in the year 1992 with the prevailing

 rent in the year 2013.




lxxi.              Upon further questioning from PW1 as to his
qualification and competency for carrying out mesne profits
computation for the suit property, he responded that mesne
profits were calculated by him on the basis of his own search and
with the help of his well wishers.



lxxii.             Further cross-examination of PW1 on the aspect of
computation of mesne profits is reproduced below:

                                     method adopted?


                                     Ans I have deposed three
                                     methods for computation of
                                     mesne profits, one on the
                                     prevailing      rent    basis,
                                     second on the basis of

                                     copies of Lease Deeds of

                                     Suit       property       was
                                     acquired/purchased          by
                                     Plaintiff in 1992-93?

                                     Ans I may not deny, it is
                                     matter of record.

                                     Q-4 Please clarify that the
                                     rent prior to the purchase of
                                     this property by Plaintiff,
                                     its rent was Rs 1800 per
                                     month, what you have to
                                     say?

                                     Ans It is a matter of record.

 
Q-5 Is it correct that the
                                     rental per month you
                                     assumed          in      your
                                     calculation of mesne profit

                                      under the method of annual
                                     escalation of rent would be
                                     Rs 28,000 per month in the
                                     year 1992?


                                     Ans It is true and correct.

                                     Q-6 Could you explain the
                                     computation carried by you
                                     under the method of annual
                                     escalation of rent?


                                     Ans The method was to
                                     take Rs 1800 per month
                                     multiplied by 12 which
                                     comes to around Rs.21,600,
                                     and     annual     escalation
                                     @14% on this amount of
                                     Rs.21,600, was calculated
                                     for computation of mesne
                                     profit.

                                     Q-7 Which year was taken
                                     as a base for taking rent @
                                     Rs.1800 per month for
                                     calculation of mesne profit
                                     on annual escalation?

                                     Ans The base year was
                                     taken as 1972-73.

                                     Q-8 Are you aware of any
                                     Rent              Agreement
                                     concerning Suit property
                                     for the year 1971-77
                                     showing the rent @
                                     Rs.1800 per month ?

                                     Ans No I am not aware, but
                                     in the Suit its somewhere
                                     appeared that rent of the
                                     Suit property was Rs. 1800
                                     per month during that
                                     stated period.

                                     ......

                                     Q-21 Can you explain the
                                     rationale of adopting 12%
                                     increase per annum while
                                     adopting the land rate
                                     method for calculation of
                                     mesne profit?

 
Ans That rationale was as a
                                     consequence of discussions
                                     made with persons when
                                     this calculation was taken
                                     up and those persons were
                                     close associates, but I do

                                     ......

                                     Q-25 Please look at your
                                     document Annexure G at
                                     page 26 and explain the
                                     computation of rent per
                                     square foot, how it was
                                     arrived?

                                     Ans I would say like an
                                     average rent of property in
                                     the year 2013 as shown in
                                     Annexure G is Rs. 166 per
                                     square foot and this figure
                                     Rs. 166 was arrived while
                                     taking an average of all the
                                     rent Deeds of that year
                                     filed in this case and while
                                     calculating this average,
                                     area of properties was also
                                     taken into consideration
                                     and final calculation was
                                     arrived with the help of
                                     excel software."



lxxiii.            Now I canvass the reasons for not accepting the
computation given by PW1. The first reason is that PW1, being
the special power of attorney holder of the plaintiff, was
permitted only to mark the documents and the lease deeds as
exemplars for fixing the mesne profits. In the absence of PW1
having any personal knowledge of the acts/transactions in
relation to the suit property, its description and location, its rental
in 1971, his testimony in the affidavit Ex.PW1/A to this effect is
disregarded. The second reason is that the plaintiff has arrived at
a figure of Rs 3,85,798 per annum as per Annexure F as mesne
profits for the year 1993 on the basis of annual escalation of 14%
per annum since the year 1971 when the rental was Rs.1800/- per
month, however, it is an admitted case of the plaintiff that till
1977, the rental in respect of the suit property remained
Rs.1800/- per month and at that time, the suit property was also

 protected under the 
DRC Act
 wherein a procedure has been
prescribed for claiming enhancement in the rentals of a particular
property, therefore, the court cannot countenance the annual
escalation of 14% per annum from 1971 onwards when in the
lease deed executed by the colonel in favor of Pires School till
1977 did not provide so. The third reason is that from 1977
onwards till 1993, the plaintiff has failed to produce on record
any comparables which could facilitate the court to arrive at a
particular figure in respect of the mesne profits starting from the
year 1993. Rather from 1993 till 2013 also, there is no material
on behalf of the plaintiff which could convince the court in
accepting the computation placed on record by PW1.




lxxiv.             There is another reason for ignoring the exemplars
lease deeds, which would become lucid post comparison of the

except Ex.PW2/16, which is close on the parameter of
measurement being 2471 sqft. The words 'similarly placed'
encompasses within its ambit similar or nearly similar in area,
location, age of property, availability of amenities. 
The lease
deeds mainly pertain to the shops/commercial properties situated
primarily in commercial areas whereas in the case in hand, the
suit property is admittedly a residential property, though,

 defendant no.2 had been running a kindergarten school which can
be equated with a commercial activity. But rentals in respect of
commercial shops cannot be equated with the rentals in respect
of the residential areas, and therefore, all those lease deeds are of
little to no assistance to the plaintiff. The court is, thus, left with
no option but to take the judicial notice for fixing the mesne
profits in respect of the suit property from the date of the
institution of the suit in November 1993 till February 2020 when
the suit property was handed over to the plaintiff.




lxxvi.             After meditating over the entire material available
on record in the form of an admitted position that in the year
1971, the admitted rate of rent was Rs.1800/- per month or 0.62
per sq feet considering the size of suit property to be 2862 sq ft,
for the entire suit property and the same rent was carried forward
till 1977 when the lease was extended by the colonel in favor of
the Pires School and also considering the rate of rentals found to
be existing between 1992 to 95 as per the lease deeds Mark A3,
some guess work has to be brought into to fix the quantum of
the mesne profits found to be appropriate in respect of the suit
property at the time of institution of the suit. If we take average
of the rentals as per the lease agreements Mark A3 and honest
guess work, the same comes out to be around Rs.8000/- per
month for each floor and since the suit property comprises of 2 ¼
floors, I am of the opinion that Rs.18000/-, which comes to Rs
6.28 per sq ft, can be fixed as the base rate for calculating the
mesne profits in respect of the suit property from the date of the
institution of the suit. 
In 22 years from 1971, when the rate per sq
ft. was agreed to be 0.6 per sq ft., this much appreciation can be

 said to be reasonable.




lxxvii.            Having arrived at a base figure of Rs 18,000 per
month from the month of November, 1993, the next task is to
compute the total quantum of mesne profits till 24.02.2020 when
the suit property was handed over to the plaintiff. It certainly is a
cumbersome and tedious task to assess the mesne profits as there
are number of factors which would govern the annual escalation
i.e the age of the property, location, overall quality of
construction, the wear and tear suffered by the property, the
repair and renovation work carried out etc. There is no material
to assess on these parameters as to what was the state of the suit
property between the year 1971 to 1993. Rather from 1992
onwards till the time of handing over the possession of the suit
property in the year 2020 also, there is no enough material to
assess the quantum of mesne profits keeping the aforesaid
parameters in mind. Though DW1 sought to put forth that all
these years plaintiff has not spent any amount towards the
upkeep of suit property and it is the defendant no.2 who had
spent from her own pocket, but this contention is worth repelling
here as it was defendant no. 2 who kept on holding on to the suit
property on the pretext of being its owner. She ought to have
surrendered the property as soon as the suit was filed. Having
failed to do so, she cannot be heard to complain about spending
on the maintenance of the suit property. Thus, the court has to
resort to honest guess work to quantify the mesne profits and for
this, the aforementioned case laws and its crux are being referred
to.

 lxxviii.           On the aspect of annual escalation, Ld. counsel for
defendant no.2 argued with much alacrity that 15% annual
increase is not considered by the court for the residential
property and therefore the judgment in M C Aggarwal is not
applicable to the suit property which is residential premises.

lxxxi.             In so far as annual escalation is concerned, we have
already seen in most of the judgments noted herein above that the
courts have been inclined to grant 10-15% annual escalation in
the rate of rent for every consecutive year for which the property
is retained in unlawful possession by the tenant/trespasser. In
order to bolster this principle of annual escalation, I reiterate the
judgment of High Court of Delhi in Chander Kirti Ranji

31.01.2013 in which case the Hon'ble Judge dealt with a suit in
respect of the first and second floor of the residential premises in

profits, the crux of which is produced again herein under:

 residential premises in Greater Kailash I area.                     The court
concluded that since the demised premises was situated in one of
the prime residential locality in Delhi i.e. Greater Kailash I, it
would be just and proper if an increase of 15% per annum over
and above the contractual rate be awarded along with simple
interest @10% per annum to be calculated on the monthly basis.

                                                              NAVJEET     BUDHIRAJA
                                                              BUDHIRAJA   Date: 2023.10.09
                                                                          15:56:38 +0530
                                     it is clear that for assessing
                                    mesne profits, judicial
                                    notice can be taken of the
                                    prevailing rents and that an
                                    element of guess work is
                                    always involved.


                                    12. Once some evidence
                                    has been adduced by the
                                    Plaintiff as to the prevailing
                                    rate and judicial notice
                                    taken as supplementing
                                    that, the burden shifts to the
                                    Defendant to establish his
                                    version as to the prevailing
                                    rents, or the rent at which
                                    similar premises were
                                    being leased out during the
                                    relevant period. He has also
                                    to prove the prevailing rate
                                    as being not what the lessor
                                    seeks to prove, but the rate
                                    which he contends it to be.


                                    It is on weighing the two
                                    that the Court determines
                                    the correct figure. The
                                    Defendant's       failure   to
                                    adduce evidence to rebut
                                    leaves the Court free to
                                    draw        an     appropriate
                                    inference, and pass orders."
                                    It is clear that the defendant
                                    had failed to submit any
                                    credible evidence. The
                                    defendants submissions are
                                    clearly without merits.

                                    70. As far as the contention
                                    of      the    plaintiffs    is
                                    concerned, in my opinion,
                                    there are no reasons to
                                    differ with the findings
                                    recorded by the Local
                                    Commissioner.

 
The Local Commissioner
                                    has for sound reasoning
                                    noted          that        the
                                    correspondence of Empire
                                    Store and Bata India Ltd.
                                    cannot be taken into
                                    account for the purpose of
                                    determining the market

                                                                        15:56:46 +0530
                                     rent. In my opinion, the
                                    conclusions are correct.


                                    PW4, the partner of Empire
                                    Store     in    his    cross-

                                    examination states that he
                                    is not aware of the area
                                    with Bata India Ltd. He is
                                    also not aware of whether a
                                    lease deed was executed in
                                    favour of Bata India Ltd.
                                    No lease deed has been
                                    produced. There is nothing
                                    to show what were the
                                    terms      and     conditions
                                    agreed upon. Hence, the
                                    conclusion of the Local
                                    Commissioner        in    not
                                    accepting       the      said
                                    documents are in order. The
                                    claim of the plaintiff on
                                    these      documents      i.e.
                                    Rs.41.97 per sq. ft. per
                                    month for 1979 cannot be
                                    accepted.

                                    ......

                                    73. It is also clear that
                                    determining the mesne
                                    profit/market rent for a
                                    period of nearly 27 years
                                    i.e. 1.2.1980 to 28.2.2007
                                    cannot be done on the basis
                                    of two sporadic leases of
                                    two separate properties
                                    filed by the plaintiffs dated
                                    5.6.1997 and 24.10.2005.
                                    There is also no evidence
                                    to show that the leases
                                    pertained to properties that
                                    had identical features as the
                                    suit     properties.     The
                                    evidence placed on record
                                    by the plaintiffs is sketchy
                                    and based on these sporadic
                                    leases for a huge area like
                                    Connaught Place it would
                                    not have been appropriate
                                    or proper to conclude the
                                    market rent for a long
                                    period of 27 years.

                                     Local Commissioner in
                                    fixing the base rate based
                                    on the rent of Rs.30,000/-
                                    per month for the period
                                    01.01.1980 to 31.01.1980
                                    is in order. It cannot be
                                    forgotten that as per the
                                    preliminary decree passed
                                    by this Court the initial rent
                                    had been agreed to be
                                    Rs.30,000/- per month for
                                    the period 1st January,
                                    1980 to 31st January, 1980
                                    i.e. one month. This rate
                                    was never challenged by
                                    the defendant before the
                                    Division Bench or the
                                    Supreme Court. In fact in
                                    an undertaking filed before
                                    the Supreme Court the
                                    defendant had agreed to
                                    pay the plaintiff at this rate
                                    till determination of the
                                    mesne profits by the Local
                                    Commissioner. The Local
                                    Commissioner rightly took
                                    this figure, namely, 9.37
                                    per sq.feet to be the base
                                    rate for 1980. The Local
                                    Commissioner also relied
                                    on leases produced before
                                    this court in various
                                    judicial pronouncement to
                                    conclude that the base rate
                                    of Rs.9.37 per sq.ft. is in
                                    order.
 
The enhancement of
                                    the said rate by 15% every

lxxxiii.           Thus, in the aforesaid case laws also the property
was found to be situated in prime location and a distinction was
also drawn between the properties which are commercial in
nature and residential properties which are at prime location
would fall in one bracket, and thus, in both the aforesaid cases,
15% annual escalation was found to be justified.



lxxxiv.            The question which now looms large is whether the
present case is such which would call for the application of 15%
annual escalation in the base price of Rs.18000/- from November
1993 onwards till 24.02.2020. On perusal of various lease deeds
placed on record on behalf of the plaintiff, it is made out that in

111 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 some cases the escalation in rent is prescribed every second year,
in some cases after three years @10-15% per annum, depending
upon the rate of rental, the location of property and other suitable
parameters. It is also seen that in case of residential properties,
the escalation generally hovers around 10% per annum. The
present is a case where the court is tasked to calculate the mesne
profits from the year 1993 till 2020 and in between this time
many significant developments in terms of economy and real
estate have taken place. The economy started opening up in the
early 1990 and the real estate flourished around early 2000,
followed by recession. The Courts also observed that though the
third quarter of 20th century saw a very slow but steady increase
in prices of immovable property but a drastic change occurred
from the beginning of the last quarter and a galloping increase in
prices of immovable properties had taken place with prices
increasing steeply, by leaps and bounds and judicial notice can be
taken thereof. Factoring in all these developments would involve
a lot of guess work in calculating in the mesne profits, which can
be avoided by adopting an annual figure of escalation ranging
between 10% to 15%. The fact that it is an admitted position that
despite the suit property being residential in nature, was being
used for running a kindergarten school which to some extent
would qualify to commercial activity and defendant no.2 having
not disclosed the profits generated while being in wrongful
possession of suit property, I am of the view that 12% annual
escalation in the base price of Rs.18,000/- would be just and
proper in the facts of the present case.
 
Thus, taking cue from the
aforesaid case laws, which had also discussed other significant
case laws pertaining to the calculation of the mesne profits, the
112 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 present case also calls for granting annual escalation of 12% on
the aforesaid fix base amount of Rs.18000/- per month in respect
of the suit property starting from November 1993 (the date of
institution of the suit being 10.11.1993) onwards, till February
2020 (the handing over of the suit property being 24.02.2020).




lxxxv.             I would now delve into the Judgments relied by Ld.
Counsel for defendant no. 2 on the aspect of grant of
damages/mesne profits. Since this is the most crucial aspect of
the case, I am stimulated to hash out each Judgment.



lxxxvi.            
In 
Fateh Chand v. Balkishan Dass
, [1964] 1 SCR
515, and Bureau of Indian Standards v. M/s Goodwill
Theatres Pvt. Ltd, Civil Appeal No. 8738 of 2017, Supreme
Court of India, the principle for the grant of mesne profits was
cited, and there is thus no divergence from that. The computation
of mesne profits arrived in this case is in accord with the
principle of annual escalation as approved in number of case
laws exposited above where the evidence is scanty and the Court
has to resort to some honest guess work. A person in wrongful
possession of immovable property has to pay compensation
computed on the basis of profits he actually received or with
ordinary diligence might have received. Further
, 
in that case
 the
transaction was in the nature of sale and purchase of the property,
which is not the case herein. The other Judgments are quite
categorical that in case of unauthorized possession of property, in
the absence of any evidence, annual escalation to the tune of 10-
15 percent can be awarded.

 lxxxvii.           
In 
Martin and Harris Ltd v. Rajendra Mehta
,
2022 8 SCC 527 and VC Jain v. Radha Kishan Poddar, 2021
SCC Online Del 4386 again the Court reiterated that the basis of
determination of the amount of mesne profits depends on the
facts and circumstances of each case considering the place where
property is situated along with other parameters. In that case,
considering the location, the Supreme Court upheld that mesne
profits of Rs2,50,000 per month. In this case also, the location of
the suit property is undoubtedly prime and, thus, the mesne
profits assessed are in sync with that, else annual escalation of 12
percent per annum would not have been given.




lxxxviii.          In      State         of      Maharashtra   v.   SuperMax
International Pvt. Ltd, 2009 9 SCC 772, the Courts are called
upon to exercise restraint and would not fix any excessive,
fanciful and punitive amount. Despite the dictums favoring grant
of 15 percent annual escalation, I have avoided such outer limit
and reduced it to 12 percent per annum, which cannot be termed
as fanciful.



lxxxix.            
In 
Alka Sachdeva v. Neeraj Gupta and Others
,
2021 SCC Online Del 5536, the Court took note of the
dilapidated condition of the property and the lease deeds of the
neighbouring area, which is done in this case also as I have given
an average figure of base value of mesne profits in the year 1993
on the basis of the lease deeds of the corresponding period placed
on behalf of defendant no. 2 only.




xc.       
In 
Marudhar Services v. Ved Prakash and Other
, 2012


114 
Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors
 CS DJ no.211236/2016
 SCC Online Del 4232, the court appreciated that in case of
commercial property the annual escalation can be 15 percent
which can be reduced to 10 percent in residential property.


Keeping this in mind, escalation of 15 percent was declined, but
considering the dictum in the case of 
Anil Kumar
 case and
Chander kirti 
Rani Tandon
 case mentioned above that in
commercial properties and residential properties at prime
locations, 15 percent escalation is permitted, I have deemed it fit
to award 12 percent annual escalation given the fact that suit
property is situated in one of the prime locations of South Delhi
i.e Greater Kailash on a wide road.




xci.               
In 
Hindustan Paper Corporation v. Kanta
Manocha
, 2013 SCC Online Del 4232, the Court had spoken
about 10-15 percent increase every three years, but this can be
one off case as we have seen in numerous cases above that
escalation is being given on yearly basis.




xcii.              Further, a pleading of mis-joinder of parties and the
suit being barred by limitation were also raised in the written
statement, however, there is no evidence to substantiate these
pleadings. The cause of action in regard to the claim of mesne
profits is a continuing one and in this case since the suit property
was surrendered on behalf of defendant no.2 only on 24.02.2020,
at no stretch of imagination, the suit cannot be said to be barred
by limitation.



xciii.             Ld. Counsel for Defendant no.2 also elucidated with
the help of case laws on the concept that plaintiff has to prove the

                                                              BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09
                                                                        15:57:38 +0530
 case on its own merits without deriving any advantage out of the
weakness of the defendant, but this weakness which Ld. Counsel
was referring to was the pleading of the defendant no.2 of having
become owner of the suit property on the back of adverse
possession. This argument is also nothing but a ploy to save
defendant no.2 from being imputed with the liability to
compensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered by keeping out of
the possession of suit property. The plaintiff has proved her
entitlement to claim mesne profits the moment defendant no.2
chose to concede the possession of the suit property in her favour
which also amounted to conceding to the ownership claim of the
plaintiff.




         Issue no.1 is accordingly decided in favour of the
plaintiff and against defendant no. 2.



42.                Issue no.2: Whether the plaintiff is also entitled
to any interest? OPP


i.                 The burden to prove this issue was also on the
plaintiff. Ld. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, as we have already
noted, laid thrust on restitution in favour of the plaintiff and to
set an example by granting exemplary interest in the form of
compound interest rather than simple interest.



ii.                Ld. counsel for defendant no.2, per contra, stated
that the principle of restitution has been invoked for the first time
at the stage of final arguments which does not find part of the
pleading or the evidence of the plaintiff and in this regard

 reliance is placed upon the judgment of 
State of Gujarat &
others Vs. Essar Oil Limited and another
, AIR 2012 SC 1146
wherein it was held as under:


                                    "....Concept of restitution
                                    is basically founded on the
                                    idea that when a decree is
                                    reversed, law imposes an
                                    obligation on the party who
                                    received an unjust benefit
                                    of the erroneous decree to
                                    restitute the other party of
                                    what the other party has
                                    lost during the period of
                                    erroneous decree was in
                                    operation. The Court while
                                    granting     restitution   is
                                    required to restore the
                                    parties as far as possible to
                                    their same position as they
                                    were in at the time when
                                    the court by its erroneous
                                    action displaced them...."



iii.               Further to counter the judgment of Madras High
Court relied on behalf of the plaintiff mentioned in preceding
discussion, Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 canvassed that 
the
said judgment
 is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of
the present case as the facts therein are entirely different and 
the
said judgment
 cannot be treated to be a precedent applicable to
the present case. Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 categorically
distinguished 
the said judgment
 of Madras High Court from the
present case on various parameters in the written synopsis.




iv.                From the expression "together with interest on such
profits" in 
Section 2(12)
 of CPC, it is apparent that mesne profits
includes within its fold an interest component and the rate of
interest to be allowed in regard to the mesne profits varies

 depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Since
the statute does not fix any rate of interest, it is left at the
discretion of the court to determine the rate of interest.
 
In

Mahant Narayana Dasjee Vs. Board of Trustees
, The
Tirumalai 1965 SC 1231, the Supreme Court observed that the
interest is integral part of mesne profits, therefore, it is to be
allowed in the computation of mesne profits itself.




v.                 In the plaint, the plaintiff has claimed interest @
19% per annum but no material has been placed on record to
justify such exorbitant rate of interest, except the oral arguments
advanced on behalf of the plaintiff wherein cross examination of
DW1 was also pointed out particularly from question no.16 to 34
and question 114 to 120. The interest component also constitutes
a significant fragment of the pleading and evidence, and since in
this case the testimony of PW1 can be read only to a limited
extent, he being the special power of attorney holder of the
plaintiff, and in the absence of any material in his affidavit to
support the claim of 19% interest, the cross questioning of DW1
on the aspect of rates applicable to the nationalized bank and
returns at a particular rate would be of no assistance to the
plaintiff.



vi.                Ld. Counsel for defendant no. 2 also referred to

Ramnik Vallabhdas
Madhvani v. Taraben PravinLal Madhvani

annum.

 vii.               On the issue of interest on mesne profits, let me
spell out the observation of High Court of Delhi in M/s M C
Agarwala (HUF) Vs. M/s Sahara India and Ors, date of
decision 02.09.2011, paragraph 17 of which is relevant and the
same is as under:


                                    "17. In my opinion, the
                                    interest granted at the rate
                                    of 20% per month besides
                                    being wholly vague is
                                    clearly exorbitant in the

                                    where the rates of interest
                                    on fixed deposit vary
                                    between 6% to 10% per

                                    payable for the said month
                                    from 1.2.2005. For the
                                    month of February, 2005
                                    interest will be payable
                                    from       1.3.2005      and
                                    similarly with respect to
                                    earlier months, the interest
                                    will be payable at the end

                                    occupation by the tenants.


                                    I may note that the
                                    Supreme Court has also
                                    awarded interest on arrears
                                    of mesne profits and one
                                    such judgment of the
                                    Supreme Court is the case
                                    of Indian Oil Coporation v.

                                    Saroj Baweja, (2005) 12
                                    SCC 298."



viii.              In the aforesaid case, the Hon'ble Judge has noted
that the interest granted at the rate of 20% per annum was clearly
vague and exorbitant where the rate of interest on fixed deposit
vary between 6 to 10% per annum. The Hon'ble Judge has also
referred to various other judgments of the Supreme Court to
highlight that the courts are mandated to reduce high rate of
interest which are claimed.



ix.                Furthermore, 
Section 34
 of CPC prescribes that the
grant of interest on the principal sum has to be reasonable.

Section 3
 and 
4
 of the Interest Act also prescribe relevant
provisions for grant of interest in money suits. The present case
is one such case which undoubtedly stands out for the sheer
abuse of the process of law as a result of which the present
litigation remained in the corridors of the court for almost three
decades. Defendant no.2, though can be stated to have entered
into the suit property being the partner of Pires School but her
possession became illegal, once she started proclaiming herself
as owner of the suit property on the basis of adverse possession,
which plea from the very inception was false and vexatious and
which eventually fizzled out when the keys of the suit property
was handed over to the plaintiff. But in this long-drawn process,
the plaintiff has suffered due to shenanigans of defendant no.2
who managed to prolong the litigation for almost three decades.
When the plaintiff had purchased the suit property and became
its legal owner following which the present suit was filed,
defendant no.2 ought to have vacated the suit property in the
absence of any legal right to occupy the same but she persisted in
her illegal quest to usurp the suit property in the garb of plea of
adverse possession, which constrained the plaintiff to embark on
this unwarranted journey, in order to lawful recover the
possession of the suit property. Therefore, for these special
reasons, I am of the confirmed opinion that defendant no.2 be
saddled with onerous interest at the rate of 9% per annum
(simple) payable at the end of each month of illegal occupation
by defendant no.2 starting from the institution of the suit till
handing over of the suit property.




x.                 Though, Ld. Senior counsel for the plaintiff, during

arguments, clamored for the grant of compound interest on the
back of the restitution theory as propounded in the judgments
referred by Ld. Senior counsel, however, those judgments are on
distinct platform, except the judgment in 
K Pandurangan Vs.
Mrs. C Parimala
, date of decision 23.12.2021, Madras High
Court, but 
in that case
 also, the High Court reduced the
compensation as sought by the party from Rs.49 lacs
approximately to Rs.35 lacs. No doubt, the plaintiff herein is
entitled to the restitution for the immense loss suffered by her at
the hands of the defendant no.2, but in my opinion, ends of
justice would be met by granting 9% simple interest per annum
to be calculated at the end of each month when the mesne profits
fell due.


                   Issue no.2 is decided in favor of the plaintiff and
against the defendant no.2.



42.                In so far as the claim of recovery of Rs.11,66,500/-
on behalf of the plaintiff as damages/mesne profits for the year
19.02.1992 till 08.02.1993, in view of the jurisprudence of grant
of mesne profits, the fact that the same can only be awarded from
the date of institution of the suit, the arrears with effect from
19.02.1992 cannot be granted in favour of the plaintiff. It is not
the case of the plaintiff that defendant no.2 was a tenant in the
suit property who was bound to deposit/pay the arrears of rent.
Therefore, this claim of the plaintiff cannot be acceded to.
Decision:

43.                The suit of the Plaintiff is decreed against Defendant
no.2/LRs as per memo of parties as under:

1. Mesne profits @ Rs.18,000/- per month from 10th November
