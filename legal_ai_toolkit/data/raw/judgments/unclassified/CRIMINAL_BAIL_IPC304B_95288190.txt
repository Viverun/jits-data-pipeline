        THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
                  M.Cr.C. No.42371/2019
               (Akash Khatik Vs. State of M.P.)
Gwalior, Dated : 18/10/19
      Shri R.K. Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioner.
      Shri Vikrant Sharma, learned Public Prosecutor for the
respondent/State.


      Case diary is perused.



      Learned counsel for the rival parties are heard.

      This is first application
 u/S. 438
 Cr.P.C. filed by the petitioner

for grant of anticipatory bail.



      Petitioner apprehends arrest in connection with offences

punishable u/Ss. 498A, 304B/34 of 
IPC
 and
 u/S.3
/
4
 of Dowry

Prohibition Act registered as Crime No.117/2019 at Police Station

Gorami, District Bhind (M.P.).



      Learned Public Prosecutor for the State opposed the application

and prayed for its rejection by contending that on the basis of the

allegations and the material available on record, no case for grant of

Anticipatory bail is made out.



      Petitioner who is cousin brother-in-law (Jeth) of the deceased

is alleged with dowry demand related cruelty which had led to the

deceased committing suicide by hanging herself. Marriage took place

on 22/06/2018 as against the incident being of 21/02/2019.


      Reading of statement of father of deceased recorded
 u/S.161


Cr.P.C. reveals some physical/mental cruelty for demand of dowry

was inflicted but specific allegation of the same having been inflicted

soon before death appears to be missing.

                                  2               M.Cr.C. No.42371/19


       In view of above and considering the fact that the applicant

has no criminal antecedents and that the material placed on record

does not disclose the possibility of petitioner fleeing from justice, this

Court is though inclined to extend the benefit of bail to the petitioner

but with certain stringent conditions in view of pending investigation.


      Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on merits of the

case, I deem it appropriate to allow this application
 u/S 438
 Cr.P.C in

the following terms.



      It is hereby directed that in the event of arrest, the petitioner

shall be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/-

(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties, each of

Rs.25,000/- to the satisfaction of Arresting Authority.


      This order will remain operative subject to compliance of the

following conditions by the petitioner :-


      1. The petitioner will comply with all the terms and conditions
         of the bond executed by him;



      2. The petitioner will cooperate in the investigation/trial, as the
         case may be;



      3. The petitioner will not indulge herself in extending
         inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with
         the facts of the case so as to dissuade him/her from
         disclosing such facts to the Court or to the Police Officer, as
         the case may be;



      4. The petitioner shall not commit and offence similar to the
         offence of which he is accused;



      5. The petitioner will not seek unnecessary adjournments
         during the trial; and


      6. The petitioner will not leave India without previous
         permission of the trial Court/Investigating Officer, as the
         case may be.

                                   3               M.Cr.C. No.42371/19


         7. The petitioner shall mark his appearance before the
            concerned Police Station once in week till conclusion of

            place of residence of petitioner or at any other place in the
            district which is earmarked by the Collector/Revenue
            Authority for planting trees and shall take care of the trees
            for the next one year by watering the plants and by
            installing tree guards at her own expenses. In case the
            petitioner is unable to afford incurring of such expenses,
            then he would obtain saplings/tree guard from the forest
            authorities (the concerned Forest Range Officer of the area)
            free of cost or at concessional/nominal rates available under
            any beneficial scheme of the Government. The petitioner
            shall file an affidavit disclosing compliance of this
            condition within 30 days in the Registry, failing which this
            court may consider cancellation of bail.



         9. On complying with condition No.8 aforesaid, the petitioner
            is directed to inform the location of plantation made to the
            Forest Range Officer of the area concerned who will pass on
            this information to the DFO concerned.



         For effective implementation of this order in the interest of

betterment of ecology of the area concerned, the District Magistrate
