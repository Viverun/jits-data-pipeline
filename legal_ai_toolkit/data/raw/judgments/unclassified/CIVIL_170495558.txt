       4.   The   contents    of    written   statement   of

defendant No.1, 3 and 4 in brief are as under:-



       The suit filed by plaintiffs is maintainable in law

and on facts and same is liable to be dismissed.

Munishamappa and Smt. Lingamma are unknown to

family of defendants No.1 to 9. The plaintiffs and

defendants No.1 to 9 do not belong to same family.

Defendants No.1 to 9 are claiming lineage from Sri

Venkatappa and Smt. Gopamma. Smt. Nanjamma and

Smt. Muniyamma are daughters of Venkatappa and

Smt.          Gopamma.       Muniyappa,        Chikkapaiah,

Venkataramanappa and Narayanaswamy are children

of     Smt.     Muniyamma.        Narayanappa,   Ramanna,

Muniyappa and Smt. Parvathamm are children of Smt.

                                    9                 O.S.No.26411/2014


Nanjamma.         It     is   further    specifically     contended,

Sy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3, situated at Dasarahalli

Village were purchased by Sonnappa, who is husband

of Smt. Muniyamma. Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.

Nanjamma purchased Sy.No.43/2.                 Smt. Muniyamma

and Smt. Nanjamma are not related to plaintiffs. Suit

'A' schedule properties acquired by defendant No.10 for

formation    of        Arkavathi Layout.      Suit      'B'     schedule

properties acquired by defendant No.1 out of his own

earning. Plaintiffs are not entitled for compensation

amount relating to properties acquired by BDA. Suit 'C'

schedule properties were purchased by Sonnappa in the

auction.    Suit        'C'   schedule    properties          exclusively

belonged to Sonnappa.             The plaintiffs are not in joint

possession and enjoyment of suit properties.                         The

plaintiffs have not properly valued subject matter of suit

and they have not paid proper court fees. On these

grounds,     defendants have requested to dismiss suit

filed by plaintiff.





      5.    The        contents    of    written     statement        of

defendant No.2(a) and 7 in brief are as under:-

                                      10            O.S.No.26411/2014


      The suit filed by plaintiffs is maintainable in law

and on facts and same is liable to be dismissed. Suit of

plaintiffs         is      wholly     misconceived,    vexatious,

unsustainable and liable to be dismissed.                Neither

plaintiffs, defendants No.11 and 12 nor late Smt.

Lingamma and Munishamappa are part of joint family

of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma. Genealogical

tree produced by plaintiffs is created for the purpose of

filing suit. late Munishamappa was not Kartha or

original owner of suit 'A' schedule properties.              Smt.

Lingamma and Sri Munishamappa are strangers to

family of defendants No.1 to 9.             Suit is bad for non-

joinder of necessary parties and bad for mis-joinder of

parties. Title deeds and revenue records indicates that,

suit schedule properties should in exclusive name of

defendants No.1 to 9 for more than 50 years prior to

filing present suit.          As such, suit is barred by law of

limitation. Smt. Nanjamma and Smt. Muniyamma are

daughters          of     Venkatappa      and   Smt.   Gopamma.

Sonnappa is husband of Smt. Muniyamma. Sonnappa

during       his        lifetime    purchased   Sy.No.43/1   and

Sy.No.43/3 out of his own income under registered sale

                                  11              O.S.No.26411/2014


deed. Sy.No.43/2 was acquired by Smt.Nanjamma D/o.

Venkatappa and Smt. Muniyamma under registered

sale deed.     Subsequently, there was deed of partition

dated 30.06.1950 and Sy.No.43/2 divided between Smt.

Nanjamma and Smt.Muniyamma. Defendants No.1 to 9

become owners of suit properties. Plaintiffs, defendants

No.11 and 12 do not any share in suit properties.

Present suit filed merely to harass defendants No.1 to 9

and in order to make wrongful gain. The plaintiffs have

not properly valued subject matter of suit and they have

not paid proper court fees.               On these grounds,

defendants have requested to dismiss                 suit filed by

plaintiff.





      6.     The    contents     of   written   statement        of

defendant No.10 in brief are as under:-



      The suit filed by plaintiffs is maintainable in law

and on facts and same is liable to be dismissed. The

plaintiffs have not issued notice to defendant No.10 as

contemplated under 
Section 64
 of BDA Act.                       The

defendant      No.10      -BDA     has    issued      preliminary

notification       and   final   notification   in    respect    of

                              12                O.S.No.26411/2014


acquisition of Sy.No.43/1, Sy.No.43/2 and Sy.No.43/3

of Dasarahalli Village for formation of Arkavathi Layout.

Defendant    No.10    authority    is   in   possession   and

enjoyment of acquired lands. There is no cause of

action for the plaintiffs to file suit against defendant

No.10. On these grounds, defendant has requested to

dismiss suit filed by plaintiff.





      7. On the basis of above pleadings of both parties,

this court has framed the following :-



                             ISSUES

         1. Whether the plaintiffs prove that the
            Plaint Schedule Properties are the joint

      for the following -

                     REASONS


     11. ISSUES No.1, 2 AND ADDITIONAL ISSUE

NO.2 :- As these issues are inter-related to each other

and involves common appreciation of facts and evidence

on record, findings on one issue are bearing on other

issue, in order to avoid repetition of facts and for

convenience sake, both issues are taken together for

common discussion.





     12. As per case of plaintiffs, late Smt. Lingamma,

Smt. Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma are

daughters of late Munishamappa. It is specifically

stated in plaint that, late Munishamappa had no male

children. Munishamappa having acquired suit schedule

properties died leaving behind his three daughters who

are Smt. Lingamma, Smt. Late Muniyamma and Smt.

                            16             O.S.No.26411/2014


Late Nanjamma to succeeded to his estate. Further it is

definite case of plaintiffs and same is deposed by

plaintiff No.4, who examined as P.W.1 that, plaintiffs

No.1 to 12 are legal heirs of late Smt. Lingamma. The

defendants No.1 to 6 are legal heirs of late Smt.

Muniyamma. The defendants No.7 to 9 are legal heirs of

late Smt. Nanjamma.





     13. It is pertinent to note here that, the contesting

defendants have denied and disputed relationship of

late Smt. Lingamma with that of late Smt. Muniyamma

and late Smt. Nanjamma. It is specifically contended by

contesting defendants, neither plaintiffs nor defendants

No.11 and 12, so also late Smt. Lingamma and

Munishamappa were not part of joint family of Smt.

Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma.               It is specific

contention of defendants and same is deposed by

defendant No.7, who examined as D.W.1 that, plaintiffs

and defendants No.1 to 9 are not members of joint

family. It is further contended and deposed by D.W.1

that, plaintiffs are claiming partition through late

Munishamappa     and    late    Smt.   Lingamma.   These

                             17             O.S.No.26411/2014


Munishamappa and Smt. Lingamma are unknown to

the family of defendants No.1 to 9.





     14. According to defendants, Sri Venkatappa and

his wife Smt. Gopamma had two daughters namely Smt.

Najamma and Smt. Muniyamma.           Muniyappa, Chikka

Appaiah, Venkataramanappa and Narayanaswamy are

children of Smt Muniyamma. Narayanappa, Ramanna,

Muniyappa and Smt. Parvathamma are children of Smt.

Najamma.





     15. On proper appreciation of pleadings of parties

and evidence of P.W.1 and D.W.1, it is very much clear

that, plaintiffs have claimed late Smt. Lingamma and

late Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma are

daughters of late Munishamappa. On the other hand,

contesting   defendants    have   denied   and   disputed

relationship of plaintiffs and late Smt. Lingamma with

that of late Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma

as well as relationship of plaintiffs and these defendants

No.1 to 9. The defendants have claimed late Smt.

Nanjamma     and    late   Smt.   Muniyamma      are   not

daughters of late Munishamappa. On the other hand,

                             18              O.S.No.26411/2014


they are daughters of late Venkatappa and late Smt.

Gopamma.



      16. When there is serious dispute with regard to

relationship of parties, it is heavy burden on plaintiffs to

prove relationship of late Smt. Lingamma with that of

late Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma as per

Provision under 
Section 50
 of Indian Evidence Act. It is

well settled proposition of law that, when relationship of

one person with another person is in dispute in Civil

suit, same has to be proved as per provisions of 
Sec. 50


of Indian Evidence Act. 
Sec. 50
 of Indian Evidence Act

is an exception to General rule that, hearsay evidence is

inadmissible and opinion based on such evidence. As

per 
Sec.50
 of Evidence Act mere opinion expressed by

conduct of a person, who is a member of a family or

otherwise has special means of knowledge as to

existence of relationship is admissible under this

Section. Such person need not be a member of family.

He may be an outsider. It will suffice, if he has special

means of knowledge. So, a person watching conduct of

members has to be treated as a person with special

means of knowledge.

                             19             O.S.No.26411/2014


     17. Further ingredients of 
Sec.50
 of Evidence Act

are as follows:- 1) There must be case, where court has

to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person

to another. 2) In such case, opinion expressed by

conduct as to existence of such relationship is relevant

fact. 3) But a person whose opinion is expressed by

conduct is relevant must be person as member of family

or otherwise has special means of knowledge on

particular subject of relationship.





     18. Herein the case, genealogical tree of family of

plaintiffs and defendants No.1 to 9 has been produced

as per Ex.P.1. In said document, Smt. Lingamma, Smt.

Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma shown as

daughters of late Munishamappa.       Admittedly, Ex.P.1

genealogical tree not issued by competent authority. It

is fact that, said document has been prepared based on

information furnished by plaintiff No.4.



     19. It is required to be noted here, just based on

oral contention of plaintiffs and contents of Ex.P.1

genealogy, which is prepared based on information of

plaintiff No.4 it is very hard to come to conclusion the

                            20              O.S.No.26411/2014


plaintiffs have proved their relationship with that of

Smt. Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma.            
In

this regard, reference has to be made to decision of

Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (1983) 3 SCC

118 in case of 
State of Bihar Vs. Radha Krishna

Singh and others
, wherein it is held that, in cases

where the plaint genealogy is the very basis of plaintiffs

case and since there is a tendency on the part of an

interested person or a party in order to grab, establish

or prove an alleged crime to concoct, fabricate or

procure false genealogy to suit their ends, the court

should endeavor to do justice on the materials and

records uninfluenced and undaunted by any extraneous

circumstances. It is further held that, genealogies

admitted or proved to be old and relied on in previous

cases are doubtless relevant and in some cases may

even be conclusive of the facts proved, but there are

several considerations which must be kept in mind viz.:


(a)   Source of the genealogy and its dependability. (b)

Admissibility of the genealogy under the 
Evidence Act
.


(c)   A proper use in decisions or judgments on which

reliance is placed. (d) Age of genealogies. (e) Litigation

                               21                O.S.No.26411/2014


where such genealogies have been accepted or rejected.


On the question of admissibility the following tests must

be   adopted:   (a)   The    genealogies   of    the   families

concerned must fall within the four-corners of 
Section

32(5)
 or 
Section 13
 of the Evidence Act. (b) They must

not be hit by the doctrine of post litem motam. (c) The

genealogies or the claims cannot be proved by recitals,

depositions or facts narrated in the judgment which

have been held by a long course of decisions to be

inadmissible. (d) Where genealogy is proved by oral

evidence, the said evidence must clearly show special

means of knowledge disclosing the exact source, time

and the circumstances under which the knowledge is

acquired, and this must be clearly and conclusively

proved.



      20. Herein the case, if principles 
laid down in


above decision are press into service to the facts and

circumstances    of   case    on   hand,    the    contesting

defendants have seriously disputed relationship of

plaintiffs with that of deceased Smt. Late Muniyamma

and Smt. Late Nanjamma as claimed in the plaint and

also as mentioned in Ex.P1, Now it is bounden duty of

                            22             O.S.No.26411/2014


plaintiffs to prove their relationship with those persons

by producing sufficient documentary and oral evidence

before the court.



     21. The P.W.1 in his cross-examination has

denied, late Smt. Muniyamma and late Smt. Nanjamma

are daughters of late Venkatappa and late Smt.

Gopamma.      It is specific say of P.W.1 that, except

genealogical tree/Ex.P.1, plaintiffs have not produced

other documents to establish relationship of Smt.

Lingamma, Smt. Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late

Nanjamma. Further it is to be noted here, no persons

who being family members of plaintiffs or defendants or

persons having special means of knowledge about

relationship of Smt. Lingamma with that of Smt. Late

Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma have been

examined before court.    The plaintiffs have not taken

any steps to establish relationship of these plaintiffs

No.1 to 12 with that of defendants No.1 to 9 as well as

their relationship with late Smt. Muniyamma and late

Smt. Nanjamma.



     22. As already discussed, P.W.1 has clearly

admitted except Ex.P.1 genealogical tree there is no

                              23               O.S.No.26411/2014


other documents or evidence of family members of

plaintiffs and defendants to establish Smt. Lingamma

being daughter of late Munishamappa is sister of Smt.

Late Muniyamma and Smt. Late Nanjamma. Even in

cross-examination of D.W.1, nothing worth elicited to

come to conclusion, Smt. Lingamma is own sisters of

Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma.              Further it is

not elicited from mouth of D.W.1 that, ancestor of

plaintiffs and Smt. Lingamma, ancestors of defendants

No.1 to 9 who are Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.

Nanjamma are daughters of late Munishamappa. The

D.W.1 in his cross-examination has categorically stated,

Smt.    Muniyamma      and    Smt.    Nanjamma      are   the

daughters of late Venkatappa and Smt. Gopamm.

Absolutely there is no documentary evidence issued by

competent authority to say late Smt. Lingamma being

one of daughter of Munishamappa, she is sister of Smt.

Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma.



       23. According to plaintiffs, Munishamappa during

his lifetime has acquired suit 'A' schedule properties.

Further it is specifically stated by plaintiffs that, suit 'B'

schedule properties purchased in the name of defendant

                             24               O.S.No.26411/2014


No.1 out of joint family funds by selling portion of suit

properties. Further it is definite case of plaintiffs that,

defendant   No.10    has   acquired   suit   'A'   schedule

properties for formation of residential layout. As such,

plaintiffs being legal heirs of late Smt. Lingamma and

they have got their definite share in suit properties.


     24. It is specifically contended by defendants and

same is deposed by D.W.1 that, Sonnappa, who is

husband of Smt. Muniyamma, during his lifetime, he

acquired land bearing Sy.No.43/1 and 43/3 out of his

own income. These Sy.No.43/1 and 43/3 are absolute

properties of late Sonnapp. In order to substantiate

same, defendants have produced certified copy of sale

deed dated 12.08.1960 as per Ex.D.4.



     25. On perusal of contents of said document,

Sonnappa S/o. Muniyappa had purchased Sy.No.43/1

to an extent of 2 acres 29 guntas and Sy.No.43/3 to an

extent of 29 guntas from Nanjappa and his family

members. The defendants have further produced sale

deeds of vendors of Nanjappa in respect of these

properties as per Exs.D.1 to D.3.

                                25             O.S.No.26411/2014


     26. On careful perusal of contents of Ex.D.1, K.V.

Byregowda had sold Sy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3 of

Dasarahalli Vilalge, in favour of Nanjappa under

registered   sale    deed   dated   01.05.1945.   Later    on

Nanjappa and his family members sold these properties

under Ex.D.2 dated 21.04.1956             in favour of Smt.

Muthamma. Under Ex.D.3, Smt. Muthamma has sold

these properties in favour of Sri Nanjappa and his

family members under registered sale deed dated

07.09.1959.    As    already   discussed,    under     Ex.D.4,

Sonnappa      S/o.   Muniyappa      had    purchased     these

Sy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3 of Dasarahalli Vilalge under

registered sale deed from Nanjappa and his family

members.



     27.     The records of rights of Sy.No.43/1 to an

extent of 2 acres 29 guntas from the year 1969 to 2013-

14 have been produced as per Exs.P.1 to P.19. On

careful perusal of these documents, earlier name of

Sonnappa S/o. Muniyappa was shown as owner and

possessor of properties. On perusal of Ex.P.5, name of

Sonnappa S/o. Muniyappa has been round off and

names of his sons Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,

                                 26             O.S.No.26411/2014


Chikkapaiah      and          Narayanaswamy        entered   to

Sy.No.43/1 in concerned revenue records based on IHC

No.2/1985-86. Thereafter, names of these persons

continued in revenue records.





     28. Likewise, records of rights of Sy.No.43/2 have

been produced as per Exs.P.22 to P.36. On perusal of

these documents, earlier names of Smt. Najamma and

Smt. Muniyamma jointly entered into said property as

owners and possessors. As per Ex.P.23 names of Smt.

Nanjamma and Smt. Muniyamma round off and thereby

names of her sons Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,

Chikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy entered into an

extent of property held by Smt. Muniyamma.



     29. The records of rights of Sy.No.43/3 have been

produced as per Exs.P.37 to P.56. On careful perusal of

contents   of   these     documents,     earlier    names    of

Sonnappa S/o. Muniyappa entered as owner and

possessor of property. As per Ex.P.40, names of

Sonnappa    round       off    and   names    of   Muniyappa,

Venkataramanappa, Chikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy

have been entered into the property.

                            27               O.S.No.26411/2014


     30. Records of rights of Sy.No.33, Sy.No.32 have

been produced as per Exs.P.58 to P.60. On careful

perusal of these documents, name of defendant No.1

shown as owner and possessor of these properties. As

per Ex.P.69/ mutation registrar extract, it can be

gathered that, name of defendants has been entered

into Sy.No.32/1, which is suit item No.1 of suit 'B'

schedule properties in the name of defendant No.1 by

deleting name of H.B. Ramegowda S/o. Bettegowda.



     31. The records of rights of suit item No. 1 to 3 of

suit 'C' schedule properties have been produced as per

Exs.P.71 to P.90. On careful perusal of contents of these

documents, names of Muniyappa, Venkataramanappa,

Chikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy jointly shown as

owners and possessors of these properties.



     32.    As per documents 
referred above
, name of

Sonnappa     and   thereafter     names   of      Muniyappa,

Venkataramanappa, Chikkapaiah and Narayanaswamy

have been entered into suit schedule properties in

concerned    revenue   records.      Plaintiffs    have   not

produced any documents to show, earlier to name of

                              28             O.S.No.26411/2014


Sonnappa         or     Muniyappa,   Venkataramanappa,

Chikkapaiah           and   Narayanaswamy     name    of

Munishamappa, who is father of Smt. Lingamma

entered to these suit properties as owner and possessor

of properties.





      33. At one stretch, during cross-examination,

P.W.1 has claimed, he can produce documents to show

land bearing Sy.No.43/1 and Sy.No.43/3 were standing

in the name of Munishamappa. In further cross-

examination, it is claimed by P.W.1 that, he has

produced documents to show all these suit properties

were standing in the name of Sonnappa.





      34. On careful perusal of documents produced by

plaintiffs before court no such registered deeds or

revenue records produced before court to show earlier

these suit properties were standing in the name of

Munishamappa, who is father of late Smt. Lingamma.

On the other hand, there is registered sale deeds and

long standing revenue records from the year 1969 to

2013-14 wherein name of Sonnappa and later names of

defendants No.1 to 3 and Narayanaswamy entered to

                               29               O.S.No.26411/2014


these     properties   are   owners     and    possessors    of

properties.





        35.   On proper appreciation of oral evidence as

well    as    documentary    evidence   as    
referred   above
,

plaintiffs have failed to establish, their ancestor Smt.

Lingamma being daughter of late Munishamappa is

sister of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma.

Further, plaintiffs have failed to establish earlier suit 'A'

schedule properties were acquired by Munishamappa

and suit 'B' schedule properties purchased in the name

of defendant No.1 out of joint family funds.



        36. Once, plaintiffs have failed to establish their

relationship with that of Smt. Nanjamma and Smt.

Muniyamma and Sonnappa as well as these defendants

No.1 to 9, plaintiffs cannot claim they are in joint

possession and enjoyment of suit properties along with

defendants No.1 to 9, 11 and 12. On the other hand, by

virtue of registered documents and long standing

revenue records which are remained unchallenged from

the year 1969, defendants No.1 to 9 have proved, they

are absolute owners of suit schedule properties. Hence I

                              30              O.S.No.26411/2014


answer Issue No.1 and 2 in the negative, Additional

Issue No.2 dated 03.03.2022 in the affirmative.



     37.ADDITIONAL           ISSUE         NO.3    DATED

03.03.2022 :-



     As these issues are inter-related to each other and

involves common appreciation of facts and evidence on

record, findings on one issue are bearing on other issue,

in order to avoid repetition of facts and for convenience

sake, both issues are taken together for common

discussion.





     38. It is specific contention of plaintiffs that, even

though suit 'B' schedule properties purchased in the

name of defendant No.1, same are also joint family

properties of plaintiffs and defendants No.1 to 9. These

properties purchased from joint family funds by selling

portion of suit 'A' schedule properties.



     39. As already discussed, plaintiffs have failed to

establish they themselves and late Smt. Lingamma are

joint family members of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt.

Nanjamma.     Plaintiffs further failed to establish, Smt.

Lingamma      being    one    of     daughters    of   late

                                   31              O.S.No.26411/2014


Munishamappa become member of joint family of Smt.

Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma. Once, plaintiffs have

failed to establish relationship of late Smt. Lingamma as

own sister of Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma,

contention of plaintiffs that, suit 'A' schedule properties

are joint family properties of themselves and defendants

No.1 to 9 and out of joint family funds, suit 'B' schedule

properties purchased in the name of defendant No.1 is

not at all sustainable.



      40. The plaintiffs first of all have to establish suit

'A' schedule properties are joint family properties of

themselves and defendants No.1 to 9 and there was

sufficient    nucleus      from    these   suit   'A'   schedule

properties.    
In   this    regard,    learned     counsel   for

defendants has rightly relied upon decision reported in

(2003) 10 SCC 310 in case of 
B.S. Lakshmaiah and

another vs. L. Balasubramanyam and another
 and

another decision reported in (1969) 1 SCC 392 in

case of 
Vallabbahi Nathabhai Vs. Baji Jivi and

others
, wherein it is held that, the parties failed to

discharge initial burden of establishing that there was

any nucleus in the form of any income whatsoever from

                             32              O.S.No.26411/2014


joint family property. No presumption of property being

joint family property only on account of existence of a

Hindu Joint Family. The one who asserts has to prove

the property is joint family property.    Hence, I answer

Additional Issue No.3 dated 03.03.2022 in the

negative.






     41. ISSUE NO.3 :- The defendant No.10 has

specifically contended, suit is not maintainable either in

law or on facts without issuing prior notice to defendant

authority. It is further contended, already Sy.No.43/1,

43/2 and 43/3 of Dasarahalli Village have been

acquired by BDA for formation of Arkavathi Layout as

per Notification issued in the year 2003 itself.



     42. It is pertinent to note here that, as per Section

64 of Bengaluru Development Authority Act, one month

written notice be given to BDA before filing suit. It is

also pertinent to note here that, in case of urgent relief

suit can be filed without notice with court's leave.



     43. Herein the case, plaintiffs have not issued any

prior notice to defendant No.10 authority as required

under 
Section 64
 of BDA Act. Further, no application

                             33             O.S.No.26411/2014


seeking suspension of such notice filed along with

plaint. As such, suit against defendant No.10 by

plaintiffs is not maintainable.   
In this regard, learned

counsel for defendants has rightly relied upon decision

reported in ILR 1992 KAR 307 in case of 
K.P. Arvind

Vs. Government of Karnataka
 wherein it is held that,

the plaint must state in unequivocal terms that, notice

in writing as required under 
Section 64
 of BDA Act has

been served on BDA, one month prior to presentation of

plaint. In instant case, no such averments is contained

in plaint nor any such notice in writing was given to

BDA.     Therefore, plaint suffers from inherent defect

non-complying with 
Section 64
 of BDA Act.        Hence, I

answer Issue No.3 in the affirmative.






       44.ADDITIONAL        ISSUE       NO.1      DATED

03.03.2022 AND ADDITIONAL ISSUE NO.1 DATED

15.10.2022 :-



       As these issues are inter-related to each other and

involves common appreciation of facts and evidence on

record, findings on one issue are bearing on other issue,

in order to avoid repetition of facts and for convenience

                                 34            O.S.No.26411/2014


sake, both issues are taken together for common

discussion.





     45.   It   is   specific    contention   of   contesting

defendants that, plaintiffs have not properly valued

subject matter of suit and they have not paid proper

court fees. The plaintiffs have valued subject matter of

suit at Rs.6 crores. The plaintiffs have valued their

1/3rd share in suit properties at Rs.2 crores.



     46. The learned counsel for defendants argued

that, suit properties though shown as Survey Numbers,

they are situated within Municipal Limits or City

Corporation and for the purpose of court fees it is the

market value which has to be taken into consideration

even if land continues to be an agricultural land in

revenue records. 
In this regard, learned counsel for

defendants has relied upon decision of Hon'ble High

Court in W.P.No.188/2016 in case of 
V.N. Manjunath

Vs. K.N. Thimmegowda and Others
, wherein it is held

that, in respect of agricultural land which falls within

Municipal Limits or City Corporation and for the

purpose of court fees it is the market value which has to

                              35                 O.S.No.26411/2014


be taken into consideration even if land continues to be

an agricultural land in revenue records.


      47. The plaintiffs having claimed they are in joint

possession of suit properties and further claim they are

entitled for share in suit properties have paid court fees

under 
Section 7(2)
       and 
Section 35(2)
 of Karnataka

Court Fees and Suits Valuation Acts. When, there is no

contra material placed by defendants and same is not

extracted in cross of P.W.1 that, plaintiffs have not

properly valued subject matter of suit, valuation of suit

properties shown by plaintiffs has to be accepted.


Hence,      I   answer   Additional     Issue    No.1    dated

03.03.2022 in the negative and Additional Issue

No.1 dated 15.10.2022 in the negative.



      48.       ADDITIONAL        ISSUE     NO.2        DATED

15.10.2022 :- The contesting defendants in their

written statement have contended, suit is bad for non-

joinder of necessary parties.         While cross-examining

P.W.1 an attempt was made to suggest, daughter of

Smt. Nanjamma by name Smt. Parvathamma not made

as party to suit.

                             36               O.S.No.26411/2014


      49. It is worth to note here that, in suit for

partition all family members are not necessary parties.

If any person who is head of particular branch is made

as party to suit, that is sufficient, he represents all

members of that branch.





      50. Further it is to be noted here, while cross-

examining P.W.1 it is suggested, there is no person by

name Muniraju.      It is well settled proposition of law

that, suit cannot be dismissed for mis-joinder of parties.

Hence,   I    answer   Additional    Issue    No.2     dated

15.10.2022 in the negative.





      51.ADDITIONAL         ISSUE       NO.3         DATED

15.10.2022 :- It is specific contention of defendants

that, suit of the plaintiffs is hopelessly barred by law of

limitation.   It is pertinent to note here that, it is not

mentioned by plaintiffs when father of Smt. Lingamma

by name Munishamappa died. No death certificate of

Munishamappa has been produced before the court. If

entire case of plaintiffs is accepted all properties

belonged to Munishamappa, immediately after death of

Munishamappa, cause of action          accrues    to    Smt.

                               37            O.S.No.26411/2014


Lingamma or plaintiffs to claim share in suit properties.

Herein the case, absolutely there is no material to show,

suit     properties     owned      and    possessed      by

Munishamappa.





       52. It is evident from revenue records itself, since

1969    itself   name   of   Sonnappa,   thereafter   names

Muniyappa,        Chikkapaiah,     Vekaramanappa,       and

Narayanaswamy and names of Smt. Muniyamma and

Smt. Nanjamma have been continued in revenue

records pertaining to suit properties. Suit filed in the

year 2014.





       53. Even assuming for movement, plaintiffs or late

Smt. Lingamma have got any right or interest over suit

properties, they would have challenged those revenue

records within reasonable time.          As such, suit is

hopelessly barred by law of limitation. Hence I answer

Additional Issue No.3 dated 15.10.2022 in the

affirmative.





       54. ISSUES NO.4 TO 6 :- As these issues are

inter-related to each other and involves common

appreciation of facts and evidence on record, findings on

                              38                 O.S.No.26411/2014


one issue are bearing on other issue, in order to avoid

repetition of facts and for convenience sake, both issues

are taken together for common discussion.



      55. As already discussed, plaintiffs have failed to

establish   their   relationship    with   defendants      and

relationship of late Smt. Lingamma with that of Smt.

Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma as claimed in plaint.

Further more, plaintiffs have failed to establish suit

schedule    properties   were      originally   acquired    by

Munishamappa, who is father of late Smt. Lingamma.

The plaintiffs have failed to establish, they being joint

owners of suit properties, they are in joint possession

and enjoyment of suit properties along with defendants

No.1 to 9, 11 and 12. Further more, suit 'A' schedule

properties already acquired by BDA for formation of

Arkavathi Layout. When, plaintiffs are not entitled for

any share in suit properties, question of mesne profits

as prayed by plaintiffs does not arise.



      56. Further it is to be noted here, the plaintiffs

themselves have pleaded, defendants have sold portion

of schedule properties in the forms of sites to 3 rd parties.

                            39              O.S.No.26411/2014


The   defendants   have   specifically   contended,   Smt.

Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma have entered into

partition in respect of Sy.No.43/2 of Dasarhalli Village,

In this regard, there is no effective cross examination of

D.W.1.





 
57. The D.W.1 has specifically stated, in the year

1950 Smt. Muniyamma and Smt. Nanjamma have

effected partition. The learned counsel for defendants

has rightly relied upon decision reported in (2016) 12

SCC 288 in case of 
Muddasani Venkata Narasiah

(dead) by LRs Vs. Muddasani Sarojana
, wherein it is

held that, cross-examination is a matter of substance

not of procedure one is required to put one's own

version in cross-examination of opponent. The effect of

non cross-examination is that, statement of witnesses

has not been disputed.






      58. It is to be noted here, though plaintiffs have

pleaded, defendants have sold portion of suit properties

in the form of sites but they have not sought for any

declaration with regard those sale deeds. On this count

also, suit of plaintiffs is not maintainable. In this

                                       40                   O.S.No.26411/2014


regard, learned counsel for defendants has relied upon

decision      of      Hon'ble              High     Court      in      MFA

NO.100407/2021            in     case         of    Sri     Omkar      S/o.

Sambhaji Yadav             and Others S. Sambhaji S/o.

Madhu Yadav, wherein it is held that, it is settled

proposition       that,   even        if    plaintiffs     contents   that,

registered sale deed executed by defendant No.1 in

favour of defendant No.2 not for family necessity and

they are bound to ignore said sale deed, they have to

seek a declaration to that effect. Off course, plaintiffs

are not signatories to sale deed in question are not

required to seek a decree for setting aside sale deed.

But, seeking declaration in respect of sale deed is very

much necessary. Admittedly, there is no prayer by

plaintiffs   in     respect      of        sale    deeds    executed    by

defendants of sites in suit properties. Suit filed by

plaintiffs is devoid of merits and liable to be dismissed.

Hence, I answer issues No.4 to 6 in the negative.



      59. ISSUES No.7             :-        In view of the above said

findings on Issue Nos. 1 to 6 and additional issues, I

proceed to pass the following:-

                                 41               O.S.No.26411/2014


                           ORDER

             The suit of the plaintiffs is hereby

      dismissed with costs.



             Draw decree accordingly.

computerized by her, corrected and signed by me and then pronounced
in the open Court on this the 2nd day of December, 2025).
