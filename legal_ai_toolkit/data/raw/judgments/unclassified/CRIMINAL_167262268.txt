                          accused committed rape upon the prosecutrix and fled away therefrom after
                          giving threat in case she reported the matter. On the basis of such Dehati Nalisi,
                          FIR was reduced in writing at Police Station Madhusudangarh at Crime
                          No.48/2017 under 
Sections 376
, 
506
 IPC and under 
Sections 3(2)(va)
 and 
3(1)
                          (w)(ii)
 of SC/ST Act and the investigation was set in motion. Upon completion
                          of investigation including recording of statements, collection of evidence and
                          necessary formalities, challan was filed. The Special Court on appreciation of
                          evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the present appellant as
                          referred above.

                                 Learned counsel for the appellant while taking exception to the impugned

                          judgment of conviction and order of sentence submits that the present appellant
                          has falsely been implicated. The judgment of conviction and order of sentence
                          is based on surmises and conjectures. There are contradictions and omissions
                          in the statements of prosecution witnesses. Learned counsel submits that
                          medical evidence does not support the story of prosecution as no definite
                          opinion could be given by the doctor. He further submits that DNA report is
                          negative. It is further submitted that the appeal being of 2024 is not likely to be
                          decided in the near future. On these grounds, learned counsel submits that the
                          present appellant may be extended the benefit of suspension of sentence and
                          grant of bail.

                                 Per contra, learned Additional Advocate General, appearing on behalf of
                          the respondent/State, while supporting the judgment impugned submits that no
                          exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of
                          bail, regard being had to the nature and the gravity of offence found proved
                          against the present appellant.

                          case, regard being had to the fact that appeal which is of the year 2024 is not
                          likely to be decided in the near future, in the obtaining facts and circumstances

                          the factum of depositing the fine amount and on his furnishing a personal bond
                          in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs only) with one solvent surety
                          in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

                                  Appellant- Govind is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court

                          behalf.

                                  Accordingly, the said IA stands allowed and disposed of.
                                  Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the
                          instant I.A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.
