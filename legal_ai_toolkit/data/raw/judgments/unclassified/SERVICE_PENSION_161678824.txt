                        1.1       The relief sought for by the writ petitioners in the present writ

              petitions in W.P.(MD).Nos.20568 and 20856 of 2015 is to quash the impugned

              Settlement dated 13.04.2015 and to direct the respondents to grant revised

              pension.





                        2.        Originally, the first respondent namely Retired and Pensioners

              Welfare Association of the TNSTC filed a writ petition to quash the G.O.(Ms).No.

              63 dated 07.04.2012 to the extent denying the revision of pension @ 9% from

              2005, @ 12% from 2007 and 15% from 2011 over and above already given.

              Labour Court by raising dispute and accordingly, the writ petition was dismissed

              after observing that the writ petitioners are at liberty to approach the Labour

              Court for the course of redressal of their grievances.




                        4.        The Retired Employees Welfare Association/ 3rd parties have

              challenged the order passed in writ petitions and also filed a separate writ

              petitions stating that, there is no alternative remedy available to the appellants

              herein, since they are no longer workmen under the Corporation and they are

              already retired and the association itself comprises only of retired persons, hence

              they could not initiate any proceedings before the Labour Court, including issue

              raised herein, i.e., enhanced pension payable by the Corporation to the retired

              employees.





              Submissions made on behalf of the writ petitioners:



                        5.        Third party appellants and writ petitioner (petitioners hereinafter)

              submitted that, as per the clause 11(3) and 11(6) of the settlement entered

              the amount already given. Originally, the prayer was made seeking revision of

              pension as per the above 12(3) settlement. There is yet another settlement entered

              between the trade unions recorded under 
Section 12(3)
 of ID Act dated

              13.04.2015 (2015 settlement hereinafter), wherein the parties have agreed to

              revise the pension only @ 15%. Hence separate writ petitions have been filed by

              some more pensioners, challenging the provision of fixing the revision of pension

              @ 15%. It is alleged that, from the year 2010 onwards, the revision of pension

              will be based on DA merged with the basic pay, hence it comes up to around 49%

              of the revision. However, the Pension Trust has granted only 15% revision over

              and above already given, which is against the 2011 settlement.




                        6.        The petitioners further allege that, one set of retired employees of

              Transport Corporations i.e., Managerial Staffs are entitled for 40% of pension

              revision, but the pension revised only @ 15% that to only to the workmen

              employees retired prior to 01.09.2010 with monetary benefits from 01.04.2015

              and this is violation of 
Article 14
 and 
16
 of Constitution of India and these reliefs

              are sought based on the admitted facts, which does not require adducing any

              evidence, hence the writ petitions are maintainable.

              Submissions made on behalf of the Pension Trust and State Government:


                        7.        The respondents/ Government and Pension Trust Board submitted

              that there is no provisions in the pension rules for enabling the pensioners for

              seeking revision of pension. The Pension Trust is already facing financial crisis,

              hence further increase of pension would adversely affect the interest of the

              pensioners, who are already receiving the pension. As per 2011 settlement, it was

              proposed to revise the pension and referred the matter to Pension Trust.

              Accordingly, the Pension Trust discussed the subject and decided to revise the

              pension @ 15%. In subsequent settlement dated 13.04.2015, i.e., 2015 settlement

              also, the decision taken by the Pension Trust board to grant 15% revision of

              pension was accepted by the Associations and Trade Unions, hence the appellants

              are not entitled to claim more than what was agreed in the 12(3) settlement dated

              13.04.2015. They further stated that points based Variable Dearness Allowance in

              the pension as on 13.09.2007 is already merged with the Basic Pay and pension

              was paid with effect from 01.10.2007 and it has been continuously increased from

              01.10.2007, hence there is no discrimination as alleged by the petitioners herein.

              They further submitted that comparison made with the managerial retired

              employees is misconceived since they form different class and they have paid

              revised pension based on their contribution and also based on revision made on

              par with Government employees.





              Reply of the Petitioners:



                        8.        In reply to the submissions made on the side of the Pension Trust

              Board and the Government, petitioners submitted that, at the time of constituting

              Pension Trust fund, it was clarified by the Government of Tamil Nadu that the

              pension benefits will be increased as and when there is increase in the State

              Government employees. Similarly, it was intimated that there will be a provision

              for the proposed scheme for periodic increase of the pension scheme, hence the

              Government or Pension Trust cannot contend that there is no provision for

              revision of pension. They further submitted that whenever the pay of the State

              Government employees were revised on the basis of the Pay Commission

              recommendations, the same is made applicable to the various other employees of

              the statutory bodies including the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, even in the

              absence of any provisions in the Pension rules. As per G.O.(Ms).No.65 dated

              21.05.2009, the Pension Trust started revising the pension by merging the

              variable DA with effect from 01.10.2010 and the said revision shall be followed

              for continuous revision of pay.                Similarly, the Pension Trust had passed a

              resolution dated 14.02.2011 to give pension revision to the retired staff as per the

              12(3) settlement @ 15% to the basic pensions drawn on 01.09.2010, accordingly

              they had approached from the Government for grant approval for the same.



              Having accepted and taken steps to get the approval from the Government, the

              Trust could not revisit it again and modify the rate. The petitioners also rely on

              the revision of pension made to the managerial staff pensioners, and to contend

              that the Government is estopped from contending that, there is no provision in the

              pension rules for revision of pension.





              Discussions and Conclusions:



                        9.        We have considered the submissions made on both sides and perused

              the materials available on record:



                        10.       Pursuant to the settlement entered between the Trade Unions and the

              Management of Transport Corporations under 
Section 12(3)

              Disputes Act, separate Pension Fund namely Tamil Nadu State Transport

              Corporation Pension Fund was constituted and consequently, Tamil Nadu State

              Transport Corporation Employees fund rules (Rules hereinafter) were framed and

              came into operation from 01.09.1998.

                        by the Board of Trustees prescribed under Rule 3(a) and its functions

                        declares that the determination of eligible service, pensionable salary
                        and other connected issues are subject to interpretation of the rules
                        by the Government. Rule 20(A) deals with providing eligible

                        12.       The writ petitioners herein claim that they are workmen category

              pensioners and they are entitled for revision of pension as per the wage settlement

              under

              proposal shall be placed before the Pension Trust Board and approval shall be

              obtained form the Pension Trust Board. This clause was considered by the Trust

              Board and it had made a decision to award 15% of increase in the pension

              payable to the retired employees and referred the matter to the Government for

              approval.           Accordingly, the Government had considered and passed a

              Government Order in G.O.(Ms).No.53 dated 07.04.2015 by increasing the

              pension by 15% with effect from 01.04.2015.





                        13.       It is also admitted fact that in the year 2009 itself, the Dearness

              Allowance of workmen pensioners. which was paid by following Variable

              Dearness Allowance, was merged with basic pay, vide G.O.(Ms.) No.65 dated

              21.05.2009 and thereby is was further ordered that, further increase of Dearness

              Allowance will be paid by way of percentage method revision. It is also admitted

              that this merger of Dearness Allowance was not granted to the managerial retired

              staff. Further, the managerial staff were awarded revision of pay and pension

              after the Government has taken policy decision to implement the 6th Pay

              Commission recommendations, which was constituted for fixing the wage and

              revision of pension for the Government employees of Tamil Nadu. Accordingly,

              a separate pension revision of 40% with effect from 01.01.2006 was paid to the

              managerial staff and this expenditure was met out by Tamil Nadu State Transport

              Corporation Employees Pension Fund Trust without any financial assistance from

              the Government.





                        14.       Subsequent to the proposed revision of pension based on the 2011

              settlement, there are further wage settlements entered in the years 2015 and 2018.

              By subsequent settlement dated 13.04.2015, it was agreed that the workmen who

              retired prior to 01.09.2010 are entitled to 15% of the enhanced pension from

              01.04.2015, thereby, the G.O.(Ms.) No.53 dated 07.04.2015 passed by the

              Government was accepted by the parties to the settlement. Though the retired

              workmen have demanded revision of pension based on the 2011 settlement, in the

              subsequent settlement, they have accepted enhancement of 15% in the revision of

              pension from 01.04.2015.





                        15.       As contended in the earlier paragraph, what was agreed in the 2011

              settlement is only a proposal to revision the pension, i.e., with increase @ 9%

              from the year 2005, increase @ 12% from the year 2007 and the revision under

              settlement dated 22.01.2011 with effect from 01.09.2010, was not concluded and

              it was subject to the decision taken by the Pension Trust. Subsequently, the

              decision was taken by the Pension Trust and concluded with issuance of G.O.

              (Ms.) No.53 dated 07.04.2015 and in the next settlement i.e., the settlement

              entered in the year 2015, the Trade Unions have accepted the same.




                        16.       In view of the above facts, we are of the view that the petitioners

              herein could not rely on the settlement entered in the year 2011 for the purpose of

              revision of pension. However, separate writ petitions were filed before this

              Court, challenging the 2015 settlement, contending that the subsequent settlement

              entered in the year 2015 and in clause 37 are violative of 
Article 14
 and 
16
 of

              Constitution of India, since it is discriminatory, as against the workmen

              pensioners.





                        17.       According to the writ petitioners, the pensioners of the managerial

              staff of the Transport Corporation have been granted 40% of enhancement in their

              pension as per the 6th Pay Commission recommendations, whereas the writ

              petitioners, who belongs to workmen category of the very same Transport

              Corporation are granted only with 15% enhancement in pension with effect from

              01.04.2015.

18.       Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that, admittedly both

              categories are receiving pension only from the very same Pension Fund, hence

              both managerial staff and workmen groups forms one of the Homogeneous group

              and there cannot be any classification among them. Whereas the Government has

              decided to increase the pension to the extent of 40% only to one set of group,

              who were the retired staff of the Management. The Government ought to have

              granted the very same percentage of the revision to workmen category also. The

              writ petitioners herein have relied on the judgments of the Apex Court in 
D.S.

              Nakara and Others vs. Union of India
 [(1983) 1 SCC 305], Kallakurichi Taluk

              Retired Officials Association, Tamil nadu and 
Others vs. State of Tamil Nadu

              Manipur and others
 [(2020) 14 SCC 625].






                        19.       The learned counsels for the petitioners further submitted that the

              classification between the two groups made herein was not based on any rational

              principle, however if any rational principle followed, further it has not been done

              to achieve the objects. In this case, the object to be achieved is to revise the

              pension due to the escalation cost of living and to meet the financial needs of

              pensioners. It is further submitted by the learned counsels that the division made

              herein is arbitrary, it runs counter to the whole gamut of the pension scheme,

              more particularly the revision of pension, hence prays to set aside the G.O.(Ms.)

              No.53 dated 07.04.2015 and also the clause 37 of the wage settlement dated

              13.04.2015.





                        20.       Learned counsel for the Government and Pension Trust submitted

              that the arguments made by the petitioners that, both managerial retired staff and

              the retired workmen categories form one class is misconceived and admittedly,

              the managerial staff are receiving pay on par with the State Government

              employees and their pay is fixed based on the recommendations of the Pay

              Commission constituted by the State Government and not covered under any

              wage settlement. Similarly, there is no provisions under the pension rules to

              make revision of pension and it is a policy decision of the Government to extend

              the benefit of pay revision to the workmen category.





                        21.       It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the State Government

              that when ever there was a wage settlement to the workers reached, consequently,

              the pension benefits are also regulated, accordingly.                        Though there was no

              separate revision of pension for the pensioners, under 
Section 12(3)
 settlement, at

              the time of exit from their service, the Dearness Allowance would be paid as

              Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA hereinafter) covered under 
Section 12(3)


              settlement. Further in respect of managerial staff, rate of Dearness Allowances is

              being paid on par with Government employees. Similarly, the managerial staff

              constitute only 1% of cadre strength and remaining 99% are the workmen

              category. Since this managerial staff constitute separate category and class, they

              cannot be equated with the workmen category. The managerial staff were carrying

              higher responsibilities, while they were in service and accordingly, they were also

              made higher contribution for pension than the workmen categories.




                        22.       The learned counsel for the State further submitted that taking note

              of the fact that there was no revision of pension to the workmen category, by

              issuing G.O.(Ms.) No.65 dated 21.05.2009, the Government has taken the policy

              decision to merge the V.D.A with the pension received by the employees and

              accordingly, it was made as basic pension. Further, it was decided to pay the

              Dearness Allowance based on the percentage method with effect from

              01.10.2007, which resulted in revision of pension to the workmen category. He

              further submitted, since classification made herein is reasonable classification and

              workmen category cannot be equated with the managerial staff category,

              managerial staff are being paid pension and entitled to Dearness Allowance on

              par with the State Government servants. Whenever the Government revises the

              same, it is made applicable to the managerial staff category, hence submitted that

              the contention of the petitioner that there is a discrimination is not proper.




                        23.       The learned counsel of State further submitted that the petitioners at

              the time of filing the writ petitions, they relied on the 2011 settlement for seeking

              revision, now the very same petitioners have come with a claim that the

              subsequent settlement, which accepts the Government proposal to revise the

              pension in terms of G.O.(Ms.) No.53 and challenging the 2015 settlement only

              shows that the petitioners are approbate and reprobate and they are not entitled to

              challenge the clause 37 of the 2015 settlement.                               It is also brought to the

              knowledge of this Court that, another settlement in the year 2018 is also rendered

              and the Trade Unions till now had not challenged the revision of pension ordered

              by Government.





                        24.        The learned counsel for State further submitted that since

              managerial staff are constituted to 1% of the Pension Trust and already the

              Pension Trust is facing high financial difficulties and already requested the

              Government to rescue the Trust Fund by making contribution. To buttress his

              arguments, the learned counsel also relied on the letter dated 05.08.2018 sent by

              the Pension Trust to the Government regarding the financial position of the

              Pension Trust as on 31.03.2013.                    Further, another letter dated 11.09.2018

              addressed to the Government was relied on to state that there are subsequent

              settlement and 7th Pay Commission implementations are pending. It is also stated

              in the 2013 wage statement, the Government has come forward to compensate the

              short fall of the Trust Fund and only Rs.33 lakhs is available with the Trust Fund

              at that point of time. Hence the Pension Trust and Government had considered

              the financial constraints while revising the pension to the workmen category,

              therefore prays to dismiss these writ appeals and writ petitions.




 
25.       The Constitution Bench of Apex Court in 
D.S. Nakara vs. Union of

              India
 [1983 1 SCC 305] cited supra has elaborately reiterated the principle to be

              followed while revision of pension and observed in paragraph Nos.31, 42 and 65

              as follows:






                            “31.      From the discussion three things emerge : (i) that
                      pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the
                      sweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to
                      1972 rules which are statutory in character because they are enacted
                      in exercise of powers conferred by the proviso to 
Art.309

                      (5) of 
Art.148
 of the Constitution ; (ii) that the pension is not an ex-
                      gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service rendered ; and

                      (iii) it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice to
                      those who in the hey-day of their life ceaselessly toiled for the
                      employer on an assurance that in their old age they would not be left
                      in lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum of pension is a
                      certain percentage correlated to the average emoluments drawn
                      during last three years of service reduced to ten months under
                      liberalised pension scheme. Its payment is dependent upon an
                      additional condition of impeccable behaviour even subsequent to
                      requirement, that is, since the cessation of the contract of service and
                      that it can be reduced or withdrawn as a disciplinary measure.

                      ....

                             42. If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the
                      pensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its
                      upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by
                      arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of
                      revision, and would such classification be founded on some rational
                      principle ? The classification has to be based, as is well settled, on
                      some rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to
                      the objects sought to be achieved. We have set out the objects
                      underlying the payment of pension. If the State considered it necessary
                      to liberalise the pension scheme, we find no rational principle behind
                      it for granting these benefits only to those who retired subsequent to
                      that date simultaneously denying the same to those who retired prior
                      to that date. If the liberalisation was considered necessary for
                      augmenting social security in old age to government servants then
                      those who retired earlier cannot be worst off than those who retire
                      later. Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into two
                      classes is not based on any rational principle and if the rational
                      principle is the one of dividing pensioners with a view to giving
                      something more to persons otherwise equally placed, it would be
                      discriminatory. To illustrate, take two persons, one retired just a day
                      prior and another a day just succeeding the specified date. Both were
                      in the same pay bracket, the average emolument was the same and
                      both had put in equal number of years of service. How does a
                      fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day earlier or a day later will
                      permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension ? One

                      a. and average emolument to be worked out on 36 months' salary
                      while the other will have a ceiling of Rs. 12,000 p.a. and average
                      emolument will be computed on the basis of last ten months average.
                      The artificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any principle
                      and whatever principle, if there be any, has absolutely no nexus to the
                      objects sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme. In
                      fact this arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the liberalised
                      pension scheme but it is counter productive and runs counter to the
                      whole gamut of pension scheme. The equal treatment guaranteed in
                      
Art.14
 is wholly violated inasmuch as the pension rules being
                      statutory in character, since the specified date, the rules accord
                      differential and discriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of
                      commutation of pension. A 48 hours difference in matter of retirement
                      would have a traumatic effect. Division is thus both arbitrary and
                      unprincipled. Therefore the classification does not stand the test of
                      
Art.14.

                      horizons of socio-economic justice, the socialist Republic and welfare
                      State which we endeavour to set up and largely influenced by the fact
                      that the old men who retired when emoluments were comparatively
                      low and are exposed to vagaries of continuously rising prices, the
                      falling value of the rupee consequent upon inflationary inputs, we are
                      satisfied that by introducing an arbitrary eligibility criteria: 'being in
                      service and retiring subsequent to the specified date' for being eligible
                      for the liberalised pension scheme and thereby dividing a
                      homogeneous class, the classification being not based on any
                      discernible rational principle and having been found wholly unrelated
                      to the objects sought to be achieved by grant of liberalised pension
                      and the eligibility criteria devised being thoroughly arbitrary, we are
                      of the view that the eligibility for liberalised pension scheme of being
                      in service on the specified date and retiring subsequent to that date' in
                      impugned memoranda....”

26.       With regard to maintainability of the writ petitions filed by the

              retired employees for revision of pension, the Apex Court in 
D.S. Nakara
 case

              cited supra has held in paragraph No.64 hereunder, hence it is argued that the

              same is applicable to the writ petitioners herein.




 
“64. Locus standi of 3rd petitioner was questioned. Petitioner
                      3 is a Society registered under the 
Societies Registration Act
 of 1860.
                      It is a non-political non-profit and voluntary organisation. Its
                      members consist of public-spirited citizens who have taken up the
                      cause of ventilating legitimate public problems. This Society received
                      a large number of representations from old pensioners, individually a
                      large number of representations from old pensioners, individually
                      unable to undertake the journey through labyrinths of legal judicial
                      process, costly and protracted, and, therefore, approached petitioner 3
                      which espoused their cause. Objects for which the 3 rd petitioner-
                      Society was formed were not questioned. The majority decision of this
                      Court in 
S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India
 rules that any member of the
                      public having sufficient interest can maintain an action for judicial
                      redress for public injury arising from breach of public duty or from
                      violation of some provision of the Constitution or the law and seek
                      enforcement of such public duty and observance of such constitutional
                      or legal provision. Third petitioner seeks to enforce rights that may be
                      available to a large number of old infirm retirees. Therefore, its locus
                      standi is unquestionable. But it is a point of academic importance
                      because locus standi of petitioners 1 and 2 was never questioned.”


 
27.       The Apex Court in 
The All Manipur Pensioners Association vs The

              State Of Manipur
 [(2020) 14 SCC 625] cited supra has once again reiterated the

              principle 
laid down in
 
D.S. Nakara
 case and held in paragraph Nos. 7.4 to 8.2 as

              follows:

                               “7.4 While the aforesaid decision of this Court in the case of
                        
D.S. Nakara
 (supra) was relied upon by the appellant herein and as
                        such which came to be considered and followed by the learned
                        Single Judge, the Division Bench considering some of the
                        observations made in the cases of 
Hari Ram Gupta
 (supra);
                        R.Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath Goyal (supra) and 
P.N.
                        Menon
 (supra), has observed and held that the decision of this Court
                        in the case of 
D.S. Nakara
 (supra) is one of the limited application
                        and there is no scope for enlarging the ambit of that decision to
                        cover all schemes made by the retirees or a demand for an identical
                        amount of pension irrespective of the date of retirement.However, by
                        not following the decision of this Court in the case of 
D.S.
                        Nakara
 (supra), considering some of the observations made by this
                        Court in the aforesaid decisions, namely 
P.N. Menon
 (supra) and
                        other decisions, the Division Bench of the High Court has not at all
                        considered the distinguishable facts in the aforesaid decisions.




 
7.5 In the case of 
P.N.Menon
 (supra), the controversy was
                        altogether different one.
 
The factual position that needs to be
                        highlighted insofar as 
P.N.Menon
 (supra) is concerned, is that the
                        retired employees had never been in receipt of “dearness pay” when
                        they retired from service and therefore the O.M. in question could
                        not have been applied to them. This is how this Court examined the
                        matter. This Court also noticed that prior to the O.M. in question,
                        the pension scheme was contributory and only with effect from
                        22.9.1977, the pension scheme was made non-contributory. Since the
                        respondent employees in the first cited case were not in service at
                        the time of introducing the same they were held not eligible for the
                        said benefit.
 
Therefore 
the said decision
 shall not be applicable to
                        the facts of the case on hand, more particularly while considering
                        and/or applying the decision of this Court in the case of 
D.S. Nakara

                        (supra).




                              7.6 In the case of Amrit Lal Gandhi (supra), pension was
                        introduced for the first time for the University teachers based on the
                        resolution passed by the Senate and Syndicate of Jodhpur
                        University. The same was approved by the State Government with

                        effect from 1.1.1990. Therefore, the controversy was not between one
                        set of pensioners alleging discriminatory treatment as against
                        another set of pensioners. There were no pensioners to begin with.
                        The retirees were entitled to provident fund under the existing
                        provident fund scheme. The question of discrimination between one
                        set of pensioners from another set of pensioners did not arise in the
                        said decision. With the aforesaid facts, this Court observed that
                        financial viability is a relevant issue.





                               7.7 Similarly, the decision of this Court in the case of
                        Indian Ex-Services League (supra) also shall not be applicable to
                        the facts of the case on hand. 
The facts in this case and the facts in
                        the case of 
D.S. Nakara
 (supra) are clearly distinguishable.
 
In the
                        case of Indian Ex-Services League (supra), the dispute was with
                        respect to PF retirees and Pension retirees and to that it was held
                        that PF retirees and Pension retirees constitute different classes and
                        therefore this Court distinguished the decision of this Court in the
                        case of 
D.S. Nakara
 (supra). Therefore, the aforesaid decision shall
                        not be applicable to the facts of the case on hand at all.


 
7.8 Similarly, the decisions of this Court in the cases of
                        
Hari Ram Gupta
 (supra) and 
Kallakkurichi Taluk Retired Officials
                        Association, Tamil Nadu
 (supra) also shall not be applicable to the
                        facts of the case on hand.






 
7.9 In view of the above, we are satisfied that none of the
                        judgments, relied upon by the learned Senior Advocate for the
                        respondent – State, has any bearing to the controversy in hand. The
                        Division Bench of the High Court has clearly erred in not
                        appreciating and/or considering the distinguishable facts in the
                        cases of 
Hari Ram Gupta
 (supra); R.Veerasamy (supra); Amar Nath
                        Goyal (supra); 
P.N.Menon
 (supra) and Amrit Lal Gandhi (supra).


                              8.     Even otherwise on merits also, we are of the firm
                        opinion that there is no valid justification to create two classes, viz.,

                        one who retired pre-1996 and another who retired post-1996, for the
                        purpose of grant of revised pension, In our view, such a
                        classification has no nexus with the object and purpose of grant of
                        benefit of revised pension. All the pensioners form a one class who
                        are entitled to pension as per the pension rules. 
Article 14
 of the
                        Constitution of India ensures to all equality before law and equal
                        protection of laws. At this juncture it is also necessary to examine
                        the concept of valid classification. A valid classification is truly a
                        valid discrimination. It is true that 
Article 16
 of the Constitution of
                        India permits a valid classification. However, a very classification
                        must be based on a just objective. The result to be achieved by the
                        just objective presupposes the choice of some for differential
                        consideration/treatment over others. A classification to be valid must
                        necessarily satisfy two tests. Firstly, the distinguishing rationale has
                        to be based on a just objective and secondly, the choice of
                        differentiating one set of persons from another, must have a
                        reasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved. The test for
                        a valid classification may be summarised as a distinction based on a
                        classification founded on an intelligible differentia, which has a
                        rational relationship with the object sought to be achieved.
                        Therefore, whenever a cut-off date (as in the present controversy) is
                        fixed to categorise one set of pensioners for favourable
                        consideration over others, the twin test for valid classification or
                        valid discrimination therefore must necessarily be satisfied.



                               8.1 In the present case, the classification in question has no
                        reasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved while
                        revising the pension. As observed hereinabove, the object and
                        purpose for revising the pension is due to the increase in the cost of
                        living. All the pensioners form a single class and therefore such a
                        classification for the purpose of grant of revised pension is
                        unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of 
Article 14
 of
                        the Constitution of India. The State cannot arbitrarily pick and
                        choose from amongst similarly situated persons, a cut-off date for
                        extension of benefits especially pensionary benefits. There has to be
                        a classification founded on some rational principle when similarly
                        situated class is differentiated for grant of any benefit.

                               8.2 As observed hereinabove, and even it is not in dispute
                        that as such a decision has been taken by the State Government to
                        revise the pension keeping in mind the increase in the cost of living.
                        Increase in the cost of living would affect all the pensioners
                        irrespective of whether they have retired pre-1996 or post-1996. As
                        observed hereinabove, all the pensioners belong to one class.
                        Therefore, by such a classification/cut-off date the equals are treated
                        as unequals and therefore such a classification which has no nexus
                        with the object and purpose of revision of pension is unreasonable,
                        discriminatory and arbitrary and therefore the said classification
                        was rightly set aside by the learned Single Judge of the High Court.
                        At this stage, it is required to be observed that whenever a new
                        benefit is granted and/or new scheme is introduced, it might be
                        possible for the State to provide a cut-off date taking into
                        consideration its financial resources. But the same shall not be
                        applicable with respect to one and single class of persons, the
                        benefit to be given to the one class of persons, who are already
                        otherwise getting the benefits and the question is with respect to
                        revision.”

              Association, Tamilnadu and Ors. vs. State of Tamilnadu and Ors. [(2013) 2

              SCC 772] cited supra has held in paragraph Nos.33, 34 and 35 as follows:



 
“33. At this juncture it is also necessary to examine the
                        concept of valid classification. A valid classification is truly a valid
                        discrimination.

 : (1976) 2 SCC 310. A valid classification is
                        based on a justobjective. The result to be achieved by the just
                        objective presupposes, the choice of some for differential
                        consideration/treatment, over others. A classification to be valid
                        must necessarily satisfy two tests. Firstly, the distinguishing

                        rationale has to be based on a just objective. and secondly, the
                        choice of differentiating one set of persons from another, must have a
                        reasonable nexus to the objective sought to be achieved.
                        Legalistically, the test for a valid classification may be summarized
                        as, adistinction based on a classification founded on an intelligible
                        differentia, which has a rational relationship with the object sought
                        to be achieved. Whenever a cut off date(as in the present
                        controversy) is fixed to categorise one set of pensioners for
                        favourable consideration over others, the twin test for valid
                        classification (or valid discrimination) must necessarily be satisfied.




                               34. In the context of the instant appeals, it is necessary to
                        understand the overall objective of treating "dearness
                        allowance" (or a part of it) as "dearness pay". There can be no
                        doubt, that 'dearness allowance' is extended to employees to balance
                        the effects of ongoing inflation, so as to ensure that inflation does
                        not interfere with the enjoyment of life, to which an employee is
                        accustomed. Likewise, the objective of 'dearness pay' is to balance
                        the effects of ongoing inflation, so that a pensioner can adequately
                        sustain the means of livelihood to which he is accustomed. Having
                        understood the reason why the Government extends the benefit of
                        'dearness allowance' and 'dearness pay', to its employees and
                        pensioners respectively, we would venture to search for answers to
                        the twin tests which must be satisfied, for making a valid
                        classification (or a valid discrimination),in the present fact
                        situation.



                               35. In the present context, it needs to be kept in mind, that
                        'dearness allowance' ispaid to Government employees keeping in
                        mind the All India Consumer Price Index. Inflation in the market
                        place is sought to be balanced by paying 'dearness allowance' to
                        Government employees. When a State Government chooses to treat
                        'dearness allowance' as 'dearness pay', the objective remains the
                        same i.e., inflation in the market place is sought to be balanced for
                        retired employees by giving them the benefit of 'dearness pay'. Since
                        the component of inflation similarly affects all employees, and all
                        pensioners (irrespective of the date of their entry into service or

                        retirement), it is not per se possible to accept different levels of
                        'dearness pay' to remedy the malady of inflation. Just like the date of
                        entry into service (for serving employees) would be wholly irrelevant
                        to determine the 'dearness allowance' to be extended to serving
                        employees, because the same has no relevance to the object sought
                        to be achieved. Likewise, the date of retirement (for pensioners)
                        would be wholly irrelevant to determine the 'dearness pay' to be
                        extended to retired employees. Truthfully, it may be difficult to
                        imagine a valid basis of classification for remedying the malaise of
                        inflation. In the absence of any objective, projected in this case, the
                        question of examining the reasonableness to the object sought to be
                        achieved, simply does not arise. Our straying into this expressed
                        realm of imagination, was occasioned by the fact, that the pleadings
                        filed on behalf of the State Government, do not reveal any reason for
                        the classification, which is subject matter of challenge in the instant
                        appeal.”





                        29.       In the case in hand, on careful perusal of the settlement taken place

              in the year 2011, the clause 11 is not binding settlement and it is only a proposal

              to revise the pension to the pensioners belonging to the workmen category,

              however this proposal was subject to deliberation and approval of the Pension

              Trust Board. Accordingly, the Trust Board discussed and decided to revise the

              pension only to the extent of 15%, that too from the date of 01.04.2015. Though

              in the Apex Court judgments cited supra, it has been held that the pension is

              neither bounty nor a matter of grace depending on the sweet will of the employer,

              the pension is ex gratia of payment. At the same time, as far as revision of

              pension is concerned, the same could not be claimed as a matter of right by the

              petitioners and it is the discretion of the State Government to revise the pension

              unless the rules framed mandates for regular revision. In this case, admittedly

              there is no provisions in the pension rules for seeking revision of pension.




                        30.       Admittedly, the revision of pension as far as the workmen category is

              concerned, it is being made on the basis of 12(3) settlements entered between the

              parties, in which the managerial staff are not entitled to enter into any settlement,

              or avail any benefits. The managerial staff pensioners have to wait for the

              decision of the State Government to constitute the pay commission for the

              purpose of complying the process of revision of pension.




                        31.       The   clarification     Letter       No.172/P2/TNSTCEPFT/2005               dated

              08.11.2005 written by the Trust Board to the Pensioner's Association would

              further clarify this aspect and it states that the wage settlement to the workers of

              the State Transport reached during the month of August 2005 with retrospective

              effect from 01.09.2003 and the pension also regulated accordingly.                           Further

              reference was made to the letter dated 15.12.2005 by the Government, wherein it

              is stated that the instructions have been issued as per the Rule 20(a) of the

              Pension Fund Rules, which reads as follows:

                         1. In respect of pensioners of State Transport Undertakings whose
                            pay scales are covered under 12(3) settlement at the time of exit
                            from service, Dearness Allowance may be paid at the variable

                         2. In respect of pensioners who were drawing State Government

                            service, the Dearness Allowance may be paid at the rates
                            applicable to State Government Pensioners.



                          In pursuance of the above orders D.A. To the pensioners are
                    being regulated as detailed below:

                         2. In respect of the workers governed under the 12(3) settlement
                            V.D.A have been paid.



                         3. To the Technical Supervisory Staff to whom a separate wage
                            revision was ordered under reference 2nd cited w.e.f. 01.01.1999
                            with monitory effect from 01.04.1999. To them revised basic Pay
                            was arrived with merger of the amount equivalent to 120 V.D.A
                            points on their existing Pay. Full D.A was paid in respect of
                            them through 120 V.D.A points were merged without reducing
                            the merged points till 7/2004. However, Government in G.O.(D)

                            same was merged with pay and informed to regulate the

                        32.       Further, the above letter continues and narrates the procedures to be

              followed for regulating the pensions to the workmen category and the

              classification was sought for the following issues:





                          “Now, the Wage settlement was reached to the employees
                    retrospectively from 01.09.2003, by merging the amount equivalent to
                    515 V.D.A points with Basic Pay. As this being the first settlement
                    reached after introduction of the New Pension Scheme to the employees
                    and hence we request the Government to clarify in respect of the
                    following issues:



                         1. On implementation of the wage settlement retrospectively from
                            01.09.2003 to the staff the pay was revised in respect of the
                            employees who exit between 01.09.2003 and 31.08.2005. As a
                            result, the pension proposal has to be revised retrospectively
                            based on the re-fixed basic pay.



                         2. Consequent to the revision of the basic pension, the commutation
                            has to be revised in respect of pensioners i.e., employees exit
                            between 01.09.2003 and 31.08.2005.



                         3. To continue to pay the existing rate of V.D.A to the pensioners
                            whose date of exit falls before 01.09.2003 and for the employees/
                            pensioners whose date of exit falls, on or after 01.09.2003, the
                            V.D.A points to be adopted after the merger on 01.09.2003.



                         4. The minimum pension payable to the family pensioners, will
                            remain on the existing level of Rs.1,275/-.”

                        33.       The above letter of the Pension Trust was clarified by way of Letter

              No.18496/D/2005-6 dated 16.05.2006, which reads as follows:



                            “I am directed to invite attention to the reference cited and to
                     state that the pay revision to the employees of STUs is the outcome of
                     Wage settlement 2005 arrived on Triparty agreement (i.e) Employees
                     Union, Management and Government. Moreover, the arrears of pay
                     has been allowed to serving employees with effect from 01.09.2003.
                     It is, therefore, obligatory to settle the arrears of pension for the
                     retired employees also with effect from 01.09.2003. The mode of
                     payment on the Pay commission arrears adopted in cases of
                     Government employees could not be adopted for State Transport
                     Undertakings pensioners.



                           2. In view of the above, I am to request you to adhere the
                     following:



                     (i). The arrears of pension accruing consequent on the Revision of
                     Pay due to Wage settlement 2005, may be allowed to the pensioners
                     of STUs with effect from 01.09.2003.



                     (ii). The State Transport Undertakings may be instructed that they
                     should not seek for any financial assistance from Government for
                     settlement of arrears of pension in this regard.”




                        34.       After issuing this letter, the Government has decided to merge the

              V.D.A paid to the workmen category with the basic pay in the year 2009 and

              accordingly, it was decided to pay the basic pension based on the merged V.D.A

              from 01.10.2007. These facts reveal that from the year 2000 onwards i.e., after

              constitution of the Pension Fund Trust on 01.09.1998, the Government has

              followed the system of regulating the pensions of the workmen categories,

              whenever there is a wage settlement. Accordingly, the pension payable was

              increased by adding the V.D.A. Similarly, there is no revision of pension as far as

              the pensioners belonging to the managerial staff cadre, based on settlement
 u/s

              12(3)
 of ID Act and their pension was subject to enhancement to the extent on par

              with the enhancement of Dearness Allowance to the Government servants. This

              shows that the Government after constituting the Pension Fund Trust has treated

              the managerial staff pensioners as a separate class.                          Similarly, the workmen

              category were treated differently while paying the pension benefits and both form

              a separate class from the date of constituting pension fund. Further, it is also

              stated that, managerial staff pensioners constitute only 1% of the cadre strength of

              the pensioners and remaining 99% of the pensioners belongs to workmen

              category.





                        35.       Though it is stated that the managerial staff have received revision of

              pension to the extent of 40%, this revision was made in pursuant to the policy

              decision taken by the Government to the extent of revision of pension on par with

              the Government servants that too once in 10 years. Whereas, the workmen

              category pensioners are receiving V.D.A based on the wage settlement reached

              cadre pensioners could not be equated with the object of revision made to the

              workmen category.              Further at no point of time, the petitioners/ workmen

              category has questioned the system of paying different types of Dearness

              Allowances paid to them, i.e., following V.D.A based on cost of living Index, for

              the purpose of regulating the pension.





                        36.       Further, it is not the case of the petitioners, they were not given any

              revision of Dearness Allowance, admittedly the revision of pension is also made

              by merging the Dearness Allowance with the basic pay. Having enjoyed all those

              pension benefits and when the Government decided to revise the pension for the

              retired managerial staff, nearly after eight years from the constitution of the

              pension fund, levelling allegation that there is discrimination of pension to

              workmen category is not valid.





                        37.       It is also submitted by the Government that since the managerial staff

              are constituted only 1% and already there is financial difficulties raised by the

              Pension Trust and they are seeking financial support to meet out the short fall to

              pay various types of funds to the pensioners, is also not disputed. If the Pension

              Trust is burdened with further revision of pension to the 99% of the workmen

              category, it would cause huge financial implication, hence we are of the view that

              the classification and revision made for the managerial staff is neither arbitrary

              nor irrational and the relief prayed by the petitioners herein could not be
