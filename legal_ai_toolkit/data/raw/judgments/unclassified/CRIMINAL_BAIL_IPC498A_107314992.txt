    For the following:­

                          JUDGMENT



     This is a charge sheet submitted by Police Inspector of

Chandralayout PS against the accused 1 and 2 for an

offence Punishable U/Sec. 498A r/w 34 of 
IPC
 and 3 & 4

D.P.Act.





2.   The case of the prosecution in brief is as under:



     The accused No.1 married CW1 on 24­06­2010 in

accordance with customs and received dowry of Rs.20,000/­

as cash and gold ornaments i.e., one gold chain, one gold

ring and one gold bracelet from the parents of CW1 and

subsequently the accused 1 at the instigation of accused 2

treated CW1 with cruelty both physically and mentally and

demanded motorcycle as an additional dowry and thrown

out CW1 from the matrimonial house and thereby the

accused has committed the offence.

                                3                     C.C.No.12786/2019


3.   Accused 1 and 2 were on bail. Substance of accusation

was read over to the accused 1 and 2 for the offence

punishable U/s. 498A r/w 34 of 
IPC
 and 3 & 4 D.P.Act. The

accused 1 and 2 have pleaded not guilty and claimed to be

tried.





4.   In order to substantiate the allegation, prosecution has

examined PW.1 and got marked the documents as Ex.P1 to

P7. Since there are no incriminating evidence against the

accused 1 and 2 as such recording of 313 
Cr.P.C
., is

dispensed.





5.   Heard the arguments.



6.   The point that would arise for my consideration in this

case are as under:



         1. Whether the prosecution has proved beyond
         all reasonable doubt that accused 1 married
         CW1   on    24­06­2010    in   accordance   with
         customs and received dowry of Rs.20,000/­ as
         cash and gold ornaments i.e., one gold chain,
         one gold ring and one gold bracelet from the

                                4                      C.C.No.12786/2019





         parents of CW1 and subsequently the accused
         1 at the instigation of accused 2 treated CW1
         with cruelty both physically and mentally and
         demanded motorcycle as an additional dowry
         and thrown out CW1 from the matrimonial
         house and thereby committed an offence
         punishable u/s 498A r/w 34 of 
IPC
 and 3 & 4
         D.P.Act?

         2. What order?



7.    My findings on the above points are as under:


        Point No.1             :    In the Negative.
        Point No.2             :    As per final order,
                                    for the following:

                          REASONS



8.   Point No.1 and 2:­ In order to avoid the repetition of

facts taken together for discussion. In order to bring home

the guilt of the accused 1 and 2 the prosecution has

examined one witness i.e., PW1 who is the complainant in

her evidence she has deposed that he has not lodged

complaint against the accused 1 and 2 and further stated

                                5                    C.C.No.12786/2019





that he does not know the contents of complaint and

mahazar marked as Ex.P1 and P2.





9.   Except the evidence of PW.1, no other evidence is

available on record to establish the guilt of accused 1 and 2.

It is to be noted that, complainant has turned out hostile to

the case of the prosecution as he has compromised the

matter with the accused 1 and 2. The prayer of Sr. APP for

issuance of summons to other witnesses is rejected as no

purpose will be served in view of evidence of P.W.1.

Accordingly, I answer point no.1 and 2 in the negative.



10. Point No.3:­ In the result, I proceed to pass the

following:



                           ORDER

     Acting under 
Section 248 (1)
 of Cr.P.C., accused 1 and

2 are hereby acquitted of the offences punishable U/sec.



498A r/w 34 of 
IPC
 and 3 & 4 D.P.Act.

                                                6                               C.C.No.12786/2019


        Bail bonds of accused 1 and 2 and their surety bond

stands cancelled.
