                                                                   2

                           pressed vide order dated 05.09.2023 passed in M.Cr.C.No.24925/2023. His
                           second bail application was also dismissed as withdrawn and not pressed vide
                           order dated 01.02.2024, passed in M.Cr.C.No.56793/2023.

                                 3. As per the prosecution story, on 26.02.2023, 25 Onrex Cough Syrup
                           having codeine phosphate was seized from the possession of the present
                           applicant. FIR was registered.

                                 4. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that applicant has not
                           committed any offence. He is innocent. He has been falsely implicated. He is in
                           jail for last more than one year. Therefore, it is prayed that applicant may be
                           released on bail, pending the trial.



                                 5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the State opposed the prayer
                           for grant of bail to the applicant and has submitted that seized quantity is a
                           commercial quantity. Applicant has a criminal background of nine cases and
                           out of these nine cases two cases of same nature under 
NDPS Act
 were
                           registered against him in the year 2022 and this case has been registered in the
                           year 2023. He is a habitual offender and is continuously involved in possessing
                           and selling contraband. Therefore, he has prayed for rejection of this bail
                           application.

                                 6. In this case a commercial quantity of contraband has been seized from
                           the possession of the applicant. Undoubtedly, he is in jail for the last one year,
                           but it cannot be overlooked that he is a habitual offender and except this case
                           two cases under 
NDPS Act
 were registered against him and in the previous year
                           i.e. 2022. 
Section 37
 of the NDPS Act put a bar on the grant of bail where a
                           commercial quantity of contraband has been seized and its provision lays two
                           limitations: (i) that Court is prima-facie of view that accused is not guilty of the
                           offence and; (ii) he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. As

                                                                  3

                           accused is already having criminal background of two cases under 
NDPS Act

                           and after release on bail in those cases, he has been again found involved in
                           same nature of offence and commercial quantity has been seized. Therefore, no
                           opinion can be formed that he will not commit same type of offence while on
                           bail. Hence, I am of the view that no case for grant of bail is made out.

                                     7. Consequently, this third bail application too under 
Section 439
 of the
                           Code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail filed on behalf of applicant -
                           Shitesh Gupta is dismissed.
