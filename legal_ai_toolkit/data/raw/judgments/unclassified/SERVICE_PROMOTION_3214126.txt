PerHon'bleMr.Pankaj Kumar, Member-A

          In this case, several applicants have joined to challenge the

seniority list brought out by the official respondents, with impleadment

of several private respondents, and sought the following reliefs:



   (i)    This Hon'ble Tribunal may kindly be pleased to quash the impugned
          seniority list dated 03.08.2021, so far it relates to applicants as well as
          private respondents vis-à-vis the alleged principle said to have been
          adopted by the respondent No. 3 in letter dated 03.08.2021, contained
          as annexure No. A-1 to O.A.


   (ii)   To direct the respondent No. 3 to recast the seniority list dated 03
          08.2021 from serial No. 590 to 657 by placing applicants between 589
          and 590.



                                                                                           Page 3 of 6


 
CAT, Lucknow DY. 2212 of 2023 in M.P. No. 332/001786of 
2023Mohammad Aslam and others Vs. U.O.I &Ors
.


      (iii) To quash the draft SOP dated 02.12.2021 and direct the respondent No.
            3   toseek clarification/guidance/instructions from respondent 2 for
            formulating draft SOP for determination of All India seniority list of UDCs,
            contained as Annexure No. A2 to O.A.

                                                   OR

          To direct the respondent No. 3 that the word" same financial year of
          para 9.4 of the draft SOP dated 02 Dec, 2021 be quashed/omitted at the
          time of finalization of SOP for determination of All India seniority list of
          UDCs.



                                                   OR

          To direct the respondent no. 3 that weight age point system for all
          completed years of service on the post of LDC be introduced at the time of
          finalization of SOP for determination of All India Seniority list of UDCs.


                                                   OR

          To direct the respondent No. 3 to hold the DPC for the post of UDCs for
          all Command HQs at its own level after LDCE and thereafter determine
          the seniority simultaneously on the basis of marks obtained by the
          candidates under 25 % quota.



      (iv) To pass such other orders which are found just fit and proper under the
           circumstances of the case.



      (v) To allow the original application with cost.





2.       The issue at the admission stage is whether this original

application can be admitted with all applicants or whether only those

applicants which are posted in the territorial jurisdiction of this Bench

can be part of this OA. It may be mentioned that the relief sought is with

reference to the impugned seniority list dated 03.08.2021 issued by

respondent 3, viz., Engineer-in-Chief (E-in-C), Military Engineering

Services (MES), New Delhi. It may also be mentioned that applicants 10

and 11 are posted at Lucknow, i.e., within the territorial jurisdiction of

this Bench while other applicants are posted at stations falling in

territorial jurisdiction of other Benches.





3.1      It is the contention of the learned counsel for applicants that the

seniority of the applicants in the impugned all India seniority list dated

03.08.2021 has got adversely affected as a result of delay in holding of

the meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) meeting by

HQ, Central Command, Lucknow. Therefore, in this OA challenging the

                                                                                           Page 4 of 6

  CAT, Lucknow DY. 2212 of 2023 in M.P. No. 332/001786of 
2023Mohammad Aslam and others Vs. U.O.I &Ors.




impugned seniority list dated 03.08.2021 brought out by E-in-C, MES,

New Delhi, part of the cause of action as arisen in HQ, Central

Command, Lucknow owing to delay in holding DPC meeting there. As per

rule 6 of the Central Administrative Tribunal (Procedure) Rules, 1987

(Procedure Rules, hereinafter) the OA can be filed in the Bench within

whose jurisdiction the cause of action, wholly or in part, has arisen.


3.2      The learned counsel for the applicants also submits that in the OA

No. 408 of 2021, decided by this Bench on 03.01.2024, applicants posted

various jurisdictions were allowed to be joined for similar reason.


4.1      Rule 6 of the Procedure Rules reads as follows:


      "6. Place of filing applications.- (1) An application shall ordinarily be filed
      by an applicant with the Registrar of the Bench within whose jurisdiction -

      (i) the applicant is posted for the time being, or

      (ii) the cause of action, wholly or in part, has arisen;

      Provided that with the leave of the Chairman the application may be filed
      with the Registrar of the Principal Bench and subject to the orders
      under section 25, such application shall be heard and disposed of by the
      Bench which has jurisdiction over the matter.

      (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (1) persons who has
      ceased to be in service by reason of retirement, dismissal or termination of
      service may be at his option file an application with the Registrar of the Bench
      within whose jurisdiction such person is ordinarily residing at the time of
      filing of the application."

4.2      In 
Alapan Bandopadhyay vs Union of India
 in Civil Appeal No. 197

of 2022 arising out of SLP (C) No. 18338/2021, Hon'ble Supreme Court

inter alia discussed the issue of jurisdiction in regard to the cause of

action in the following terms:






      "11. In Nawal Kishore's case, the issue concerned was with respect to the
      jurisdiction of a particular High Court against an authority/person residing
      outside its territorial jurisdiction. That question was considered with reference
      to 
Article 226(2)
 of the Constitution. It was held that writ could be issued
      if cause of action wholly or partially had arisen within the territorial
      jurisdiction of High Court concerned even if the person or authority
      against whom writ is sought for is located outside its territorial
      jurisdiction. 
However, it was held that in order to maintain such a
      writ petition, the petitioner had to establish that such respondents
      infringed his legal rights within the limits of the High Court's

                                                                                           Page 5 of 6

   CAT, Lucknow DY. 2212 of 2023 in M.P. No. 332/001786of 
2023Mohammad Aslam and others Vs. U.O.I &Ors
.




        jurisdiction.In Navin Chandra N. Majithia's case, again the jurisdictional
        issue was considered with reference to 
Article 226(2)
 of the Constitution and
        held that the High Court concerned would have jurisdiction to
        entertain a writ petition if any part of the cause of action arose
        within its territorial limits even though the seat of government or
        authority or residence of persons against whom direction, order or
        writ is sought to be issued is not within its territory."

                                                                                 (emphasis supplied)


6.3       In the instant case, the dispute on seniority has arisen because of

all India seniority list prepared by E-in-C, New Delhi. However, the delay

on part of HQ, Central Command, Lucknow is the reason cited by the

applicants giving rise to the said dispute. Thus part of the cause of action

leading to the dispute has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this

Tribunal. We have also taken note of OA No. 408 of 2021 adjudicated by

this Bench as pointed out by the learned counsel for the applicants.


7.1       In view of the foregoing, M.A. 1786 of 2023 is allowed.


7.2       The OA is admitted.




7.3       The case shall be listed on 25.01.2024 for disposal of interim relief.
