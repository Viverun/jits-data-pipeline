     THESE WRIT PETITIONS ARE FILED UNDER 
ARTICLES
226
 
& 227
 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO
STRUCK DOWN THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT NO.07 OF
"KARNATAKA PRIVATE AIDED EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
EMPLOYEES (REGULATION OF PAY, PENSION AND OTHER
BENEFITS) ACT, 2014" AND CONSEQUETNLY TO QUASH THE
GAZETTE NOTIFICATION DATED 12.02.2014 PUBLISHED IN
KARNATAKA GAZETTE DATED 12.02.2014 IN PART IV(A) BY THE
RESPONDENT NO.1 AS PER ANNEXURE-E.


     THESE WRIT PETITIONS BEING HEARD AND RESERVED,
COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
                            : 240 :




                          ORDER



      In all these petitions, the constitutional validity of

the Act known and called as '
The Karnataka Private

Aided Educational Institutions Employees (Regulation of

Pay, Pension and Other Benefits) Act, 2014
, (for short

'Act No.7/2004') is under challenge. Petitioners are also

seeking for treating the employees of aided private

educational institutions who have been admitted to

grant-in-aid   on   par   with       employees    working    in

Government     Educational     Institutions      in   providing

service benefits.





      2.    I have heard the arguments of Sriyuths

Janardhan G., Vittal S Teli, J.S.Shetty, A.S.Patil,

Sharmila M.Patil, learned counsel appearing on behalf

of petitioners and Sri A.G.Shivanna, learned Additional

Advocate General along with Sri Ravi V Hosamani,

learned Additional Government Advocate appearing on

behalf of respondent/State. In few of the writ petitions,

                           : 241 :





the institutions in which the petitioners are working

have also been arrayed as parties and notices issued to

them either has been served, represented or unserved

and yet to be served.    Their presence or absence and

their say in these writ petitions would have no bearing

on the contentions raised by the petitioners in aid of the

relief sought for by them in these writ petitions. Hence,

by consent of learned advocates appearing for parties,

these writ petitions are taken up together for hearing

and disposed of by this common order since grounds

urged and defence putforth in all these writ petitions are

common, similar and identical.





     3.    The grievance of the petitioners is they have

been appointed as Lecturers, Teachers, Clerical Staff

etc., by the Management of the aided institutions in

which they are now at present working and their

appointment was approved subsequently on various

dates (in respect of different petitioners) by admitting

                           : 242 :





them to grant-in-aid and the non-grant period was not

considered for purposes of seniority and fixing the pay-

scale. It is also contended that some of the petitioners

working as teachers had undergone career advancement

scheme as per the requirement of UGC guidelines and

on fulfilling the said requirement, they are being paid

salary accordingly, by extending all benefits. It is also

contended that the petitioners have been granted the

revised UGC pay-scales from time to time from the date

of joining of service.





      4.    It is also contended that on account of the

State undertaking to exclude the non-grant period for

the purposes of reckoning seniority and other service

benefits, some of the teachers had approached this

Court seeking for a direction to the State to include the

non-grant period also for service benefits and same

came to be allowed which was later affirmed by the

Division Bench and also by the Hon'ble Apex Court. It

                                : 243 :





is contended that pursuant to the said order, first

respondent extended the triple benefit scheme for non-

grant period also and to over come the orders passed by

this Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court, the present Act

has been introduced with retrospective effect from

01.06.1995, whereby for the non-grant period extending

the triple benefit scheme now stands excluded.



      5.    It is also the grievance of the petitioners that

pursuant to the same, second respondent has issued

Circulars   to   the   institutions/colleges   where    the

petitioners are working to implement the provisions of

amended Act and accordingly re-fix their salaries by

excluding the non-grant period and as such, these

institutions/colleges are making attempts to re-fix the

salaries of the petitioners.





      6.    It is contended by the petitioners that in

doing so, it would amount to discrimination between the

employees of State and employees of private institutions

                               : 244 :





and all teachers will have to be treated equally and as

such the impugned Act is violative of 
Article 14
 of the

Constitution. It is also contended that the State having

been unsuccessful before all the Courts including the

Apex Court in repudiating the claim of the petitioners

for treating the non-grant period to be excluded has now

sought to negate the dicta of the Courts by bringing the

present legislation retrospectively.



     7.    The contentions raised in these writ petitions

by the petitioners can be crystalised as under:


     i)    State cannot deny the service benefits
           to    the     employees              working           in
           institutions admitted to grant-in-aid
           though      same      is     extended           to    the
           employees     working           in      Government
           colleges/institutions           and        it    would
           amount to discrimination since both
           are discharging same duties;



     ii)   When      
Section          87
      of     Karnataka
           Education     Act,           has        fixed        same

                          : 245 :






       parameters for both the employees
       namely         employees            working         in
       educational institutions receiving grant
       from the State will be the same as
       those    applicable          for   corresponding
       category of employees in any State
       institutions, same cannot be whittled
       down by the amending Act that too,
       retrospectively and particularly when
       the provisions of existing Act has been
       interpreted by the Courts to the benefit
       of the petitioners and as such, taking
       away the benefit accrued by such
       orders of the Court through legislation
       would be violative of 
Article 14
 of the
       Constitution.



iii)   When 
Section 87
 of the Karnataka
       Education Act, 1983, along with Rules
       (1), (3), 2 (d), 3, 3 (1) (a) (b) (c), 3 (2) (a)
       and     Rule     17         (1)    of        Karnataka
       Education Rules, has been examined,
       interpreted and held by the Courts that
       employees        working                in      private
       institutions are entitled for the triple

                          : 246 :





      benefit     scheme           on     par      with   the
      employees working in institutions run
      by Government, State cannot shrug off
      its responsibility in complying with
      such orders by taking recourse to
      nullify     the     said          orders      through
      impugned retrospective legislation.



iv)   When petitioners and similarly placed
      employees         have       been      granted      all
      service benefits with prior approval of
      the      State,    such           benefits     already
      granted cannot be taken away by
      impugned retrospective legislation.



v)    Any attempt by the State to nullify the
      effect     of     judicial          pronouncement
      amounts to encroachment of judicial
      power,


vi)   When Hon'ble Supreme Court has held
      that claim of teachers in aided schools
      for parity in the matter of pay and
      pension to be the same granted to
      teachers        working           in      Government
      schools/colleges and has granted such

                             : 247 :





             parity, same cannot be denied on the
             ground of financial burden to the State
             as it would not be a valid ground for
             denying the pay parity.



     vii)    It is also contended that statement and
             objects of the Act would clearly indicate
             that to avoid financial burden to the
             State, impugned legislation is being
             brought in retrospectively and same
             would amount to taking away the
             fundamental right of the petitioners.



     viii)   The principle of equal pay for equal
             work would apply in all force to the
             petitioners and as such, there cannot
             be any discrimination between them
             and    the   employees     working      in
             institutions run by Government.



     8.      The learned advocates appearing for the

parties having reiterated the above raised contentions

and have also supplemented their contentions which

can be summarised as under:

                          : 248 :


i)     When judgments have been passed by
       the Courts holding that petitioners are
       entitled for equal pay on par with
       Government teachers/staff from the
       date of appointment or initial entry into
       service and not from the date they were
       admitted to grant-in-aid same cannot
       be nullified by the Act in question that
       too, with retrospective effect.


ii)    The impugned Act attempts to nullify
       the   judgments        of   this    Court       and
       Hon'ble    Apex      Court        and   same     is
       impermissible       and      is     violative    of
       Articles   13,     14       and    16    of     the

       Constitution of India since these issues
       which have been concluded by the
       judgments and the object with which
       the Act impugned is being brought in is
       not for a bonafide reason but tainted
       with malafides.



iii)   By the impugned Act a reasonable
       classification between two classes of
       employees is not brought about but it

                       : 249 :





      discriminates between two classes of
      employees who are similarly placed
      and who have put in equal service and
      it further discriminates between same
      class of teachers i.e., between the
      teachers   of   aided     institutions   and
      teachers of Government colleges.



iv)   
The Education Act
 being in concurrent
      list, impugned Act in question over
      rides the Central Act and same is
      beyond legislature competence of the
      State legislation.



v)    Pension and salary is not a bounty
      given by the State but it is a property
      right and same is being taken away by
      impugned legislation.



vi)   Even teachers who were working in
      Government      colleges     as    stop-gap
      lectureres have been extended benefit
      from the date of initial entry into
      service and by the impugned Act,
      benefit granted to them would not be

                           : 250 :





       taken away but on the other hand
       such benefit extended to petitioners
       and similarly placed persons would be
       taken away and as such there would
       be discrimination between petitioners
       and     stop-gap       lecturers     working     in
       Government colleges.



vii)   Provisions of 
Section 3
 of Act 7 of 2014
       is ultra vires the powers of the State
       Legislature      as    it     encroaches       upon
       judicial field and over rule the judicial
       pronouncements               which   is   binding
       between interse parties. Thus, any
       action to take away the power of the
       judicial   pronouncements               would    be
       ultra    vires    of     the    power     of    the
       Legislature       and         binding     judicial
       pronouncement between the parties
       cannot be made ineffective with the aid
       of legislative power by enacting a
       statute which in substance over rules
       such judgments and it would not be in
       the     realm    of    legislative      enactment

                                : 251 :





             which     displaces         the    basis    or
             foundation of such judgments.



     viii)   It is contended that in the instant case,
             Courts have not struck down any
             legislation   so      as    to    enable   the
             Legislature to remove the defect in the
             statute pointed out in the judgment so
             as to bring in the impugned legislation
             retrospectively      and     as    such    the
             legislature   have          no    power     or
             competency to nullify the binding effect
             of the judgments rendered by Courts
             which are binding interse parties.

     10.    Per contra, Sri A G Shivanna, learned

Additional Advocate General appearing along with Sri

Ravi V     Hosamani,   learned      Additional   Government

Advocate would reiterate the contentions raised in the

statement of objections in W.P.No.21216/2014 and

contends that said plea put forward by the State would

hold good as the defense of the State in respect of all

other writ petitions and elaborates his submission by

contending that grant-in-aid is not a right and same is a

matter of policy of the State and as such, first

respondent taking into account its economic capacity

and development of the State has taken a conscious

decision not to consider the non-grant period for pay,

pension and other benefits and decisions rendered by

this Court to consider the non-grant service period for

same would amount to amendment of the existing

                           : 254 :





Government policy by way of judicial order and it also

amounts to extension of benefits to persons to whom

the policy was not intended to apply and as such, the

Karnataka    Private   Aided        Educational   Institutions

Employees (Regulation of Pay, Pension and other

benefits) Act, 2014 was brought in and it satisfies the

three tenets prescribed by catena of judgments of the

Hon'ble Apex Court namely, (1) impugned Act satisfies

the test of legislative competence; (2) defect pointed out

by the Courts in the judgments is cured by complying

with legal and constitutional requirements; and (3) there

is no violation of rights guaranteed in part III of the

Constitution.





     11.    He would also further contend that 
Section

87
 of the Education Act having been amended by

Ordinance 1 of 2004, the defect or deficiency in the

statutory provision which was pointed out by the Courts

in various earlier judgments which have been relied

                           : 255 :





upon by the petitioners has been sought to be removed

by the impugned legislation and Legislature is fully

empowered to prescribe the conditions for excluding the

non-grant period. He would also contend that pension

of Government employees are governed by Karnataka

Civil Services Rules and none of the petitioners fit into

the category of a Government employee i.e., they do not

satisfy the three conditions prescribed under Chapter

XVI of Karnataka Civil Services Rules so as to claim

equality with employees working in institutions run by

Government. He would also submit by way of alternate

submission that law which was already found in 
Section

87
 of the Education Act has been clarified by Act 7 of

2014 and the impugned legislation       is a clarificatory

legislation and to exclude the non-grant period for

extending pay and pension, new law has been framed.

It is also contended that State of Andhra Pradesh by Act

No.26 of 2006 declared to limit the liability of the State

                               : 256 :





on schemes of advancement to the extent of grant-in-aid

sanctioned to the posts by nullifying the judgment

rendered by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in

W.P.No.8697/2005         dated     07.11.2005   and   similar

exercise having been undertaken by the State of

Karnataka through Act No.7 of 2014, the constitutional

validity be upheld since there is no challenge to the

competence of the legislature to enact the impugned

legislation. Hence, he prays for dismissal of the writ

petitions.





      12.    In support of his submissions, he has relied

upon the following judgments:



             (i)     AIR 2014 SC 2407
                     State of Tamil Nadu vs. State of Kerala

             Cooperative Finance Corporation Limited
             and another


      13.      Having   heard     the   learned    Advocates

appearing for the parties, on perusal of the pleadings

and case laws relied upon by the learned Advocates

appearing for the parties, this Court is of the considered

view that only question which arises for consideration

is:





      "Whether constitutional validity of Karnataka
      Private    Aided     Educational      Institutions
      Employees (Regulation of Pay, Pension and other
      Benefits) Act, 2014 (Act No.7 of 2014) is to be
      upheld or be declared as unconstitutional on the
      ground that it is ultra vires of the Constitution
      of India?"



       In order to undertake this exercise, it would be

necessary to narrate few facts which are common to all

the writ petitions and also extract the impugned

legislation.

                           : 259 :





FACTUAL MATRIX:



      14.   All the petitioners are working as teaching

and non-teaching staff of private aided educational

institutions.   They came to be appointed by the

respective institutions after permission came to be

granted by the Department of Education.                 On the

ground that they are legally entitled for fixation of pay

scale, annual increments, seniority and also entitled to

pensionary benefits from the date of their initial

appointment upto the date of their appointment with

aid and denial of said benefit to them is bad in law, they

had approached this Court by filing writ petitions with a

prayer to reckon and count the past services rendered

by   them   namely,   from   the    date   of   their    initial

appointment up to the date of approval of their

appointment with aid for the purposes of fixation of pay

scale, annual increments, seniority and pensionary

benefits.   Writ petitions filed by them came to be

allowed and was affirmed by the Division Bench of this

                            : 260 :





Court and Special Leave Petitions filed by the State

challenging the orders passed by Division Bench came

to be dismissed. Thus, the matter attained finality.



     15.   For the purposes of immediate reference, one

set of writ Appeals filed by the State which came to be

dismissed by the Division Bench of this Court in

W.A.No.503/2011 and connected matters by order

dated 30.11.2011 requires to be noticed to meet the

arguments advanced by respective learned Advocates. It

came to be held by the Division Bench as under:



                  "4.   Since on a similar question
           this Court has taken a consistent view, in
           several petitions, holding that such
           lecturers are entitled to the benefit of
           fixation of salary from the date of their
           initial appointment and not necessarily
           from the date the college was admitted to
           grant-in-aid, the present petitions stand
           allowed. Annexure-"C" by which such a
           benefit is denied to the petitioners is
           hereby quashed. The respondents are
           directed to take into account the past
           services of the petitioners from the
           date of their respective appointments
           till the passing of the impugned order
           for the purpose of fixation of pay with

                                : 261 :





              revision from time to time in the cadre
              of Lecturers along with arrears and to
              pass suitable orders within a period of
              eight weeks, if not earlier, from the date
              of receipt of a certified copy of this order.



                          (emphasis supplied)




     16.      Similar matters which came to be disposed

of by the Division Bench was challenged by the State

Government in Special Leave Petitions filed before the

Hon'ble Apex Court in SLP (C) Nos.14870-15136/2012

c/w SLP (C) Nos.22176-22186/2010 which came to be

dismissed by order dated 21.08.2013. Thus, the matter

attained finality. In other words, petitioners therein

acquired certain rights by virtue of orders passed by

this Court.





     17.      On account of non-implementation of the

orders/directions       issued      in   the    above    referred

judgments and also similar orders, aggrieved petitioners

had approached this Court by initiating contempt

                           : 262 :





proceedings, wherein the State undertook to implement

the orders within two months and as such, reserving

liberty to the complainants/petitioners to seek revival of

the contempt proceedings in the event of order passed

by the learned Single Judge is not complied, contempt

proceedings came to be disposed of.            Thereafter, the

State did not comply with the order passed by the

learned Single Judge and as such, complainants revived

the   contempt     proceedings        by   filing   necessary

applications and the State Government being put on

notice, produced the Government order, under which

the State Government extended the service benefits for

the unaided period of service, such as fixation of pay

scale, adding annual increments, senuiority, T.B.A. and

pensionary benefits. Thereafter, several orders came to

be issued by the State Government under which the

service benefits such as fixation of pay scale, annual

increments,      pensionary         benefits    and     other

                              : 263 :





consequential benefits were extended to some of the

petitioners only and several others have not been

extended the service benefits for unaided period. It

would be apt to note at this juncture itself that review

application filed by the State Government before the

Hon'ble Apex Court seeking review of dismissal of

Special Leave Petitions also came to be dismissed on

06.12.2012.





        18.   It is in this factual background, the State

Government through the impugned enactment namely,

by Act No.7 of 2014 introduced Karnataka Private Aided

Educational Institutions (Regulation of Pay, Pension and

other    Benefits)   Act,   2014       to   extend   Grant-in-aid

computed at the minimum of pay scale in the time scale

on the date of admission to Grant-in-aid to the

employees working in Private Educational Institutions

in the State and to limit the liability of the State on

schemes of advancement to the extent of Grant-in-aid

                               : 264 :





sanctioned to the posts and for the matters connected

therewith   or   incidental     thereto   for   the   purposes

indicated thereunder with retrospective effect from

01.06.1995.





     19.    Concededly the State Government amended

the 
Karnataka Education Act, 1983
 namely, 
Section 87


of the Education Act through Ordinance namely,

through Karnataka Education (Amendment) Ordinance,

2014 (Karnataka Ordinance No.1/2014) retrospectively

i.e., with effect from 01.06.1995.         The amendement

brought about to Section 87 via Ordinance reads as

under:





            "2. Amendment of Section 87.- 
In the
            Karnataka     Education      Act,    1983


(Karnataka Act
 1 of 1995), in 
section 87
,-



                  (a)   in the proviso the words "and
            benefits of retirement" shall be omitted;

            and


                  (b) after the proviso, the following
            provisos shall be inserted, namely:-

                           : 265 :


                "Provided further that conditions of
          service of the employees working in aided
          educational institutions shall be as such
          as may be determined by the State
          Government from time to time.



                Provided also that since 1974 no
          employee of the aided institution is
          required to appear and pass any Servie
          Examination or the Kannada Language
          Examination as prescribed in the
          Karnataka Civil Service (Service and
          Kannada Language Examination) Rules,
          1974 no such employee shall be eligible
          for or be granted any additional
          increment for having passed or deemed to
          have been passed said examination from
          the date of commencement of said rules."



The said Ordinance having not been placed before both

the Houses of the State namely, Legislative Assembly

and Legislative Council as required under 
Article

213(2)(a)
 of the Constitution of India, same has lapsed

which is not disputed by the learned Additional

Advocate General.     Hence, this Court would not

examine the issue of constitutional validity of the

amendment to 
Section 87
 brought about by Ordinance

during the pendency of writ petitions, though some of

                               : 266 :





the petitioners have also amended the writ petitions and

have    sought     for   declaring      Karnataka    Education

(Amendment) Ordinance, 2014 being unconstitutional

and violative of 
Article 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution of

India, since such an exercise if undertaken would be an

exercise in futility and academic issue.



       20.    Now turning my attention back to the core

issue namely, the constitutional validity of Act No.7 of

2014, it would be of benefit to extract the Statement¸

Objects      and   reasons    of    enacting   the   impugned

legislation by the State of Karnataka. It reads as under:



              Statement, Objects and Reasons:



                    "
An Act
 to regulate salary and
              allowance and other conditions of service
              of teaching and non-teaching employees
              of private educational institutions on
              admission to grant-in-aid and limiting
              financial liability of the State and other
              matters     connected      therewith   are
              incidental thereto;



                     Whereas, the State Government
              has admitted several private educational
              institutions for grant-in-aid to improve

                 : 267 :





the standard of education and reduce the
burden of the management by giving the
salary grant to teaching and non-
teaching staff.



       And whereas, the Government in
order No.ED 65 SES 62 dated 24.08.1963
introduced the Karnataka State Aided
Schools       Employees       Contributory
Provident         Fund-Insurance-Pension
scheme (Triple Benefit Scheme) Rules to
regulate pensionary benefits of aided
institutions coming under the ambit of
Primary and Secondary Education with
effect from 01.04.1963 and directed to
take in to account the length of qualifying
service of all previous service whether
temporary, officiating or permanent either
in one or more than one State - aided
institution.



        And whereas, the Government
framed the 
Karnataka Education Act,
1983
 to provide for the planned
development of educational institutions,
inculcations of healthy educational
practice, maintenance and improvement
in the standards of education and better
organization discipline and control over
Educational institutions in the state with
a view to fostering the harmonious
development of the mental and physical
facilities of students and cultivating a
scientific and secular outlook through
education and the said Act came into
force from 1-6-1995 as per Government
notification No ED 2 MES 95 dated 30-
05-1995 with a saving clause enshrined
in 
Section 146 (3)
 by virtue of which the

                  : 268 :





TBS Rules became part and parcel of the
said Act.



      And whereas, non-consideration of
non-grant service for pay was questioned
in W.P.Nos. 226-228/1998 and the said
writ petitions were dismissed on 13-08-
1998 by rejecting the reliefs sought by
the writ petitioners.



       And Whereas, the Government in
letter No. ED 130 PMC 99 dated: 12-07-
2001 has given direction not to reckon
the unaided service for pensionary
benefits.



       And Whereas, the Government has
issued a circular on 20-09-2003 bearing
No. ED 90 PMC 99 clarifying that the
non-grant service shall not be considered
for the purpose of pension and leave.



       And whereas the Government has
issued order No. ED 674 SEW 2005
dated:    10-04-2006      reiterating    the
directions given in rule 3 (1) (b) and (c) of
the Karnataka Educational Institutions
(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions
of Service of Employees in Private Aided
and Primary and Secondary Educational
Institutions) Rules, 1999, wherein the
service rendered during non-grant period
shall not be considered for pay, leave,
pension and any other service benefits.



       And whereas the non-reckoning of
non-grant period of service for pensionary
benefits was challenged by Sri H. Peter in
W.P. No. 10399/2004 and the Hon'ble
High Court of Karnataka allowed the said

                 : 269 :





writ petition on 01-09-2006 with a
direction to compute pensionary benefits
by considering non-grant period.



      And whereas, in exercise of powers
conferred by Sub-Section (1) of 
Section
145
 of the Karnataka Education Act,
1983 the Government framed the
Karnataka     Pre-University    Education
(Academic, Registration, Administration
and Grant-in-aid etc.) Rules, 2006. The
Sub-rule (2) and (3) of Rule 21 of the said
Rules reads as below-



             "(2) The posts and the
      persons working in such posts
      in private aided Pre-University

       And whereas in exercise of the
powers conferred by sub-section (1) of

section 145

conditions specified in the guidelines

upholding     the    contention    of   the
Petitioners that the Triple Benefit Scheme
Rules and the Government Orders are
not inconsonance with 
section 87
 of the
Karnataka Education Act, 1983 thereby
rejecting the Government's contention
that as per TBS Rules only the service
rendered in aided institutions be
considered for qualifying service, the
Hon'ble High Court on 13.10.2006 and
12.12.2007 allowed the Writ Petitions by
directing reckoning of the service from
initial appointment on the basis of actual
emoluments drawn, including increments

Karnataka connected the Writ Appeals
Nos. 450/2007 and 848/2008 filed by
the State with other similar Writ Petitions
delivered the following Order:



             "Under the circumstances,
      Writ Appeals filed by the State
      have to be dismissed and the
      Writ Petitions have to be
      allowed. Rule is made absolute.


      The respective authorities are
      directed to consider the case of
      each of the Petitioner and pass
      orders    accordingly    in   the
      context    of   relevant    rules
      applicable to them with regard
      to their retirement benefits
      including pension and gratuity
      along with interest at the rate of
      6% p.a. which shall be paid with
      effect from the date of filing of
      the Writ Petition by each of
      these lecturers/teachers within
      a period of two months from the
      date of receipt of the certified
      copy of this Order".



      And    whereas,  the    State   of
Karnataka preferred the Appeal in the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the Special
Leave Petition No. 22176-22186/2010
was connected with other similar Special
Leave Petitions were dismissed on
21.08.2013;



       And    whereas, there is  no
justification to include the service

                 : 275 :





rendered in un-aided institutions which
are subsequently brought under grant-in-
aid, for the purpose of pensionary
benefits as such inclusion would amount
to taking into consideration the service
not covered by the Pension Rules and it
would also amount to giving retrospective
effect to the admission to grant-in-aid
which is never contemplated by the
Government;



      And whereas, if the increments
earned by the teaching and non-teaching
employees    of   the    Private  Aided
Educational Institutions in non-grant
period is taken into consideration for
releasing the Grant-in-aid, and for the
purposes of Automatic Advancement
Scheme, Career Advancement Scheme
and Pension it would involve very huge
financial implication to the       state
exchequer;



        And     therefore,   Government
reviewed the matter and decided to
extend Grant-in-aid computed at the
minimum of pay in the time scale on the
date of admission to grant in aid to the
employees working in Private Educational
institutions in the State and to limit the
liability of the State on schemes of
Advancement to the extent of Grant-in-
aid sanctioned to the posts and for the
matters connected therewith or incidental
thereto for the purposes hereinafter
appearing;"

21.   The preamble of a Statute like the long title

is a part of the Act and is an admissible aid to

construction.   Although not an enacting part, the

preamble is expected to express the scope, object and

purpose of the Act more comprehensively than the long

title. It may recite the grounds and cause of making the

statute, the evils sought to be remedied or the doubts

which may be intended to be settled. Sir John Nickel in


Brett vs. Brett
 reported in (1826) 162 ER 456 at page

458-459 has held:






                 "It is to the preamble more
           specially that we are to look for the
           reason or spirit of every statute,
           rehearsing this, as it ordinarily does,
           the evils sought to be remedied, or the
           doubts purported to be removed by
           the statute, and so evidencing in the
           best and most satisfactory manner,
           the object or intention of the
           legislature in making or passing the
           statute itself."

                           : 277 :


 
22.   As to circumstances under which a preamble

can be used as a tool in aid of interpretation, came to be

considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of


BURAKAR COAL LIMITED vs UNION OF INDIA


reported in AIR 1961 SC 954 and held:






                 "It is one of the cardinal
           principles of construction that where
           the language of an Act is clear, the
           preamble      must    be     disregarded
           though, where the object or meaning
           of an enactment is not clear, the
           preamble may be resorted to explain
           it. Again, where very general language
           is used in an enactment which, it is
           clear must be intended to have a
           limited application, the preamble may
           be used to indicate to what particular
           instances, the enactment is intended
           to apply. We cannot therefore, start
           with the preamble for construing the
           provisions of an Act, though we could
           be justified in resorting to it, nay, we
           will be required to do so if we find that
           the language used by Parliament is
           ambiguous or is too general though in
           point of fact Parliament intended that
           it should have a limited application."

                           : 278 :


It has been further held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in


STATE OF RAJASTHAN vs LEELA JAIN
 reported in

AIR 1965 SC 1296 that preamble cannot be used to

eliminate the operative provisions of the statute as

unintended. It has been held:






           "The preamble may, no doubt, be used
           to solve any ambiguity or to fix the
           meaning of the words which may have
           more than one meaning but it can,
           however, not be used to eliminate as
           redundant     or     unintended,      the
           operative provisions of the statute."



 
23.   Thus, an enactment including its preamble

must be read as a whole to decide whether any part of

the enacting provision is clear or ambiguous.          If,

however, having read the Act as a whole, including the

preamble, the enacting words clearly negative the

construction which it is sought to support by the

preamble, that is an end of it. It has been held by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
STATE OF WEST

                           : 279 :





BENGAL vs UNION OF INDIA
 reported in AIR 1963 SC

1241 that objects of the Act cannot be used to cut down

the generality of the words used in the statute.      It has

been observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court as under:


                 "It is however well settled that
           the Statement of Objects and Reasons
           accompanying a Bill, when introduced
           in Parliament, cannot be used to
           determine the true meaning and effect
           of substantive provisions of the
           statute. They cannot be used except
           for    the     limited    purpose     of
           understanding the background and
           the antecedent state of affairs leading
           up to the legislation. But we cannot
           use this statement as an aid to the
           construction of the enactment or to
           show that the legislature did not
           intend to acquire the proprietary
           rights vested in the State or in any
           way to affect the State Government's
           rights as owner of minerals.          A
           statute, as passed by Parliament, is
           the expression of the collective
           intention of the legislature as a whole,
           and any statement made by an
           individual, albeit a Minister, or the
           intention and objects of the Act
           cannot be used to cut down the
           generality of the words used in the
           statute. "

                           : 280 :


     24.    Keeping these principles in mind, when the

Statements, Objects and Reason of the impugned

enactment i.e., Act No.7/2014 is perused, it would

clearly emerge that the State Government having

admitted several Private Educational Institutions for

Grant-in-aid to improve the standard of education and

reduce the burden of management had extended salary

grant to teaching and non-teaching staff from the date

of grant and not from the date of their initial

appointment. Records would also indicate that several

employees    both   teaching    and   non-teaching     being

aggrieved   by   non-consideration    of   initial   date   of

appointment for extending grant-in-aid, pay and other

benefits had questioned such denial and had sought for

reckoning the non-grant period for extending pay, leave,

promotion, pension and other service benefits. Records

would also indicate that several writ petitions filed by

such of those employees including petitioners herein

                           : 281 :





had been allowed by this Court and affirmed in Writ

Appeals and confirmed by the Hon'ble Apex Court.

However, in order to exclude the non-grant period

rendered by the employees in unaided institutions

which were subsequently brought under the Grant-in-

aid for the purpose of pay and pensionary benefits,

automatic advancement scheme, career advancement

scheme, impugned enactment has been brought about

on the ground that it would result in huge financial

implication to the State Exchequer.      When preamble

of the Act is read in conjunction with the provisions of

impugned enactment, it would clearly indicate that it

disentitles the petitioners the benefit of fixation of pay

scale, annual increments, Time Bound Allowances,

pensionary benefits and other consequential benefits

from the date of their entry into service but they would

be entitled to such benefits from the date of approval of

their appointment with aid. In other words, the benefit

                          : 282 :





accrued and derived by the petitioners by virtue of the

order passed by this Court and which have also been

implemented by the State is sought to be nullified by

the impugned Act No.7/2014.





      25. Keeping the aforestated aspects in mind,

further   and   deeper    examination    namely,   the

constitutional validity of the Act is being examined in

the background of its challenge on the grounds already

noted hereinabove.





      26. It is not in dispute that petitioners and

similarly placed persons had approached this Court for

reckoning the non-grant period to be treated as

qualifying years for the purposes of extending pay and

other service benefits and this Court having considered

the plea of the State which was to the effect that


Karnataka Education Act, 1993
 and the Rules made

thereunder would enable the State to restrict the

employees working in aided institutions to grant salary

                            : 283 :





and other service benefits from the date of admitting

them to grant and not any period anterior to it and

rejected the same by delving upon 
Section 87
 of the

Education Act and Rule 3 of the Karnataka Educational

Institutions (Recruitment and Terms and conditions of

service of employees in Private Aided Primary and

Secondary Educational Institutions) Rules, 1999 by

holding that a conjoint reading of 
Section 87
 of the

Karnataka Education Act, 1993 and the Rules made

thereunder, it is clear that the intention of the State

Government is to grant parity to the teachers working in

all Government Schools as well as those working in

Private Schools vide judgment rendered by Division

Bench    on   03.11.2009     in      W.A.No.848/2008    and

connected matters. It came to be been held by the

Division Bench to the following effect:



                 "21. On a combined reading of
           these provisions what emerges is that
           under 
Section 87
 of the Act, conditions of
           service of employees in recognized private

                                : 284 :





               educational institutions must be on par
               with the conditions of service of the State
               Government Institutions. However, the
               proviso states that with regard to
               conditions of service including the
               retirement for employees in educational
               institutions such as the state aided
               institutions can be prescribed otherwise
               meaning thereby that the conditions of
               service of aided institutions could be
               varied as compared to the conditions of
               service of teachers of Government
               Institutions by means of Rules being
               enacted. It is in view of this proviso the
               2001 Rules and the 1999 Rules as well as
               2003 
referred to above
 have been
               enacted."



      27.      The question whether the legislature has

kept itself within the jurisdiction assigned to it or has

encroached upon a forbidden field, is determined by

finding out the true nature and character of the

legislation.     The   Courts'     strongly   lien   against   a

construction which reduces the statute to a futility. A

statute or any enacting provision therein must be so

construed so as to make it effective and operative on the

principle expressed in the maxim "ut res magis valeat

quam pereat" - that the thing may rather have

                            : 285 :





effect than be destroyed; that the transaction may

be valid rather than invalid. It is on application of

this principle that Courts while pronouncing upon the

constitutionality of a statute start with a presumption in

favour of constitutionality and prefer a construction

which keeps the statute within the competence of the

legislature. There is, therefore a presumption that the

legislature does not exceed its jurisdiction and the

burden of establishing that the act is not within the

competence    of   the   legislature,   or   that   it   has

transgressed other constitutional mandates such as

those relating to fundamental rights, is always on the

person who challenges its vires.





     28.   Lord Denning in the case of FAWCETT

PROPERTIES VS. BUCKINGHAM COUNTY COUNCIL

reported in 1960 (3) AIR 503 has observed thus:


           "But when a statute has some meaning
        even though it is obscured, or several
        meanings, even though it has little to
        choose between them, the Courts have to

                             : 286 :





         say what meaning the statute is to bear
         rather than reject it as a nullity."



      29.   A statute is designed to be workable and the

exercise undertaken by a Court should be to secure that

object unless crucial omission or clear direction makes

that ultimate end unattainable. If on one construction

a given statute would become ultra vires the powers of

the legislature, whereas on another construction, which

may be open and the statute remains effective and

operative, the Court will prefer the latter, on the ground

that the legislature is presumed not to have intended to

act in excess of its jurisdiction.





 
30.   A perusal of statement of objects and

reasons assigned by the State while enacting Act

No.7/2014, it would indicate that the legislature with

an intent to remove the basis of the judgment rendered

by this Court has sought to ensure such decision is

rendered ineffective. The legislature, while removing the

                             : 287 :





basis of a judgment or its substratum can exercise its

power by bringing in a legislation to render such

judicial decision ineffective.        If the legislature wants to

render a judicial decision ineffective, it can only do so

by removing or altering or neutralizing the legal basis of

the judgment which is sought to be made ineffective

and that neither the legislature nor the executive has

the power of simply declaring the earlier decision of the

Courts as invalid or not binding.                In otherwords,

legislature has the power to remove the defect in the

statute pointed out by the Courts by amending Act and

removing such defect in the statute by validating such

Act retrospectively with the aid of legal fiction. It has

been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of


M/S.TIRATH RAM RAJINDRA NATH, LUCKNOW VS.

SCC 585 as under:




                  "7.  Now coming to the second
            contention of Dr.Singhvi, we fail to see

           this contention. The Legislature has not
           purported either directly or by necessary
           implication to overrule the decision of the
           Allahabad High Court in Krishna Brick
           Field's case (supra). On the other hand it
           has accepted the decision as correct but
           has sought to remove the basis of the
           decision by retrospectively changing the
           law.     This court has pointed out in
           several cases the distinction between
           encroachment on the judicial power and
           the nullification of the effect f a judicial
           decision     by     changing     the    law
           retrospectively. The former is outside the
           competence of the Legislature but the
           latter is within its permissible limits. In
           the instance case what the Legislature
           has done is to amend the law
           retrospectively and thereby remove the
           basis of the decision rendered by the
           High Court. Such a course cannot be
           considered as an encroachment on the
           judicial power."



 
31.   It has been further held by Hon'ble Apex

Court in the case of 
I.N.SAKSENA VS. STATE OF M.P


reported in AIR 1976 SC 2250 that distinction between

                            : 289 :





a "legislative act" and a "judicial act" is well known

though in some specific instances the line which

separates one category from the other may not be easily

discernible.   It has been held that such validating

legislation which removes the causes for ineffectiveness

or invalidity of actions is not an encroachment on

judicial power.




 
"22. While,     in   view   of   this
           distinction between legislative and judicial
           functions, the legislature cannot by a bare
           declaration, without more, directly over-
           rule, reverse or over-ride a judicial
           decision, it may, at any time in exercise of
           the plenary powers conferred on it by
           
Article 245
 and 
246
 of the Constitution
           render a judicial decision ineffective by
           enacting a valid law on a topic within its
           legislative field fundamentally altering or
           changing with retrospective, curative or
           neutralising effect the conditions on which
           such decision is based. As pointed out by
           Ray C.J. in 
Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj
           Narain
,(1) the rendering ineffective of
           judgments or orders of competent courts
           and tribunals by changing their basis by
           legislative enactment is a well-known
           pattern of all validating Acts. Such
           validating legislation which removes the
           causes for ineffectiveness or invalidity of
           actions or proceedings is not an
           encroachment on judicial power."


                           : 290 :


     32.   The legislature may, at any time, in exercise

of the plenary power conferred on it by 
Article 245
 and


246
 of the Constitution render a judicial decision

ineffective by enacting a valid law.       There is no

prohibition against retrospective legislation. The power

of the legislature to pass a law postulates the power to

pass it prospectively as well as retrospectively, which

would be subject to legislative competence.        Thus,

rendering the judgments and orders of competent

Courts ineffective by changing their basis by legislative

enactment is a well known pattern of all validating Acts.

Such validating legislation which removes the causes of

ineffectiveness or invalidity of action or proceedings

cannot be construed as encroachment of judicial power.

If the legislature by passing an Act without altering the

statute on the basis of which the judgment was

pronounced, then such legislation will not nullify the

                               : 291 :





effect or force of the judgment pronounced by a Court in

any manner.





 
33.   The learned Additional Advocate General has

very heavily relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex

Court in the matter of 
COMORIN MATCH INDUSTRIES

(PVT) LTD vs STATE OF TAMIL NADU
 reported in

1996(4) SCC 281 to contend enacting validation law

with retrospective effect is within the competence of the

legislature and by amendment Act, judgment of the

High    Court    is   being     nullified      to   sustain   the

constitutional validity of the impugned Act.


       34.   Assessment Orders for the assessment year

1957-58 to 1965-66 came to be challenged before the

High    Court    of   Madras            by   COMORIN     MATCH

INDUSTRIES PRIVATE LIMITED contending that it had

sold the Safety Matches manufactured by it, in the

course of inter-state trade and commerce for which

sales tax was charged under the 
Central Sales Tax Act
,

                            : 292 :





1956 (for short 'CST'), on the ground that CST was

levied on turnover which included excise duty and no

CST can be levied on excise duty. Claim for refund of

the tax collected by the authorities were also made.

Similar writ petitions were also filed before the High

Court.   The High Court of Madras allowed the writ

petition in the case of LARSEN AND TOUBRO LIMITED

vs   JT.CTO   reported   in    (1967)   20   STC   (Mad.).

Following that decision, High Court allowed the writ

petition filed by the assessee - COMORIN MATCH

INDUSTRIES and other writ petitioners. 
Though the

sales tax authorities did not file any appeal against the

judgment of COMORIN MATCH INDUSTRIES, but

preferred an appeal in respect of another assessee

before the Hon'ble Apex Court i.e., in the case of 
STATE

OF MADRAS vs N.K.NATARAJA MUDALIAR
 reported

in AIR 1969 SC 147. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that

provisions of sub-sections (2), (2-A) and (5) of 
Section 8


                             : 293 :





of the Central Sales Tax were valid.      However, it was

held that the tax on excise duty was illegal and affirmed

the decision of the High Court on the said issue.


 
35.   The grievance of the assessee - COMORIN

MATCH INDUSTRIES was that despite the judgment of

the High Court, refund of the tax was not granted

though specific direction had been given by the High

Court to the said effect.     The Hon'ble Apex Court in


NATARAJ MUDALIAR
's case, while disposing of the

appeal had directed as under:






                  "The appeal will be allowed and the
           order passed by the High Court declaring
           the provisions of 
Sections 8(2)
, 
8
(2-A) and
           8(5) ultra vies must be set aside.



                 The petition out of which this appeal
           arises was one of a group of petitions filed
           before the High Court. Against orders
           passed in favour of the other assessees the
           State has not preferred appeals. The
           amount involved in the claim is small. The
           State apparently has approached this
           Court with a view to obtain a final
           determination of the important question
           which was raised in the petitions filed
           before the High Court. We therefore direct

                             : 294 :





            that there will be no order as to costs in
            this Court and in the High Court."



     36.    Yet another reason for which assessments

were set aside was on account of inclusion of excise

duty in the computation of 'turnover'. There was a

controversy as to how the turnover under the Central

Sales Tax should be computed. Under the T.N.General

Sales Tax Act, 1959 and the Rule, as it stood at the

material time, provisions had been made for deduction

of excise duty in the computation of chargeable

turnover.   The High Court of Madras held that the

quantum of turnover for the purposes of levy of CST

had to be made in the same manner by excluding the

excise duty paid on the goods sold.





 
37.    
The   Central   Sales     Tax   Act,   1956
   was

amended by 
Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1969
,

whereunder the definition of 'turnover' defined in


Section 2(j)
 was amended and the working of 
Section 9


                            : 295 :





was radically altered. The new provisions were deemed

always to have been substituted. The said amendment

was effected with a view to put an end to the

controversy whether "turnover" should be computed in

accordance with the provisions of the State Sales Tax

law or not. This amendment was brought about to get

over the view expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in


STATE OF MADRAS vs N.K.NATARAJA MUDALIYAR


reported in AIR 1969 SC 147 whereunder it had been

held that the Central Sales Tax had to be levied in the

same manner as provided in the Madras General Sales

Tax Act.
 
It had been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in


NATARAJA MUDALIYAR
's case referred to supra as

under:






                  "If under the Madras General Sales
           Tax Act in computing the turnover the
           excise duty is not liable to be included
           and by virtue of 
Section 9(1)
 of the
           Central Sales Tax Act has to be levied in
           the same manner as the Madras General
           Sales Tax Act, the excise duty will not be
           liable to be included in the turnover....

                            : 296 :


           We are of the view that in the matter of
           determining the taxable turnover the
           same rules will apply by virtue of 
Section
           9(1)
 of the Central Sales Tax Act, whether
           the tax is to be levied under the 
Central
           Sales Tax Act
 or the 
General Sales Tax
           Act
."



When the Central Sales Tax Act
 was examined by the

Madras High Court in LARSEN AND TOUBRO's case

referred to supra and the Hon'ble Apex Court in


NATARAJ MUDALIAR
's case, defined 'turnover' as

defined in 
Section 2(j)
 of the Central Sales Tax Act to

mean "the aggregate of the sales prices received and

receivable by him in respect of sales of any goods in the

course of inter-State trade or commerce made during any

prescribed period and determined in the prescribed

manner". By amending Act, the words "and determined

in the prescribed manner"            were substituted by the

words "and determined in accordance with the provisions

of this Act and the Rules made thereunder".
 
This

amendment was given effect with retrospective effect

                            : 297 :





from the date on which the 
Central Sales Tax Act
 came

into force and thereby the basis of law on which

judgement in 
N.K.NATARAJ MUDALIAR
's case was

pronounced was removed from the statute.


     38.    It is in this background, the Hon'ble Apex

Court in COMORIN MATCH INDUSTRIES (PVT) LTD

VS STATE OF TAMIL NADU reported in (1996)4 SCC

281 has held that the statute being what it was, the

judicial interpretation of the statute could not be held to

be erroneous by legislative imprimatur, but if the

statute itself was amended retrospectively so that the

very basis of the judgment disappear, then it could not

be said that the judgment was still in force and will

have to be given effect even though the legislature had

specifically laid down that amended law would operate.

It has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in said case

as under:



                 "16. Therefore, the majority view
            appears to be that if a judgment is

                               : 298 :





             pronounced by a court and the effect of
             that judgment is sought to be taken away
             by legislature by passing an Act without
             altering the statute on the basis of which
             the judgment was pronounced, then such
             legislation will not nullify the effect or force
             of the judgment pronounced by a court in
             any manner. The statute being what it was,
             the judicial interpretation of the statute
             could not be held to be erroneous by
             legislative imprimatur, but if the statute
             itself was amended retrospectively so that
             the    very    basis    of     the    judgment
             disappeared, then it could not be said the
             judgment was still in force and will have to
             be given effect to even though the
             legislature had specifically laid down that
             the      amended      law       will    operate
             notwithstanding any judgment or decision
             or decree by the court to the contrary. In
             fact, that is how the judgment of Shri
             Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. understood and
             explained.



     39.     The power of validation is undisputed if

vested with the Legislature.            For this proposition, the

judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of SRI

PRITHVI COTTON MILLS vs BROACH BOROUGH

MUNICIPALITY reported in (1969)2 SCC 283 can be

looked up.

                              : 299 :


      40.     The   distinction    between   legislative    and

judicial function is well known. Within the scope of its

legislative    competence         and   subject    to      other

constitutional limitations, Legislature can exercise its

power to enact laws and said power is plenary in

nature. In exercise of such plenary power, Legislature

can enact law prospectively as well as retrospectively.



Where the statutory provision is interpreted by the

Court in a particular manner and directions are issued

for implementing the judgment in the light of the

interpretation placed on the statutory provisions, the

legislature need not pass a validating Act.             In such

situation, the legislature in exercise of its plenary power

under 
Article 245
 and 
246
 can make a new Act altering

fundamentally the provisions which was the basis of the

judgment passed by the Court.           This exercise can be

done with retrospective effect also.

                           : 300 :


 
41.   As held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the

case of 
STATE OF TAMIL NADU VS. STATE OF

KERALA
 reported in AIR 2014 SC 2407 that State can

validate the law by removing the defects pointed out by

the Court will have to be examined in the facts and

circumstances of each case. The question whether or

not the legislature has usurped the judicial power or

enacted a law in breach of separation of powers would

depend upon facts of each case after considering the

real effect of law on a judgment or a judicial proceeding.




Three primary tests which requires to be applied are:



     (1)   Whether the vice pointed by Court and
           invalidity suffered by previous law is
           cured,   complying       with   legal   and
           constitutional requirements?



     (2)   Whether Legislature has competence to
           validate the law?

                            : 301 :


      (3)   Whether such validation is consistent
            with the rights guaranteed in part III of
            the Constitution?



      42.   Thus, Court has a delicate function to

examine the law enacted by legislature to find out,

whether in fact legislature has exercised legislative

power by merely declaring an earlier judicial decision to

be invalid and ineffective or the legislature has altered

and   changed    the   character     of   legislation   which

ultimately render the judicial decision ineffective.




      43.   It has to be remembered that there is always

a presumption that legislature does not exceed its

jurisdiction. As such, burden of establishing that

legislature has transgressed constitutional mandate is

always on the person who alleges such violation and

who challenge the vires.    It is to be remembered that

until and unless it becomes clear beyond reasonable

                            : 302 :





doubt   that   the   legislation     under   challenge   has

transgressed constitutional limits, Courts refrain from

interfering with such legislation and it will be allowed to

stand. The adjudication of the rights of the parties

according to law is a judicial function.           When a

particular rule or the Act is interpreted by a Court of

law in a specified manner and the law making authority

forms the opinion that such an interpretation would

adversely affect rights of the parties and as such, a new

set of rules or laws is enacted, it is quite offen

challenged on the ground of the legislature having

transgressed its power or usurped the judicial power.

Thus, the Courts would have delicate function to

undertake and examine the new set of laws enacted by

the legislature and to find out whether in fact the

legislature has exercised the legislative power by merely

declaring an earlier judicial decision to be invalid and

ineffective or the legislature has altered and changed

                              : 303 :





the character of the legislation which ultimately may

render the judicial decision ineffective.




 
44.     The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of


STATE OF TAMIL NADU vs STATE OF KERALA


reported in        AIR 2014 SC 2407 while examining the

constitutionality     of   
Kerala      Irrigation   and     Water

Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2006
 and declaring it

as unconstitutional in its application to and effect on

the Mullaperiar Dam was also examining the separation

of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary

and held that even without express provision of the

separation of powers, the doctrine of separation of

powers is an enshrined principle embodied in the

Constitution of India. It has been held by the Hon'ble

Apex Court after elaborate discussion on the issue of

doctrine      of   separation     of     powers     under     the

Constuitution of India and summarized it as under:


                 : 304 :


       "121. On deep reflection of the
above discussion, in our opinion,
following are the constitutional principles
in the context of Indian Constitution
relating to separation of powers between
legislature, executive and judiciary may,
in brief, be summarized thus:



      (i)   Even       without      express
            provision of the separation of
            powers, the doctrine of
            separation of powers is an
            entrenched principle in the
            Constitution of India. The
            doctrine of separation of
            powers informs the Indian
            constitutional structure and
            it is an essential constituent
            of rule of law.       In other
            words,     the    doctrine   of
            separation of power though
            not expressly engrafted in the
            Constitution,     its    sweep,
            operation and visibility are
            apparent from the scheme of
            Indian            Constitution.

            Constitution      has     made
            demarcation,            without
            drawing formal lines between
            the      three     organs     -

            legislature, executive and
            judiciary. In that sense, even
            in the absence of express
            provision for separation of
            power, the separation of
            powers between legislature,
            execution and judiciary is not
            different       from        the
            constitutions of the countries

             : 305 :





        which     contain   express
        provision for separation of
        powers.



(ii)    Independence of courts from
        the executive and legislature
        is fundamental to the rule of
        law and one of the basic
        tenets of Indian Constitution.
        Separation of judicial power
        is a significant constitutional
        principle       under       the
        Constitution of India.



(iii)   Separation       of      powers
        between three organs -

        legislature, executive and
        judiciary - is also nothing
        but     a   consequence       of
        principles      of      equality
        enshrined in 
Articles 14
 of
        the Constitution of India.

        Accordingly,      breach      of
        separation of judicial power
        may amount to negation of
        equality under 
Articles 14.

        Stated thus, a legislation can
        be invalidated on the basis of
        breach of the separation of
        powers since such breach is
        negation of equality under
        
Articles     14
      of     the
        Constitution.



(iv)    The superior judiciary (High
        Courts and Supreme Court)
        is   empowered      by    the
        Constitution to declare a law
        made by the legislature

            : 306 :





       (Parliament      and         State
       legislatures) void if it is found
       to have transgressed the
       constitutional limitations or
       if it infringed the rights
       enshrined in Part - III of the
       Constitutions.



(v)    The doctrine of separation of
       powers applies to the final
       judgments of the courts.

       Legislature cannot declare
       any decision of a court of law
       to be void or of no effect. It
       can,    however,    pass    an
       amending Act to remedy the
       defects pointed out by a
       court of law or on coming to
       know of it aliunde. In other
       words, a court's decision
       must always bind unless the
       conditions on which it is
       based are so fundamentally
       altered that the decision
       could not have been given in
       the altered circumstances.



(vi)   If the legislature has the
       power over the subject-

       matter and competence to
       make a validating law, it can
       at any time make such a
       validating law and make it
       retrospective. The validity of
       a validating law, therefore,
       depends upon whether the
       legislature   possesses    the
       competence which it claims
       over the subject-matter and

             : 307 :





        whether in making the
        validation law it removes the
        defect which the courts had
        found in the existing law.




(vii)   The law enacted by the
        legislature may apparently
        seem to be within its
        competence       but    yet    in
        substance if it is shown as
        an attempt to interfere with
        the judicial process, such law
        may be invalidated being in
        breach     of     doctrine     of
        separation of powers.          In
        such situation, the legal
        effect of the law on a
        judgment      or    a    judicial
        proceeding        must         be
        examined      closely,    having
        regard       to       legislative
        prescription     or    direction.

        The questions to be asked
        are, (i) Does the legislative
        prescription or legislative
        directions interfere with the
        judicial functions? (ii) Is the
        legislation targeted at the
        decided case or whether
        impugned law requires its
        application to a case already
        finally decided? (iii) What are
        the terms of law; the issues
        with which it deals and the
        nature of the judgment that
        has attained finality? If the
        answer to (i) to (ii) is in the
        affirmative        and        the
        consideration      of    aspects

                            : 308 :





                       noted     in   question   (iii)
                       sufficiently establishes that
                       the impugned law interferes
                       with the judicial functions,
                       the Court may declare the
                       law unconstitutional."





     45.   Thus, it would emerge from the scheme of

constitution   that   Legislature    can     render   judicial

decision ineffective by enacting validating law within its

legislative field fundamentally altering or changing its

character retrospectively. However, said principle would

have no application where a judicial decision has been

rendered by recording a finding of fact and under the

pretence of such plenary power, legislature, cannot

nullify or neutralize the effect of the judgment rendered

after ascertainment of facts by means of evidence or

material placed by the parties to such dispute. A final

judgment   once   rendered      would   be    operative   and

executable until and unless altered by the Court itself in

appropriate proceedings.

                             : 309 :


 
46.    Keeping the aforestated discussion in mind,

the constitutional validity of Act No.7/2014 is to be

tested.    As held by Hon'ble Apex Court in 
STATE OF

TAMIL NADU vs STATE OF KERALA
 referred to supra,

a validating law is to be judged by applying three tests

namely,


            (1)   Whether the legislature possesses

                  competence          over   the   subject

                  matter?





            (2)   Whether       by       validation   the

                  legislature has removed the defect

                  which the Courts found in the

                  previous law? and,


            (3)   Whether it is inconsistent with

                  the provisions of Part III of the

                  Constitution?

                              : 310 :


     47.   Insofar as the first test is concerned, it

would not detain this Court for too long to hold that

there is not much challenge by the petitioners with

regard to the competency of the legislature to enact the

impugned Act namely, Act No.7/2014.                   Hence,

question of applying the first test and examining as to

whether the impugned Act would pass the said test

does not arise.





     48.   However,    the      other   two   tests   namely,

whether the impugned Act is a validating Act brought

about to remove the defect which the Courts had

pointed out in the previous law or whether the

impugned Act is inconsistent or contrary to the

provisions of Part III of the Constitution will have to be

examined in the background of the law 
laid down by


this Court in granting relief to the petitioners namely,

directing the State to reckon the non-grant period or the

date of initial appointment for the purposes of granting

                             : 311 :





pay, promotion, pension and other service benefits to be

granted to them which concededly was on account of

interpretative    process   adopted      by    this    Court,    by

declaring the law namely, 
Karnataka Education Act,

1993
 and Rules made thereunder. Purportedly to plug

the said loop hole or the lacuna in the law, legislature in

exercise of its plenary power has brought about the

impugned enactment. Whether this Court had pointed

out any defect in the existing enactment and whether

on the basis of said defect, judgment came to be

rendered so as to enable the legislature to remove such

defect found in the previous law would be the primary

question. It is also to be examined as to whether the

impugned enactment is not opposed to Part III of the

Constitution of India or in other words, impugned

enactment    is    inconsistent       with    Part    III   of   the

Constitution of India.

                                 : 312 :


     49.   In        Writ   Appeal         No.848/2008        c/w

W.A.No.450/2007 and other writ petitions, Division

Bench of this Court examined the contention of the

State which was to the effect that the non-grant period

of service of the lecturers/teachers cannot be taken into

consideration for paying pensionary benefits, by relying

upon 
Section 87
 of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993

and Rule 3 of the Karnataka Educational Institutions

(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions of Service of

Employees in Aided Colleges of Education and Teachers

Training   Institutions) Rules,           2001 and     Karnataka

Educational Institutions (Recruitment and Terms and

Conditions of Service of Employees in Aided Colleges)

Rules, 1999. However, Division Bench rejected said

contentions     by    holding     that    there   is   no   contra

prescription insofar as the teachers of the aided

institutions are concerned and said Rule create a parity

                           : 313 :





between the Teachers of the Government colleges as

well as aided colleges.





     50.     Likewise, the serving as well as retired

teachers, assistant teachers and non-teaching staff who

have worked or working in aided private institutions

assailed   the   Government Order    dated 25.03.2011

whereunder the claim made by those petitioners for

grant of one increment on account of their passing

Kannada Language examination came to be denied for

the period 1974-1987. Said order came to be quashed

before a co-ordinate Bench of this Court and this Court

by order dated 10.08.2012 upheld the contention of

employees. Same was assailed in Writ Appeal No.2779

& 4868-5434/2013 by the State before the Division

Bench.     It was contended in the appeals by the State

that writ petitioners were not entitled to any benefits

which are applicable to Government servant and

teachers serving in the aided institutions cannot be

                               : 314 :





treated on par with the teachers serving in the

Government      institution   and        mere     passing   of   the

Kannada       Examination     by        them,   which    was     not

obligatory,    would   not    entitle      them    to   claim    the

increment and as such, it was contended that the

learned Single Judge was not justified in directing that

monetary benefit being paid to them for passing of the

Kannada Language examination or same to be extended

to the teachers working in private aided institutions

also. 
Section 87
 of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993

and Rule 3 of Karnataka Educational Institutions

(Recruitment and Terms and Conditions of Service of

Employees in Private Aided Primary and Secondary

Educational Institution) Rules, came to be examined by

the Division Bench and direction issued by the learned

Single Judge to grant benefit of one increment to those

teaching and non-teaching staff of the aided institutions

                            : 315 :





on par with the Government schools was upheld. It has

been held by the Division Bench as under:



                 "On a conjoint reading of the Section
          and the Rules along with Annexure-H, it
          becomes clear that the intention of the
          State Government is to grant parity to the
          teachers working in all Government
          schools as well as those working in private
          schools. However, this is subject to the
          financial capacity of the State Government.
          It is in that regard that the proviso has
          been inserted to Sub-Rule(b) of Rule 3(1),
          so as to deny certain benefits to employees
          of aided institutions. In the instant case, if
          the State had intended to deny the benefit
          of one incentive to the teachers and non-
          teaching staff of private institutions on
          passing     of   the    Kannada      language
          examination, the same could have been
          inserted in Annexure-II of the Rules. The
          absence of such an insertion in Annexure-
          II coupled with 
Section 87
 read with
          Clause (b) of Sub-Rule(1) of Rule 3 makes
          clear that there is no intention on the part
          of the State Government to deny such a
          benefit to the teachers of the aided
          institutions.     Moreover, conditions of
          service of staff of private aided institutions
          could be varied by the State Government
          under Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 3. Such a
          variation has not been pointed out insofar
          as the respondents are concerned. In that
          view of the matter, the learned Single
          Judge was right in quashing Annexure-A
          impugned in the writ petition and directing
          the State to grant the benefit of one

                            : 316 :





           increment to those teaching and non-
           teaching staff of the aided institutions,
           particularly the respondents herein, on
           passing    of    the   Kannada    language
           examination, on par with the Government
           schools. In that view of the matter, the
           impugned order does not call for any
           interference in these appeals. The appeals
           being devoid of merit are dismissed."



     51.   The legislature cannot by a bare declaration

without more, directly overrule, reverse or override a

judicial decision.   However it may, at any time, in

exercise of the plenary powers conferred on it by 
Article

245
 and 
246
 of the Constitution render a judicial

decision ineffective by enacting a valid law on a topic

within its legislative field fundamentally altering or

changing with retrospective effect either curatively or

neutralizing the effect on which such decision is based.

Such validating legislation which removes the causes

for ineffectiveness or invalidity of actions or proceedings

is not an encroachment on judicial power.         For this

proposition, judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the

                             : 317 :





case of INDIRA NEHRU GANDHI vs RAJ NARAYAN

reported in AIR 1975 SC 2299 can be looked up.



 
52.   Legislature while passing validating law and

providing an intended valid legislation must indicate the

defect pointed out in the judgment which otherwise

could not have been rendered. The intended legislation

must be curative legislation, not directly declaring the

judgment as ineffective.         It has been held by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in 
SAJJAN SINGH vs STATE OF

RAJASTHAN
 reported in AIR 1965 SC 845 to the

following effect:






                   "It is also urged that inasmuch as
            the impugned Act purports in substance
            to set aside the decisions of courts of
            competent jurisdiction by which some of
            the Acts added to the Ninth Schedule
            have been declared to be invalid, it is
            unconstitutional. We see no substance in
            this argument. It is hardly necessary to
            emphasize that legislative power to make
            laws in respect of areas entrusted to the
            legislative    jurisdiction  of   different
            legislative bodies, can be exercised both
            prospectively and retrospectively. The
            constituent power conferred by 
Art. 368


                               : 318 :





             on the Parliament can also be exercised
             both prospectively and retrospectively.
             On several occasions, legislatures think it
             necessary to validate laws which have
             been declared to be invalid by Courts of
             competent jurisdiction and in so doing,
             they have necessarily to provide for the
             intended validation to take effect
             notwithstanding any judgment, decree or
             order passed by a court of competent
             jurisdiction to the contrary. Therefore, it
             would be idle to contend fiat by making
             the    amendment       retrospective,   the
             impugned         Act       has      become
             constitutionally invalid."



 
53.     It has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court

that though the legislature has power to validate an

invalid    levy   retrospectively       and    can   change    the

character    of   tax   or   duty       from   impermissible    to

permissible but these principles would not apply if it is

in the form of a explanation, vide 
M.P.CEMENT

MANUFACTURERS            ASSOCIATION            vs   STATE     OF

MADHYA PRADESH
 reported in (2004)2 SCC 249. It

has been held as under:




 
"22. The legislature has the power to
             validate an invalid levy and to do so

                 : 319 :





retrospectively.         The  prescription
provided in the context of judicially
invalidated legislation would not apply as
the 2001 amendment had not, till the
promulgation of the 2003 Act, been held
to be invalid by any court.           The
legislature can also change the character
of the tax or duty from impermissible to
permissible but the tax or levy should be
within     its   legislative  competence.
However, in our view, these principles
would not apply to the 2003 amendment
since it is in the form of an Explanation
to 
Section 3(2)
.        The object of an
Explanation to a statutory provision has
been culled out from the earlier judicial
decisions and succinctly restated in

S.Sundaram Pillai v. V.R.Pattabiraman
 -
(1985) 1 SCC 591.




 
"53. Thus,         from       a
      conspectus of the authorities
      
referred to above
, it is manifest that
      the object of an Explanation to a
      statutory provision is--




      (a)   to explain the meaning and
      intendment of the Act itself,


      (b)   where there is any obscurity
      or   vagueness     in    the   main
      enactment, to clarify the same as to
      make it consistent with the
      dominant object which it seems to
      subserve.



      (c)  to provide an additional
      support to the dominant object of

                           : 320 :





                the Act in order to make          it
                meaningful and purposeful,


                (d)   an Explanation cannot in any
                way interfere with or change the
                enactment or any part thereof but
                where some gap is left which is
                relevant for the purpose of the
                Explanation, in order to suppress
                the mischief and advance the
                object of the Act it can help or
                assist the court in interpreting the
                true purport and intendment of the
                enactment, and


                (e)   it cannot, however, take away
                a statutory right with which any
                person under a statute has been
                clothed or set at naught the
                working of an Act by becoming a
                hindrance in the interpretation of
                the same."



 
54.   The power of the legislature to remove the

basis of a decision rendered by a competent Court in

exercise of its plenary power is an issue which is no

more res integra in view of the law 
laid down by
 Hon'ble

Apex Court in the case of 
STATE OF H.P. AND

OTHERS vs. YASH PAL GARG (DEAD) BY LRS
. &

OTHERS reported in (2003)9 SCC 92.
 
Likewise, where

                            : 321 :





the legislature possess competence over the subject

matter and tries to remove the defect which the Courts

had found in the existing law and makes adequate

provision in the validating law, the constitutionality of

such law has been held to be upheld as held by the

Hon'ble Apex Court in 
DHARAM DUTT AND OTHERS

vs UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS
 (2004)1 SCC 712.


 
55.   However, if the judgment is delivered on the

principles of parity, while re-enacting the law with

retrospective effect, such Act can be questioned as one

being in violation of fundamental rights enshrined in

Part-III of Constitution. If the judgment is delivered on

the principle of parity i.e. 
Article 14
 of the Constitution,

then there is little scope or area left available to the

legislature to enact a law inasmuch as, there is nothing

left to be validated or defect to be cured.           Such

legislation cannot be considered as curative legislation.

Where the judgments are held to be ineffective by

                             : 322 :





amending law, then exercise of power by the legislature

has to be held as having encroached upon the judicial

power. It has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in the

case of 
STATE OF HARYANA & OTHERS vs THE

KARNAL     CO-OP.     FARMERS'        SOCIETY       LIMITED


reported in AIR 1994 SC 1 to the following effect:


                  "31. Thus, it becomes clear that a
           Legislature while has the legislative
           power to render ineffective the earlier
           judicial decisions, by removing or altering
           or neutralising the legal basis in the
           unamended law on which such decisions
           were founded, even retrospectively, it
           does not have the power to render
           ineffective the earlier judicial decisions by
           making a law which simply declares the
           earlier judicial decisions as invalid or not
           binding for such power if exercised would
           not be a legislative power but a judicial
           power which cannot be encroached upon,
           by a Legislature under our Constitution.



                  32. In the instant case, the
           Haryana State Legislature, by the
           Amendment Act of 1981, has not made
           any provision to include the lands and
           immovable properties - the subject of the
           civil Court's decrees, in 'Shamilat deh' so
           as to bring them within the purview of
           the principal Act.      But, the provision

                  : 323 :





made therein merely directs the Assistant
Collector of First Grade, in effect, to
disregard or disobey the earlier civil
Courts' decrees and judicial orders by
which it had been held that certain lands
and immovable properties fell outside
'shamilat deh' regulated by the principal
Act. Such provisions inserted by the
Amendment Act of 1981 in the principal
Act by a Legislature are clearly
unconstitutional for they are to be
regarded     as    provisions     made      by
encroaching upon the judicial power.
Hence, the view of the High Court that
the provisions of the Amendment Act of
1981 which merely authorize the
Assistant Collector of First Grade to
decide the claims to the made before him
claiming certain lands or immovable
properties as 'shamilat deh' vesting in
Panchayats ignoring the judicial orders or
decrees, by which any right, title or
interest of private parties in such lands
or immovable properties are recognized
are unconstitutional, requires to be
upheld. Consequently, the provisions of
the Amendment Act of 1981, insofar as
they     are     intended      to      operate
retrospectively     for     nullifying     the
adjudications made by civil Courts prior
to that Amendment Act are invalid,
inoperative       and      unconstitutional.

However,      the     provisions     in    the
Amendment         Act    of    1981,      can

undoubtedly operate prospectively for
adjudicating upon claims to 'shalimat
deh' in proceedings initiated subsequent
to the commencement of that Act, if they

                              : 324 :





            do not, in any way, disturb the finality of
            adjudications made earlier."



     56.    
In this connection, the judgment of the

Hon'ble    Apex     Court   in   the    case   of   
MUNICIPAL

CORPORATION OF CITY OF AHMEDABAD vs NEW

SHOROCK        SPINNING          &     WEAVING       COMPANY

LIMITED
 reported in AIR 1970 SC 1292 can be noticed

whereunder the High Court as well as the Apex Court

has held that the property tax collected for certain years

by the Municipal Corporation was illegal.           In order to

nullify the effect of the decision, the State Government

introduced Section 152-A by an amendment to the Act,

the effect of which was to command the Municipal

Corporation, to refuse to refund the amount illegally

collected despite the orders of the High Court as well as

Apex Court.       In this background, it was held that said

provision makes direct in-road into the judicial powers.

It was further held that no legislature in the country

                            : 325 :





has power to ask the instrumentalities of the State to

disobey or disaregard the decision given by the Courts.

Consequently, the amended provision was held to be

repugnant to the Constitution and struck down.


     57.   The legislature can change the basis on

which decision is rendered by the Court and thus,

changed the law in general, which will affect a class of

persons and events at large.         It cannot, however, set

aside an individual decision inter parties and affect their

rights and liabilities alone. Such an act on the part of

the legislature amounts to exercising the judicial power

of the State and to function as an appellate Court or

Tribunal. This view is fortified by the law laid downby

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of: CAUVERY

DISPUTES TRIBUNAL reported in 1993 supplment (1)

SCC 96(II).

                             : 326 :


 
58.   The legislature cannot assume power of

adjudicating a case by virtue of its enactment of the law

without leaving it to the judiciary to decide it with

reference to the law in force.        The legislature also is

incompetent to over rule the decision of a Court without

properly removing the base on which the judgment is

found. The Hon'ble Apex Court in 
INDIAN ALUMINIUM

COMPANY      &   OTHERS        vs.    STATE    OF   KERALA


reported in (1996) 7 SCC 637            while examining the

validity of 
Section 11
 of Kerala Electricity Surcharge

(levy and collection) Act, 1989 (Act 22 of 1999) and

further provision permitting non-refund of the amount

collected has laid down the parameters for examining

the constitutionality of validating Act by the Courts in

the following manner:




           "56. From a resume of the above
           decisions the following principles would
           emerge:



                 (1)    The adjudication of the rights
                        of the parties is the essential

           : 327 :





      judicial function. Legislature
      has to lay down the norms of
      conduct or rules which will
      govern the parties and the
      transactions and require the
      court to give effect to them;



(2)   The Constitution delineated
      delicate   balance   in the
      exercise of the sovereign
      power by the legislature,
      executive and judiciary;


(3)   In a democracy governed by
      rule of law, the legislature
      exercises the power under
      
Articles 245
 and 
246
 and
      other    companion    articles
      read with the entries in the
      respective   lists  in     the
      Seventh Schedule to make
      the law which includes power
      to amend the law.



(4)   Courts in their concern and
      endeavour      to    preserve
      judicial power equally must
      be guarded to maintain the
      delicate balance devised by
      the Constitution between the
      three sovereign functionaries.

      In order that rule of law
      permeates        to      fulfil
      constitutional objectives of
      establishing an egalitarian
      social order, the respective
      sovereign functionaries need
      free play in their joints so
      that the march of social

          : 328 :





      progress and order remains
      unimpeded.     The smooth
      balance built with delicacy
      must always be maintained;



(5)   In its anxiety to safeguard
      judicial    power,     it   is
      unnecessary         to     be
      overzealous and conjure up
      incursion into the judicial
      preserve    invalidating  the
      valid law competently made;



(6)   The court, therefore, needs to
      carefully scan the law to find
      out:

      (a) whether the vice pointed
      out by the court and
      invalidity     suffered     by
      previous     law     is  cured
      complying with the legal and
      constitutional requirements;

      (b) whether the legislature
      has competence to validate
      the law: (c) whether such
      validation is consistent with
      the rights guaranteed in Part
      III of the Constitution.


(7)   The court does not have the
      power to validate an invalid
      law or to legalise impost of
      tax    illegally  made    and
      collected or to remove the
      norm of invalidation or
      provide a remedy. These are
      not judicial functions but the
      exclusive province of the
      legislature. Therefore, they

           : 329 :





      are not encroachment          on
      judicial power.



(8)   In     exercising     legislative
      power, the legislature by
      mere declaration, without
      anything       more,      cannot
      directly overrule, revise or
      override a judicial decision.
      It    can    render      judicial
      decision      ineffective      by
      enacting valid law on the
      topic within its legislative
      field fundamentally altering
      or changing its character
      retrospectively. The changed
      or altered conditions are
      such that the previous
      decision would not have been
      rendered by the court, if
      those conditions had existed
      at the time of declaring the
      law as invalid.      It is also
      empowered to give effect to
      retrospective legislation with
      a deeming date or with effect
      fro the particular date. The
      legislature can change the
      character of the tax or duty
      from      impermissible        to
      permissible tax but the tax or
      levy should answer such
      character and the legislature
      is competent to recover the
      invalid tax validating such a
      tax on removing the invalid
      base for recovery from the
      subject     or    render     the
      recovery from the State

                             : 330 :





                        ineffectual. It is competent
                        for the legislature to enact
                        the law with retrospective
                        effect and authorize its
                        agencies to levy and collect
                        the tax on that basis, make
                        the    imposition   of   levy
                        collected and recovery of the
                        tax         made        valid,
                        notwithstanding           the
                        declaration by the court or
                        the    direction  given    for
                        recovery thereof.


                  (9)   The consistent thread that
                        runs      through      all    the
                        decisions of this Court is that
                        the      legislature       cannot
                        directly overrule the decision
                        or make a direction as not
                        binding on it but has power
                        to    make       the    decision
                        ineffective by removing the
                        base on which the decision
                        was rendered,        consistent
                        with     the    law     of    the
                        Constitution        and       the
                        legislature       must       have
                        competence to do the same."



      59.   A bare reading of above dicta 
laid down by


Hon'ble Apex Court would indicate that the legislature

by mere declaration without anything more, cannot

directly over rule, revise or over write a judicial decision.

                           : 331 :


It has been held that the consistent thread that runs

through all the decisions of the Apex Court is that the

legislature cannot directly over rule the decision or

make a direction as not binding on it but has power to

make the decision ineffective by removing the base on

which the decision was rendered, consistent with the

Constuitution of India.   The State has to establish that

due to absence of the provision found in the amending

Act, such judgment came to be rendered and this was

the defect pointed out by the Court and to cure the

defect pointed out, amending Act or amendment was

being brought in.





     60.   It is well settled by catena of judgments that

when the Courts in exercise of power of judicial review

have declared a particular statute to be invalid, the

legislature has no power to over rule the judgment.

However, it has the power to suitably amend the law by

                            : 332 :





use of appropriate phraseology by removing the defects

pointed out by the Court for its effective enforcement.




     61.   Where the legislature validates the executive

action repugnant to the statutory provision declared by

the Court of law, what the legislature is required to do

is, first to remove the very basis of invalidity and then

validate the executive action.       In order to validate the

executive action or any provision of a statute, it is not

sufficient for the legislature to declare that a judicial

pronouncement given by a Court of law would not be

binding as the legislature would not possess that power.




     62.   In the instant case, the decisions rendered

by the Courts insofar as petitioners and similarly placed

persons are concerned relates to pay parity, grant of

increment on par with teachers working in Government

institutions, payment of pension and grant of other

                               : 333 :





service benefits which is based on 
Article 14
 of the

Constitution. Thus, it is a fundamental right which has

accrued to the petitioners as a matter of interpretation

of 
Section 87
 of Karnataka Education Act, 1993 and

Rules made thereunder by applying the principle of

'equal pay for equal work' financial benefits have been

extended   to   the    petitioners      and   similarly   placed

persons, which again is based on the principles 
laid

down in
 
Article 14
 and 
16
 of the Constitution.                
The

impugned enactment by the legislature in exercise of its

plenary    power      would      take    away     the     judicial

pronouncement which have been based on 
Article 14
 of

the Constitution and as such, the impugned enactment

will have to be necessarily held as opposed to 
Article 14


of the Constitution and thereby it fails to pass one of the

tests as indicated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in 
STATE

OF TAMIL NADU vs STATE OF KERALA
 reported in

AIR 2014 SC 2407 referred to supra.


                                 : 334 :


 
63.     At this juncture, it would be apt to note the

judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of


CHANDIGARH          ADMINISTRATION               vs     RAJNI   VALI

(Mrs.
) reported in (2000)2 SCC 42 wherein the Hon'ble

Apex Court has opined that it is the duty of all the

States in India to facilitate the imparting of primary and

secondary education and the grant-in-aid to the private

schools is a constitutional obligation, which the States

cannot     ignore   and    it     is      also   held    that   State

Administration cannot plead lack of resources to meet

such contingency. It has been held by the Hon'ble Apex

Court as under:




                   "10. Coming to the contention of
             the appellants that the Chandigarh
             Aministration will find it difficult to bear
             the additional financial burden if the claim
             of the respondents 1 to 12 is accepted, we
             need only say that such a contention
             raised in different cases of similar nature
             has been rejected by this Court. The State
             Administration       cannot     shirk     its
             responsibility    of    ensuring      proper
             education in schools and colleges on the
             plea of lack of resources. It is for the
             Authorities running the Administration to

                            : 335 :





           find out the ways and means of securing
           funds for the purpose. We do not deem it
           necessary to consider this question in
           further detail. The contention raised by
           the appellants in this regard is rejected. It
           is, however, clarified that the proportion in
           which the additional burden will be shared
           by the Chandigarh Administration and the
           Management of the school will be in
           accordance with the Grant-in- aid Scheme
           applicable to the school from time to time.
           The judgment of the High Court that the
           sharing of the financial burden will be in
           the ratio of 95 % to 5% is modified
           accordingly."



     64.   
In fact, directions came to be issued by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court way back in the year 1998 in

the case of 
HARYANA STATE ADHYAPAK SANGH &

OTHERS vs STATE OF HARYANA & OTHERS
 reported

in AIR 1988 SC 1663 to the effect that teachers of the

aided schools must be paid the same pay scales and

dearness allowance as teachers in Government schools

for the entire period claimed by petitioners, and that the

expenditure on that account should be apportioned

between State and the management in the same

                                  : 336 :





proportion in which they share the burden of the

existing emoluments of the teachers which direction

was reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court on 21.02.1990

between the same parties reported in reported in AIR

1990 SC 968 with a direction to the State to pay scales

of the teachers of the Government aided schools so as to

bring them at par with the pay scales of teachers of

Government schools with effect from 01.04.1979 and

also additional dearness allowance on the basis of

revised    pay    scales   for     the     period   01.04.1979   to

31.12.1985 in five instalments.






     65.    In this background, it requires to be noticed

that the impugned Act namely, Act No.7/2014 enacted

by the State legislature in exercise of its plenary power

is sought to be defended on two grounds namely,


            (1)     It causes financial burden to the State;

                    and

                           : 337 :





           (2)   Petitioners        and    similarly     placed
                 employees     working      in    Government
                 aided institutions do not have right to
                 claim monetary and service benefits
                 from    the        date   of    their   initial
                 appointment.



It is the same plea which came to be put forward by the

State when petitioners and similarly placed persons had

approached this Court seeking for pay parity on par

with the employees working in Government institutions.

By interpretative process, this Court has consistently

held in catena of judgments that 
Section 87
 when read

with 
Section 49
 of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993

does not leave any iota of doubt to arrive at a conclusion

about there cannot be any discrimination between two

types of teachers discharging same duties and thereby it

came to be held that pay parity by way of differenciation

between the teachers working in Government aided

institutions and teachers working in aided institutions

                            : 338 :





would amout to discrimination and is hit by 
Article 14


of the Constitution of India.





     66.   The judgments rendered by this Court as

affirmed by Division Bench and confirmed by Hon'ble

Apex Court has not extended the benefit to the

petitioners on the basis of any lacuna either in the


Karnataka Education Act, 1993
 or the Rules made

thereunder and thereby enabling the legislature to fill

up the said defect or loop hole or lacuna in the

enactment through the impugned enactment. However,

on the touch stone of 
Article 14
, 
Section 87
 of

Karnataka Education Act, 1993 has been held to be

discriminatory.   The legislature nor the executive has

the power to simply declare the decisions of the Court

as invalid or not binding. The State has not taken into

consideration any fresh material nor it has taken into

consideration any report from competent and expert

bodies to arrive at a conclusion that the impugned

                           : 339 :





enactment is brought about as a curative legislation.

The Courts in the instant case have not found or

declared any law to be invalid so as to enable the

legislature to exercise its plenary power to remove or

alter or neutralize the legal basis in the unamended law.



      67. In fact, at this juncture, it would be apt to

note the subsequent event also that arose during the

pendency of these writ petitions namely, amendment

brought about to 
Section 87
 of the Karnataka Education

Act by way of Ordinance whereunder the words "and

benefits of retirement" found in the proviso to 
Section

87
 of the Act was sought to be omitted and the provisos

indicated thereunder was sought to be inserted.      The

above said omission and insertion which were sought to

be   included    under       the    Karnataka   Education

(Amendment) Ordinance, 2014 (Karnataka Ordinance

1 of 2014) reads as under:

                 : 340 :


      "2. Amendment of 
Section 87
. -

In the Karnataka Education Act, 1983


(Karnataka Act
 1 of 1995), in 
section 87
,-


       (a) in the proviso the words "and
benefits of retirement" shall be omitted;
and


       (b) after the proviso, the following
provisos shall be inserted, namely:-


            "Provided further that
      conditions of service of the
      employees working in aided
      educational institutions shall
      be as such as may be
      determined    by   the   State
      Government from time to time.



              Provided also that since
      1974 no employee of the aided
      institution is required to
      appear and pass any Service
      Examination or the Kannada
      Language      Examination      as
      prescribed in the Karnataka
      Civil Service (Service and
      Kannada                Language
      Examination) Rules, 1974 no
      such employee shall be eligible
      for    or    be    granted   any
      additional      increment     for
      having passed or deemed to
      have      been    passed    said
      examination from the date of
      commencement of said rules."



      3. Cancellation of sanction of
Additional       increment        and
extinguishment of claims, if any.- (1)

                  : 341 :





Notwithstanding anything contained in
the 
Karnataka Education Act, 1983


(Karnataka Act
 1 of 1995), any order of
the State Government or rules governing
the conditions of employees of any Private
aided Educational Institution or any
other Law governing the Grant in aid to
the above employees or any Judgment,
decree or order of any Court or Tribunal
or Authority no employees of an aided
institution is required to pass any Service
or Kannada Language examination or be
eligible for or be granted any additional
increment for having passed or deemed to
have been passed any such examination
as prescribed to Government Servants in
the Karnataka Civil Services (Service and
Kannada Language examination) Rules,
1974 and any claim of an employee of a
Private    Educational     Institution    for
sanction of any additional increment for
the     above     reason     shall     stand
extinguished, accordingly,-



      (a)  the    order    issued by
Government directing to sanction any
additional increment for the above
reason shall stand cancelled;



      Provided that any amount paid
as per the order now cancelled
towards said additional increment
shall not be recovered;



      (b) no suit or other proceeding
shall be maintained or continued in
any Court against the Government by
any employee of Private Aided
Educational    institution   claiming
additional increment for the said

                           : 342 :





           purpose or arrears thereof or for
           pensionary benefits by reckoning the
           said additional increment;



                  (c) no Court shall enforce any
           decree or order directing release of
           grant in aid taking into account the
           additional    increment   for  having
           passed or deemed to have been passed
           the Service examination or the
           Kannada Language Examination by an
           employee of Private aided Educational
           Institution."





 
68.   At the cost of repetition, it requires to be

noticed that said Ordinance having not been brought

before the Legislature, it has failed and thereby

amended provision brought to 
Section 87
 of the

Karnataka Education Act, 1993 is not to be found or in

other words, unamended 
Section 87
 stands as on date.

Thus, 
Section 87
 of the Karnataka Education Act, 1993

having been interpreted by this Court as it is and held

that not taking into consideration the date of entry into

service for the purposes of pay, promotion, pension and

other service benefits to the petitioners and similarly

                             : 343 :





placed employees would tantamount to discrimination

and hit by 
Article 14
 of the Constiutition of India,

Legislature is now precluded from nullifying the effect of

judgments rendered by this Court by impugned Act in

exercise of its plenary power since it is not validating

any law declared by the Courts as invalid or defective.

Thus, the very foundation or the basis for the impugned

Act is lacking. Consequently, it has to be held that the

legislature    has   transgressed     its   power   and   has

encroached the judicial arena through the impugned

enactment.     Thereby, the impugned Act also does not

pass the second test prescribed by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of 
STATE OF TAMIL NADU vs STATE

OF KERALA
 reported in AIR 2014 SC 2407.


      69.     Yet another contention which has been

raised by Sri A.G.Shivanna, learned Additional Advocate

General is that State of Andhra Pradesh had enacted

similar law and same has been upheld by the High

                             : 344 :





Court of Andhra Pradesh when examined, it requires to

be taken note of for purposes of rejection for reasons

more than one.       State of Andhra Pradesh enacted

Andhra     Pradesh   Private     Aided   Educational      Staff

(Regulation of Pay) Ordinance, 2005 (Ordinance 3 of

2005) relating to certain service conditions of the

employee    both   teaching    and    non-teaching   of    the

educational institutions run by private organizations.

The validity of the said Ordinance had come up for

consideration before the Division Bench of High Court of

Andhra Pradesh in the matter of Y.SIDDAREDDY vs

GOVERNMENT OF ANDHRA PRADESH reported in

(2006)1 ALT 354 and held as follows:



                  "67.   Under     
Section   4
,    the
            Legislature purports to extinguish the
            rights created under the automatic
            advancement scheme and the career
            advancement scheme, the benefits of
            which are made available to those
            employees who had rendered certain
            minimum qualifying service. 
Section 4
 of
            the Act purports to extinguish the claims
            of the employees of the private aided
            educational institutions with regard to

                  : 345 :





the above mentioned four aspects of the
service based on any government order or
any judgment of the Court below or
tribunal. A plain reading of the section
purports to extinguish the rights of the
employees through the various orders on
the basis of which such rights were
created. Though the learned Advocate
General argued that the intention of the
Legislature is only to extinguish such
rights vis-a-vis the State, the section does
not make any distinction between the
obligation of the State and the obligation
of the management to give the benefits as
contemplated under the various GOs. It
mainly purports to extinguish the right
itself   thereby     relieving   even     the
managements from the obligation to
extend the benefits conferred under the
various government orders. We fail to
understand        the     whole      exercise
undertaken by the State. On one hand,
the continued existence of the benefits
created      under        the     automatic
advancement        scheme      and     career
advancement scheme is recognized in the
Ordinance, but on the literal construction
of 
Section 4
, it purports to extinguish the
rights flowing from such schemes. In our
view, the enactment is a product of an
absolute misconception of law and
inability of the draftsman to handle
the problem. The State in an attempt
to escape the financial liability arising
out of a plethora of ill-conceived
orders issued earlier resorted to the
impugned retrospective legislation by
which it not only proposes to escape
the financial liability - we make it clear

                            : 346 :





           the State indeed is entitled to escape -
           but also extinguish the rights of the
           employees vis-avis the managements. The
           State also ignored the fact that it owes a
           constitutional obligation to extend the
           necessary financial support to the
           educational       institutions    imparting
           education to children below 14 years. The
           Ordinance does not make any distinction
           between the educational institutions
           imparting education to the children below
           14 years and those imparting education
           to children above 14 years. This kind of
           grouping of SUBJECTS ignoring the
           constitutionally settled differentia, in
           our view, itself renders the legislation
           irrational and arbitrary. In our view,
           therefore, the Ordinance, as it is, is
           required         to        be      declared
           unconstitutional as violating the
           
Article 14
 of the Constitution of India.
           We accordingly declare so. The Writ
           Petition is allowed as prayed for".



                     (Emphasis supplied)



     70.   Facts narrated in the above judgment are

some what similar to facts obtained in the instant case.

GVK Girls High School was admitted to grant-in-aid

with effect from 01.09.1985 as per the 
Andhra Pradesh

Education Act
.     The arrears of salary to the Head

Mistress and Staff of the school were not paid. As such,

                           : 347 :





a writ petition came to be filed and State was directed to

pay the arrears. However, it was noticed by the Court

that during the pendency of writ petitions, G.O. dated

28.04.1994 was issued refusing to pay the arrears.

Hence, direction came to be issued to the State to pay

the arrears.    It is thereafter the State came forward

with a legislation by way of Andhra Pradesh Act, 34 of

1995   with    retrospective    effect   from   17.10.1989

whereunder it permitted denial of "arrears" of grant-in-

aid whenever such arrears were claimed under any

judgment, decree or order of Court or other authority or

any order issued by Government.          In the writ Appeal

filed by the State against the learned Single Judge's

order, State relied upon the said legislation to get over

the judgment of the learned Single Judge.           In this

background, Division Bench held that legislature could

not set aside the judgment of the High Court by Act

No.34 of 1995 by dismissing the Writ Appeal No.1745 of

                           : 348 :





dated 06.08.1996 and affirming the judgment of the

learned Single Judge.     This judgment of the Division

Bench was carried by the State by way of Special Leave

Petition before the Hon'ble Apex Court which was later

converted as Civil Appeal No.2428/1997.        The Hon'ble

Apex Court has held to the following effect:



                 "Act 22/1995 cannot set aside
           the judgment of the learned Single
           Judge.     Now 
section 2
 of the Act
           34/95 also purports to nullify the
           effect of the judgment of the learned
           Single Judge. It is well settled that
           the legislature cannot overrule a
           judgment by passing a law to that
           effect unless it removes the basis of
           the legal rights upon which the
           judgment is based, with retrospective
           effect and provided there is no
           violation    of   any   constitutional
           provision in such withdrawal of rights
           retrospectively.



                 In the present case, we are not
           going into the question whether any
           provision of the Constitution is
           violated while passing Act 34/95
           denying    arrears   of   grant-in-aid
           retrospectively. However, in our view,
           inasmuch as the rights created by Act
           1/82 and Act read with the

                           : 349 :





           Committee's recommendations have
           not been nullified by Act 22/95, the
           judgment of the learned Single Judge
           remains effective. The basis of the
           judgment has not been removed. We
           have already shown that the rights
           flowing from the Acts were not
           touched."



     71.   Thus, from the perusal of the order passed

by the Hon'ble Apex Court, it would clearly indicate that

judgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court came to be

affirmed. It was held by the Andhra Pradesh High Court

that Ordinance was unconstitutional and as such,

amendment brought to 
Andhra Pradesh Education Act


came to be struck down. In that view of the matter, the

said amendment cannot be held as being in parimateria

with 
Karnataka Education Act, 1993
. In that view of the

matter, contention of the learned Additional Advocate

General that amendment brought to 
Andhra Pradesh

Education Act
 is similar to the impugned Act if accepted

also, then the necessary consequence would be to hold

                            : 350 :





the present impugned enactment as also violative of


Article 14
 of the Constitution of India.





     72.   One another contention which has been

raised by the State is that 'Doctrine of Small Repairs'

is applicable to the impugned enactment and the

legislature in order to carry out the object of the

principal Act has resorted to enact the impugned Act.

Hence, it is contended that impugned Act does not

suffer from any vice for being struck down.




 
73.   Whenever a tax payer would challenge the

levy of tax before the Courts, scrutiny of legal provisions

is undertaken by the Courts to decide whether the levy

of tax is legally valid or suffers from some infirmity. In

the event of Court arriving at a conclusion that such

levy of tax was not warranted on account of defect in the

enactment or the phraseology used in the statutory

                           : 351 :





provisions or any other infirmity, order for refund. The

legislature in such circumstances undertake to enact

law to remove or rectify the defect or the lacuna and

also validate the proceedings including retaining or

withholding tax already recovered by retrospective

operation.   Such an amending and validating Act to

make "small repairs" is permissible mode of legislation

which is frequently resorted to in Fiscal enactments

which has been approved by the constitutional bench of

the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
ASSISTANT

COMMISSIONER OF URBAN LAND TAX AND OTHERS

vs THE BUCKINGHAM AND CARNATIC COMPANY

LIMITED, ETC
. reported in (1969)2 SCC 55.       Keeping

the principles enumerated by Hon'ble Apex Court in

mind, when the impugned Act is examined, it would not

even remotely suggest that the Courts while interpreting


Section 87
 of the Karnataka Education Act and the

Rules made thereunder had found any infirmity or

                            : 352 :





lacuna in the said enactments so as to enable the

legislature to exercise its plenary power to remove such

defect or lacuna in the enactment and thereby render

the judgments already delivered by the Courts to be

ineffective.
 
On the other hand, the impugned

enactment has been brought about on the ground that

it would cause financial burden on the State which has

already been dealt by this Court hereinabove and it has

been held that State Administration cannot shirk its

responsibility of ensuring proper education in schools

and colleges on the plea of lack of resources and it is for

the authorities to find out ways and means of securing

funds for the said purpose as held by the Hon'ble Apex

Court in the case of 
CHANDIGARH ADMINISTRATION


case referred to supra.


                                : 353 :


     74.   For the reasons aforestated, I proceed to

pass the following:





                              ORDER



           (i)     Writ Petitions are hereby allowed.



           (ii)    The        Karnataka           Private    Aided

                   (Regulation of Pay, Pension and other
                   Benefits) Act, 2014 
(Karnataka Act

                   No.07/2014) is hereby struck down as
                   ultravires of Constitution of India as it
                   is opposed to 
Article 14
 of Constitution
                   of India and also encroaches upon the
                   judicial    powers        of   the   Courts   as
                   discussed herein above.



           (iii)   Respondent - State shall continue to
                   pay salary or pension as the case may
                   be, to petitioners and similarly placed
                   persons as was being paid pursuant to
                   its earlier orders or in other words, as
                   it was being paid prior to impugned
                   enactment.

                             : 354 :


                                      OR

                  Respondent-State shall comply with
                  the directions already issued by this
                  Court extending the monetary benefits
                  and treating the petitioners working in
                  Private Aided Educational Institutions
                  on par with the employees working in
                  Government Institutions.



           (iv)   In the event of respondent - State
                  having     recovered     any    amount/s
                  pursuant to the impugned enactment,
                  same is hereby ordered to be refunded
                  to the respective petitioner/s by the
                  State expeditiously, at any rate within
                  eight weeks from the date of receipt of
                  certified copy of this order.



           (v)    No order as to costs.


      Ordered accordingly.
