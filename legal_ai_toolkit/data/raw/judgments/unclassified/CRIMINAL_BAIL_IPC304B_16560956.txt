                                        CRL.P No. 3155 of 2024





Sessions Court in Crl.Misc.No.1640/2023 was dismissed on

10.11.2023.    Therefore, he had approached this Court in

Crl.P.No.12113/2023. The said criminal petition was dismissed

as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioner to file fresh petition

after charge sheet is filed.   Hence, petitioner is before this

Court in this successive bail application, after filing of charge

sheet.





      5.    Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that

though F.I.R. was registered for the offences punishable under

143, 147, 498-A, 302, 304B, 149 of

the last ten months. Accordingly, he prays to allow the petition.



      6.    Per contra, learned HCGP has opposed the bail

petition and submits that, death has occurred within a span of

one year from the date of marriage. Therefore, there is a

presumption as against the accused persons. In the first

                                    -4-

                                                   NC: 2024:KHC:29916

information,    there     are    allegations    with   regard   to    the

harassment of the deceased and she was being abused and

assaulted in her matrimonial house. He accordingly, prays to

dismiss the petition.





      7.     Marriage of the deceased - daughter of the first

informant    was solemnized        with the petitioner herein on

27.01.2023.    In the first information, it is alleged that at the

time of marriage as per the demand made by the accused, the

family members of deceased had given dowry and inspite of the

same, there was demand for payment of additional dowry and

in this background Vinutha was harassed in her matrimonial

house.     It is alleged in the first information that petitioner

herein had assaulted Vinutha with sickle on her head, but no

compliant was lodged since uncle of the petitioner had assured

that he would advice the petitioner. The dead body of

deceased-Vinutha was found in a lake in Chelur, Tumakuru

District. On the basis of the first information submitted, initially

F.I.R. was registered against accused persons invoking 
Sections

302
   and    
304B
    of    IPC    amongst      other   offences.     After

investigation, charge sheet has been now filed for offence

punishable under 
Sections 498A
 and 
304B
 of IPC and Sections

                                -5-

                                            NC: 2024:KHC:29916

                                        CRL.P No. 3155 of 2024





3 & 4 of 
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
. The offence under


Section 302
 of IPC is dropped in the charge sheet. As per the

postmortem report, death of deceased has occurred as a result

of asphyxia due to drowning. Petitioner who has no criminal

antecedents is in custody from 23.10.2023.      Undisputedly all

the other accused are already enlarged on bail.      Allegations

against the petitioner is required to be proved in a full fledged

trial.   Under these circumstances, I am of the view that

petitioner has made out a case for grant of regular bail.

Accordingly, the following:





                             ORDER

         The petition is allowed.
