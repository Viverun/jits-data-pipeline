that "death in this case was due to Aluminium-
Phosphide poisoning" and that the said "poisoning can
occur..... through injection of the compound in solution
form" and the said opinion had been brought on record
after furnishing a copy to the respondents, yet the same
was not taken into consideration by the Trial Court.

14. While it is true that the opinions of Dr. Amit
Sharma (PW-12) and Dr. Amandeep Kaur are advisory
and contradictory, yet the Trial Court should have
examined both the opinions and given reasons as to
why it was accepting one opinion and rejecting the
other.

15. Further, this Court is of the view that in the present
appeal, it cannot examine as to whether the opinion of
Dr. Amandeep Kaur is contrary to medical texts as
firstly the said submission has not been examined by
the Trial Court. Moreover, as no alternate charge
under
Section 302
IPC had been framed, this Court if
it were to reject the submission of learned counsel for
respondents, would not be able to carry the matter to
its legal conclusion.

16. Consequently, this Court in exercise of its power
under
Section 464(2)
of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (hereinafter referred to as "
Cr.P.C
").
remands the case back to the Trial Court as there has
been an omission on the part of Trial Court to frame
charge and such omission has resulted in failure of
justice.

17. Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside
and the matter is remanded back to the Trial Court for
framing of an alternate charge under
Section 302
IPC
against the accused persons. The accused persons will
be given an opportunity to cross-examine Dr.
Amandeep Kaur and to lead additional evidence in
defence, if they so desire. The statement of the accused
under
Section 313
Cr. P.C. shall also be recorded
afresh."

ALTERNATE CHARGE

39. On 27.03.21, Alternate charge

against all the three accused persons to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE

40. Dr. Amandeep Kaur, Professor, Department of Forensic
Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok
Nayak Hospital was examined as PW-21, cross examined
by the Ld. Counsel for accused persons. The evidence of
PW-21 is reproduced below:

"ON SA.

On 10/08/2016, I was posted as Assistant Professor at
Department of Forensic Medicine Maulana Azad
Medical College & Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi.
On that day an application was moved by SI Mohit
Malik PS Prashad Nagar Delhi seeking clarification in
respect of skin samples preserved in case FIR No.
126/2008 PS Prashad Nagar and put forward few
queries on which a subsequent opinion vide No.
FM/XII/(MLW)/10/OPN/Yr of PM 2008/ OPN/118
dated 12/08/2016 which is exhibited as
Ex.PW21/A(running into 3 pages) bearing my
signatures at points A on each page, was given by me
as follows.

Q-1. What is the purpose of keeping skin samples
during the postmortem of deceased?

Ans. The skin samples are preserved from the alleged
site of insect bite for analysis of insect toxins.

Q-2. If the purpose of keeping skin samples during the
postmortem of deceased to rule out the insect bite then
it is requested that please provide the address of
laboratory where the skin sample will be sent for
expert opinion?

Ans. The samples are sent for chemical analysis to
FSL/CFSL where the facility to assess such toxin is
available. If not, FSL/CFSL may be contacted for
further guidance regarding this matter.

Q-3. During the FSL examination of other two samples
i.e. blood and viscera, FSL Rohini opined that
aluminum phosphide is found in the body of the

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar

deceased. Kindly opine whether the above mentioned
poison is taken orally or otherwise, also you are
requested to please opined whether any insect bite can
cause the above mentioned poison i.e. aluminum
phosphide.

Ans. The commonest route of poisoning in case of
aluminum phosphide is through ingestion of the
compound in the form of tablets/powder/solution
which is easily available. However, poisoning can
occur through inhalation of vapours or through
injection of the compound in solution form. Insect bite
does not cause aluminum phosphide poisoning.

Q-4. Is it necessary to obtain expert opinion of skin
samples when the other samples opined as aluminum
phosphide?

Ans. As a cause of death has already been opined as
aluminum phosphide poisoning in the subsequent
opinion. Further analysis of skin sample is not
required.

XXXXXX by Sh. Kishore Kumar, ld. Counsel for all
accused persons.

"I have no personal knowledge about this case. I was
not the head of the department at the that time when I
had given the opinion Ex.PW21/A. I was posted as
Assistant professor in the department of Forensic
Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok
Nayak Hospital, Delhi.

Q. Under which capacity you have given this
opinion to the police?

Ans. I was authorized by my HOD.

Q. Do you have any such authorization letter to
give said opinion?

Ans. I do not have any such authorization at present
and even in the Court file and the same may be called
from the record.

It is wrong to suggest that I was not authorized by the
HOD to give opinion Ex.PW21/A or that I myself gave
the opinion to SI Mohit Malik as per his convenient.

I am doctor of medicine (MD) in Forensic Medicine. I
did not conduct any research in the chemicals i.e.

hazardous chemical, poison or other chemical even
used in the farming or in other fields. I did not conduct
research in respect of aluminium phosphide(ALP).
Vol., we in forensic medicine do see cases / conduct
postmortems which subsequently have been alleged to
die of aluminium phosphide (ALP) or thereafter
confirmed by forensic science laboratory report. I do
not have any knowledge in respect of aluminium
phosphide. I rely upon the encyclopedia, my seniors
research and their books, scientific literatures etc. in
respect of ALP. It is correct that acute aluminium
phosphide poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning;
mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent
commonly accidental and rarely homicidal. It is
correct that ALP used as rodenticide, weedicide or
pesticide in grain, wheat, rice etc. in tablets form.
ALP is available in only powder and tablet forms.
It is correct that ALP used in fumigant and oral
pesticide. It is correct that if ALP comes in contact
with water or moisture in air, it releases phosphine gas
which vaporises in air. It is correct that after release of
phosphine gas, the residue powder is harmless. It is
also correct that on coming to contact with moisture
present in air (or with HCL or and water in the
stomach), ALP liberates phosphine leaving behind
aluminium hydroxide(or chloride) which is harmless
and non toxic. The contents of the textbook of Forensic
Medicine and Toxicology are correct which is written
by Dr. Anil Aggarwal (retired Director Professor). He
was my senior. I have seen the book today in the Court.
It is correct that commonly the ALP cannot be given by
force homicidally as it emits very bad smell like rotten
fish and garlic. As far as I know the absorption of ALP
through intact skin is rare, hence, if it causes burning
on the skin (by ALP or phosphine) is not known to me.
I cannot say regarding the mode of intake of ALP in
this case if it was ingested, injected or inhaled. I know
Dr. Amit Sharma. Dr. Amit Sharma is senior and
expert. I have seen the postmortem report and opinion
given by Dr. Amit Sharma. The deceased Bhavna had
taken ALP orally in the present case as per the FSL
report already Ex.PW-7/C. Any tablet / poison tablet
when taken orally do appear in blood either by
absorption or after metabolism. It is wrong to suggest
that I gave my opinion to the police at the instance of
the IO and complainant. It is wrong to suggest that I
am deposing falsely."

EXAMINATION UNDER SECTION 313 CR. P.C. AFRESH

41. Thereafter, the accused persons were examined afresh
u/s. 313 Cr. P.C. and they opted to lead evidence in their
defence but did not led any further defence evidence and
the case was listed for final arguments.

FINAL ARGUMENTS

42. Ld. Addl. PP for the State argued that the prosecution has
proved its case against the accused persons beyond
reasonable doubt. It is argued that the accused persons
misled the doctors by informing that the deceased was
bitten by the insect, however, the postmortem report and
subsequent FSL result reveal that the deceased had
expired due to poisoning. It is argued that the burden was
upon the accused persons to prove as to how the deceased
had expired. It is further argued that the accused persons
have caused disappearance of evidence as they have
cleaned the vomiting of the deceased from the place of
incident. It is argued that the deceased had died
unnaturally under suspicious circumstances and the cause
of death is confirmed due to poisoning. It is argued that
there is no evidence on record that the poison was
consumed by the deceased herself and the circumstances
point towards the guilt of the accused persons. It is
therefore, prayed that the accused persons may be
convicted for the offences charged against them.

43. Ld. Counsel for the accused persons has filed written
submissions and it is argued that the present FIR was
registered on the complaint of the mother of the deceased
Bhawna against the accused persons (husband and
brothers-in-laws of the deceased) u/s. 498A/304 B/201/34

IPC
and after thorough investigation, the prosecution had
filed charge-sheet against the accused persons and
produced 21 witnesses. He further stated that the accused
persons also led 7 witnesses in their defence. It is further
argued that on the basis of entire evidences and materials
on record, the accused persons were acquitted by the ld.
Predecessor of this Court vide judgment dated
13.08.2018. It is further argued that after the remand back
of the case by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi, the
prosecution produced Dr. Amandeep Kaur as PW-21 and
even she has not supported the prosecution's case. She
corroborated the version of PW-12 Dr. Amit Sharma
(who conducted PM of deceased). It is argued that PW-12
stated that "as there were no evidence of any sign of
struggle, injury mark in this case therefore deceased
possibly taken the tablet/poison herself".
It is argued that
both above important witnesses stated that "ALP is
available in Tablet and Powder form and same cannot be
given via injection". It is argued that Bhawna was
conscious and she herself told the witnesses that some
insect has bitten on her arm. It is argued that there were
no marks of struggle on body of deceased. It is argued
that even the star/prime/complainant and independent

, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34

witnesses stated that Bhawna and Bhaskar loved each
other and they were living happily. It is argued that they
were living separately having their own mess from other
family members. It is argued that accused Praveen and
Bhupender were living separately from deceased and
Bhaskar and hence, they have no concern and
interference in the family of the deceased. It is argued
that there was no demand of dowry, harassment, cruelty
by accused and his family. It is argued that Bhawna never
made any complaint in respect to demand of dowry,
harassment and cruelty to police, authority and her family
members and the accused never received any dowry or
any thing from the side of the deceased. It is argued that
Bhawana was suffering from lower abdomen pain and
Gyane problem since long time and she was undergoing
treatment for her problems from various hospitals. It is
argued that she loved the children and wanted to get a
child from her womb. It is argued that she had suffered
miscarriages and due to above, she was under stress and
depression. It is argued that Bhaskar used to provide
treatment for Bhawna so that she could deliver healthy
child and does not suffer pain. It is argued that whenever
she used to suffer any medical problem, Bhaskar used to
take her to the doctor and hospital for treatment. It is
argued that no incriminating material was found and
accused persons cooperated during the investigation and
they joined investigation.

It is argued that the accused
were at their work at the time of incident and they were

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34

called by the family members and even the family
members also called relatives of deceased and after
reaching at home, immediately, Bhasker (husband) took
and got admitted the deceased in the best hospital of
Delhi/India for her treatment and relatives of both side
and neighbors were present in the hospital and cremation
ground. It is argued that the dead body of deceased-wife
was handed over to her husband (Bhaskar) and he
performed the last rituals of deceased in the presence of
complainant, both relatives and neighbors. It is argued
that till then there was no complaint from the side of
complainant against accused persons. It is argued that
there was no motive or intention to kill the deceased
because there was no complaint whatsoever against
accused as they loved each other and living happily and
her husband performed all his duties as an ideal husband
towards deceased. It is argued that there was no struggle
mark on the body of the deceased. It is argued that PW-17
Smt. Meena (sister of deceased) already stated that "I
have deposed against accused before the court and police
at the instance of my mother, brother, police and also
being a sister of Bhawna" and it is also on record that she
is mentally ill.

It is argued that during the present trial,
the complainant (mother of the deceased) i.e. plaintiff had
also filed a civil suit for recovery of Stridhan of the
deceased against the accused no. l i.e defendant on the
similar facts and incidents which was dismissed by the
court of Ms. Harshita Vatsayan Ld. CJ (Central), THC,

Delhi vide order dated 19.02.2018 on the merits and
thereafter, complainant filed an appeal bearing no. RCA
no. 63/18. The ld. Appellant Court of Dr. Rakesh Kumar,
ADJ-03, (Central), THC, Delhi upheld the decision of the
ld. Civil Judge, Delhi and dismissed the same on merits
vide judgment dated 05.12.2022 holding that "I am clear
view that the plaintiff has falsely stated the facts
regarding cause of action having been arisen in her
favour to institute the present suit as admittedly, she had
never made any demand to return the Stridhan or even
had not met the defendant. Therefore, there existed no
cause of action. In light of evidence, the bills relied
appears to be fake. The plaintiff has also failed to prove
the allegations made by her regarding cruelty and
harassment committed by the defendant and his family
members against her daughter. She has also miserably
failed to prove any such demand". It is argued that in the
said civil suit, the complainant had leveled the similar
allegations and facts as of the case before this ld. Court. It
is further argued that the accused persons are innocent. It
is further argued that the deceased was suffering from
said illness since long time and due to this, she was under

stress and depression and Bhaskar (husband) being an
ideal husband performed his duties and also was
providing best treatments from various hospitals. It is
further argued that he loved her deceased wife very much
and they were living happily and separately from the
other accused and hence, other accused had no concern or

interference in their family life. It is further argued that
the complainant also made false and fabricated
allegations against mother-in-law of deceased who was
already admitted in Safdarjung Hospital even prior to
incident. It is further argued that all alleged
incidents/facts of the story of prosecution are also false,
fabricated and after-thought, as the complainant herself
admitted that she never visited at the matrimonial home
of her daughter and accused never demanded dowry and
the deceased never made any complaint in respect to
demand of dowry, cruelty and harassment even before her
death. It is further argued that the all accused persons
were not present on the spot at the time of incident and
they were called by family members when the deceased
suffered ill and they also took her to the best hospital with
her family members. It is further argued that no
incriminating material was found from the spot or from
the accused persons. It is further argued that the accused
persons cooperated with investigation and there was no
reason for causing death of the deceased by the accused
persons due to dowry demand or harassment soon before
death. It is further argued that the prosecution has failed
to prove any motive or intention to kill the deceased.

It is
further argued that after remanding back, except PW-21,
(who has also not supported the prosecution's case) the
prosecution has not produced any other evidence/witness
and material against the accused persons and on the basis
of evidences/witnesses and materials on record, the

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34

accused persons have already been acquitted by the ld.
Predecessor of this Court. It is further argued that there is
no allegation of 406
IPC
in the present case and there was
no cruelty, harassment and demand of dowry by the
accused at any time. It is further argued that there are no
ingredients/facts/material in the present case to show that
soon before her death, Bhawna was subjected to cruelty
or harassment by her husband or any relatives of her
husband for or in connection with, any demand of dowry.
It is further argued that the prosecution has failed to
establish his case beyond reasonable doubts and the
accused persons have already rebutted the presumption
u/s. 304-B and 113-B
IPC
and hence,
Sec. 304
B, 201,

are not made out against the accused. It is
further argued that the prosecution has also failed to give
any cogent and material evidence against the accused
persons who have been charged
u/s. 302
IPC. Therefore,
it is respectfully prayed that the accused persons may
kindly be acquitted in the present case from all false and
fabricated allegations in the interest of justice. Ld.

44. Ld. Counsel for complainant has also filed written
submissions. He stated that at the outset, it is brought to
kind consideration of this court that the instant case was
never tried in its true perspective, owing to the failure of
justice. It is further argued that the Hon'ble High Court of
Delhi set aside the Judgment passed by the Ld.
predecessor of this Court vide order dated 13/08/2018 by
which it had acquitted all the accused
u/s. 498A
/
304 B
/
IPC on the ground that none of the sections under
which charges had been framed against them for the
death of Ms. Bhawna @ Pinky and remanded it back vide
its order dated 13/01/2020 to frame alternate charge
under
u/s. 302
IPC and accused persons were given
opportunity to examine Dr. Amandeep Kaur who had
opined contradictory to PW-12 Dr Amit Sharma. It is
further argued that the Hon'ble High court also observed
in Para 18 of its judgment that all the contentions of all
parties are left open. It is humbly submitted that in the
light of the observations of Hon'ble High court, the
complainant is submitting what was not considered by the
Ld predecessor Court which resulted into failure of
justice in the instant case. It is further humbly submitted
that the family members of the accused were made
witnesses in the instant case and their submissions alludes
towards hiding of facts relevant to determine the instant
case. It is further argued that their submissions are
untrustworthy vis-a-vis medical and other facts which

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
30 of 73
established that the death of the deceased Bhawna
happened under mysterious situations and the accused
persons never explained the facts relevant to her death. It
is further argued that they concocted a story of insect bite
and made the relevant evidence i.e vomiting disappear
and mislead the entire trial resulting into failure of justice
in the instant case. It is further argued that the deceased
Bhawna was married to accused Bhaskar on 08/02/2006
as per Hindu rituals and she expired in the seven years of
marriage in her matrimonial home under unnatural
circumstances. It is further argued that she was poisoned
by the accused persons and a false and cooked up story of
insect bite was created to cover their culpable criminal
act of murdering a human being. It is further argued that
that the deceased was admitted to Ganga Ram Hospital at
3:30 PM on 10/07/2008 by accused No. 1 as per MLC
which records the fact that the deceased Bhawna was
brought by accused no.1 to Ganga Ram hospital with the
complaint that insect bite over (R) forearm at 11.00 AM
at his residence 16/835 E Bapa Nagar, Padam Singh
Road, Karol Bagh Delhi. MLC also records the fact that
the patient (deceased Bhawna) was not fit for statement.

It is further argued that in Post Mortem Examination
Report (Department of Forensic Medicine, Maulana Azad
Medical College), it is clearly mentioned at para (v) that
the deceased Bhawna was admitted to Ganga Ram
Hospital with alleged history of being bitten by insect on
10/07/08 at about 11 AM at home and she was taken to

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
31 of 73
Ganga Ram Hospital at 3 PM on 10/07/08 where she
expired at 3: 40 AM on 11/07/08. It is humbly submitted
that the accused persons delayed her admission to
hospital deliberately so that she could not be given proper
and right treatment. It is further argued that at para (ix) in
external examination, Dr. Amit Sharma has mentioned
that contusion present over right arm before right elbow
and venepuncture wound (query Insect Bite or injection
mark) was found present in the middle of the contusion.
It is further argued that the subcutaneous tissues and
muscle underneath the injury shows extraction of blood.
It is further argued that that Ex. PW-7/C the viscera
Report/ FSL report mentioned that Aluminium Phosphide
was detected in Stomach and Intestine of the deceased
Bhawan, hence, the cause of death was poisoning by
ALP. It is further argued that the Death Certificate of
Ganga Ram Hospital under the signature of Resident
Doctor Amit Madaan on 11/07/2008 mentions cause of
death as Insect Bite/ Unknown/Poisoning. It is further
argued that that Death Report- Unnatural Death by
poisoning (Inquest Report) mentions that the deceased
was in good health, not suffering from any disease, not
taken any medicine, taken Bread and Tea between 10:30
AM and 1:30 PM on 10/07/08 at the commencement of
symptom. It is further argued that the deceased started
vomiting as first symptom and she was sensible in the
intervals of the convulsions.

It is further argued that the
medical evidence clearly established that the deceased

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
32 of 73
Bhawna was administered poison and a concocted story
of Insect Bite was created to cover up the murder by the
accused persons. It is further argued that that the story
cooked up by the accused persons is revealed in their
statements/examinations before the Court. It is further
argued that in PMR, it has been found that a condition of
stomach hemorrhage congesting the whole stomach
which goes on to cook and scientifically prove that there
would have been heavy vomiting replete with blood. It is
further argued that the accused did not help in fair
investigation and made these evidences disappear. It is
further argued that when the visible reactions and
symptoms of the poisoning by ALP subsided only then
the accused persons took the victim to hospital for any
medical treatment under a conspiracy to hide the murder
and created a false story of insect bite which has been
falsified by the fact that the victim was subjected to
Aluminium Phoshide poisoning. It is further argued that
that the prosecution had to rely on the statement of family
members of the accused persons who deposed only to
save the skin of the accused persons and lied before the
Court about the time, cause of death, vomiting fouls
smell and other relevant with be read vis-a-vis statement
of PW-14 Dev Shankar and PW-17 Meena who deposed
before PW-18 Inspector Harish Kumar that they had seen
vomiting and PW-17 was very clear that foul smell was
coming out of the room where the deceased was kept and
from her clothes.

It is further argued that the submissions

PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC

of PW-13, PW-15, PW-16 may be read vis-a-vis the
medical facts and submissions of PW-14, PW-17, PW-18
and PW-19 to cull out the truth and real facts. It is
humbly submitted that it has also come on record that all
the accused persons came to the spot within 15 minutes in
the congested gali which is not motorable. It is further
argued that these facts go on to prove that the accused
persons were present on the spot. It is further argued that
that PW-14 and PW-17 proved beyond unreasonable
doubt that the deceased did not make any submission
with regard to the insect bite only she indicated towards
her forearm where the wound was present which even
PW-12 has found out that it needed enquiry whether it is
insect bite or injection mark. It is further argued that that
the submissions of PW-12 and PW-21 both doctors went
on to prove that the death of Bhawna is due to the
poisoning (ALP herein ) and PW-21 has established that
it cannot be caused by insect bite. It is further argued that
PW-12 only opined that ALP is easily available in market
and as there was no sign of struggle, injury mark
deceased possibly has taken the poison herself. It is
further argued that such opinion was unwarranted as he
himself found the injury on the right arm in the nature of
injection or insect bite he was not sure hence, his opinion
with regard to suicide which is merely advisory is not to
be relied upon in the instant case.

It is further argued that
PW-21 had opined that the commonest route of poisoning
in ALP case through ingestion of the compound in the

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.

, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
34 of 73
form of Tablets/Powder/solution which is easily available
and poisoning can occur through inhalation of vapours or
through injection of the compound in solution form. It is
further argued that insect bite does not cause ALP
poisoning. It is further argued that the deposition of PW-
21 goes on to establish that the ALP is very pungent and
has reiterated the fact that she has seen FSL report PW-
7/C about which it has been opined by PW-12 that the
deceased had taken it orally. It is further argued that she
has gone to say that ALP poisoning is extremely lethal
mode of ingestion is usually suicidal, commonly
accidental and rarely homicidal. It is further argued that
she has gone to establish that when ALP will come into
contact with stomach water it will release Phosphine
leaving behind Aluminium hydroxide (or chloride) which
is non toxic. It is further argued that that it is humbly
submitted that the Phosphine gas is the reason of Pungent
foul smell of 20 ALP. It is further argued that the
submission of PW-21 may be read vis-a-vis the fact that
vomiting and foul smell was found at the spot which was
never let to come before the Court. It is further argued
that the accused persons flushed the most essential piece
of evidence for which only they are liable. It is further
argued that that the defence has tried to create a theory
that the deceased was suffering from depression as she
had given birth the still born and because of that
depression she committed suicide.

It is further argued that
this theory has been created to give a cover to their both

mens-rea and actus-reus. It is further argued that the
defence has not produced any documents which show
that the deceased was treated for depression. It is further
argued that all the documents are with regard to Lower
abdomen pain suffered by the deceased. It is further
argued that DW-1 and DW-2 cannot even identify the
signature of the doctors whose signature was there on the
documents, they cannot be relied upon. It is further
argued that DW-4 has submitted that the summoned
record was destroyed hence, it did not prove anything. It
is further argued that in their statement
u/s. 313
Cr. P.C.
the accused no.1 has admitted that he deliberately gave
false and fake address in the medical papers showing the
treatment of the deceased Bhawna. It is further argued
that in his statement, accused No.1 again tried to create a
theory that when he alongwith Meena and Bimla was
taking the deceased to Ganga Ram Hospital by auto/TSR,
Bhawna was conscious and she told them that she had
been bitten by some insect. It is further argued that he is
lying to save himself under the concocted theory of insect
bite which is falsified by the medical proofs. It is further
argued that the accused persons have not been able to
explain all the incriminating medical evidence and Ex.
PW-19/A and the submission of Inspector Harish Kumar
who punctured the theory of insect bite which is again
proved by Ex. PW-7/CFSL report whereby ALP was
found the reason and cause of death which cannot be due
to insect bite as per PW-21.

It is further argued that in a

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC

recent judgment Cr. Appeal no. 301/2015 titled Balvir
Singh vs state of Uttarakhand, the Hon'ble SC in para 29
has mentioned that "in such circumstances, the only
inference can be drawn is that the Aluminium Phosphide
either in liquid form or in the form of tablets was
procured by the accused husband and the same was
administered to the deceased" and the theory of suicide as
sought to be put forward on behalf of appellant/accused is
ruled out. It is further argued that in the instant case also,
the theory of suicide is ruled out by the facts and
circumstances and it gets proved that the the only
inference can be had that the accused persons procured
ALP and administered it to the deceased and created a
concocted theory of Insect Bite. It is thus prayed that the
accused persons be convicted for the alleged offences.

IPC.

d. That all the accused persons jointly and in furtherance

FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/
S.
498A
IPC

47. With reference to the first point, the prosecution was
required to establish the fact that there was a demand of
dowry and in furtherance thereof, deceased Bhawna was
subjected to cruelty. In this regard, it is important to
mention the essential components of
Section 498-A
IPC
which are as follows:

(i) That the perpetrator is the husband or relative
of the husband of a woman.

(ii) Such woman is subject to cruelty, which is:

(a) Any wilful conduct which is likely to drive
the woman to commit suicide or to cause
grave injury or danger to life, limb or health,
whether mental or physical.

(b) Harassment with a view to coerce her or any
person related to her to meet any unlawful
demand for any property or valuable security.

48.
Section 498-A
IPC was incorporated in the Act 1983 as a
response to
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
. Cruelty as

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
38 of 73
defined in this Section, consists of two Clauses as
mentioned above in point (ii) (a) and (ii) (b).
Section 498-
A
IPC postulates the wilful conduct on the part of
perpetrator. Mensrea is an essential ingredient of the
offence. Complainant, in order to substantiate her
averments has to prove that there was an unlawful
demand from husband or any of his relative.

49. Now, adverting to the facts of the present case, the most
important material public witnesses of the prosecution
with regard to the allegations of demand of dowry and
subjecting the deceased to cruelty are PW-2 Parvati Devi
(Mother of deceased), PW-3 Naresh Kumar (Elder
brother of deceased), PW-13 Indra (Neighbour of
deceased), PW-15 Daulat Ram (Brother in law of
deceased). This court shall now analyse the testimonies of
these witnesses to conclude whether the alleged offence
of
Section 498A
IPC is made out or not against the
accused persons.

50. PW-2 Parvati Devi (mother of deceased) in her testimony
mainly alleged that at the time of marriage all the house-
hold articles and jewellery were given to the accused
persons, but they were not satisfied. She further alleged
that the accused persons including the mother-in law
(since expired) used to torture, harass and pressurize the
deceased to bring money from her parents and as such,
the accused persons were demanding dowry. She also
alleged that she had given Rs.20,000/- on one occasion

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
39 of 73
and Rs.25,000/- on another occasion to the in-laws of her
deceased daughter. She also alleged that three days prior
to the death of her daughter, when she had gone to drop
her daughter to her in-laws' house, accused Bhaskar
quarrelled with them and threatened her.

51. Bare perusal of the examination-in-chief of PW-2 would
reveal that there are no specific averments with regard to
demand of dowry and subjecting the deceased Bhawna to
cruelty. During her cross-examination, PW-2 herself has
stated that accused Bhaskar loved his wife very much and
they were living happy married life. PW-2 has further
stated that since the day of marriage of her daughter
Bhawna with accused Bhaskar till her death, she never
made any complaint regarding demand of dowry, money,
articles, assault or harassment.

52. PW-3 Naresh Kumar (elder brother of deceased) in his
testimony mainly alleged that huge amount was spent on
the marriage of his sister with accused Bhaskar and
household articles given to her in-laws. He alleged that
after 6/7 months of her marriage, Bhawna's husband used
to torture her and she was not allowed to visit her
parental house. He alleged that accused Bhaskar used to
talk in a rude manner and did not allow her to call her
parents and that all the accused persons used to torture
her for less dowry. He alleged that his sister deceased
Bhawna told him that her husband Bhaskar, dewar
Praveen, jeth Bhupender and mother-in-law Krishna Devi

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
40 of 73
(since expired), used to torture, harass and pressurize her
to bring more money and dowry from her parents. He
alleged that on one occasion Rs.20,000/- was given and
on another occasion Rs.25,000/- was given to her in-laws
as pressurized by them alleging that they need this money
for purchasing goods / material for their shop / business.

53. During his cross-examination, PW-3 has stated that at the
time of marriage of his sister Bhawna, he was residing in
a tenanted house. PW-3 further admitted that his sister
was suffering from gynaecological problem and was
being treated at Lady Harding Hospital, AIIMS, Maharaja
Agarsen Hospital, Dr. Mrs. Kochhar Clinic etc. PW-3
also admitted that deceased Bhawna suffered two
miscarriages and had also delivered pre-mature child.
PW-3 also admitted that accused Bhaskar used to provide
treatment to deceased Bhawna so that she could deliver
healthy child and do not suffer pain. PW-3 further stated
that whenever deceased Bhawna used to suffer any
medical problem, accused Bhaskar used to take her to the
doctor. It has also been admitted by PW-3 that his sister
deceased Bhawna and accused Bhaskar used to love each
other a lot. It is further stated by PW-3 that deceased
Bhawna never made any complaint to the police, court or
any other authority regarding harassment or dowry
demand or beating. PW-3 also stated that last rites of
deceased Bhawna were done by her husband accused
Bhaskar and his family.

54. PW-2 and PW-3 who are mother and brother of deceased
Bhawna, are the vital public witnesses of prosecution and
their testimonies are crucial for determining the
culpability of the accused persons. A meticulous perusal
of their testimonies would reveal that they do not inspire
confidence of the Court. None of the duo alleged that at
the time of marriage, there was a demand of dowry. They
have also not claimed any articles given in dowry nor
there is any allegation of
Section 406
IPC against accused
persons. Both the witnesses have alleged two instances of
making payment of Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/- without
any specific details and documentary proof.

55. The other material witness PW-13 Smt. Indra who is
stated to be the neighbour of accused persons and
deceased Bhawna, has turned hostile and has not
supported the prosecution case. She stated that on the day
of incident, when she saw certain people gathering
outside the house of accused persons and she inquired
from Bhawna as to what has happened, to which Bhawna
herself stated that some insect had bitten her. PW-13 was
cross-examined by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State but of
no benefit to the prosecution. During cross-examination,
PW-13 stated that deceased Bhawna did not vomit in her
presence. Certain Court questions were also put to the
witness and in response to that, PW-13 stated that on the
day of incident deceased Bhawna was lying on bed on
ground floor and she was neither smeared with vomiting
nor was emitting any foul smell. In her cross-

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
42 of 73
examination by the accused persons, PW-13 stated that
when she had talked with deceased Bhawna, she was
conscious. PW-13 further stated that deceased Bhawna
used to talk with her frequently and used to say that she
was living in good condition in her matrimonial house.
PW-13 further stated that deceased Bhawna was residing
separately on the third floor with her husband. It is
further stated by PW-13 that she had not heard that any
demand for dowry was made or deceased Bhawna was
harassed or beaten up for dowry. PW-13 has categorically
stated that deceased Bhawna was living happily with her
husband Bhaskar.

56. The next witness PW-15 is Brother-in-law (Jija Ji) of
deceased Bhawna who stated in his cross-examination
that no demand of dowry was made in his presence.

57. To add further, the accused persons examined DW-1 from
AIIMS who produced the record pertaining to the
medical history and treatment of deceased Bhawna at
Gynae Department of AIIMS. DW-2 from Sardar Vallabh
Bhai Patel Hospital produced the medical documents
Mark B. DW-3 from Gynae Department, Lady Harding
Medical College produced the medical record pertaining
to deceased Bhawna for her treatment at Lady Harding
Medical College for gynae problem. DW-4 Record Clerk
from Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, Punjabi Bagh produced
medical record pertaining to the treatment of deceased
Bhawna related to gynae problem, at their hospital. All

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
43 of 73
these defence witnesses were cross-examined on behalf
of the State, however, no material contradiction has
emerged from their cross examination.

58. It is not in dispute that the deceased by suffering from
gynae problem for which she was under treatment at
several medical institutions. Further, DW-6 Vijay Kumari
stated that deceased Bhawna and accused Bhaskar were
living happily and lovingly, on the third floor of the
building having separate kitchen. She also deposed that
deceased Bhawna used to share her feelings with her and
she had never complained of any harassment, beatings or
maltreatment given by her husband and her in-laws on
account of dowry. She further stated that deceased
Bhawna was suffering from lower abdomen pain and
some gynae problem. DW-6 further stated that deceased
Bhawna also delivered immature infants twice at AIIMS
and thereafter, she was under depression and frustration.
DW-6 further stated that deceased Bhawna was under

treatment for above mentioned problem and accused
Bhaskar used to take her to the hospital regularly. She
deposed that deceased Bhawna was keen desirous to have
a child due to which she was under depression. DW-6
was cross examined on behalf of the State but no
contradiction emerged in her statement.

59. DW-7 Asha also stated that deceased Bhawna was
suffering from lower abdomen pain and gynae problem,
due to which deceased Bhawna went under depression

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
44 of 73
and was undergoing treatment for the same. She further
stated that accused Bhaskar used to love her and never
harass her or demanded any dowry. DW-7 was cross-
examined at length by the Ld. Addl. PP for the State but,
no material contradiction has emerged in her cross
examination.

60. Accused Bhaskar examined himself as DW-5 and stated
that deceased Bhawna was living happily with him. He
further stated that deceased Bhawna was suffering from
lower abdomen pain and gynae problem. She was being
treated from AIIMS, Maharaj Agrasen Hospital, Sardar
Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital, Dr. Mrs. Kochar and Lady
Harding Hospital. He further stated that deceased
Bhawna had delivered pre-mature infants at AIIMS and
thereafter, she was under depression and tension. He
further deposed that deceased Bhawna was given proper
medical treatment for her problem till her death.

61. It evinces from the aforementioned testimonies on record
that though the prosecution witnesses are alleging that
deceased Bhawna was treated badly and there was a
demand of dowry by the accused persons but to the
contrary, the defence witnesses including the accused
Bhaskar as DW-5 are alleging that there was no demand
of dowry and deceased Bhawna was treated properly and
was also given proper medical treatment and was not
subjected to cruelty. From the testimonies of prosecution
witnesses, two instances of demand of Rs.20,000/- and

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
45 of 73
Rs.25,000/- are coming out but there is no other instance
of giving any cash or any article by the parents or brother
of deceased Bhawna to any of the accused persons. It is
needless to mention that mere allegations of demand of
dowry would not suffice in themselves. These allegations
have to be much more than mere averments itself. The
burden to prove the specific allegation of demand of
dowry is upon the prosecution and it was for the
prosecution to prove the facts that dowry was demanded.
The obligation was upon the prosecution to prove specific
instances beyond one or two casual instances of payment,
which should be put forward in the form of evidence,
which is absent in the present case

62. Though PW-2 and PW-3 have alleged that there was a
demand of dowry however, they are not citing any
specific incident except payment of money on two
occasions. They themselves have stated that this money
was given to the accused persons for their necessity as
they had to do some business out of the said money. The
defence witnesses and even the prosecution witnesses
have deposed that deceased Bhawna used to love her
husband and her husband was providing medical
treatment to her. None of the PWs have disputed the fact
that deceased Bhawna was being treated at various
hospitals by her husband. It is not the case of prosecution
that all the medical expenses of deceased Bhawna or her
day to day household expenses occasionally, frequently
or regularly were borne by the family of deceased and not

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
46 of 73
by the husband. None of prosecution witnesses have
deposed that the expenses of treatment of deceased were
not borne by her husband.

63. It is also not the case of prosecution that at the time of
marriage, there was any demand of dowry or any dowry
in the form of cash and jewellery etc. was given. There
are no allegations of
Section 406
IPC against the accused
persons.

64. The testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 are nothing but oral
evidence which could not be substantiated or
corroborated by any concrete evidence. PW-2, PW-3 and
PW-13 have deposed that accused Bhaskar and deceased
Bhawna used to love each other. PW-16 and PW-17 have
also deposed similar facts.

65. Therefore, the testimonies of complainant and other
prosecution witnesses cannot be said to qualify any of the
essential ingredients of
Section 498-A
IPC. In different
words, the testimonies of prosecution witnesses are
insufficient to substantiate the allegations of dowry
demand and subjecting the deceased to cruelty. Thus, the
charge of
Section 498A
/
IPC does not stand proved
against the accused persons.

304B. Dowry Death.

(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any
burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under
normal circumstances within seven years of her
marriage and it is shown that soon before her death
she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her
husband or any relative of her husband for, or in
connection with,any demand for dowry, such death
shall be called "dowry death", and such husband or
relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.

Explanation--- For the purpose of this sub-section,
"dowry" shall have the same meaning as in
section 2

of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961).

(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished
with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less
than seven years but which may extend to
imprisonment for life.

67. The following are the essential ingredients for
establishing the offence punishable
u/s 304B
IPC:

(a) That there is a demand of dowry and harassment by
the accused.

(b) That the deceased died.

(c) That the death is under unnatural circumstances.

(d) That the death has taken place within 7 years of
marriage.

(e) That it should also be shown that soon before her
death that she was subjected to cruelty or harassment
by husband or a relative of husband.

(f) That such harassment or cruelty should pertain to
demand for dowry.

68. At the outset, it is important to mention that
Section 304B

IPC is a special provision which was inserted by the
amendment in 1986 to deal with cases of dowry death. It

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC

applies to all cases where the death occurs otherwise than
under normal circumstances. If other conditions are
satisfied, when the deceased committed suicide, still the
death comes within the scope of
Section 304B
IPC.

69.
Section 304B
IPC has proximate nexus with
section 113A

and
113B
Indian Evidence Act which lays down the
presumption in such cases where death of a married
woman occurs otherwise than under normal
circumstances within 7 years of her marriage.

70.
Section 113A
and
113B
of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
reads as under:-

113A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a
married woman.

When the question is whether the commission of suicide
by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any
relative or her husband and it is shown that she had
committed suicide within a period of seven years from
the date of her marriage and that her husband or such
relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the
Court may presume, having regard to all the other
circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been
abetted by her husband or by such relative of her
husband.

Explanation.--- For the purposes of this section,
"cruelty" shall have the same meaning as in
section
498A
of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1960).

113B. Presumption as to dowry death.

When the question is whether a person has committed
the dowry death of a woman and it is shown that soon
before her death such woman has been subjected by
such person to cruelty or harassment for, or in
connection with, any demand for dowry, the Court shall
presume that such person had caused the dowry death.

IPC

"dowry death" shall have the same meaning as
insection 304B of the
Indian Penal Code
(45 of 1960).

71. In GV Sidaramesh Vs State of Karnataka, [(2010) 3
SCC 152], it was held that there must be material to show
that soon before the death of woman, such woman was
subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection
with demand of dowry, then only a presumption can be
drawn that a person has committed the dowry death of a
woman.

72. It was further held in
Kailash Vs State of MP
, [AIR 2007
SC 107], that the words 'soon before' in
section 113B

Evidence Act cannot be limited by fixing time limit. It is
left to be determined by the courts, depending upon the
facts and circumstances of the case.

73.
In
C.Veerudu Vs State of AP
, [1989 CRLJ(NOC) 52
(AP)], it was held in that so far as presumption under

section 113A
Evidence Act is concerned, unless the
offence
u/s 498A
IPC is established, no presumption can
be invoked.

74. From the above-mentioned precedents, it is clear that the
death must be within seven years of marriage and it
should be as a result of cruelty soon before her death and
such cruelty should be related the dowry. In the present
case, the prosecution has not been able to establish that
there was a demand of dowry and the offence under

Section 498-A
IPC has been committed.
In such
circumstances, the judgment
C Veerudu
(supra) applies

with full force and vigour.

75. Now, adverting back to the facts of the present case,
PW-2 Smt. Parvati (mother of deceased) is the star
witness of the prosecution. With regard to the cruelty
soon before death or any other cruelty, it is conspicuous
that PW-2 has not thrown much light in her entire
examination-in-chief. There are only two instances
regarding demand of dowry and cruelty as alleged by
PW-2 in her examination-in-chief. She has stated that she
gave Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/- to the accused persons
and when she had gone alongwith her daughter to her
in-laws house to drop her there, accused Bhaskar
quarrelled with them and also threatened her by saying
that "mai teri aankh phor donga". Besides these facts, no
other incident has been deposed with regard to the cruelty
or harassment of deceased Bhawna, soon before her death
or at any point of time.

76. During her cross-examination, PW-2 has stated that the
last rites of deceased Bhawna were performed by her in-
laws. She also stated that no complaint was ever lodged
with the police at any point of time before the death of
deceased Bhawna. PW-2 has also admitted that deceased
Bhawna was suffering from gynae problem and was
treated in that regard by her husband accused Bhaskar.
PW-2 during her cross examination categorically stated
that accused Bhaskar loved his wife very much and they
were living happy married life.

77. If the evidence of PW-2 is to be considered as it is, it does
not prove the essential ingredients of
Section 304B
IPC.
In other words, testimony of PW-2 is not sufficient to
bring the case of prosecution within the realm of
Section
304B
/
IPC.

78. Coming to the testimony of PW-3 Naresh Kumar, he is
the brother of deceased Bhawna and is a material witness.
His testimony is most important for proving the story of
prosecution. He stated that after the marriage of his sister
deceased Bhawna, she was tortured by her husband for
dowry, but no specific instance has been deposed by him.
He has not disclosed as to how this fact came into his
knowledge. He has not deposed whether he was witness
to any such incident or someone else had told him.
PW-3
has clarified in this regard that his sister deceased
Bhawna used to tell him that her husband, dewar
Praveen, jeth Bhupender and mother-in-law (since
expired) used to torture and harass her, but no details
have been furnished by PW-3 as to when any such
incident has happened. With regard to payment of
Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/-, it is stated by PW-3 that it
was given to deceased Bhawna for the reason that it was
needed for purchasing of goods/material for their
business/ shop. In cross examination, PW-3 stated that he
suspects that his sister deceased Bhawna has been killed
by accused persons. No specific detail or basis for such
belief has been explained by PW-3 as to how he has
reason to believe that it was accused persons who had

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
52 of 73
killed his sister deceased Bhawna.

79. With regard to allegations qua 'cruelty soon before death',
PW-3 stated that deceased Bhawna was suffering from
gynae problem however, accused Bhaskar used to provide
treatment to her. He also stated that accused Bhaskar and
deceased Bhawna used to love each other. He also
admitted that no complaint was ever lodged to the police,
court or any other authority qua dowry demand,
harassment or beating. It is apparent that testimony of
PW-3 also does not suffice for attracting
Section 304B
/
IPC against accused persons.

80. The next important public witness examined by the
prosecution is PW-13 Smt. Indra. She did not support the
story of prosecution and stated that deceased Bhawna told
her that some insect had bitten her. PW-13 further stated
that deceased Bhawna did not vomit in her presence and
when she saw deceased Bhawna on the day of incident,
she was not smeared with vomiting nor there was any
foul smell coming from her clothes.

81. PW-15 Daulat Ram (brother-in-law of deceased) was the
one who reached at the spot in question on 10.07.2008
and saw that Bhawna was lying unconscious and upon
inquiry, in-laws' of deceased Bhawna told that some
insect bite on her arms. PW-15 also reached at Ganga
Ram hospital on same day. Deceased Bhawna was in
emergency ward of Ganga Ram hospital when PW-15
made a call to the mother of deceased Bhawna about the

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
53 of 73
incident. It is stated by PW-15 that he came to know
about the death of Bhawna on the next day. PW-15 in his
cross-examination has stated that his wife Smt. Meena,
sister of deceased Bhawna was not mentally fit. PW-15
corroborated the fact that Bhawna (since deceased)
delivered two dead infants at AIIMS. PW-15
categorically stated that no demand of dowry was made
in his presence. Thus, testimony of PW-15 is also of no
benefit to the prosecution for the allegations regarding
304B/34
IPC
against accused persons.

82. PW-16 Smt. Bimla (Sister-in-law (Devrani) of deceased,
is again a material witness who is stated to be residing in
the same house at ground floor. She stated that on he day
of incident at around 1:00 pm, she saw her sister-in-law
Asha had gone to roof for drying the clothes. She also
saw that Bhawna was lying on bed. Asha called her and
said that Bhawna was not well. She has stated that
Bhawna told her that one insect bit her on the right arm in
the bathroom while she was taking the bath. Thereafter,
Bhaskar, Praveen and Raj Kumar were called.
One doctor
was also called who said that Bhawna got food poisoning
and advised her to shift to Ganga Ram hospital. During
her cross-examination, PW-16 has stated that when she
reached in the room of Bhawna, she was conscious. She
further stated that Bhawna and Bhaskar used to live
happily and there was no complaint from her side against
the accused persons. She further stated that Bhawna was
disturbed as she had delivered two dead child and that she

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
54 of 73
was also being treated at AIIMS. There is nothing in the
testimony of PW-16 to support the allegations regarding
304B/34
IPC
against accused persons.

83. PW-17 Meena (sister of deceased) deposed that on the
day of incident, when she reached the house of Bhawna,
she saw that Bhawna was lying on bed and her hair were
wet and tied. She further stated that foul smell was
coming from the room and her clothes. One cloth in the
size of bandage was tied on her arm. Her husband came
after five minutes. When she inquired about the bandage
on the arm of Bhawna, one of the sister-in-law of
deceased Bhawna told that mosquito has bitten her.
During her cross examination, PW-17 stated that
deceased Bhawna had stated through her gestures that she
was given something by syringe. PW-17, however,
admitted that she is being treated for mental illness at
RML hospital. She has further stated that she has deposed
against the accused persons at the instance of her mother
and brother and also being sister of deceased Bhawna. By
admitting such fact, PW-17 has put her entire statement
under doubt.
She herself has suggested that she is
deposing at the instance of her mother, brother and being
sister of deceased Bhawna. Thus, she seems to be an
interested witness. Above all, she herself has admitted
that she is getting treatment for mental illness from RML
hospital for the last more than 5 years. Testimony of PW-
5 is does not substantiate nor it is reliable to prove the
allegations of offence

MEDICAL EVIDENCE

84. Now coming to the medical evidence, Dr. Vikas Sharma
had prepared the MLC of deceased Bhawna on the day of
incident when she was taken to Ganga Ram hospital,
however, he had left the services of the hospital. The
prosecution examined PW-10 Dr. Sanjay Solanki who
identified the handwriting and signature of Dr Vikas
Shrama on the MLC of deceased Bhawna Ex.PW10/A.
The MLC reflects the alleged history of insect bite and
further states that patient was not fit for statement and
referred to further department.

85. Another important witness examined with regard to
medical evidence is PW-5 Y.P. Malhotra, the Executive
Magistrate who conducted inquest of deceased Bhawna.
On 11/07/2008, he went to Ganga Ram Hospital and
recorded the statement of Bhaskar, Parveen, Smt. Parwati
(mother of deceased) and Naresh (brother of deceased).
He proved his inquest report as Ex.PW5/C.

86. Next crucial witness examined by prosecution is PW-12
Dr. Amit Sharma who had conducted the post-mortem on
the dead body of deceased Bhawna. PW-12 opined that
the cause of death was poisoning due to Aluminium
Phosphide and proved the Post-mortem report as
Ex.PW12/A. During cross examination, PW-12 stated
that most common mode of intake of Aluminium

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
56 of 73
Phosphide is through oral routes in the form of tablet
which are readily and easily available in open market. He
categorically stated that it will not act if given via
injection. He further stated that it is extremely difficult
and virtually impossible to give an adult and healthy
individual this tablet forcibly. He ruled out the possibility
of an struggle of injury mark upon the deceased alleging
that there was no evidence of any such sign.

87. PW-20 Jitender Kumar is the witness from FSL Rohini
who examined the blood sample etc pertaining to
deceased Bhawna and in his report Ex.PW7/C, he opined
that Ex.1A, Ex.1B, Ex.2B and Ex.2C were found
containing phosphide and Ex.2A was found containing
aluminium phosphide. No material contradiction has
emerged from the cross examination of this witness.

88. Apart from above, the remaining witnesses are police
officials including IO who have conducted the
investigation or remained apart thereof. It is important to
mention here that neither the incident nor any part thereof
has happened in the presence of any of the police officials
which is a matter of record. Investigating officers of the
case including other police officials have stated whatever
has been alleged by the other witnesses and as mentioned
in the charge-sheet which is not repeated here for the sake
of brevity.

89. Accused persons have also led their evidence in defence
and examined 7 witnesses to prove that the deceased was

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
57 of 73
suffering from gynae problems and was receiving
treatments from different hospitals viz. AIIMS, Sardar
Ballabh Bhai Patel hospital, Lady Harding Medical
College, Maharaja Agrasen hospital and to prove that
was under depression as she was unable to deliver a
child. From the medical evidence led in defence, it
evinces that the deceased had delivered immature, still
born child twice and she was having difficulty in
conceiving the child again due to which she was suffering
from depression.

90. From the careful perusal of the evidence on record, it is
apparent that the prosecution is not able to shift the
burden upon the accused that it were the accused persons
who subjected deceased Bhawna to cruelty soon before
her death and due to that she died. It is pertinent to
mention that the nature of cause of death of Bhawna is
not disputed. After considering the testimony of PW-12
Dr. Amit Sharma who conducted the post-mortem of
deceased and the testimony of PW-20 Jitender Kumar
from FSL, it transpires that poisonous substance i.e.
Aluminium Phosphide was found in her body. In other
words, the death of Bhawna was not natural for the
reason that the cause of death was due to poisonous
substance by the name of Aluminium Phosphide.

91. None of the prosecution witnesses, be it PW-2 Parvati
Devi or PW-3 Naresh Kumar or PW-16 Bimla or PW-17
Meena has stated anything in this regard that soon before

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
58 of 73
her death Bhawna was subjected to cruelty by the
accused persons. As concluded earlier, the testimonies of
the PWs do not even qualify the essential ingredients of

Section 498A
IPC itself. It is apparent that the IO during
the investigation has not been able to collect any concrete
evidence qua cruelty upon deceased Bhawna. In these
circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion
that the prosecution case has not crossed the threshold
required to raise the most basic and essential presumption
under
Section 113B
Evidence Act and thus, it has not
been able to establish the offence
u/s 304B
IPC against
the accused persons.

92. It is needless to say that
Section 113B
Evidence Act lays
down a presumption, however, there has to be some
sufficient and cogent material on which such presumption
is based. It has come on record that Bhawna (since
deceased) did not die naturally as some poisonous
substance by the name of Aluminium Phosphide was
found in her body which is the cause of her death. There
is nothing on record to suggest that the said poisonous
substance was administered to her by the accused
persons. This Court is of the opinion that the prosecution
has failed to prove the culpability of accused persons
beyond reasonable doubt that they had subjected Bhawna
to cruelty soon before her death and thereby caused her
death or that her death was caused due to their actions.

93. To recapitulate, the following position emerges after

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
59 of 73
consideration of evidence on record:

A) It is a matter of record that marriage of Bhawna
(since deceased) took place with accused Bhaskar in Feb
2006 and she had expired on 11.07.2008. The death is
therefore, within the seven years of her marriage. It is
also reflected from the record that the death is not natural
as per post-mortem report and the cause of her death is
due to poisoning by Aluminium Phosphide.

B) The allegations of demand of dowry are raised,
however, except payment of cash on two occasions i.e.
Rs.20,000/- and Rs.25,000/- there is no evidence
available on record. There is no specific details and no
documentary proof. Further, with regard to payment of
such cash, PW-2 and PW-3 have themselves stated that
accused persons demanded this money for their necessity
i.e. for their business purpose. If, this submission is
presumed to be correct, even then it is not leading to
conclusive demand of dowry by the accused persons.

C) None of the public witness has stated with certainty
that accused Bhaskar or other accused persons used to
torture the deceased or subject her to cruelty. To the
contrary, it has been said by all the public witnesses and
more particularly PW-2 Parvati Devi (mother of deceased
Bhawna) and PW-3 Naresh Kumar (brother of deceased
Bhawna) that accused Bhaskar and Bhawna (since
deceased) were living happily and lovingly.

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
60 of 73
D) With regard to cruelty, either with regard to
Section
498-A
IPC or
Section 304-B
IPC under the qualification
'soon before her death', none of the PWs have thrown
any light on this subject. It is not the case of prosecution
nor it is alleged by PW-2 and PW-3 that there was
demand of dowry at the time of marriage or thereafter.
They did not depose that dowry either in the form of cash
or jewellery was given, as per the requirement and
demand of accused persons. There is a difference
between gift given at the time of marriage and dowry.
The difference though, is a thin line difference, however,
is of great importance and entirely depend upon the
testimonies of prosecution witnesses. Testimonies of any
of the prosecution witnesses, in this regard, do not inspire
the confidence of this Court.

E) PW-13, PW-15, and PW-16 are the most important
witnesses who had seen the deceased just before her
death. None of these witnesses have said anything with
regard to any cruelty caused upon the deceased. To the
contrary, all these witnesses have stated that they were
told by deceased that some insect had bitten up on her
arm. PW-17 Meena (sister of deceased) deposed that
when she reached at the house of Bhawna (since
deceased), she was lying on bed and upon inquiry,
Bhawna (since deceased) herself had stated that some
mosquito had bitten her. None of these prosecution
witnesses have alleged that Bhawna (since deceased) had
stated that either something was injected into her or she

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC
61 of 73
was given some tablets orally against her wishes.

F) It has come on record that the death of Bhawna
(since deceased) was not natural and as per report from
FSL, poisonous substance by the name of Aluminium
Phosphide was found in her body. However, prosecution
has not been able to collect any evidence as to how such
poisonous substance went into the body of the deceased.
The possibility of any force or struggle or taking such
poisonous substance through injection has been ruled out
by PW-12 Dr. Amit Sharma.

G) PW-13 Smt. Indra (neighbour of accused persons
and deceased) stated that deceased used to share all her
feelings with her but she never complained against
accused persons that she was harassed or subjected to
cruelty.

H) No complaint is stated to has been lodged against
the accused persons either by Bhawna or by her parents
or brother at any point of time that accused persons used
to demand dowry or that she was subjected to cruelty or
harassment.

I) It is also reflected from the evidence on record that
Bhawna was having some gynae problem for which she
was being treated at various hospitals and clinic. It has
also not been disputed that Bhawna had given birth to
two still born premature children and as she was not able
to have any child, therefore, she was under some kind of

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC

depression.

94. In the light of aforementioned discussions, this Court is
of the considered opinion that prosecution has not been
able to establish the offence
u/s 304B
/
IPC against the
accused persons.

FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/S 201

IPC

95. Now coming to the charge
u/s. 201
/
IPC against
accused Bhaskar and Praveen, this offence depends upon
the prime offence under
Section 304-B
IPC. In other
words, concealing or removing the evidence by the
accused persons is always dependent upon and subject to
the commission of main substantive crime. As concluded
above, the evidence available on record is not sufficient
to establish that Bhawna (since deceased) died due to
cruelty which was soon before her death, by the accused
persons. With regard to
Section 201
IPC, though
prosecution has examined PW-14 Dev Shankar Singh and
PW-15 Daulat Ram who had come to the spot, however,
they have not stated with certainty that there was any
vomiting found spread on the spot. Only one witness i.e.
PW-17 Meena has stated that she had observed foul smell
coming from the room and the clothes of Bhawna,
however, she also did not see any vomiting on the floor or
at any other place. No other PW has stated anything in
this regard that he or she saw vomit at the place of
incident.

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC

96. PW-14 Dev Shankar Singh is an independent witness
who reached at the spot and had examined Bhawna. PW-
14 had also not seen anything either on the bed or at the
floor. PW-14 had stated that he saw some water on the
floor. If, the testimony of PW-14 is presumed to be
correct, even then it cannot be said with certainty that the
water found on the floor was there in order to wash the
vomiting. Thus, the testimonies of all the PWs available
on record are not sufficient to conclude any of the
essential ingredients of
Section 201
IPC. Thus, the
prosecution has failed to establish its case for the offence
under
Section 201
/
IPC against the accused persons.

FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFENCE U/S 302

IPC

97. The accused persons are alternatively charged
u/s. 302

IPC consequent to the observations of the Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi in the Judgment on appeal. Regarding the
allegations of murder of deceased by the accused persons,
it is pertinent to mention that there is no direct evidence.
Adverting to the circumstantial evidence, there is no
proof on record that the accused persons were present on
the spot when the alleged incident had taken place.

100. The statement of PW-2 Parvati Devi Ex PW2/A was
recorded by the IO wherein she raised that allegations of
harassment of deceased Bhawna and dowry demand and
causing of death of deceased by the accused persons. On
such statement of PW-2, the present FIR was registered.

101. As per prosecution story PW-16 Bimla (jethani of
deceased) was informed on 10.07.2008 by her devrani
Asha, about the ill health of the deceased Bhavna. PW-16
went to the deceased who told her that one insect had
bitten on her arm in the bathroom. After that accused
persons Bhaskar (husband of deceased), Praveen (jeth of
deceased) and Rajkumar were called. The sister and
brother in law of deceased were also called. One doctor
was also called.

102. The sister of deceased namely Meena (PW-17) on
receiving the said information, reached at the house of
her sister Bhawna and there, jethani of the deceased told

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34

her that mosquito had bitten her. In evidence, Meena
admitted that she has given statement to police wherein
she had stated that her sister Bhawna had told her that
some insect had bitten on her left arm.

103. PW-15 Daulat Ram (brother in law of deceased and
husband of PW-17) also on receiving information reached
at the house of deceased, where the deceased was found
unconscious and her in laws informed him that she was
bitten by some insect.

104. PW-14 Dev Shanker Singh was the assistant at the clinic
of Dr Rakesh Malhotra. He was asked by one person to
accompany him as the doctor has already left. He went to
the spot and found one female lying on bed and on
asking, she indicated towards her arm. The family
members present there told him that some insect had
bitten her. He advised them to take the patient
immediately to Ganga Ram Hospital.

105. The MLC Ex PW10/A of deceased reveals that she was
brought to Ganga Ram Hospital by her husband accused
Bhaskar at about 3.00 pm on 10.07.08 with the alleged
history of insect bite on 10.07.08 at around 11 am. She
was not fit for statement.

106. During treatment, the deceased Bhawna expired on
11.07.08 at about 3.30 am. Post-mortem was conducted
on the dead body of deceased vide PM report Ex PW12/A
and the opinion regarding cause of death was reserved for

FIR No. 126/2008
State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34
IPC

after the viscera chemical analysis, blood sample and soft
tissue report.

107. The FSL report Ex PW7/A revealed that stomach and
piece of small intestine was found to contain "Aluminium
Phosphide" and the blood, pieces of liver, spleen and
kidney were found to contain "Phosphide".

108. Vide subsequent opinion report Ex PW12/B, Dr Amit
Sharma opined regarding cause of death as follows:

"Answers to the query asked by IO :- Since it is clearly
mentioned in the viscera report that Aluminium
Phosphide was detected in stomach and intestines,
therefore it was taken orally. Poisoning by Aluminium
Phosphide is usually suicidal in manner."

109. Vide further report Ex PW12/DA, Dr Amit Sharma
responded to the queries posed by the IO as follows:

"Q-1 Whether Aluminium Phosphide can be given
through injection or tablet easily available in open
market?

Ans:- Most common mode of intake of Aluminium
Phosphide is through oral route in the form of tablets
of Aluminium Phosphide that are readily available in
the open market. It will not act if given via injection.

Q-2 Whether it can be given forcibly to anyone and
what is the status in this case?

Ans:- It is extremely difficult and virtually impossible to
given an adult healthy individual this tablet forcibly. As
there were no evidence of any any signs of struggle
injury marks in this case therefore the deceased
possibly taken the tablet herself.

Q-3 How much quantity of Aluminium Phosphide is
sufficient to cause death in human beings?

Ans:- One tablet of Aluminium Phosphide is fatal if
consumed by as person."

110. In the subsequent opinion/report dated 12.08.16 by Dr
Amandeep Kaur, Assistant Professor, Department of
Forensic Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and
Lok Nayak Hospital, stated as under:

"Ques.3. During the FSL examination of other two
samples i.e. blood and viscera, FSL, Rohini opined that
Aluminium Phosphide is found in the body of the
deceased. Kindly opine whether the above mentioned
poison is taken orally and otherwise. Also, you are
requested to please opine whether any insect bite can
cause the above mentioned poison, i.e. Aluminium
Phosphide.

Ans.3. The commonest route of poisoning in case of
Aluminium Phosphide is through ingestion of the
compound in the form of tablets/powder/solution which
is easily available. However, poisoning can occur
through inhalation of vapours or through injection of
the compound in solution form. Insect bite does not
cause Aluminium Phosphide poisoning."

111. Apparently, though Dr Amandeep Kaur opined that the
death in this case was due to Aluminium phosphide
poisoning but she also mentioned that "the said
poisoning can occur ...through injection of compound in
solution form".

112. Thus, the opinions of Dr Amit Sharma (PW-12) and Dr
Amandeep Kaur were prima-facie contradictory to each
other.
In this regard, Dr Amandeep Kaur was examined in
court as PW-21 and she proved has report as Ex.
PW21/A. She deposed that commonest route of poisoning
in case of aluminium phosphide is through ingestion of
compound in the form of tablets/powder/solution which
is easily available, however, poisoning can occur through
inhalation of vapours or through injection of the

compound in solution form. She deposed that insect bite
does not cause aluminium phosphide poisoning.

113. During cross examination, she admitted that she has no
personal knowledge about this case. She was not the head
of the department at the that time when she had given the
opinion Ex.PW21/A. She denied the suggestion that she
was not authorized by the HOD to give opinion
Ex.PW21/A or that she herself gave the opinion to SI
Mohit Malik as per her convenience. She stated that she
is doctor of medicine (MD) in Forensic Medicine and she
did not conduct any research in the chemicals i.e.
hazardous chemical, poison or other chemical even used
in the farming or in other fields and she did not conduct
research in respect of Aluminium Phosphide (ALP). She
voluntarily deposed that they in forensic medicine do see
cases/conduct postmortems which subsequently have
been alleged to die of Aluminium Phosphide (ALP) or
thereafter confirmed by forensic science laboratory
report.

114. PW-21 further stated that she does not have any
knowledge in respect of Aluminium Phosphide. She
stated that she relied upon the encyclopedia, her seniors
research and their books, scientific literatures etc. in
respect of ALP. She admitted that acute Aluminium
Phosphide poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning;
mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent commonly
accidental and rarely homicidal. She admitted that ALP is

used as rodenticide, weedicide or pesticide in grain,
wheat, rice etc. in tablets form and that ALP is available
in only powder and tablet forms. She admitted that if ALP
comes in contact with water or moisture in air, it releases
phosphine gas which vaporises in air. She admitted that
after release of phosphine gas, the residue powder is
harmless. She admitted that on coming to contact with
moisture present in air (or with HCL or and water in the
stomach), ALP liberates phosphine leaving behind
Aluminium Hydroxide (or chloride) which is harmless
and non toxic. She admitted that commonly, ALP cannot
be given by force homicidally as it emits very bad smell
like rotten fish and garlic. She further stated that as far as
she knew the absorption of ALP through intact skin is
rare, hence, if it causes burning on the skin (by ALP or
phosphine) is not known to her.

115. After seeing the PM report and the opinion given by Dr.
Amit Sharma, PW-21 stated that the deceased Bhavna
had taken ALP orally in the present case as per the FSL
report already Ex.PW-7/C. She stated that any tablet
/poison tablet when taken orally do appear in blood either
by absorption or after metabolism.

116. The allegations against the accused persons are that they
caused murder of the deceased by administering
Aluminium Phosphide (ALP) to her. It is one of the
allegation that the deceased was given some poisonous
substance through injection on her arm. First of all, it is

State Vs. Bhaskar and Ors.
PS Prasad Nagar
, U/s. 302/498A/304B/201/34

confirmed through forensic evidence that the deceased
has expired due to Aluminium Phosphide poisoning. Now
coming to the question whether the same was
administered to her through injection, the answer comes
out to be in negative. PW-21 specifically admitted that
when ALP comes in contact with water, phosphine gas is
released and the residue is harmless. Thus, ALP could not
have been administered in solution form through
injection. Moreover, PW-21 after going thought the PM
report and the opinion given by Dr Amit Sharma
categorically deposed that the deceased had taken the
ALP orally in the present case. PW-12 Amit Sharma also
in clear terms reported that since the ALP was found in
blood, stomach and intestines, it was taken orally. Thus,
there remained no contradiction in the reports of PW-12
and PW-21.

117. It is the case of prosecution that the deceased was given
ALP forcefully, then in this context, it is important to read
the cross examination of PW-21 wherein she states that
the mode of ingestion is usually suicidal in intent
commonly accidental and rarely homicidal. She also
admitted that commonly the ALP cannot be given by
force homicidally as it emits very bad smell like rotten
fish and garlic.
In the report Ex. PW12/DA, Dr Amit
Sharma reported that it is extremely difficult and virtually
impossible to give an adult heathy individual this tablet
forcibly and as there were no evidence of any sign of
struggle injury marks in this case therefore, the deceased

possibly took the tablet herself.

SKIN SAMPLE OF DECEASED

118. The judicial record reflects that vide order dated
29.04.2017, the Addl. PP for State prayed that the skin
sample of the deceased be sent for obtaining expert
opinion as to whether the alleged bite mark on the skin of
the deceased was made by insect or by injection. The ld.
Predecessor observed that since this facility is not stated
to be available in FSL Rohini and FSL CBI (Lodhi Road),
therefore, it was directed that the samples be sent to
CFSL Hyderabad to obtain the expert opinion. The order
dated 28.02.2018 of the ld. Predecessor of this Court
records the report of CFSL Hyderabad that facility for
giving the requisite opinion is not available and therefore,
no opinion could be given. As such, the sample of skin
collected from the deceased lend no credit to the
prosecution case.

119. There is nothing on record to suggest that the accused
persons administered ALP to the deceased. There is no
direct or circumstantial evidence to connect the accused
persons to the alleged crime. Thus, the offence u/s.
302/
does not also stand proved against the accused
persons.

FINAL CONCLUSION

120. For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
