The case of the petitioners is that they were appointed with

the Department as Class-IV employee through a regular selection

process on daily wage basis. Later on, a decision was taken by

the Government to regularize the services of such daily wager

Class-IV servants. In that regard order dated 30.09.1985 was

passed wherein criteria for regularization of services was fixed. In

pursuance to the said order and in pursuance to certain orders

passed by the High Court in certain writ petitions filed by the

employees the services of the Class-IV employees were

regularized by the Department. In the present matters, the said

date of regularization qua all the petitioners fall somewhere

between the year 1991-1994. 14 out of the present petitioners

have since retired and 12 are still in service.

The case of the petitioners in the present petitions is that

their services have not been regularized w.e.f the date of initial

appointment which ought to have been done as the petitioners are

the persons similarly situated to one Meera Devi to whom the said

benefits had been granted. It has been submitted that Meera Devi

was an employee who was appointed on the same date on which

one of the petitioners, namely, Jai Prakash was appointed and was

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(11 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

also regularized on the same date i.e. 22.08.1994 on which Jai

Prakash was regularized. Meera Devi raised a dispute before the

Labour Court with a prayer for regularization of her service from

the date of her initial appointment. The claim of Meera Devi was

allowed by the Labour court and the writ petition preferred against

the same being S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.4320/2012 was also

dismissed. It has been submitted that in pursuance to the orders

passed by this Court, the services of Meera Devi have been

regularized from the date of her initial appointment and therefore,

the petitioners being similarly situated persons have a right to

claim parity and should be granted the same benefits as granted

to Meera Devi. Alternatively, it has been submitted that initial

date of appointment should be considered at least for the

purposes of calculation of gratuity and pension benefits as the

qualifying service as defined under Rule 12 of the Rajasthan Civil

Services (Pension) Rules, 1996 (for short hereinafter referred to

as, 'the Rules of 1996') and
Section 2
of the Payment of Gratuity

Act, 1972 (for short hereinafter referred to as, 'the Act of 1972')

has been completed by the petitioners.

Counsel for the petitioners submitted that as the order

passed in Meera Devi's case has become final for all purposes and

has been implemented and executed by the Department, the

same is definitely applicable to the present petitioners too and

they also deserve to be granted the same benefits. It has further

been submitted that although the present petitioners have raised

their claims belatedly, but the said delay cannot come in the way

of granting relief to the petitioners as it has been held in the

catena of judgments that if a relief has been granted to a similarly

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(12 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

situated person, the same cannot be denied to the other

incumbents on the ground of delay.

So far as the issue whether the petitioners have completed

the qualifying service for the purpose of calculation of pension and

gratuity is concerned, the counsel has relied upon the judgment

passed in the case of
Netram Sahu vs. State of Chhattisgarh

(2018 AIR SC 1545) decided on 23.03.2018.

Counsel for the petitioners also relied upon the following

judgments:

1.
State of Haryana vs. Mohinder Singh
; (2017) 4 SCC 587

2.
Maharaj Krishan Bhatt and Anr. vs. State of Jammu and
Kashmir and Ors.

Per contra, counsel for the respondents submitted that the

present petitions deserve to be dismissed only on the ground of

delay. It has been submitted by the respondents that the services

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(13 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

of the petitioners were regularized somewhere between the year

1991-1994 to which the petitioners never raised any objection and

many of them have even retired. The fact itself is sufficient to

prove that the petitioners were never aggrieved of the date of

regularization and therefore, they cannot be permitted to

challenge the same after a period of more than 25 years. Counsel

further submitted that it is true that Meera Devi was granted the

said relief but it was in pursuance to the directions issued by this

Court. Meera Devi had raised her grievance soon after the

regularization of her services and therefore the petitioners who

had never challenged their orders of regularization at the relevant

point of time cannot challenge the same now. So far as the

calculation of the pension and gratuity benefits from the date of

initial appointment is concerned counsel for the respondents has

submitted that the same also being the consequential relief cannot

be granted.

Counsel for the respondents relied upon the following

judgments:

1.
New Delhi Municipal Council vs. Pan Singh and Ors.
; (2007)
9 SCC 278

2.
Union of India and Ors. vs. M.K. Sarkar
; (2010) 2 SCC 59

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(14 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

Heard the parties and perused the material available on

record.

A bare perusal of the grounds raised in the petitions makes it

clear that the present petitions have been filed by the petitioners

on the sole ground that as Meera Devi, similarly situated person,

has been granted regularization w.e.f the date of her initial

appointment the same may be granted to them also. It is clear on

record that services of the petitioners were regularized way back

between years 1991-94, and no such grievance was ever raised by

the petitioners even till the date of their retirement (in case where

the petitioner had retired). Only when orders for pension in the

case of Meera Devi, calculating the same on the basis of initial

date of appointment were issued, the present petitioners too

decided to raise their claim for first time in the year 2017 vide a

notice which was served on the respondent-authorities.

In the case of
New Delhi Municipal Council Vs. Pan

Singh & Ors.
; (2007) 9 Supreme Court Cases 278, the

Hon'ble Apex Court has held that a person, who did not choose to

challenge a specific order at the relevant point of time and

challenged the same only after the relief was granted to a similarly

situated employee, cannot be granted the same benefit. The

Hon'ble Apex Court held as under:

"16. There is another aspect of the matter which
cannot be lost sight of. Respondents herein filed a
Writ Petition after 17 years. They did not agitate
their grievances for a long time. They, as noticed
herein, did not claim parity with the 17 workmen
at the earliest possible opportunity. They did not
implead themselves as parties even in the
reference made by the State before the Industrial
Tribunal. It is not their case that after 1982, those
employees who were employed or who were
recruited after the cut-off date have been granted
the said scale of pay.
After such a long time,
therefore, the Writ Petitions could not have been

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(15 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

entertained even if they are similarly situated. It
is trite that the discretionary jurisdiction may not
be exercised in favour of those who approach the
Court after a long time. Delay and laches are
relevant factors for exercise of equitable
jurisdiction. See
Govt. of W.B. v. Tarun K. Roy
And Others
[(
2004) 1 SCC 347], Chairman, U.P.
Jal Nigam & Anr. v. Jaswant Singh And Anr.
[2006
(12) SCALE 347] and Karnataka Power Corpn. Ltd.

through its Chairman & Managing Director and
Another v. K. Thangappan and Another [(2006) 4
SCC 322]."

So far as the claim of the petitioners for regularization of

their services w.e.f the date of initial appointment is concerned,

this Court is not inclined to interfere with the same because of a

gross delay of 25 years being caused in raising the said claim.

So far as the other judgments cited by the counsel for the

petitioners in support of the submissions regarding the

regularization of the petitioners are concerned, there is no dispute

pertaining to the ratio as laid down in the said judgments. But as

this Court is not inclined to interfere in the present matters qua

the relief of regularization on the ground of gross delay, the said

judgments are not required to be dealt with in the present matter.

So far as the case of petitioners who have since retired and

pray for calculation of the pensionary and gratuity benefits from

the date of initial appointment are concerned, the ground raised

by the counsel for the petitioners is found to be tenable. Rule 12

of the Rules of 1996 defines qualifying services as under:

"12. Commencement of qualifying service

(a) Except for compensation gratuity, a
Government servant's service does not qualify till
he has completed eighteen years of age.

(b) Subject to the provisions of these rules, the
qualifying service of a Government servant shall
commence from the date he takes over charge of
the post to which he is first appointed, either
substantively or in an officiating or temporary
capacity."

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(16 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

Section 2(c)
of the Act of 1972 defines 'continuous service'

as under:

"2(c) "continuous service" means continuous
service as defined in
section 2A
;"

Section 2A(1)
of the Act of 1972 reads as under:

"2A. Continuous service.--For the purposes of this
Act--

(1) an employee shall be said to be in continuous
service for a period if he has, for that period, been
in uninterrupted service, including service which
may be interrupted on account of sickness,
accident, leave, absence from duty without leave
(not being absence in respect of which an order
treating the absence as break in service has been
passed in accordance with the standing orders,
rules or regulations governing the employees of
the establishment), lay-off, strike or a lock-out or
cessation of work not due to any fault of the
employee, whether such uninterrupted or
interrupted service was rendered before or after
the commencement of this Act;"

In view of the above provisions, it is clear that the remaining

14 petitioners who have since retired, having completed their

qualifying services, were entitled for calculation of pensionary and

gratuity benefits w.e.f. the date of initial appointment.

In the case of
Shree Gopal Gaur Vs. State of Rajasthan

& Ors.
; S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.11839/2016, while relying

upon the judgment passed in
Keshrimal Soni Vs. State & Ors.
;

S.B.C.W.P. No.4743/2004, the Coordinate Bench of this Court

held as under:

"I have considered the submissions made by
learned counsel for the parties and have perused the
material available on record. Provisions of Rule 12(b) of
the Rules of 1996 read as under:-

"Rule 12. Commencement of qualifying service

(a) Except for compensation gratuity, a Government
servant's service does not qualify till he has completed
eighteen years of age.

(b) Subject to the provisions of these Rules, the
qualifying service of a Government servant shall

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(17 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

commence from the date he takes over charge of the post
to which he is first appointed, either substantively or in an
officiating or temporary capacity."

A bare perusal of Clause (b) of Rule 12 indicates
that qualifying service of a Government servant shall
commence from the date he takes charge on the post,
for which, he is first appointed, either substantively or in
an officiating or temporary capacity.

The term temporary post has been defined in Rule
7(35) of the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 ('Rules of
1951'), which reads as under:-"

"Temporary post - means a post carrying a definite
rate of pay sanctioned for a limited time."

The order of appointment of the petitioner dated
09.05.1985 reads as under:-

A perusal of the terms above would clearly indicate
that the petitioner was granted appointment on
temporary post and once the appointment has been
made on temporary post, in terms of Rule 12(b) of the
Rules of 1996, the petitioner is entitled to get the said
period counted towards his qualifying service."

In view of the ratio as
laid down in
the case of
Keshrimal

Soni and Shree Gopal Gaur
(supra), and the observations made

herein above, this Court is of the opinion that the petitioners who

have retired are entitled for calculation of their pension and

gratuity benefits from the date of initial appointment in service.

In view of the same, so far as the following 14 petitioners

who have since retired, their writ petitions are partly allowed. The

respondents are directed to take into consideration the initial date

(Downloaded on 26/12/2022 at 12:25:17 AM)

(18 of 19) [CW-3629/2018]

of appointment of the 14 retired petitioners for the purpose of

calculating their qualifying service and grant them consequential
