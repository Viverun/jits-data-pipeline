5. On the request of the parties, this Court has taken up

C.W.J.C. No. 20636 of 2021, listed at serial no. 1 (Shamima

Khatoon vs. State of Bihar and others) as the lead case. For brevity

sake, this Court is not taking note of the various memo numbers

and dates in different writ applications at this stage, however, those

will be referred to at appropriate stage. This Court would refer

them as impugned office order(s).

Case of the Petitioners-Category-I

6. It is the case of the petitioner(s) that they were

appointed on the post of assistant teachers in different districts as

back as in the year 1982. One Kaushal Kumar filed a Public

Interest Litigation in this Court vide C.W.J.C. No.10002 of 2016,

alleging that a large number of irregularities have taken place in

the matter of appointment of Assistant Teachers in Lower

Subordinate Education Service (in short 'LSS'). The Hon'ble

Division Bench while hearing C.W.J.C. No.10002 of 2016, passed

the order dated 19.06.2016 by which the authorities of the

Department of Education, Government of Bihar including the

Principal Secretary, Department of Education were called upon to

appear in person with an explanation by way of affidavit as to why

necessary action has not been taken by the State-respondents on

the report of the C.B.I. and what action has been taken against
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023
22/87

those persons who have made illegal appointments. The Hon'ble

Division Bench, however, observed as follows:-

"We make it clear that no termination of service of
teachers shall take place pursuant to the report of the
C.B.I. without giving notice to the teachers concerned
and without following the due process of law."
7. It is stated that in fact the matter relating to

appointment of Assistant Teachers during the said period were

subject matter of inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in

short 'C.B.I.' or 'CBI'). C.B.I. had submitted a report after

examining the appointments of 'LSS' by different appointing

authorities during the period 1980-1998. The report of the CBI

indicated that large number of appointments were made without

any advertisement of the post in any local newspaper, no roster

clearance was obtained, reservation rules were not followed and

there was no proceeding of any selection committee for selection

of the candidates. Some of the appointments were made of the

candidates who were over aged and appointing authorities were

not even competent to make regular appointments.

8. The report submitted by the CBI revealed that in

certain cases, the applicants who did not posses the required

qualification of Matric Trained Teachers, were appointed in lower

scale of Matric Untrained Teachers and subsequently, upon

acquiring the Matric Trained Qualification, they were given the
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023
23/87

scale of Matric Trained Teachers by the concerned appointing

authorities. In most of the cases, the candidates submitting the

application for appointment as LSS teachers had declared his

poverty, poor economic conditions, being widow, being divorcee

or deserted by husband, etc. as such circumstances for their

appointment to the post of LSS teachers which were considered

and taken into account for their appointment on the

recommendation of the politicians. So far as the petitioners in the

first category are concerned, the petitioner, namely, Shamima

Khatoon was served with a show cause notice pointing out that her

appointment has been found irregular by the CBI and directions

have been issued to take action in the light of the report of the

CBI, therefore, she should submit her show cause within a period

of three days. Vide memo no. 710 dated 01.10.2016, her service

was terminated in view of the report of the CBI.

9. Similar orders were issued to the other writ petitioners

and their services were terminated. It is stated that the order

terminating the services of the petitioners were challenged in this

Court vide C.W.J.C. No.17547 of 2016 and other analogues

matters. All those writ applications came to be considered by the

learned Writ Court. In C.W.J.C. No.17904 of 2016, this Court

found that the decision making process was faulty, therefore, set
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023
24/87

aside the order terminating the services of the petitioners and the

same judgment was followed by the learned Writ Court in

C.W.J.C. No.17438 of 2016 and other analogues cases. However,

while disposing of the writ application, the learned Writ Court

observed a follows:-

"This order, however, could not preclude the Regional
Deputy Director of Education concerned to proceed afresh
but in accordance with law and pass appropriate order after
affording appropriate opportunity ...... The petitioners on
being served notice would corporate in expeditious
disposal of he matter."

10. After setting aside of the order of dismissal of the

petitioners, they were reinstated in service and were paid their

salaries.

Fresh Steps- Show Cause Notices

11. The Regional Deputy Director (in short 'RDD'),

however, once again issued show cause notice to the petitioners

which the petitioners replied. By the order of the RDD, a

departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioners. The

petitioners were made available a copy of the remarks made by the

CBI and it was alleged that their initial appointment was made

without advertisement, without roster clearance or without

interview. A copy of the memo served upon the petitioner Smt.

Shamima Khatoon has been placed on record and the same is

being reproduced hereunder for a ready reference:-

12. The petitioners claimed that they appeared before the

District Programme Officer and submitted that they were

appointed pursuant to the notice published in the school. Their

appointments have taken place against the sanctioned vacant post.

The petitioner Shamima Khatoon, however, retired from service

on 31.12.2020 during the pendency of the departmental

proceeding. On 08.04.2021 the petitioner filed a second show

cause reply, however, keeping aside the reply of the petitioner, the

impugned order forfeiting the pensionary benefits of the

petitioner and others was issued. A copy of the impugned office

order is Annexure '15' to the writ application (in C.W.J.C. No.

13. The impugned order has been assailed by the

petitioners on the ground that the CBI has adopted a

discriminatory approach in preparing and submitting the report

dated 04.12.2004 which deals with the cases of 304 Teachers of

LSS cadre. It is submitted that CBI has reported that 251 Assistant

Teachers were irregularly appointed, appointment of 28 Teachers

have been held regular, records of 17 Assistant Teachers were not

available and the records of 3 Assistant Teachers who were

terminated were not available. Similar was the case in respect of 5

Assistant Teachers who were held irregular but the records were

not available. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

CBI has held 28 appointments as regular but in those appointments

manifold irregularities are existing which are akin to the cases of

251 Teachers. According to the petitioners there is no basic

difference in between the cases of said 28 Teachers and 251
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

28/87

Teachers but the CBI held the appointment of said 28 Teachers as

regular and thereby the appointment of the said 251 Teachers have

been held as irregular. This has been called a completely arbitrary

and discriminatory approach on the part of the CBI and that

according to the petitioners would vitiate the report of the CBI.

14. It is submitted that one grave illegality which has

been committed by the CBI is evident from bare perusal of the

entries made in the 84 Assistant Teachers named at various serial

numbers who have been declared as irregular appointees in spite of

the fact that in concerned column of the said 84 Teachers, it has

been clearly mentioned that "records are not available".

15. It is submitted that the order of punishment has been

passed against the petitioners solely on the basis of the said CBI

report dated 04.12.2004, therefore, the order of punishment is in

the teeth of the order dated 19.09.2016 passed in C.W.J.C. No.

10002 of 2016 by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court. The

petitioners relied upon the observations of the Hon'ble Division

Bench of this Court wherein it has been stated that no termination

of service of Teachers shall take place pursuant to the report of

CBI without giving notices to the teacher(s) concerned and

without following due process of law.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

29/87

16. It is submitted that the punishment orders are also

in teeth of the judgment of this Court passed on 17.01.2017 in

C.W.J.C. No. 17904 of 2016. (
Shanti Kumari Vs. State of Bihar

& Ors
.)

17. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the

respondents have not acted in accordance with the Rule 17(4) and

17(5) of the Bihar Government Servants (Classification, Control

& appeal) Rules 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Service

Rules') in the matter of initiation of the departmental proceeding

right from the stage of framing of memorandum of charge until the

conclusion of the same and the same is in the teeth of the

provisions of the Service Rules.

18. Learned counsel has also relied upon the statement

made by CBI in paragraph '10' of its' affidavit dated 09.12.2019

filed in WP(S) No. 5669 of 2018 before the Hon'ble Jharkhand

High Court at Ranchi in which it is stated that the appointees

were not examined during CBI inquiry. It is submitted that in case

of similarly situated Teacher like these petitioners, the Hon'ble

Jharkhand High Court had been pleased to allow WP (S) No. 6023

of 2018 which has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Division bench of

Jharkhand High Court vide order dated 02.03.2023 in L.P.A.No.

141 of 2021.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

30/87

19. Learned counsel submits that on a bare perusal of the

orders passed by the Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court it would

appear that in the said case it has been held that as per Rule 97 (xi)

of the Bihar Education Code, the District School Inspectress was

the competent authority for appointment of Assistant Teachers in

the pay-scale of Rs. 50-90/-

20. It is further submitted that the charges levelled

against the petitioners related to the periods of the year 1982

onwards, therefore, no proceeding under the Bihar Pension Rules

could have been initiated against the petitioners. Reliance in this

regard has been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of
State of M.P. v. Bani Singh
reported in 1990

Supp SCC 738, State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. N.

Radhkrishnana reported in (1998) 4 SCC 154, Union of India

and Ors. vs. Kishorill Bablani reported in
AIR 1999 SC 517 and

P.V. Mahadevan v. Managing Director, T.N. Housing Board

reported in (2005) 6 SCC 636.

21. It is further submitted that after initial appointment

of the petitioners, the authorities concerned had granted all due

benefits to the petitioners like regular employees and the

appointment of all the petitioners had been made by the

competent authority against the sanctioned and vacant post as also
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

31/87

they were having requisite qualifications for the post of Assistant

Teachers (in LSS Cadre) they were appointed by virtue of Notice

Board Advertisement.

Stand of the Respondents

22. Contrary to the stand of the petitioners, the State-

respondents have filed a counter affidavit in which the following

stand has been taken:-

(i). The petitioner has been duly proceeded against in a

departmental proceeding and they have been given opportunity of

hearing by serving show cause and affording opportunity to them

to participate in the inquiry. The petitioners were also served with

the inquiry report and second show cause notice was served upon

them. It is submitted by the State-respondents that the impugned

order has been passed under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules

because the petitioner had retired on 31.12.2020. The departmental

proceeding had been converted into a proceeding under Rule 43(b)

of the Pension Rules vide memo no. 08 dated 05.01.2021 as

contained in Annexure 'A' to the counter affidavit.

23. The State-respondents have submitted that the

petitioners' appointment was done without proper advertisement in

the local newspaper without any test or interview or without any
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

32/87

roster clearance. It was a backdoor entry, they did not conform to

Articles 14
and
of the Constitution of India. The appointment

was void ab-initio in law.

24. Learned counsel for the State has submitted that the

ratio of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

State of Karnataka v. Umadevi
(3) reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1

clearly says that an appointment made contrary to
Articles 14
and
of the Constitution of India dehors the rules would be illegal

appointments and those will be distinguishable from irregular

appointments and they are like a still born child who can never be

infused with life. Thus, the labelling of 'Irregular' Illegal or

Regular appointments in its' report by CBI is not significant. These

appointments are to be put in appropriate category as understood

in legal parlance.

25. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Full

Bench of this Court in the case of
Ram Sevak Yadav vs. The

State of Bihar and others
reported in 2013 1 PLJR 964, learned

counsel for the State submits that the Hon'ble Full Bench of this

Court has declared that an illegal appointment void ab-initio made

contrary to the mandate of
Article 14
without open competitive

selection process is void ab-initio and cannot be regularized under

any circumstance.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

33/87

26. The State-respondents have further submitted that in

C.W.J.C. No.9847 of 1998 (
Brajesh Kumar Singh and others

vs. State of Bihar and others
), vide order dated 16.12.2019 there

was a direction to the CBI to carry on an investigation in the

matter of appointments/ promotion of LSS (women cadre) who

were appointed from 1980 to 1998. CBI submitted its report on

09.11.2004 before the Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar,

Patna against 305 teachers in which appointment of only 27

teachers were found regular whereas appointment of 278 teachers

were found to be illegal/ irregular, and therefore, recommendations

were made for taking action against illegally/ irregularly appointed

teachers and also against those officers who had made such

appointments. As per report of the CBI, there was no

advertisement in most of the cases, no roster clearance were

obtained and no reservation rules were followed.

27. It is submitted that in the year 2011, the power and

function of Inspectress of Schools-cum-Deputy Director of

Education was merged with the post of Regional Deputy Director

of Education. The Director, Seconday Education, Bihar, Patna

issued a direction vide letter no. 1674 dated 17.08.2016 to all

Regional Deputy Director of Education to locate such LSS

teachers (women cadre) who were appointed during the period
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

34/87

1980-1998 and take legal action in accordance with law. Pursuant

thereof, second show cause notice was issued to the petitioners and

after careful consideration of the reply filed by the petitioners and

scrutinizing the CBI report, the then Regional Deputy Director

terminated the services of the petitioners which termination orders

were challenged in several writs and those writ petitions were also

heard together and orders of termination were set aside/ quashed.

By virtue of termination, their services were restored but this

reinstatement was with liberty granted to the respondents to

proceed afresh in accordance with law.

28. It is submitted that one of the candidates in this

regard, namely, Neelam Kumari (C.W.J.C. No.10022 of 2019)

whose name appears at serial no. 186 in CBI report was appointed

in 1977 by the District Inspectress (DI) who was not competent

authority for the appointment. There was no select committee

proceedings for her appointment through interview/ test. The post

was not advertised in any newspaper. Her husband was assistant in

the education department and in such circumstance, if the

impugned order has been passed after giving appropriate

opportunity of hearing to the petitioners, no fault may be found

with the same. Referring to the facts of another similarly situated

petitioner, namely, Shanti Kumari (C.W.J.C. No.3039 of 2019), it
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

35/87

is submitted that she was appointed by DI who was not competent

because LSS teachers is a State cadre post. The post was never

advertised in any local newspaper. Her name appears at serial no.

205 of the CBI report. It has also been submitted that the

departmental proceeding has been conducted in accordance with

law and on the face of the facts which are crystal clear and are

showing that these appointments were made without any

advertisement and without their being any selection committee

formed for this purpose, no prejudice would be caused to the

petitioner if no witness was examined by the department in the

departmental proceeding.

29. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that

principle of natural justice cannot be put in a straight jacket

formula and this is one of those cases in which the facts are such

that this Court can easily appreciate that their being no denial of

the fact that there was no advertisement in the newspaper and the

appointments were made without roster clearance and without

their being any selection committee formed for this purpose to

appoint the petitioners on the basis of interview, no prejudice

would be caused to the petitioners as it is an open and shut case.

On the aforesaid grounds, the State-respondents have submitted

that the writ application are fit to be dismissed.
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

36/87

As regards the judgment of the Hon'ble Jharkhand High

Court, it is submitted that the same is clearly distinguishable and in

any case the judgment would not be a binding precedent.

Stand of the CBI

30. Let it be recorded that in course of hearing of these

writ applications when this Court went through the records

including the report of the CBI, learned Senior Counsel for the

CBI was called upon to take a stand with regard to the nature of

the cases found by the CBI particularly the distinction drawn by

the CBI in its report between irregular and illegal appointments.

Learned Senior Counsel for the CBI has assisted this Court by

going into the records particularly the report of the CBI and

learned Senior Counsel pointed out that the cases in which the

appointments have been made on political recommendations

without any advertisement and without their being any select

committee and without there being any interview by such

appointing authorities who had no authority to make regular

appointments are definitely in the nature of illegal appointments.

Consideration

31. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners,

learned counsel for the State and learned Senior Counsel for the

CBI as also on going through the pleadings, this Court finds that
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

37/87

writ petitioners are questioning the impugned orders passed by the

State-respondents by which in exercise of power under Rule 43(b)

of the Pension Rules, the pension as well as other retiral benefits

of the petitioners have been forfeited.

32. The background of the present case would be

evident from the submissions of the parties which have been taken

note of hereinabove.

33.
In the case of
Shanti Kumari Vs. State of Bihar &

Ors.
this Court in its judgment dated 17.01.2017 in C.W.J.C. No.

17904 of 2016 inter alia observed as follows:-

"........Undisputedly the petitioners have been deprived of a
reasonable opportunity to canvas their respective cases,
produce relevant documents together with supporting case
laws which could not be pressed into service, in the manner in
which the matter has been conducted. My observations
certainly would not bear a protection to such appointments
which are plagued with fraud and obtained on forged
documents, however this would require an examination thereof
and individual case needs to be examined."

(underline is mine)
Further it is observed in concluding paragraph as under:

"Needless to add that in case the Regional Deputy Director
of Education, Magadh Division, Gaya as well as Regional
Deputy Director of Education of other Divisions would
decide to re-initiate the proceeding and serve notice on the
writ petitioners, they would cooperate in the expeditious
disposal of the matter."

34. The petitioners were facing the charges that they

were appointed without advertisement of the posts in a newspaper

or to the employment exchange, the roster clearance were not

available, reservation rules were not followed and there was no
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

38/87

selection through a selection committee by conducting interview

and/or verifying the records. They were appointed on the

recommendation of the politicians. In the first round of litigation,

the termination of the petitioners were set aside by this Court and

they were ordered to be reinstated in service with consequential

benefits even as the disciplinary proceeding against them were to

proceed afresh. At this stage, this Court finds that the petitioners in

fact got benefit of their salary etc. even as the validity of their

appointments were yet to be tested, examined and an appropriate

view was to be taken. In this regard, the Hon'ble Constitution

Bench judgment in the case of Managing Director, ECIL,

Hyderabad Versus B. Karunakar and Others reported in (1993)

4 SCC 727 may be referred to. Paragraph '31' of the judgment is

being reproduced here under for ready reference:-

"31. Hence, in all cases where the enquiry officer's report
is not furnished to the delinquent employee in the
disciplinary proceedings, the Courts and Tribunals should
cause the copy of the report to be furnished to the
aggrieved employee if he has not already secured it before
coming to the Court/Tribunal and give the employee an
opportunity to show how his or her case was prejudiced
because of the non-supply of the report. If after hearing the
parties, the Court/Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the
non-supply of the report would have made no difference to
the ultimate findings and the punishment given, the
Court/Tribunal should not interfere with the order of
punishment. The Court/Tribunal should not mechanically
set aside the order of punishment on the ground that the
report was not furnished as is regrettably being done at
present. The courts should avoid resorting to short cuts.
Since it is the Courts/Tribunals which will apply their
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

39/87

judicial mind to the question and give their reasons for
setting aside or not setting aside the order of punishment,
(and not any internal appellate or revisional authority),
there would be neither a breach of the principles of natural
justice nor a denial of the reasonable opportunity. It is only
if the Court/Tribunal finds that the furnishing of the report
would have made a difference to the result in the case that
it should set aside the order of punishment. Where after
following the above procedure, the Court/Tribunal sets
aside the order of punishment, the proper relief that should
be granted is to direct reinstatement of the employee with
liberty to the authority/management to proceed with the
inquiry, by placing the employee under suspension and
continuing the inquiry from the stage of furnishing him
with the report. The question whether the employee would
be entitled to the back-wages and other benefits from the
date of his dismissal to the date of his reinstatement if
ultimately ordered, should invariably be left to be decided
by the authority concerned according to law, after the
culmination of the proceedings and depending on the final
outcome. If the employee succeeds in the fresh inquiry and
is directed to be reinstated, the authority should be at
liberty to decide according to law how it will treat the
period from the date of dismissal till the reinstatement and
to what benefits, if any and the extent of the benefits, he
will be entitled. The reinstatement made as a result of the
setting aside of the inquiry for failure to furnish the report,
should be treated as a reinstatement for the purpose of
holding the fresh inquiry from the stage of furnishing the
report and no more, where such fresh inquiry is held. That
will also be the correct position in law."

35. In the fresh round of disciplinary proceeding, the

petitioner(s) were served with Prapatra 'K' ¼izi= d½. Inquiry was

conducted into the matter and after consideration of the stand of

the petitioners what ultimately transpired in the inquiry report may

be summerised as under:

(i) No advertisement had been issued by the Inspectress

of School-cum-Deputy Director of Education, Bihar for the
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

40/87

purpose of appointment of teachers in the subordinate service

cadre.

(ii) The petitioners only claimed that there were

information on the notice board of the office of the Inspectress of

School-cum-Deputy Director of Education, Bihar, it is not their

stand that the posts were advertised and the public at large who

were eligible for appointment as teacher had opportunity to apply

for the said post.

(iii) As regards, roster clearance and observance of the

principles of reservation are concerned, this is also not in dispute,

and

(iv) The petitioners failed to produce any letter of a

selection committee or any competent authority calling upon them

to appear for interview.

36. In course of hearing of C.W.J.C. No.1690 of 1997

which was filed by Smt. Shushma Kumari and other primary

teachers claiming pay benefits for the period 20.07.1985 to

17.05.1990, the then Director, Secondary Education, Bihar filed a

reply contending that the lady teachers appointed during the period

from 1980 onwards were appointed illegally and consequently the

promotion given to them was also irregular. This Court was

informed that the matter of appointment/ promotion of these
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

41/87

teachers was under investigation with Cabinet Vigilance

Department and the Government of Bihar had set up an inquiry

committee to inquire into the matter. This Court vide order

date19.09.1997 directed the Government of Bihar to take final

decision in the matter. An inquiry was also started by the Cabinet

Vigilance Investigation Bureau, Bihar. While the said inquiry was

in progress, in C.W.J.C. No.9847 of 1998 (
Brajesh Kumar and

others vs. State of Bihar and others
) this Court issued directions

to the CBI to take up the investigation into the matter of

appointments of primary teachers and other teachers in the State of

Bihar from 1980 till date. It is in these facts and circumstances,

the CBI Anti Corruption Branch registered the preliminary inquiry

No.3 (A/01) dated 08.06.2001.

37. The preliminary inquiry revealed that Inspectress of

Schools-cum-Deputy Director, Secondary Education, Bihar

provided a list of 305 teachers of LSS (women wing) whose

appointments were said to be illegal/irregular. The name of the

authorities who had appointed them were also provided. Another

list of 160 LSS teachers allegedly illegally/ irregularly promoted

during 1990 by late Dr. Sachita Kumar Sinha the then Director,

Secondary Education, Bihar was also obtained by the CBI.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

42/87

38. The CBI in its report has scrutinized the rules

governing the LSS teachers and circulars which were issued by the

Government of Bihar from time to time. This Court deems it just

and proper to reproduce the same hereunder for the ready

reference:-

10. RECOMMENDATORY There are no provisions, no procedure
APPOINTMENTS and no circulars for such appointments

For the purposes of promotion of LSS Teacher to the grade of SEX, the relevant rules and
procedure as applicable are summarised as below :-

1. Appointing Authority :- Director, Secondary Education Bihar is the appointing authority of SES Teachers both
for direct recruitment as well as through promotion from LSS to SES (Rule 796 Bihar Education Code 1961 and
Letter No. 11/MZZ/03/63E-4484 dt. 8.12.65).

2. Direct Recruitment :- It is to be made through State Selection Board /Vidyalaya
Sewa Board.

3. Promotions :- For promotion from LSS teacher to SES teacher, 50% of the total post will be filled by direct
recruitment and 50 % of the vacancies will be filled by promotion from amongst the LSS teachers as per letter
No. 27 dt 7.1.76 of Education Department."

39. It is evident from the relevant Rules and the

Circulars which have been issued from time to time that the

Director, Secondary Education, Bihar is the appointing authority

of the Subordinate Education Services Teachers (hereinafter

referred to a the 'SES Teachers') both by direct recruitment as well

as through promotion from 'LSS' to 'SES' (Refer Rule 796 of the

Bihar Education Code 1961 and letter No. 11/M 22/03/63 E-4484

dated 08.12.1965). It is also evident that the direct recruitment is
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

45/87

to be made through State Selection Board/Vidayalay Sewa Board.

The Director, Secondary Education is only competent to approve a

select list for appointment in LSS (women cadre). A

compassionate appointment may be made in 'SES' Scale directly

as and when cleared by the government through Department of

Personal and Administrative Reforms.

40. As regards the appointment of the 305 LSS

Teachers, the CBI got 234 appointment folders and scrutinized the

same. Some of the appointees were also examined to ascertain the

procedure adopted towards their appointment as LSS Teachers.

This inquiry revealed that these appointments of LSS Teachers

(women wing) were made by 46 appointing authorities during the

period from 1980 to 1998. They were the Inspectress of School-

cum-Deputy Director, Secondary Education, Bihar who made

maximum number of 108 appointments during period 1980-86.

One Smt. Sudha Sinha the Inspectress of School, Bihar who was

the District Inspectress School (in short 'DI') at Patna at the

relevant time made 57 appointments during the period

05.07.1988 to 15.01.1990 and 1987 to 1988 respectively. In this

manner all the 46 Inspectress of School, Deputy Director

Education, Director, Secondary Education and District Inspectress

of School were involved in making appointments without carrying
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

46/87

any selection process. A large number of them had died at the time

the CBI was conducting inquiry.

(underline is mine)

41. As regards the procedures related to appointment

what has been revealed in the inquiry report of the CBI are being

taken verbatimly from the said report as under:-

"The enquiry has further revealed that the procedure related to the appointments of LSS teachers is governed
by GO No.I-D-306-58E-1 382D dated 17.3.59 and
Article 64 (1

& 3)
of Bihar Education Code,
Article 3
of BB Misc.
Rules, 1958, Rule 796 of Bihar Education code and notification 262 dated 2.6.86 according to which Inspectress
of Schools of Bihar and/or Director of Secondary Education, Bihar is the appointing authority of LSS teachers.
Clause 2 of Article-64 of Bihar Education Code lays down that, in the event of an urgent and unforeseen
vacancy, the Inspectress may make temporary appointment of a teacher without prior reference to the Director
for a period not exceeding three months. In view of the aforesaid provision, only the Inspectress of Schools was
empowered to make temporary appointment only for three months. In letter No. 8167 dated 21.6.66 issued by
Secretary to the Government of Bihar, it is laid down that all recruitments to the vacancies to be filled up by the
State Government will be channelised compulsorily through the Employment Exchange except the vacancies
which were to be filled up on the recommendation of the Bihar Public Service Commission or by promotion or
transfer or deputation specifically mentioning therein that the other source of recruitment will be tried only
when the Employment Exchange concerned issues a non-availability certificate.

The enquiry has further revealed that in the matter of illegal/irregular appointment of 305 LSS
teachers, the original applications of most of the candidates are addressed either to the inspectress of Schools,
Bihar, Patna or to the State Education Minister, Bihar. The said applications contain the recommendations made
by politicians like MLA's/ MLC's other Ministers/ Distt. Educational Authorities and were endorsed to the
Inpectress of School, Bihar, Patna for taking necessary action and/or for making appointment as Primary
Teacher. These recommendations of the politicians or the then Education Minister were treated as Government
orders by the Inspectress of Schools, Bihar/Distt. Inspectress of Schools and they without following the
prescribed procedure directly issued appointment orders in favour of the recommended candidates, making
appointment in a temporary capacity for a period ranging between 3 to 6 months against a temporary vacancy
created by any regular teachers going on maternity/sick/long leave. The prescribed procedure, relevant rules,
and circulars issued by the Government of Bihar from time to time for such appointments were not followed by
the concerned appointing authority while making the appointments.
Article 64 (3-i)
of Bihar Education Code
empowers Inspectress of Schools to make temporary emergency appointments for 3 months without following
the required procedure but there is no provision to grant extension to such temporary teachers or to reappoint.
The enquiry however, has revealed that in almost all the cases repeated extensions were given and re-
appointment letters were issued. Under
Article 64 (3-iii)
, the Inspectress of Schools was required to furnish to
the Director Secondary Education, Bihar by the 16 th of April, of every calendar year, the particulars of
qualifications, categories, etc, of all vacancies that were likely to occur within the following year, and wherein
regular appointments were required to be made by following the proper procedure but this rule was not
followed. No advertisement for the posts was ever made in the local newspaper nor the names were called
through the regional Employment Exchange as was required under the rules. No Establishment/ Select
Committee was constituted to conduct test/interview to prepare a select list of the qualified and deserving
candidates to make recommendations for appointment of the successful candidates for the vacant posts of LSS
teachers. No roster clearance regarding reservation of vacancies for each category for the post of general
teachers, music teachers and craft teachers was obtained from DP & AR through Director Secondary Education
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

47/87

prior to advertising the vacancies, if any, in the local newspaper/employment exchange. Contrary to the laid
down procedure, direct appointment letters were issued on the basis of recommendations of
politicians/authorities as mentioned in the Chart on
Analysis of Available Record and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.

The enquiry has also revealed that in certain cases the applicants who did not possess the required
qualifications of Matric Trained Teachers, were appointed in the lower scale of matric untrained teachers but
subsequently upon acquiring the matric trained qualifications, they were given the scale of matric trained
teachers by the concerned appointing authority. It has also been revealed that in most of the cases, the
candidates submitting the applications for appointment as LSS teachers had declared self poverty, poor
economic conditions, being widow, being divorcee or deserted by husband etc. as special circumstances for
their appointment to the post of LSS teachers, which grounds were considered and taken into account for their
appointments.

The enquiry has further revealed that in March, 1988 an advertisement had appeared in the local
daily newspapers issued by Inspectress of Schools, Bihar inviting applications for the posts of
general/music/craft teachers in LSS grade. A number of applications were received in response to the said
advertisement. However, no teacher of General category whosoever had applied for the post was
selected/appointed, though certain candidates were appointed for the post of General teacher whose
applications were received duly recommended by the politicians. It is also revealed that no roster clearance for
the reservation of vacancies so advertised was obtained. A few number of craft/music and dance teachers were
selected and given appointments as LSS teachers on the recommendations of a Select Committee constituted
for this purpose. As such these appointments have been shown as regular appointments in Chart of Analysis of
Available Record and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.

The enquiry has revealed that the post of LSS teachers (Primary Teacher's) in Government Girls Schools of
Bihar is under the direct control and supervision of Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna and is State cadre post
and its appointing as well as disciplinary authority is Inspectress of Schools - cum - Dy. Director Secondary
Education, Bihar. However, on a number of occasions, in a number of cases Distt. Inspectresses of Schools of
various districts of Bihar, who are not appointing authorities for LSS teachers were also allowed to make
appointments of LSS teachers in Government Girls Schools within their respective districts. It is further revealed
that some of the teachers appointed prior to 1980 were appointed in similar manner in temporary capacity for
3 months without following the proper procedure by the then Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna as has been
followed by the Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna in this case during 1980 -98. The Distt. Inspectresses of
Schools of the relevant districts have also made appointments/re appointments of LSS teachers in temporary
capacity for 3-6 months without following the proper procedure and have also granted repeated extensions to
such temporary appointees against the rules. The Distt. Inspectress of Schools is not an authorised appointing
authority of LSS teachers and hence all the appointments made by Distt. Inspectresses of Schools during 1980

-98 in their districts have been shown as irregular appointments in the Chart of Analysis of Available Record and
Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.
The enquiry has revealed that out of 305 appointments so made, no record is available in respect of 25
appointments. The Chart of Analysis of Available Record' and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report
reveals different irregularities committed by the said 46 appointing authorities, such as non-obtaining of roster
clearance, non-advertisement of posts/vacancies in daily newspapers/ regional employment. exchange, non-
calling of names of the candidates through regional employment exchanges, non- observance of age limits.
non-observance of training/ educational qualification, non-observance of prescribed procedure, making
appointments on the recommendations of politicians like MLAs, MLCS, Chief Minister, Education Minister, other
Ministers and other authorities without following the prescribed procedure and making of appointments by
unauthorised/ incompetent authorities etc.
The enquiry has revealed that Distt. Inspectresses of Schools of the relevant districts have also made
appointments/ reappointments of LSS teachers in temporary capacity for 3-6 months without following the
proper procedure and have also granted repeated extensions to such temporary appointees against the rules.
The Distt. Inspectress of Schools is not an authorised appointing authority of LSS teachers and hence all the
appointments made by Distt. Inspectresses of Schools during 1980-98 in their districts have been concluded as
irregular appointments in the Chart of Analysis of Available Record and. Evidence enclosed as annexure to this
report. It has also come to light that under
Article 97(xi)
of Bihar Education Code, under the head of Powers of
Distt Inspectresses of Schools, it has been laid down that District Inspectress of Schools is empowered to "make
appointment of Class-IV Government, Servant and of teachers in the scale of 50 - 90 or below under her control
and to sanction pension to all such cases". This power given to the Distt. Inspectresses. has been misunderstood
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

48/87

as the appointing power of LSS teachers. However, The Distt. Inspectress of Schools cannot be the appointing
authority of LSS teachers due to the below mentioned reasons :-

i. LSS teacher's post is a State Cadre Post under the direct control and supervision of
Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna who is the appointing authority for this post
under
article 64 (1-3).

ii. There can not be two appointing authorities for the same post i.e. Inspectress of
Schools, Bihar and the District Inspectress of Schools.

iii. District Inspectresses are posted in the relevant districts under the control of
Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna to assist her in the work of control and
supervision of Government Girls Schools of Bihar and a person posted in a district
can not be the appointing authority of a state cadre post.

iv. The required Roster Register and seniority list of LSS teachers is being maintained
by the Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna under supervision of Director Secondary
Education, Bihar whereas no such register and seniority list can be maintained' at a
district level for a State Cadre Post.

v. The power of Distt. Inspectress under
article: 97(xi)
has been provided in respect of
Take Over Girls Schools, if any, in her district. Now this power in respect of
appointment in Take Over Schools is vested in a committee constituted under
District Education Officer/ Superintendent.

vi. The Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand vide its order dated 9.6.2002 passed in CWJC
No. 1110 and 1119 of 1995 had held that "neither the education code nor any of
the rules empowers Distt. Inspectress of Schools to be the appointing authority in
respect of appointment to the post of Matric Trained Teachers. The appointment of
the petitioners by the Distt. Inspectress of Schools is illegal and wholly without
jurisdiction".

vii. The appointing authority of a post is always the disciplinary authority of that post
and vice-versa. The disciplinary authority in case of LSS teachers is Inspectress of
Schools Bihar, Patna and not the Distt. Inspectress."

(underline is mine)

42. What surprised to this Court is that even though the

CBI in its' preliminary report found that huge number of illegal

appointments had been made contrary to the Rules which had in

fact resulted in undue enrichment to the illegally appointed

Teachers, the CBI did not register a regular case to prosecute

them and got contented by recommending the department

concerned as under:-

"4. CONCLUSION :

In view of the facts, circumstances and evidence discussed above, the matter is being referred to the
department with the recommendations as under :-

i) Suitable Action as deemed fit against the appointees who have been irregularly appointed to be
taken by the Director, Secondary Education, Government of Bihar.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

49/87

ii) Suitable Action as deemed fit against Smt. Shanti Devi, inspectress of School, Bihar, Smt.
Prabhavati Kumar, Inspectress of School, Bihar, Smt. Manju Singh, Distt. Inspectress of School,
Bhojpur - Rohtas, ms. Meena Kumari Rai, Distt, inspectress of School, Bhojpur and Smt, Neeta
Kumari Pandey, Distt. Inspectress of School, Singhbuoom for making irregular appointments of
LSS teachers.

iii) The Government of Bihar may initiate suitable measures to bring about system improvement in
the appointment of teachers and their monitoring by higher authority to ensure that such lapses as
have figured out in the present enquiry for not occur in future."

43. Despite submission of the CBI report revealing

startling facts and then recommendation to the State Authorities,

no action was taken for obvious reason. Right from the then

Politicians to the Assistant in the Education Department and a

large number of officers who had made illegal appointments were

likely to suffer the consequences of legal action. The CBI report

was dumped. The State respondents at a much belated stage

proceeded to take action only after the Hon'ble Division Bench of

this Court passed an order dated 19.09.2016 in C.W.J.C. No.

10002 of 2016 (
Kaushal Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.
).

The Hon'ble Division Bench having noticed that no action had

been taken by the State respondents on the report of the CBI called

upon the Principle Secretary of the Department, the Director,

Secondary Education, Regional Deputy Director of Education,

Magadh Division, Gaya to appear in Court. Subsequently, the

Hon'ble Division Bench was informed that actions have been

taken by the State upon recommendation of the CBI which are

now subject matter of large number of the individual writ petitions.

Taking note of it, the Hon'ble Division Bench observed that as
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

50/87

State has taken action, the writ petition had outlived its purpose. It

was, thus, permitted to be withdrawn.

44. In this manner despite the fact that the department

was well aware about the illegal appointments made during the

period 1980-98 and in fact an affidavit to this effect had been filed

in C.W.J.C. No. 1690 of 1997 itself, the fact remains that inquiry

which was initiated by the Cabinet (Vigilance) went in the hand of

the CBI and the CBI registered a preliminary inquiry in the year

2001 which ended in submission of a preliminary report sometime

in the year 2004 but no action was taken by the department

pursuant to the revelation made in the preliminary inquiry report

of the CBI forwarded to the State Chief Secretary vide confidential

Letter No. 3937 dated 3071-04. This shows complete inaction on

the part of the State respondents and calls upon this Court to take a

view that there were concerted efforts inside the Department itself

to delay any action against the petitioners and similarly situated

illegal appointees and others involved in this racket of illegal

appointments and it was done in order to confer them legitimacy

by continuing in service for long years. The public money kept on

flowing by way of salary, perks and other emoluments to the

illegally appointed Teachers who enjoyed the benefit of service.

45. In this Court, the petitioners have raised a submission

that the CBI report discriminates among the various Teachers whose
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

51/87

appointments have been scrutinized by calling some of them illegal

appointees whereas the others as irregular appointees. This Court need

not detain itself on this issue because what is illegal appointment and

what would be irregular appointment in legal parlance have been well

discussed by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the

case of
Uma Devi
(supra). The appointments which have taken place

without there being any advertisement, without sanction post, by the

authorities who are not competent to make regular appointments and

without there by any selection committee are illegal appointments and it

does not matter if any one else says or claims that it will be a case of

irregular appointment. Something which is illegal cannot be regularized

and this issue is no longer a res intgra.

46.
In a recent judgment in the case of the
State of Bihar v.

Devendra Sharma
reported in (2020) 15 SCC 466, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court was dealing with the cases of illegal appointments in the

Health Department of the State of Bihar against Class III and Class IV

Posts. About six thousands employees appointed by one Dr. Mallick the

then Assistant Director in the Health Department had been terminated.

Those were challenged on the ground of violation of Principle of

Natural Justice.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the said

matter noticed the views of the Constitution Bench in the case of
Uma

Devi
(supra) and held that in
Uma Devi
(supra) the submission that the

employees had legitimate expectations was negated. In paragraph '46

of the judgment it has been held as under:-

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

52/87

"46. ... The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the
administrative authority affect the person by depriving him of
some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past
been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can
legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there
have been communicated to him some rational grounds for
withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to
comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-

maker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him first an
opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should
not be withdrawn. ... There is no case that any assurance was
given by the Government or the department concerned while
making the appointment on daily wages that the status conferred
on him will not be withdrawn until some rational reason comes
into existence for withdrawing it. The very engagement was
against the constitutional scheme......."

47. The Hon'ble Supreme Court referred the
State of

Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa
reported in (1967) 1 SCR 128 :
AIR

1967 SC 1071, R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah
reported in (
1972)

1 SCC 409 and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka
reported in

(1979) 4 SCC 507 and held that there may be cases where irregular

appointments (not illegal appointments) may be made as explained in

those judgments.

48. The Hon'ble Supreme Court then approved the Full

Bench Judgment of Patna High Court in the case of
Rita Misha Vs.

Director, Primary Education
reported in (AIR 1988 Pat 26) wherein

the question posed before the Hon'ble Full Bench was whether a public

servant was entitled to payment of salary to him for the work done

despite the fact that his letter of appointment was forged, fraudulent or

illegal. The Hon'ble Full Bench held as under:-

"13. It is manifest from the above that the rights to salary, pension
and other service benefits are entirely statutory in nature in public
service. Therefore, these rights, including the right to salary,
spring from a valid and legal appointment to the post. Once it is
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

53/87

found that the very appointment is illegal and is non est in the eye
of the law, no statutory entitlement for salary or consequential
rights of pension and other monetary benefits can arise. In
particular, if the very appointment is rested on forgery, no
statutory right can flow from it."

49. The Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed an another Full

Bench judgment of this Court in the case of
Ram Sewak Yadav Vs.

The State of Bihar &Ors.
reported in (2013) 1 PLJR 964 (FB)

wherein the appellants were appointed on class IV post by the Civil

Surgeon in the Health Department but their services were terminated for

the reasons that their appointments were illegal. The Hon'ble Full

Bench of this Court held in paragraph '41' as under:-

"41. The public power to make appointment on public posts is
conferred for public good. The power is given to the officer
concerned by the Government in trust, that it shall be used and not
abused. If the trust is belied, the protection conferred upon a
government servant stands denuded. The answerability and
accountability is then individual of the officer. The Government is
duty-bound to take appropriate civil/criminal action against the
officer. The illegality in the appointment is not a one way street. If
there was someone willing to pay a price for the job, there was
another waiting to take advantage of the same by fixing a price. It
is not without reason that majority of such appointments relate to
Class III and IV posts. The standard by which the Government
professes to act is the same standard by which its actions shall be
judged. Therefore whenever the Government terminates an
appointment being illegal, it is the constitutional duty of the
Government to simultaneously take action against the officials who
belied the trust of the Government. Those who made hay while the
sun shined must see the darker cloudy days also. ......"

51. In the facts of the matter, when this Court examined the

submissions made on behalf of the petitioners, it is found that these

petitioners were given ample opportunity of hearing. They were served

with the Memo of Charge and were allowed to participate in the inquiry.

They were also served with the copy of inquiry report and were given

time to submit their show cause. Thus, the principle of natural justice

have been fully complied with. No violation of procedure estabished by

law could be shown to this Court. The petitioners, in fact, admit that

there was no advertisement in any newspaper. They claim that the posts

were advertised through the notice pasted in the office of the DI but this

would not come to their rescue. These are the cases of backdoor

appointments and, hence, the appointment of the petitioners and

continuance in service for all these years would not fetch any advantage

in their favour. None of the petitioners have in fact dislodged the

finding of illegal appointment. They are not able to establish that their

appointments were legal and valid in all respects. The credible findings

in the CBI report are in fact not contested on any cogent ground.
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

62/87

52.
In the case of
Devendra Sharma
(supra), the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has approved the view of the Hon'ble Full

Bench in the case of
Ram Sevak Yadav
(supra) that illegal

appointment which are void ab initio cannot be regularised in any

circumstances and question of regularization of their services even

by interpreting paragraph '44' of the judgment in the case of

Umadevi
(3) (supra) would not arise.

53. To this Court, it appears that these appointments are

akin to and stand on similar footing with that of those Class III and

Class IV employees who were appointed by Dr Mallick in the

Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme which were held ex facie illegal.

In fact in the cases of those appointees, the Court while dealing

with the submissions of the terminated employees in the case of

Ashwani Kumar and Others v. State of Bihar and Others

reported in (1997) 2 SCC 1, held that those recruitments were

arbitrary, capricious and null and void after considering the

Government Order dated December 3, 1980 as well as

Government Resolution dated March 25, 1983. It was also held

that none of the appointees have any accrued right in the absence

of sanctioned post and the whole exercise remained in the realm of

an unauthorised adventure. It was held that army of the employees

of the Scheme had got to be cleared lock, stock and barrel so that
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

63/87

public confidence in Government administration would not get

shattered and arbitrary actions would not get sanctified. In these

cases also the Government order and provisions of the Bihar

Education Code have been relied upon to show the appointments

of these petitioners being wholly illegal and bad in Law.

54. The Principles of nature justice stand fully complied

with and the petitioners cannot be allowed to take advantage of

their continuance over all these years when the inquiry into these

appointments was kept pending because all high-ups were

allegedly involved in this scam of illegal appointments.

55. Reliance placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble

Jharkhand High Court in the case of
Sushma Kumari @ Sushma

Kumari Devi versus the State of Jharkhand and Others
(W.P.

(S) No. 6023 of 2018) is wholly misconceived. In the said case, as

it appears from the judgment itself, the fact was that there was an

advertisement notice on 21.09.1988 and a three member selection

committee had been constituted for appointment of matric trained

teacher. Petitioner was appointed through the selection process. No

adverse remarks were made by CBI and CBI only recorded that the

"records were not available". In the said case, the Deputy Director

of Education had issued Order No. 4161 dated 22.04.1989,

therefore, it was held not a case of back door appointment. It is
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

64/87

evident from bare reading of the Judgment of the Jharkhand High

Court that the facts of the said case were quite different and

distinct.

56. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the he

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Roop Singh

Negi versus Punjab National Bank and Others
reported in (2009) 2

SCC 570 in the case of
Union of India & Ors. v. B.V. Gopinath

reported in (2014) 1 SCC 351 to submit that in this case the State

respondents have not acted in consonance with the principles of

natural justice. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the charges

levelled against the delinquent officer must be found to have been

proved and the enquiry officer has a duty to arrive at a finding upon

taking into consideration the materials brought on record by the parties.

The submission is that purported evidence collected during the

investigation by the Investigating Officer against all the accused by

itself would not be treated to be evidence in the disciplinary

proceeding. Submission is that in this case no departmental witness

appeared to prove the contents of the inquiry, therefore, it could not

have been treated as evidence.

At first instance the submission appears

impressive but then this Court is reminded of the judgment of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Bharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.

v. N.R. Vairamani
reported in (2004) 8 SCC 579 wherein the Hon'ble

Supreme Court has held that the judgment of the court cannot be cited

like an Euclid's theorem because a slight change in the facts of the case
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

65/87

would make a sea difference in the opinion of the court.

In the case of

Roop Singh Negi
(supra) there was an allegation against the delinquent

employee who was working as Manager in the branch office of the

Bank at Chandni Chauk, Delhi that he was responsible for the loss of

drawing book of which one of the two employees had been the

custodians and that the loss of drawing book would have been avoided

had they taken the due care and precaution. The employer had lodged a

first information report and after five years when the disciplinary

proceeding was initiated, the documents collected by the Investigating

officer were simply produced and the inquiry officer concluded that the

petitioner Roop Singh Negi had direct or indirect links with the culprits.

The criminal court had already passed an order of discharge against the

petitioner and it was brought to the notice of the inquiry officer but the

same was not considered.

In this background the judgment of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has been rendered in the case of
Roop Singh

Negi
(supra). The facts of the present case are that of a mass scale

illegal appointments by incompetent officers of the State on the

recommendation of the politicians without any advertisement and

without any selection committee for the purpose. In these

circumstances, it is not only the CBI report which is the basis for

arriving at a conclusion that the appointment of the petitioners

(Category I and II for the present) is illegal rather the appointments

were also against the relevant government circulars and the provisions

of the Bihar Education Code. This is in the nature of scam and in such
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

66/87

cases, it appears to this Court that 'situational modifications' with

regard to application of principle of natural justice would be

permissible.

In this regard this Court would quote the relevant part of

the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Mohinder

Singh Gill and Anr. Vs. The Chief Election Commissioner, New

Delhi and Ors
reported in AIR 1978 SC 851 wherein while dealing

with the issue of prejudice and the burden to prove prejudice, the

Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that the Court may not be taken to

say that "situational modifications to notice and hearing are altogether

impermissible. They are, as the learned Addl. Solicitor-General rightly

stressed. The glory of the law is not that sweeping rules are laid down

but that it tailors principles to practical needs, doctors remedies to suit

the patient, promotes, not freezes, life's processes, if we may mix

metaphors."
Tucker, LJ drove home this point when he observed in the

Duke of Norfolk case (1949) 1 All ER 109) in the following words:-

"There are no words which are of universal application to every
kind of inquiry .... The requirements of natural justice must
depend 14on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the
inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject-
matter that is being dealt with, and so forth."

This circumstantial flexibility of fair hearing has been
underscored in
Wiseman v. Borneman
(1971) AC 297 by Lord
Reid when he said he would be "sorry to see this fundamental
general principle degenerate into a series of hard-and-fast rules".

57. This Court therefore, finds that the judgments of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of
Roop Singh Negi
(supra) and
B.

V. Gopinath
(supra) has not laid down a hard and fast rule and would

not be applicable in the facts situation of the present case.
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

67/87

58. Learned counsel has relied upon some judgments of this

Court rendered by learned co-ordinate Benches of this Court in the case

of
Mamta Verma Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (C.W.J.C. No.
of 2022) and Kumari Manju Lata Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.

(C.W.J.C. No.
3361 of 2020) to submit that forfeiture of 100 %

pension of the petitioner in exercise of power under Rule 43(b) of the

Pension Rules at this stage cannot be sustained. It is submitted that the

appointment of the petitioners had taken place more than 30 years ago,

therefore, the Memo under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules would be

invalid.

59. This Court finds from the materials placed before this

Court that in these cases of Category I, the proceeding under Rule 43(b)

of the Pension Rules was initiated during the service period itself and

those were converted after retirement of the petitioners and further in

their first round of litigation, this Court had though quashed the

impugned order of termination but at the same time granted liberty to

the Regional Deputy Director of the concerned Divisions to proceed

afresh. Sofar as the Category III cases are concerned, in those cases, the

final decision is yet to be taken.

60.
In the totality of the circumstances, since this Court has

found that this is a case akin to and seems to be nearer to the case of

appointments of Class III and Class IV posts in the Tuberculosis

Eradication Scheme by Dr. Mallick and this Court has noticed the
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

68/87

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Devendra

Sharma
(supra), this Court finds no reason to interfere with the same.

61. This Court is therefore, of the considered opinion that the

impugned orders need no interference in exercise of power of this

Court under
Article 226
of the Constitution of India.

Category II Cases

62. In the category II cases, there are altogether nine writ

applications. For reference, this Court would take the pleadings from

CWJC No. 354 of 2023 (
Nirmala Vs. State of Bihar and Ors
).

63. In this writ application, the petitioner has challenged the

order dated 09.12.2022 passed by State Appellate Authority in O.A. No.

419 of 2022 and also Memo No. 462 dated 09.10.2020 passed by

Director (Administration) -cum- Additional Chief Secretary, Education

Department, Government of Bihar (Respondent No. 2). The petitioners

have also prayed for grant and payment of retiral benefits along with all

other consequential benefits.

64. By the impugned order, the service of the petitioners

have been terminated. The order of termination/dismissal from service

was challenged by the petitioner Nirmala Bhartibefore the State

Appellate Authority. The Chairperson (A) and the State Appellate

Authority held that there was a departmental proceeding conducted after

calling for an explanation from the petitioner. The petitioners were

provided with a copy of the inquiry report and an opportunity to show

cause, therefore, the principle of natural justice has been duly followed.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

69/87

The appeal preferred by the petitioner has been disallowed. So far as

other petitioners are concerned, they have also been dismissed from

service on the ground that they were illegally appointed and their

appointments were void ab initio.

65. In this category II what the CBI has found in course of

preliminary inquiry are given hereunder in a tabular form case wise:-

66. This Court finds from the facts of the cases stated above

that these petitioners are identically situated with the petitioners of the

Ist Category save and except that in the Category II, the petitioners have

been dismissed/terminated from the services whereas in Category I,

action has been taken in terms of the pension rules.

67. For the reasonings and rationals provided in Category I,

this Court takes a view that the petitioners in Category II are also not

entitled for any relief. Their appointments are found to be illegal,

arbitrary and capricious and void ab initio. They do not acquire any

right of salary or the post retiral benefits.

Category III Cases

68. In Category III cases, the petitioners have moved this

Court against the letters issued under the signature of the Regional

Deputy Director, Education calling upon them to submit their show

cause within 15 days from the date of issuance of the letter. The letter

has been issued with an inquiry report in which the Inquiry Officer has

reported that the appointment of these petitioners have been found

illegal/irregular by the CBI in its report. Instead of submitting their

second show cause, the petitioners have rushed to this Court in an

attempt to stop the respondents from passing an appropriate order.

Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

70. One person, namely, Sanjay Bihari Pandit is a male

but was appointed in LSS (women) cadre.

71. In C.W.J.C. No. 439 of 2022 and C.W.J.C. No. 4981

of 2022, the petitioners have also challenged the inquiry report.

The facts of C.W.J.C. No. 693 of 2022 (
Smt. Tara Singh Vs. The

State of Bihar and Ors
) are slightly different inasmuch as against

her a proceeding under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules has been

initiated vide Memo No. 1388 dated 24.11.2021 (Annexure '11' to

the writ application). She has been served with a memo of charge

dated 24.11.2021 (Annexure '12'). It is her contention that she has

superannuated from her service on 30.11.2014 itself. It, however,

transpires on perusal of Annexure '11' to the writ application that

the proceedings were initiated against this petitioner earlier and the

same was converted into a proceeding under Rule 43(b) of the

Pension Rules vide Memo No. 1855 dated 24.08.2016 which was

within a period of two years from the date of her attaining the age

of superannuation. By Annexure '11', the Inquiry Officer and

Presenting Officer have been appointed. As regards the petitioner

Smt. Tara Singh, CBI has found in its preliminary report that she

was over-aged and had been appointed on the recommendation of

the politicians without following proper procedure for such
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

83/87

appointments. No advertisement of the post was made by any local

newspaper.

72. The materials available on the record would show

that this petitioner has been called upon to participate in the

inquiry by Letter No. 513 dated 17.12.2006. In the writ

application, there is no averment that the proceeding against the

petitioner was not converted under Rule 43(b) in the year 2016.

Her alleged illegal appointment took place in the year 1982 but

that illegality allegedly continued till her retirement, therefore, a

challenge to the initiation of the proceeding under Rule 43(b)

would not be tenable.

73. Be that as it may, this Court is of the considered

opinion that the petitioners in category III should have co-operated

in course of inquiry by submitting their response and participation

before the Inquiry Officer and the disciplinary authority. Instead of

doing that, their effort is to somehow prolong the ongoing inquiry

and culmination of the disciplinary proceeding. In their cases also,

the principle of natural justice is being followed by the State-

respondents.

74. Thus, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the

impugned office memo, the charge and/or the inquiry report in this

writ application. The petitioners must participate in the inquiry,
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

84/87

submit their second show cause within a period of two weeks from

today whereupon the Inquiry Officer/ disciplinary authority, as the

case may be, shall proceed in the matter and take appropriate

steps/decision. If they have attained the age of superannuation, the

disciplinary authority shall consider converting the proceeding

under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules and pass an appropriate

order within three months from the said date.

75. Before this Court parts with its judgment, the Court

finds it just and proper to record that in all these writ applications,

learned counsel for the petitioners have raised plea of violation of

principles of natural justice. They have gone to the extent of

submitting that the CBI has not examined the appointees, however,

this Court has noticed from the preliminary report of the CBI that

they have examined some of the appointees also. The petitioners

have been given enough opportunity to rebut the specific case of

the respondent-State in term of the Memo of Charge that the

appointments in Category-I and Category-II cases were done

without advertisement and selection procedure. In category-III

cases the State-Respondent have served second show cause on the

petitioners. This Court is of the considered opinion that where the

illegality writs large on the face of the kind of allegations made in

the preliminary inquiry, the principle of natural justice cannot be
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

85/87

stretched to the extent of rejecting the report of the CBI as a waste

paper. It is to be remembered that the matter relating to illegal

appointments of these petitioners were raised as back as in the year

1998 and the inquiry report of the CBI was submitted in the year

2004 itself. But it was kept pending for no valid reason and had the

Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court not called upon the Principal

Secretary of the Education Department, Government of Bihar to

explain as to why no action has been taken on the inquiry report of

the CBI, the matter would have remained as it is.

76. The huge delay on the part of the State respondents

by sitting over the preliminary inquiry report of the CBI has done

a lot of damage to the interest of the State. The delay alone has

given rise to a spacious plea that at this stage the petitioners have

continued over 30 years, therefore, no action may be taken against

them in accordance with law. Although this Court has negated this

plea but at the same time it is noticed that by virtue of the

appointments which were wholly illegal, public money has been

disbursed to the illegal appointees conferring them the benefits of

pay and perks during all these years. This Court being a

constitutional Court sitting under
Article 226
of the Constitution of

India deems it just and proper to take judicial notice of the

principles of public accountability. The case of Vineet Narain and
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

86/87

Ors. Vs. the Union of India and Ors.
reported in (1996) 2 SCC

199, is a step forward towards accountability in public life. The

preliminary investigation report of the CBI is clearly indicating

towards extraneous consideration which has taken place in the

matter of large scale appointments and promotions in the LSS

(Women wing) in the State of Bihar during the period 1980-1998.

The case was handed over to CBI but why CBI remained

contented by only submitting a preliminary inquiry report is

something which is required to be looked into by the CBI itself at

this stage. This Court is concerned because it is of the opinion that

those who were involved in keeping aside the law and the

procedures for appointment on public post should not be allowed

to go scot-free only because they have succeeded in somehow

stalling the consequential action. In the totality of the

circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion as under:-

(i) The CBI should take the case to a logical end. Its'

preliminary inquiry report is available on the record indicating the

manner in which appointments were done on political

recommendations and by the authorities in the Education Department

who were not competent, without advertisement and without there being

any selection process. The CBI is, therefore, obliged to consider as to

whether or not its' preliminary report should be converted in a regular
Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023

87/87

case and the matter be investigated in accordance with law for its

logical conclusion; and

(ii) The Additional Chief Secretary of the Education

Department, Government of Bihar is also required to look into the

reason(s) for the huge delay in not taking the consequential action

pursuant to the report of the CBI submitted in the year 2004. Those who

are behind this inaction are required to be identified and appropriate

action is to be considered.

77. Accordingly, this Court having taken judicial notice

of the above mentioned facts emerging from the pleadings on the

record and finding that the CBI is already party respondent in

some of the writ applications, directs the Director, CBI and the

Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Education, Government

of Bihar to consider taking appropriate action within a period of

one month from the date of receipt/communication of this order.

78. These writ applications are, thus, disposed of in the

aforesaid terms.
