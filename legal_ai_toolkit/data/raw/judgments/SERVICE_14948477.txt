ORDER

Per Hon'ble Mr. Ajay Pratap Singh, Member (Judicial):

The instant Original Application has come on being
referred under
Section 26
of Administrative Tribunals Act,
1985 [for brevity herein after referred as Act, 1985] to the
Third Member in view of difference of opinion between the two
Hon'ble Members in their respective common order/Order

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

dated 03.07.2025 passed by the Hon'ble Member (Judicial)
and Hon'ble Member (Administrative).

2. The order was reserved in the OA on 10.03.2025 by
the Division Bench consisting of Hon'ble Shri Umesh
Gajankush, Member (Judicial) and Hon'ble Shri Santosh
Mehra, Member (Administrative). The Hon'ble Member
(Judicial) of the said Division Bench recorded his findings and
conclusion and dismissed the OA as no case is made out for
interference in the OA. However, the Hon'ble Member
(Administrative) has parly allowed the OA and recorded his
concurrence in full with the first thirty six paragraphs of
common order dated 03.07.2025 passed by Hon'ble Member
(Judicial) but taken a different view with different conclusions
of the order passed by Hon'ble Member (Judicial).

FACTS IN BREIF

3. Though, the Hon'ble Member (Administrative) has
fully concurred with first-36 paragraphs of common order
dated 03.07.2025 passed by Hon'ble Member (Judicial) but
also recorded disagreement with the remaining paragraphs of
said order i.e. 03.07.2025. Before adverting to the issue
though no point of difference has been enumerated in the
reference with regard to common order dated 03.07.2025
passed by Hon'ble Member (Judicial) and Hon'ble Member
(Administrative), for the sake of convenience and clarity,
briefly adumbrated facts as evident from the material placed
on record in case in hand are as under -

3.1 Applicants were initially appointed on the post of
Inspector and initial seniority fixed as per marks obtained in
the selection. Applicants, while working on the initial post of
Inspector were superseded by reserved category-junior
employees and promoted from post of Inspector (Central
Excise) to the post of Superintendent. The applicants also

KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

later on promoted to the post of Superintendent but after
junior-reserved category and applicants' seniority should have
been assigned over and above junior-reserved candidates
promoted earlier than applicants in the cadre of
Superintendent by following the catch-up rule. The impugned
promotion orders to the post of Assistant Commissioner
(Customs & Excise), impugned draft seniority list dated
23.09.2019 of Superintendents as on 01.01.2019 is contrary
to law laid down in case of
M.Nagaraj & Ors. Vs. Union of
India & Ors.
(2006) 8 SCC 212.

3.2 Respondents have not conducted any survey to
collect quantifiable data to provide reservation in the matter
of promotion or to grant consequential seniority and failed to
show reasons to grant reservation in promotion to the post of
Superintendents in Central Excise Deptt. now Goods and
Services Tax and thus effecting reservation in promotion from
post of Superintendents to Assistant Commissioner is illegal
and contrary to
Article 16(4A)
& (4B) of the Constitution of
India and law
laid down in
case of
M.Nagaraj
(supra).

3.3 Present OA is against illegal reservation in promotion
in cadre of Superintendent/Assistant Commissioner in
Central Excise Department to set aside promotion orders on
the post of Assistant Commissioner and seniority list dated
23.09.2019 by respondents of the post of Superintendents to
the extent it provides reservation in promotion and granted
accelerated seniority and also to conduct DPC or Review DPC
to the post of Assistant Commissioner based on seniority-
cum-merit without providing any reservation in promotional
posts with all consequential benefits from the date their
juniors were promoted.

3.4 Per contra, official respondents filed reply and made
averments that as per provisions of Constitution of India in
public employment SC/ST candidates provided for 15%

O.M. dated 29.03.2007 addressed to all States/Union
Territories and clarified that observation made in
M. Nagaraj

(supra) regarding creamy-layer amongst SC/ST are mere
obiter-dicta and per-incuriam and do not flow from and cannot
be reconciled with the nine-judge Bench decision in case of

Indra Sawhney & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors.
, 1992
Supp. (3) SCC 217. The reference to creamy layer in the
concluding paragraph and other portions of the judgments
does not relate to the SCs and STs.

Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case of
M.Nagaraj
(supra) reiterated that state required to
collect quantifiable data in the cadre showing backwardness
of class and inadequacy in reservation to provide reservation
in promotion. Consequent to amendment the DOP&T OM
dated 11.07.2002 clarified that SC/ST candidates appointed
by promotion on their own merit and owing to reservation will
be adjusted against un-reserved points in reservation roster
and not against reserved points.

3.5 Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 15.11.2017
in
Jarnail Singh and Ors. Vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta &
Ors. [Jarnail Singh
(1)] (2018) 10 SCC 396 decided to
examine whether earlier decision in
M. Nagaraj
(supra)
requires reconsideration or not on the issue as to whether
test of backwardness would at all apply in case of SC/ST.
Hon'ble Supreme Court 5-Judge Constitution Bench in

Jarnail Singh & Ors. Vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta & Ors.
[Jarnail Singh
(2)] (2022) 10 SCC 595 held that
M. Nagaraj

(supra) judgment does not need to be referred to seven-judge
Bench and conclusion in
M.Nagaraj
(supra) that State has to
collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of SC and ST
being contrary to the nine-judge Bench in
Indra Sawhney
(1)
(supra) held to be invalid to this extent.
3.6 Respondents have further averred in the reply that
DOP&T vide OM dated 30.01.1997 provided for catch-up-rule

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

OA No.407/2020

and subsequently the Constitution of India was amended
retrospectively by 85th
Amendment Act, 2001
,
Article 16
(4A)
w.e.f. 17.06.1995 and catch-up rule repealed and OM
dated 21.01.2002 issued to negate effects of
Article 16 (4A)
of
the Constitution of India w.e.f. 17.06.1995 to allow the
government servants belonging to SC/ST to retain the
seniority in the case of promotion by virtue of rule of
reservation. Thus, after issuance of O.M. dated 21.01.2002,
OM dated 30.01.1997 stands withdrawn, the seniority of
government servants shall be determined and revised as if
that OM was never issued and as of now, catch-up-rule does
not exist for determining the seniority.

3.7 In case of
State of Tripura Vs. Jayant
Chakraborty
, vide decision dated 14.11.2017 matter referred
to the Constitution Bench and respondents further submitted
that after insertion of
Article 16 (4A)
, the constitutional
validity upheld in case of
M. Nagaraj
(supra) and catch-up-
rule is against legislative intent for insertion of
Article 16(4A).

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
M. Nagaraj
(supra) &
B.K. Pavitra Vs. Union of India & Ors.[B.K.Pavitra(1)],
reported in (2017) 4 SCC 620 already clarified that catch-
up-rule is a judicially evolved concept arising out of service
jurisprudence but cannot override constitutional amendment

Article 16(4A)
which provides consequential seniority to the
SC/ST.

3.8 Respondents also stated in the reply that present OA
is barred by limitation prescribed under
Section 21
of Act,
1985 and representation does not cure limitation. The officers
promoted to the grade of Assistant Commissioner vide
impugned orders and also promoted during 1998 to 2006 as
Superintendent based on all India seniority prior to decision
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
M. Nagaraj
(supra),
hence the question of review of promotion effected pursuant
to guidelines by DOP"&T with regard to reservation by
determining inadequacy in cadre based on collection of data
NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

in the cadre. DOP&T OM dated 21.01.2002 also provides for
consequential seniority to the reserved category candidates.

3.9 Respondents further stated in the written statement
that promotion made to posts of Superintendent and
Assistant Commissioner in Central Excise Department (now
Central Goods & Service Tax) CGST & Central Excise is based
on instructions of DOP&T on issue of reservation and
consequential seniority under
Article 16(4A)
of the
Constitution of India and impugned orders of promotions and
consequential seniority list dated 25.09.2019 prepared in
accordance with settled legal position.

3.10 Official respondents also filed additional affidavit
stating that applicants are trying to unsettle the settled
seniority position of Superintendents cadre, the impugned
seniority cannot be upset and present OA is grossly barred by
limitation.

3.11 Respondents have also averred that the higher post
of Assistant Commissioner as on 04.01.2021 and 2118
number of additional posts have been created by respondents
vide order dated 21.12.2013, available only upto 31.12.2021
out of which more than 1500 were lying vacant and shall
lapse by virtue of remaining vacant on 31.12.2021.

4. Thereafter, on conclusion of the arguments
advanced by learned counsel for the parties before the said
Division Bench of the CAT Mumbai Bench, Mumbai, Hon'ble
Member (Judicial) wrote an order dated 03.07.2025 based on
law
laid down by
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Indra
Sawhney
(supra),
Sudhakar Baburao Nangnure Vs.
Nareshwar Raghunathrao Shende & Ors.
(2020) 11 SCC
399, Chettian Veetil Ahmad Vs. Taluk Land Board (1980)
SCC 499, M. Nagaraj
(supra),
Jarnail Singh
(1) (supra),

Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) and placed reliance on paragraph

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

38 of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) that before providing for
reservation in promotions to a cadre, the State is obligated to
collect quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of reservation
of SCs/STs. Collection of information regarding inadequacy of
representation of SCs/STs cannot be with reference to the
entire service or class/group but it should be relatable to the
grade/category of posts to which promotion is sought. Cadre,
which should be the Unit for the purpose of collection of
quantifiable data in relation to the promotional post(s), would
be meaningless if data pertaining to representation of SC/ST
is reference to entire service. So also relied paragraph 4 that
there cannot be the test to proportion of SCs and STs to the
population of India be the test for determining adequacy of
representation in promotional posts. So also it is for the State
to assess the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in
promotional posts by taking into account relevant factors.

In
para 69, it has also been observed that State should justify
reservation in promotion with respect to the cadre to which
promotion is made to give correct picture of the inadequacy of
representation of SCs/STs in the cadre of relation to which
reservation in promotion is sought to be made, rosters are
prepared cadre-wise and the cadre which is a part of a group
is the unit and the data has to be collected with respect to
each cadre and same is in consonance with law
laid down in

M. Nagaraj
(supra) and
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) and
individual case to be answered accordingly.

So also
considered principles
laid down in
case of
State of Punjab &
Ors. vs. Davinder Singh
(2025) 1 SCC.

Hon'ble Member
(Judicial) observed that issue in case of
Davinder Singh

(supra) was related to issue of sub-classification whereas
judgment in case of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) was on the
issue in respect of reservation in promotion and rejected the
contention of applicants and placed reliance on majority
decision by Third Member order dated 26.06.2024 in case of
CAT Mumbai Bench in OA No.557/2023 Valerie Avinash

OA No.407/2020

Dhepe vs. UOI & Ors. as correct position of law upholding
order dated 02.04.2025 of Hon'ble Member (Administrative).

The Hon'ble Member (Judicial) also considered that there is
no challenge to the OM whereas impugned promotion orders
and seniority list 23.09.2019 is based on said O.M. Hon'ble
Member (Judicial) in his common order dated 03.07.2025
also considered in para 40, that official respondents have
justified action of grant of reservation in promotion in year
2023 based on OM dated 12.04.2022 issued after judgment
in case of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) and OM dated
12.04.2022 still holds the field in light of law
laid down in

case of
M. Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra).

Hon'ble
Member (Judicial) vide common order dated 03.07.2025
upheld methodology followed by respondents while dealing
with and implementing law
laid down by
Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) and based on OM
dated 12.04.2022 to grant promotions in year 2023 in view of
judgment in case of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) in case of
reservation in promotion. The Hon'ble Member (Judicial), vide
common order dated 03.07.2025 dismissed the OA and
upheld orders of promotion as well as impugned seniority list
as respondents have correctly acted in light of OM dated
12.04.2022 by collection of quantifiable data in cadre for
reservation in promotion. Hon'ble Member (Judicial) held -

43. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, no
case is made out for interference in the impugned
ad-hoc promotion orders and Provisional Seniority
List dated 23rd September, 2019. Therefore, OA is
liable to be dismissed and is hereby dismissed.
Pending MAs, if any, with no order as to costs."

5. On receipt of aforesaid common order dated 03.07.2025
authored by Hon'ble Member (Judicial). The Hon'ble Member
(Administrative) on receipt of pre-delivery order recorded
respectful disagreement, however, points of difference not
been recorded in this common order dated 03.07.2025. In his
common order dated 03.07.2025 in paragraph no.3 Hon'ble
NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

Member (Administrative) has stated that he fully concurred
with the first 36 paras which finishes on page no. 103 of this
pre-delivery order and also observed that first 36 paras upto
page of 103 of the pre-delivery order can be construed to be
part of his order also but the conclusions are at variance with
those of the Hon'ble Member (J). Hon'ble Member
(Administrative) expressed disagreement on the issue involved
in the OA seeking direction to set aside seniority list dated
23.09.2019 of post of Superintendent and re-cast based on
general seniority following catch-up rule and also quashed
impugned promotion orders of Assistant Commissioner dated
23.02.2017 and 11.05.2018 and directed to consider for
promotion as Assistant Commissioner on regular basis by
conducting appropriate DPC based on seniority without
providing reservation in promotion with all consequential
benefits and not to provide reservation in promotion till
requisite exercise as mandated in
M.Nagaraj
(supra) is
satisfied.

The Hon'ble Member (A) considered that crux of the
matter is whether criteria
laid down in

M. Nagaraj
(supra)
whether inadequacy of representation and efficiency in
administration have been adhered to or not in order to
provide reservation in promotion and also to grant accelerated
consequential seniority.

The Hon'ble Member (Administrative)
in para 15 of his order dated 03.07.2025 also considered

Jarnail Singh
(2)(supra) and stated that with respect to
collection of data on the basis of cadre with respect to
inadequate representation in promotion and observed that
the contention of respondents not accepted as exercise as
directed by
M.Nagaraj
(supra) and other judgments have not
been carried out and respondents are not justified in dividing
the posts between UR, SCs and STs etc.

So also held that
nothing is brought on record by respondents to show a proper
exercise to determine the issue of efficiency of administration
on the basis of APARs/ACRs and held that impugned orders
of promotion and existing seniority list dated 23.9.2019 is not
NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

OA No.407/2020

in accordance with judgments of
M.Nagaraj
(supra) and other
judgments and necessity for collection of quantifiable data
and efficiency criteria for providing reservation in promotion.
The Hon'ble Member (Administrative) expressed his
disagreement as above and partly allowed the OA directing
respondents not to implement any form of reservation in
promotion or accelerated seniority in the cadre of
Superintendent or Assistant Commissioner and quashed
promotion orders (Annexure A-1 & A-2) and seniority list
dated 23.09.2019 (Annexure A-3) directing respondents to
grant promotions strictly on the basis of seniority-cum-
suitability as per original seniority list in feeder cadre of
Superintendent with all consequential benefits. Hon'ble
Member (Administrative) dissented with the view expressed by
Hon'ble Member (Judicial) and opined, which reads as under-

"27. I am of the considered view that the promotion
orders and seniority list in question have been issued in
contravention of the principles
laid down by
the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in
M. Nagraj vs. Union of India
and
other judgments, particularly with regard to the necessity
for collection of quantifiable data, and efficiency criteria
for providing reservation in promotion. In view of the
above facts and circumstances, the O.A is partly allowed.
It is hereby, ordered:

A. The impugned Promotion (Ad-hoc) Order
dated 23.02.2017 (Annexure A1), the
Promotion (Ad-hoc) Order dated 11.05.2018
(Annexure A2), and the Seniority List dated
23.09.2019 (Annexure A3), issued by the
Respondents, are hereby quashed and set
aside to the extent they:

a. Provide reservation in promotion without
satisfaction of the Constitutional
preconditions;

b. Grant accelerated seniority to SCs/STs
candidates in violation of the catch-up
rule.

B. The Respondents are also directed not
to implement any form of reservation in
promotion or accelerated seniority in the
cadre of Superintendent or Assistant
Commissioner unless and until all the
Constitutional prerequisites as
laid down by

the Hon'ble Supreme Court are demonstrably
fulfilled.

[Emphasis supplied]

6. Since different observations and findings recorded by
both Hon'ble Members while deciding OA No.407/2020 by
their separate orders, but points of difference has not been
enumerated in the present reference and the reference being
decided based on principle culled out from constitutional
jurisprudence in reservation in public employment.

7. On receipt of aforesaid disagreement by following the
principles of natural justice, learned counsel appearing for
the parties were giving opportunity to address their
arguments.

8. Having heard Shri Kumar Parimal, learned counsel
for the applicants, Shri R.R. Shetty, learned senior counsel
assisted by Shri Sachin Patil, Advocate for official
respondents and Ms. Disha Wadekar Advocate with Ms.
Varishtha Singh Advocate for private respondents and also
perused the material placed on record.

SUBMISSIONS

9. Shri Kumar Parimal, learned counsel for applicants
supporting the view of Hon'ble Member (Administrative) and
criticizing order passed by Hon'ble Member (Judicial)
reiterated his submissions and can be summarized as under-

(i) Applicants were initially appointed on the post of
Inspector (Central Excise) and reserved category -
junior employees on the basis of reservation in
promotion, promoted to the post of Superintendent
and thereafter applicants also have been promoted
on the posts of Superintendent - but respondents
have not given benefits to the applicants of catch-up

rule/principle. The respondents also issued order
dated 11.06.2018 and 23.02.2017 of promotion to
the grade of Assistant Commissioner of Customs and
Central Excise against temporary posts. During
pendency of the OA also issued promotion orders
vide office order dated 13.01.2023 and 01.11.2023 of
Assistant Commissioner of Customs and Indirect
Taxes. So also impugned draft seniority list of
Superintendent under Chief Commissioner, CGST &
CX, Mumbai Zone is contrary to law
laid down in

case of
M. Nagaraj
(supra),
Uttar Pradesh Power
Corporation Limited Vs. Rajesh Kumar
(2012) 7
SCC 1, B.K. Pavitra (1) (2017) 4 SCC 620 and
Jarnail Singh (2) (supra),
Mukesh Kumar Vs. State
of Uttarakhand
(
2020 ) 3 SCC 1, S. Panneer
Selvam Vs. State of Tamil Nadu
(2015 10 SCC

292.

(ii) The Constitution Bench in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) has
clearly laid down certain conditions that there must
be compelling reasons for making reservation in
promotion and the State is not bound to make
reservation for SC and ST in matters of promotion.
Reservation in
Article 16(4)
and
Article 16(4A)
is
enabling provision and the discretion of appropriate
government is subject to existence of backwardness
inadequacy of representation in public employment
and efficiency of administration as required under

Article 335
and to obliterate the creamy layer. The
respondents have failed to identify and measure the
backwardness and inadequacy and efficiency in
administration.

There is no collection of quantifiable
data as to population of India on the backwardness
of SCs and STs and the seven Judge Bench of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of State of Punjab &

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

Ors. vs. Davinder Singh & Ors.
(2025) 1 SCC 1
has held that for collection of quantifiable data to
determine inadequacy of representation, cadre as a
Unit cannot be taken up. The respondents are
bound to collect quantifiable data and take the total
population of SCs and STs and its representation in
the public employment, while determining the
adequacy of the representation. The cadre cannot be
taken as a Unit for determination of adequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in public
employment.

So also the seven-judge, Constitution
Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of

Davinder Singh
(supra) observed that as
applicability of quantifiable data on backwardness in
so far SCs and STs and applicability of creamy layer
principles even to SCs and STs is upheld in
unanimously decision of five-Judge judgment of
Constitution Bench in
M.Nagaraj
(supra) and
respondents have issued impugned orders of
promotion and seniority list without compliance of
mandate of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
M. Nagaraj

(supra).

(iii) The Constitution Bench decision in
M.Nagaraj

(supra) mandates the State to demonstrate the
collection of quantifiable data as determining factor
for inadequacy in public employment, backwardness
and overall administrative efficiency, there is no data
collected by respondents to grant reservation in
promotion to the posts of Assistant Commissioner,
Customs and Central Excise and until and unless
quantifiable data is collected principle of
consequential seniority cannot be applied and there
cannot be reservation in promotion to the posts of
Assistant Commissioner and every time efficiency in

administration and exclusion of creamy layer to be
examined to grant benefits of reservation in
promotion.

(iv) The nine-Judge Bench decision in case of
Indra
Sawhney
(supra) decided on 16.11.1992. Hon'ble
Supreme Court in majority opinion held that
reservation is permissible at the time of initial
recruitment and not in promotion. By the 77th
Amendment,
Article 16(4-A)
and
16(4-B)
are only
enabling provisions that the State is empowered to
extant reservation. If the State has quantifiable data
to show inadequacy of representation can make
reservations in promotion keeping in mind
maintenance of efficiency is as indicated by
Article
of the Constitution of India.

(v) The Five-Judge Constitution Bench, judgment in
case of
M. Nagaraj
(supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that the State concerned will have to show in
each case the existence of the compelling reasons
namely backwardness, inadequacy of representation
and overall administrative efficiency before making
provision for reservation in promotion.
Article 16(4-
A)
is an enabling provision and State is not bound to
make reservation for SCs/STs in matters of
promotions. The official respondents failed to collect
quantifiable data showing inadequacy of
representation and in addition to compliance with

Article 335
and State has to see ceiling limit of 50%
and creamy layer.

(vi) In case of
U.P. Power Corporation vs. Rajesh
Kumar & Ors.
(2012) 7 SCC 1, Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that
Article 16(4-A)
and
16(4-B)
are
enabling provision and State can make provision for
NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

reservation in promotion on certain basis or
foundation and in each case a fresh exercise in the
light of the Constitution Bench in
M. Nagaraj

(supra) is mandatory requirement. Respondents
have not carried out any exercise and there is no
collection of data to show compelling reasons, hence
the impugned orders of promotion as well as grant of
consequential seniority in the cadre of
Superintendent deserves to be quashed and set
aside.

(vii) In
B.K. Pavitra (1) Vs. Union of India & Ors
.

(2017) 4 SCC 620, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
State has to place exercise undertaken for
determination of inadequacy of representation and
overall efficiency under
Article 16(4-A)
and roster
promotee will not be entitled for consequential
seniority who are otherwise junior and catch-up rule
will be applicable and seniority to those promoted
later cannot be denied seniority on account of
reservation policy. In the present case there is no
iota of evidence to show as to collection of
quantifiable data of population of SCs and STs and
consequential seniority based on roster promotee to
juniors cannot be granted and catch-up-rule will
apply.

(viii) The Five-Judge Constitution Bench judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Jarnail Singh
(1)
(supra).

Their Lordships held that in
M.Nagaraj

(supra) the creamy layer test to SCs and STs in
exercise of applications of the basic structure test to
uphold the constitutional amendments to
Article
16(4-A)
and
15(4-B)
and when applying the
principles of reservation will be well within their
jurisdiction to exclude the creamy layer from such

KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

groups or sub-groups.

In the nine-Judge
Constitution Bench decision in case of
Indra
Sawhney
(supra) the creamy layer principle is
applied and creamy layer SEBCS are excluded to
grant benefits of reservation.

Respondents have not
applied principle of creamy layer to exclude SCs and
STs to provide reservation in promotion vide
impugned orders and same are liable to be quashed
and set aside as dictum of
M.Nagaraj
(supra) and

Jarnail Singh
(1) (supra) not been complied with.

(ix) In Jarnail Singh (1), Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held that quantifiable data shall be collected by the
State on the parameters as stipulated in
M. Nagaraj

(supra) on the inadequacy of the representation
which can be tested by the Courts and the data
should be relatable to the cadre concerned. The
Union or State in the present case executives have
not undertaken exercise to show compelling reasons
determining adequacy of representation of SCs and
STs by collection and analysis of quantifiable data in
the cadre of Assistant Commissioners and impugned
promotion orders deserve to be set aside as requisite
exercise has not been carried out to show
inadequacy of representation in the cadre.

(x) In case of Jarnail Singh (1), Hon'ble Supreme
Court has held that the judgment in
M. Nagaraj

(supra) does not need to be referred to a seven-judge
Bench and conclusion in
M.Nagaraj
(supra) that the
State has to collect quantifiable data showing
backwardness of the SCs and STs being contrary to
the nine-judge Bench in
Indra Sawhney
(1) (supra)
held to be invalid to this extent.

(xi) Mukesh Kumar and Anr. vs. State of Uttarakhand

& Ors., reported in (2020) 3 SCC 1. Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that
Article 16(4)
and
16(4-A)
do
not confer fundamental right to claim reservation in
promotions being in nature of enabling provisions,
vesting discretion on the State government to
consider providing reservations, if circumstances so
warrant. State cannot be directed to provide
reservation for appointment in public employment.
State is also not bound to provide reservation in
promotion to SCs and STs. So also held that if the
decision of the government is challenged in the
Court, the State concerned shall have to place before
the Court the requisite quantifiable data and satisfy
that such reservation became necessary on account
of inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in a
particular class or classes of posts without affecting
general efficiency of administration by
Article 335.

The respondents in present case have not shown any
material to show compelling reasons for extent of
reservation.

(xii)
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court
has observed that constitution Bench in Jarnail
Singh (1) had rejected the request for
reconsideration of law
laid down in
case of
M.
Nagaraj
(supra), Their Lordships held that in M.
Nagaraj - it has been held that it is open to State to
provide for reservation in promotion subject to
limitation that there must exist compelling reasons
for backwardness, inadequacy of representation in a
class of post(s) keeping in mind the overall
administrative efficiency.

The appropriate
Government has to apply the cadre strength as a
unit in the operation of the roster in order to

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'

ascertain whether a given class/group is adequately
represented in the service and the collection of
quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of
representation as stipulated by
M. Nagaraj
(supra) is
relatable to cadre concerned according to Jarnail
Singh (1). There has to be some quantifiable data in
cadre of Assistant Commissioner to show
inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs to justify
impugned orders.

(xiii) In
Manoj Parihar and Others Vs. State of Jammu
and Kashmir & Ors.
(2022) 14 SCC 72. Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that the roster system is only
for the purpose of ensuring that the quantum of
reservation is reflected in the recruitment process
and roster points do not determine seniority.

(xiv) The seven-Judge Constitution Bench judgment in
case of
State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Davinder Singh
& Ors
(2025) 1 SCC 1. Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held that the observations in M. Nagaraj that
adequate reservation of the class or group must be
measured against the cadre is contrary to the plain
language of
Article 16(4)
and
16 (4-A)
and State
must collect data on the inadequacy of
representation in the services of the State. So also in
paragraph 519 and 520.7, held that State must
evolve a policy for identifying the creamy layer even
from SCs and STs so as to exclude them from the
benefit of affirmative action to achieve the real
equality as enshrined in the constitution.

So also
held that the finding of
M. Nagaraj
(supra),
Jarnail
Singh
(1) (supra) and Davinder Singh (2020) 8 SCC
1 to the effect that creamy layer principle is also
applicable to SCs and STs lays down the correct
position of law.

10. Shri R.R. Shetty, learned senior counsel with Shri Sachin
Patil, Advocate for official respondents critizing order passed by
Hon'ble Member (Administrative) and supporting order passed
by Hon'ble Member (Judicial) argued and can be summarized as
under -

(i) Clause 4A of
Article 16
of the Constitution of India
contains an enabling provision to the

State/executives to make reservation in promotion
subject to essential exercise to undertake the
adequacy of representation and impact on efficiency
in the administration. The respondents have
collected quantifiable data in the cadre of Assistant
Commissioner of Customs and Indirect Taxes in
CBIT and Customs against existing posts and DPC
was held and assessment of DPC provided data in
the said cadre on the inadequacy of representation
of SCs/STs employees and taken a conscious
decision on inadequacy of representation of SCs and
STs in the cadre in question. So also after analyzing
the quantifiable data in the cadre being relevant and
drawn conclusions to implement reservation in
promotion following DOP&T OM dated 12.04.2012,
satisfying the enabling provision for providing
reservation as mandated by dictum of
M. Nagaraj

(supra) and clarified by Hon'ble Court in case of

Jarnail Singh
(2)(supra) and OM dated 12.04.2022,
it is well settled in law that adequacy of
representation has to be assessed with reference to
the cadre, a benchmark on adequacy and not to be
linked with population of SCs and STs as a measure
of adequacy. The respondents have taken care of
efficiency in administration and the eligible employee
assessed on merit with respect to prescribed
benchmark and officers graded fit and based on

OA No.407/2020

vigilance status and ACRs/APARs for reckonable five
years and also taken into account general service
record and efficiency of administration not affected.

(ii) Following the mandate of Constitution Bench in case
of
M. Nagaraj
(supra) and the three-Judge Bench
decision in
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra) and after
carrying out requisite exercises, the respondents
decided to implement reservation in promotion in the
cadres of Superintendent and Assistant
Commissioners with consequential seniority and in
view of OM dated 12.04.2022. The consequential
seniority does not require application of the creamy
layer test, it is incidence of promotion. All the
promotion orders issued after analysis of data in the
cadre as to shortfall in the roster points for SCs and
STs.

(iii) The seven-Judge Constitution Bench judgment in case
of
Davinder Singh
(supra) was with reference,
whether sub-classification of the SCs and STs for
reservation is constitutionally permissible or not.

Their Lordships in
the said judgment
observed that
correctness of the view taken in
Jarnail Singh

(supra) is not questioned and law laid down is not
attracted. So also law
laid down in
the present case
not at all attracted.

(iv) The opinion of official respondents as regard to
inadequacy of representation based on quantifiable
data collected in the cadre and promotion orders
issued based on benchmark of ACRs and merit
taken care for efficiency in administration. There is
neither any legal infirmity nor artibtrariness in the
impugned orders issued in compliance of mandate in

(v) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in
All India
Equality Forum Vs. Union of India & Ors.
in OA
No.332/2019 (Mumbai) vide Order dated
05.06.2024 and the majority opinion in case in
similar terms of Valerie Avinash Dhepe & Ors. Vs.
Union of India & Ors., OA No.557/2023 (Mumbai)
vide Order dated 26.06.2024 passed by Hon'ble
Member (Administrative) held that post based roster
is prepared in manner for filling up of the posts
prescribed by Constitution Bench decision in R.K.
Sabharwal (supra).

The benchmark as to data
collection is met as directed by dictum of
M.Nagaraj
and Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra), the data in the cadre
is also available with the authorities and adequacy of
representation of SCs and STs has been correctly
determined.
The order dated 26.06.2024 passed by
Hon'ble Member (A) in case of Valerie Avinash
Dhepe (supra) has been held to be correct view in
the Third Member reference decided vide order dated
02.04.2025.
In view of law laid down in similar facts
and legal issue in present case and to maintain
consistency in the interpretation of law, this Bench
is bound by orders passed in case of Valerie
Avinash Dhepe (supra) and
All India Equality
Forum
(supra) decided by the Division Bench of this
Tribunal and in view of law
laid down in
case of Sub-
Inspector Roop Lal and Anr. Vs. Lt. Governor &
Ors. (2010) 1 SCC 644. Hon'ble Supreme Court
held that Tribunal is bound by the precedent of a
coordinate Bench of Tribunal.

The legal issue and
ratio laid down is binding on this Tribunal decided
in similar terms in case of Avinash Dhepe (supra)

and
All India Equality Forum
(supra) hence the
present OA deserves to be dismissed in light of order
dated 03.07.2025 passed by Hon'ble Member
(Judicial) and there is no infirmity in the impugned
orders and the instant OA is devoid of merits.

(vi) The five-Judge Constitution Bench judgment in
case of R.K. Sabharwal (supra) Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that in cases of reservation in promotion
to SCs and STs that when a percentage of
reservation if fixed in respect of a particular cadre
and roster points in reserved points to be taken that
reserve point is to be filled from members of reserved
categories and general category candidates cannot
be considered for reserved posts and reserved
category on own merit can compete for general
category and their numbers cannot be added to
working of percentage of reservation. The
Government can make any provision for reservation
of posts or appointments in favour of any OBCs
under
Article 16(4)
subject to opinion of State that
category is not adequately represented in the
services under the State. So to reach on such
opinion or conclusion after necessary exercise and
providing the extent of percentage of posts reserved
for the said category then the percentage has to be
followed strictly.

(vii) R.K. Sabharwal (supra). Their Lordships further
held that once the prescribed percentage of posts are
filled the numerical test of adequacy is satisfied and
the percentage of representation worked out in State
Services of respective categories is fulfilled and same
is in accordance with demographic estimate worked
out in relation to their population and equality of

opportunity is assured to reserved as well as
unreserved category.

(viii) Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of R.K. Sabharwal
(supra) further held that as and when there is a
vacancy whether permanent or temporary the same
has to be filled from amongst the category to which
the post belonged in the roster and this ensures
neither shortfall nor excess in percentage of
reservation.
So far as present case is concerned
respondents have issued promotion orders dated
13.01.2023 and 01.11.2023 and applicants have not
impugned in this OA i.e. Office Order No.5/2023
dated 13.01.2023 and 13.11.2023 vide Office Order
No.1`89/2023 and promotion to the grade of
Assistant Commissioner of Customs and Indirect
Taxes on purely ad hoc against temporary posts duly

temporary vacancies arisen to be filled on procedure
akin to regular post and statutory rules i.e. Indian
Revenue Services (Customs & Central Excise)
Recruitment Rules, 2012 and extant instructions of
DoP&T. Hon'ble High Court of Bombay, in

(ix) In
Jarnail Singh & Ors. vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta

"
Jarnail Singh & Ors. Vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta

respondents have analyzed inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs employees in the
cadre of Assistant Commissioner based on vacancies
arising quantified on the basis of post based roster
data in the cadre and found inadequate
representation of SCs and STs in the cadre and
issued promotion orders and applicants not

deserves to be dismissed.

(
x) Chairman & Managing Director, Indian Airlines
Vs. Binod Kumar & Ors.
(2001) 8 SCC 722.

Hon'ble Supreme Court held that once relief was not
claimed challenging validity of
Regulation 13(b)
and
relief granted by High Court in quashing
Regulation
13(b)
is set aside. Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of

Mrs. Akella Lalitha Vs. Sri Konda Hanumantha
Rao
, 2022 Live Law (SC) 638. Their Lordships
held that relief not found on pleadings should not be
granted. If a Court considers or grants a relief for
which no prayer or pleadings was made depriving
the respondents of an opportunity to oppose or resist
such relief would lead to miscarriage of justice (Para
1518). So far present case, applicants have not
challenged OM No.36012/16/2019 dated
12.04.2022 issued to comply directions given by
Hon'ble Supreme Court to ensure enabling provision
requiring pre-requisite exercise is taken up to
determine inadequacy in the cadre. So also
applicants not challenged promotion orders dated
13.01.2023 and 0.11.2023 and no relief can be
granted in this OA to the applicants. So also the

Bench of this Tribunal that if roster has already
been maintained with respect to the cadre and
demonistrates inadequacy in SC/ST representation,
the same is required to be treated as quantifiable
data about inadequacy of representation of SCs and
STs and roster maintained for each cadre shall

Annexure R/6 with reply and demonstrated
quantifiable data collected in the cadre and based on

(Administrative) is contrary to record and without
application of mind on data collected by respondents

R/6 with the reply dated 18.02.2021. The
quantifiable data collected and the committee took
note of the vacancies for 2014-15 and 2015-16
including carried forward vacancies. There is
shortfall of SC/ST representation in the cadre. The
zone of consideration is based on seniority list of

THE CHALLENGE

12. The applicants, in present OA have challenged the validity
of Office order dated 23.02.2017 (Annexure A-1) and dated
11.05.2018 (Annexure A-2) whereby officers have been
promoted to the grade of Assistant Commissioner of Customs &
Central Excise on adhoc basis against 2118 temporary posts
created as a result of restructuring in year 2013 and also
impunged combined draft seniority list of Superintendents as
on 01.01.2019 (Annexure A-3) under Mumbai cadre, Central.

13. The validity of orders has been challenged on the ground
that exercise determining inadequacy of representation on the
basis of population of SCs and STs by collection of quantifiable
data, backwardness impact on overall efficiency in light of

Article 335
and exclusion of creamy layer amongst SCs and STs,
had not been preceded before implementation of roster in
promotion and the seniority list has been issued without
following catch-up rule.

ANALYSIS

14. Notebly, the terms of reference is not carved out in the
dissenting Original Order dated 03.07.2025 in OA No.407/2020
by Hon'ble Member (Adminsitrative). Threfore, the issue
"Whether impugned orders to the extent of reservation in

up for consideration, is dwell upon on the basis of settled legal
preposition.

CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE IN RESERVATION

The matter was heard by the nine-judge Constituition

enforceability of the impugned OM dated 13.08.1990, subject to
certain conditionalities and pre-requisites, was upheld. The
leading judgment by Hon'ble Justice Shri B.P. Jeevan Reddy for
Hon'ble Justice Shri M.H. Kania, C.J., Hon'ble Justice Sh. N.N.
Venkatachaliah, Hon'ble Justice Shri A.M. Ahmadi, Hon'ble
Justice RAtnavel Pandian and Hon'ble Justice Shri P.B. Sawant
concurring. Relevant paragraph 859 and 860 reads as under -

"859. We may summarise our answers to the various questions
dealt with and answered hereinabove:

(1) (a) It is not necessary that the 'provision' under
Article 16(4)

should necessarily be made by the Parliament/Legislature.

Such a provision can be made by the Executive also. Local
bodies, Statutory Corporations and other instrumentalities
of the State falling under
Article 12
of the Constitution are
themselves competent to make such a provision, if so
advised. (Paras 735-737)

(b) An executive order making a provision under
Article 16(4)
is
enforceable the moment it is made and issued. (Paras 738-740)
(2) (a) Clause (4) of
Article 16
is not an exception to clause (1). It is an
instance and an illustration of the classification inherent in clause
(1). (Paras 741-742)

(b)
Article 16(4)
is exhaustive of the subject of reservation in favour of
backward class of citizens, as explained in this judgment. (Para

743)

(c) Reservations can also be provided under clause (1) of
Article 16.
It
is not confined to extending of preferences, concessions or
exemptions alone. These reservations, if any, made under clause
(1) have to be so adjusted and implemented as not to exceed the
level of representation prescribed for 'backward class of citizens' --
as explained in this Judgment. (Para 745)
(3) (a) A caste can be and quite often is a social class in India. If it is
backward socially, it would be a backward class for the purposes
of
Article 16(4).
Among non-Hindus, there are several occupational
groups, sects and denominations, which for historical reasons, are
socially backward. They too represent backward social
collectivities for the purposes of
Article 16(4).
(Paras 746 to 779)

(b) Neither the Constitution nor the law prescribes the procedure or
method of identification of backward classes. Nor is it possible or
advisable for the court to lay down any such procedure or method.
It must be left to the authority appointed to identify. It can adopt
such method/procedure as it thinks convenient and so long as its
survey covers the entire populace, no objection can be taken to it.
Identification of the backward classes can certainly be done with
reference to castes among, and along with, other occupational
groups, classes and sections of people. One can start the process
either with occupational groups or with castes or with some other
groups. Thus one can start the process with the castes, wherever
they are found, apply the criteria (evolved for determining
backwardness) and find out whether it satisfies the criteria. If it
does -- what emerges is a "backward class of citizens" within the
meaning of and for the purposes of
Article 16(4).
Similar process
can be adopted in the case of other occupational groups,
communities and classes, so as to cover the entire populace. The
central idea and overall objective should be to consider all
NARESH NARESH

available groups, sections and classes in society. Since caste
represents an existing, identifiable social group/class
encompassing an overwhelming minority of the country's
population, one can well begin with it and then go to other groups,
sections and classes. (Paras 780 and 785).

(c) It is not correct to say that the backward class of citizens
contemplated in
Article 16(4)
is the same as the socially and
educationally backward classes referred to in
Article 15(4).
It is
much wider. The accent in
Article 16(4)
is on social backwardness.
Of course, social, educational and economic backwardness are
closely inter-twined in the Indian context. (Paras 786-789)

(d) 'Creamy layer' can be, and must be excluded. (Paras 790-793)

(e) It is not necessary for a class to be designated as a backward class
that it is situated similarly to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled
Tribes. (Paras 794 and 797)

(f) The adequacy of representation of a particular class in the
services under the State is a matter within the subjective
satisfaction of the appropriate Government. The judicial
scrutiny in that behalf is the same as in other matters
within the subjective satisfaction of an authority. (Para 798)
(4) (a) A backward class of citizens cannot be identified only and
exclusively with reference to economic criteria. (Para 799)

(b) It is, of course, permissible for the Government or other authority
to identify a backward class of citizens on the basis of occupation-
cum-income, without reference to caste, if it is so advised. (Para

800)
(5) There is no constitutional bar to classify the backward classes of
citizens into backward and more backward categories. (Paras 801
to 803)
(6) (a) and (b) The reservations contemplated in clause (4) of
Article 16

should not exceed 50%. While 50% shall be the rule, it is necessary
not to put out of consideration certain extraordinary situations
inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people. It
might happen that in far-flung and remote areas the population
inhabiting those areas might, on account of their being out of the
mainstream of national life and in view of the conditions peculiar to
end characteristic of them need to be treated in a different way,
some relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative. In doing
so, extreme caution is to be exercised and a special case made out.
(Paras 804 to 813)

(c) The rule of 50% should be applied to each year. It cannot be
related to the total strength of the class, category, service or
cadre, as the case may be. (Para 814)

(
d) Devadasan [T. Devadasan v. Union of India
, (1964) 4 SCR 680 :

AIR 1964 SC 179 : (1965) 2 LLJ 560] was wrongly decided and is
accordingly overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with this
judgment. (Paras 815 to 818)
(7)
Article 16(4)
does not permit provision for reservations in the
matter of promotion. This rule shall, however, have only
prospective operation and shall not affect the promotions
already made, whether made on regular basis or on any
other basis. We direct that our decision on this question
shall operate only prospectively and shall not affect
promotions already made, whether on temporary, officiating
or regular/permanent basis. It is further directed that
wherever reservations are already provided in the matter of
promotion -- be it Central Services or State Services, or for
that matter services under any Corporation, authority or
body falling under the definition of 'State' in
Article 12 --

such reservations may continue in operation for a period of

five years from this day. Within this period, it would be open
to the appropriate authorities to revise, modify or re-issue
the relevant rules to ensure the achievement of the objective
of
Article 16(4).
If any authority thinks that for ensuring
adequate representation of 'backward class of citizens' in
any service, class or category, it is necessary to provide for
direct recruitment therein, it shall be open to it to do so.
(Ahmadi, J expresses no opinion on this question upholding
the preliminary objection of Union of India). It would not be
impermissible for the State to extend concessions and
relaxations to members of reserved categories in the matter
of promotion without compromising the efficiency of the
administration. (Paras 819 to 831)
(8) While the rule of reservation cannot be called anti-meritarian, there
are certain services and posts to which it may not be advisable to
apply the rule of reservation. (Paras 832 to 841)
(9) There is no particular or special standard of judicial
scrutiny applicable to matters arising under
Article 16(4).

(Para 842)
(10) The distinction made in the impugned Office Memorandum dated
September 25, 1991 between 'poorer sections' and others among
the backward classes is not invalid, if the classification is
understood and operated as based upon relative backwardness
among the several classes identified as Other Backward Classes,
as explained in paras 843-844 of this Judgment. (Para 843-844)
(11) The reservation of 10% of the posts in favour of 'other
economically backward sections of the people who are not covered
by any of the existing schemes of the reservation' made in the
impugned Office Memorandum dated September 25, 1991 is
constitutionally invalid and is accordingly struck down. (Para 845)
(13) The Government of India and the State Governments have the
power to, and ought to, create a permanent mechanism -- in the
nature of a Commission -- for examining requests of inclusion and
complaints of over-inclusion or non-inclusion in the list of OBCs and
to advise the Government, which advice shall ordinarily be binding
upon the Government. Where, however, the Government does not
accept the advice, it must record its reasons therefor. (Para 847)
(14) In view of the answers given by us herein and the directions
issued herewith, it is not necessary to express any opinion on the
correctness and adequacy of the exercise done by the Mandal
Commission. It is equally unnecessary to send the matters back to
the Constitution Bench of five Judges. (Paras 848 to 850).

B. The five-Judge Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of
R.K. Sabharwal and Ors. Vs. State of Punjab
& Ors.
(1995) 2 SCC 745.

Their Lordships were seisin with the
issue related to the reservation in promotion in roster system
taking into consideration entire cadre strength to determine
limit as per judgement in case of
Indra Sawhney
(supra). Their
Lordships in paragraph 4 and 5 observed and to appreciate the
controversy reproduced as under -

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

"4. When a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of a
particular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve points, it
has to be taken that the posts shown at the reserve points are
to be filled from amongst the members of reserve categories
and the candidates belonging to the general category are not
entitled to be considered for the reserved posts. On the other
hand the reserve category candidates can compete for the non-
reserve posts and in the event of their appointment to the said
posts their number cannot be added and taken into
consideration for working out the percentage of reservation.

Article 16(4)
of the Constitution of India permits the State Government
to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in
favour of any Backward Class of citizens which, in the opinion of the
State is not adequately represented in the Services under the State. It
is, therefore, incumbent on the State Government to reach a conclusion
that the Backward Class/Classes for which the reservation is made is
not adequately represented in the State Services. While doing so the
State Government may take the total population of a particular
Backward Class and its representation in the State Services. When the
State Government after doing the necessary exercise makes the
reservation and provides the extent of percentage of posts to be
reserved for the said Backward Class then the percentage has to be
followed strictly. The prescribed percentage cannot be varied or
changed simply because some of the members of the Backward
Class have already been appointed/promoted against the
general seats. As mentioned above the roster point which is reserved
for a Backward Class has to be filled by way of
appointment/promotion of the member of the said class. No general
category candidate can be appointed against a slot in the
roster which is reserved for the Backward Class. The fact that
considerable number of members of a Backward Class have
been appointed/promoted against general seats in the State
Services may be a relevant factor for the State Government to
review the question of continuing reservation for the said class
but so long as the instructions/rules providing certain
percentage of reservations for the Backward Classes are
operative the same have to be followed. Despite any number of
appointees/promotees belonging to the Backward Classes
against the general category posts the given percentage has to
be provided in addition. We, therefore, see no force in the first
contention raised by the learned counsel and reject the same.

5. We see considerable force in the second contention raised by the
learned counsel for the petitioners. The reservations provided
under the impugned Government instructions are to be
operated in accordance with the roster to be maintained in
each Department. The roster is implemented in the form of
running account from year to year. The purpose of "running
account" is to make sure that the Scheduled Castes/Schedule
Tribes and Backward Classes get their percentage of reserved
posts. The concept of "running account" in the impugned
instructions has to be so interpreted that it does not result in
excessive reservation. "16% of the posts ..." are reserved for
members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes. In a lot of
100 posts those falling at Serial Numbers 1, 7, 15, 22, 30, 37, 44, 51,
58, 65, 72, 80, 87 and 91 have been reserved and earmarked in the
roster for the Scheduled Castes. Roster points 26 and 76 are reserved
for the members of Backward Classes. It is thus obvious that when
recruitment to a cadre starts then 14 posts earmarked in the roster are
to be filled from amongst the members of the Scheduled Castes. To
illustrate, first post in a cadre must go to the Scheduled Caste and

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

thereafter the said class is entitled to 7th, 15th, 22nd and onwards up
to 91st post. When the total number of posts in a cadre are filled by
the operation of the roster then the result envisaged by the impugned
instructions is achieved. In other words, in a cadre of 100 posts when
the posts earmarked in the roster for the Scheduled Castes and the
Backward Classes are filled the percentage of reservation provided for
the reserved categories is achieved. We see no justification to operate
the roster thereafter. The "running account" is to operate only till
the quota provided under the impugned instructions is reached
and not thereafter. Once the prescribed percentage of posts is
filled the numerical test of adequacy is satisfied and thereafter
the roster does not survive. The percentage of reservation is the
desired representation of the Backward Classes in the State
Services and is consistent with the demographic estimate
based on the proportion worked out in relation to their
population. The numerical quota of posts is not a shifting
boundary but represents a figure with due application of mind.
Therefore, the only way to assure equality of opportunity to the
Backward Classes and the general category is to permit the
roster to operate till the time the respective
appointees/promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the
roster. The operation of the roster and the "running account" must
come to an end thereafter. The vacancies arising in the cadre, after the
initial posts are filled, will pose no difficulty. As and when there is a
vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post
the same has to be filled from amongst the category to which
the post belonged in the roster. For example the Scheduled Caste
persons holding the posts at roster points 1, 7, 15 retire then these
slots are to be filled from amongst the persons belonging to the
Scheduled Castes. Similarly, if the persons holding the post at points 8
to 14 or 23 to 29 retire then these slots are to be filled from among the
general category. By following this procedure there shall neither
be shortfall nor excess in the percentage of reservation."

F. The Five-Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case of
M.Nagaraj and Others vs. Union of India & Ors.
,
reported in (2006) 8 SCC 212. Their Lordships considered
issue related to implementation of reservation in promotion. The
relevant paragraphs are reproduced hereunder:-

"122. We reiterate that the ceiling limit of 50%, the concept of
creamy layer and the compelling reasons, namely,
backwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall
administrative efficiency are all constitutional requirements
without which the structure of equality of opportunity in

Article 16
would collapse.

123. However, in this case, as stated above, the main issue
concerns the "extent of reservation". In this regard the State
concerned will have to show in each case the existence of the
compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of
representation and overall administrative efficiency before
making provision for reservation. As stated above, the
impugned provision is an enabling provision. The State is not
bound to make reservation for SCs/STs in matters of
promotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion
and make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable
data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of
representation of that class in public employment in addition
to compliance with
Article 335.
It is made clear that even if the
State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will
have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to
excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50% or
obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation
indefinitely.

What comes out loud and clear from the conclusion in the
case of
M.Nagaraj
(supra) that the
Article 16(4A)
and
16(4B)
of
the Constitution of India is an enabling provision and if the
State wish to exercise their discretion to make reservation for
SCs/STs in matters of promotion, the State has to collect
quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class and
inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment
in addition to compliance with
Article 335
and reservation
provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to breech the
ceiling limit of 50% as was in case of
R.K. Sabharwal
(supra)
which was a case of promotion and the issue in the case was
operation of roster system and the Hon'ble Supreme Court
stated that the entire cadre strength should be taken into
account to determine whether reservation upto the required
limit had been reached.

case of
Jarnail Singh and Others vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta

[Jarnail Singh (1)] decided on 26.09.2018,
reported in (2018) 10 SCC 396.

Their Lordships was dealing
with reference order by a two-Judge Bench in case of
State of
Tripura Vs. Jayant Chakraborty
(2018) 1 SCC 146 and a
second reference order dated 15.11.2017 by a three-Judge
Bench in State of Maharasthra Vs. Vijay Ghogre (2018) 17
SCC 261, referred the correctness of the decision in
M. Nagaraj

controversy in these matters revolved around the interpretation
of
Article 16 (4-A) (4-B)
, 335
, 341
, 342
of the Constitution of
India. Their Lordships concluded in paragraph 36 as under -

H. The three-Judge Bench judgment in
Jarnail Singh and
Others Vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta and Others
[Jarnail Singh
(2)], decided on January 28, 2022 reported in (2022) 10 SCC

595. Their Lordships were dealing with matters arising from
some High Courts where reservation in promotion provided by
Central Government and the State Governments to SCs and STs
have been assailed as being violative of law
laid down in
case of

M. Nagaraj
(supra). The common issues raised and six points
formulated for determination. The relevant paragraph 11 reads
as under -

"11. After considering the issue identified by the learned
Attorney General and other learned counsel and hearing them, the
following six points are formulated for determination:

11.1 (1) What is the yardstick by which, according to M.
Nagraj, one would arrive at quantifiable data showing
inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in public
employment?

11.2(2) What is the unit with respect to which quantifiable
data showing inadequacy of representation is required to be
collected?

11.3(3) Whether proportion of the population of SCs and STs
to the population of India should be taken to be the test for
determining adequacy of representation in promotional
posts for the purpose of
Article 16(4-A)?

11.4(4) Should there be a time period for reviewing inadequacy of
prospectively?

11.5(5) Whether the judgment in M.Nagraj can be said to
operate prospectively?

11.6 (6) Whether quantifiable data showing inadequacy of
representation can be collected on the basis of sampling
methods, as held by this Court in B.K. Pavitra vs. Union of
India [B.K. Pavitra]."

(1) Yardstick for arriving at quantifiable data

17. Determination of inadequate representation of SCs and STs in
services under a State is left to the discretion of the State, as the
determination depends upon myriad factors which this Court
cannot envisage. A conscious decision was taken by this Court
in
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC
212 : (
2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] and Jarnail Singh [Jarnail
Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta
, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019)
1 SCC (L&S) 86] to leave it to the States to fix the criteria for
determining inadequacy of representation.

The submission of
the learned Attorney General for India that this Court has to lay
down the yardstick for measuring adequacy of representation did
not yield a favourable result as this Court in Jarnail Singh [Jarnail
NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA

AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta
, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC
(L&S) 86] found it befitting for the States to have the liberty to
evaluate the representation of SCs and STs in public employment.
Laying down of criteria for determining the inadequacy of
representation would result in curtailing the discretion
given to the State Governments. In addition, the prevailing
local conditions, which may require to be factored in, might
not be uniform.

Moreover, in
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union
of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court
made it clear that the validity of law made by the State
Governments providing reservation in promotions shall be decided
on a case-to-case basis for the purpose of establishing whether the
inadequacy of representation is supported by quantifiable data.
Therefore, we are of the opinion that no yardstick can be

laid down by
this Court for determining the adequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts for the
purpose of providing reservation.

(2) Unit for collecting quantifiable data

21.
In
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :

(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court observed that the appropriate
Government has to apply cadre strength as a unit in the operation
of the roster in order to ascertain whether a given class/group is
adequately represented in the service. Cadre strength as a unit
also ensures that the upper ceiling limit of 50% is not violated.

Following the law
laid down in

R.K. Sabharwal [R.K.
Sabharwal v. State of Punjab
, (1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S)
548] , this Court in
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006)
8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] further held that the roster
has to be post-specific and not vacancy based.

22.
In
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :

(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court held that it is open to the
State to provide for reservation in promotions subject to limitation
that there must exist compelling reasons for backwardness,
inadequacy of representation in a class of post(s) keeping in mind
the overall administrative efficiency. While referring to the roster,
this Court observed that the appropriate Government has to apply
the cadre strength as a unit in the operation of the roster in order to
ascertain whether a given class/group is adequately represented
in the service. Collection of quantifiable data regarding inadequacy
of representation as stipulated by
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union
of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] is relatable
to the cadre concerned, according to
Jarnail Singh [Jarnail
Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta
, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC
(L&S) 86] .

36.
In
R.K. Sabharwal [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab
, (1995) 2
SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] , this Court held that the right to
be considered for appointment can only be claimed in respect of a
post in a cadre and that the concept of "vacancy" has no relevance
in operating the percentage of reservation. It was further held that
the cadre strength is always measured by the number of posts
comprising the cadre.

38. In the Office Memorandum dated 2-7-1997, the Union of India
set out the principles for making and operating post-based rosters,
in which it has been expressly stated that cadre is to be construed
as the number of posts in a particular grade. It is made clear that
rosters have been prepared grade-wise which are reviewed on a
yearly basis and that reservation in promotions is implemented on
the basis of these rosters, which operate grade-wise.
In
M.
Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1
SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court approved that the percentage of

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

reservation in promotions was to be applied to the entire cadre
strength, as held in
R.K. Sabharwal [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of
Punjab
, (1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] .

While doing so,
this Court in
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8
SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] made it clear that the unit for
operation of the roster would be the cadre strength. Before
providing for reservation in promotions to a cadre, the State is
obligated to collect quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs. Collection of information regarding
inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs cannot be with
reference to the entire service or "class"/"group" but it should be
relatable to the grade/category of posts to which promotion is
sought. Cadre, which should be the unit for the purpose of
collection of quantifiable data in relation to the promotional post(s),
would be meaningless if data pertaining to representation of SCs
and STs is with reference to the entire service."

(3) Proportionate representation as test of adequacy

39.
In
R.K. Sabharwal [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab
, (1995) 2
SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] , it was observed that State
Governments may take the total population of a particular
Backward Class and its representation in the State services for the
purpose of coming to a conclusion that there is inadequate
representation in the State services.

41. This Court in
Jarnail Singh [Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi
Narain Gupta
, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC (L&S) 86]
found no fault with
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
,
(2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] regarding the
test for determining the adequacy of representation in
promotional posts in the State. While emphasising the
contrast in the language used between
Article 330
and

Articles 16(4-A)
and
16(4-B)
of the Constitution, this Court
declined the invitation of the learned Attorney General for
India to hold that the proportion of SCs and STs to the
population of India should be the test for determining
inadequacy of representation in promotional posts.
Therefore, we are not persuaded to express any opinion on
this aspect. It is for the State to assess the inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts, by
taking into account relevant factors.

(4) Time period for review

43. We are not inclined to express any view on discontinuation of
reservations in totality, which is completely within the domain of
the legislature and the executive. As regards review, we are of the
opinion that data collected to determine inadequacy of
representation for the purpose of providing reservation in
promotions needs to be reviewed periodically. The period for review
should be reasonable and is left to the Government to set out.
(5) Prospective operation of the judgment in
M. Nagaraj [M.
Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC
(L&S) 1013]

45. This Court upheld the validity of
Article 16(4-A)
in
M.
Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1
SCC (L&S) 1013] on 19-10-2006 and observed that reservation in
promotions in public services can be made, subject to collection of
quantifiable data by the State showing backwardness of the class
and inadequacy of representation of that class in public
employment, in addition to compliance with
Article 335
of the
Constitution. Reservation in promotions provided by various State
Governments and the Central Government have been challenged in
the High Courts on the ground of non-compliance with the

AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

requirement of collection of quantifiable data showing
backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation.

It is
relevant to mention at this stage that collection of
quantifiable data regarding backwardness of SCs and STs is
no more required in view of the judgment of this Court
in
Jarnail Singh [Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta
,
(2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC (L&S) 86] . In respect of the
data relating to inadequacy of representation of SCs and
STs, the High Courts have adjudicated writ petitions which
are the subject-matter of special leave petitions pending in
this Court.

62. This Court in
Golak Nath [Golak Nath v. State of Punjab
, (1967)
2 SCR 762 : AIR 1967 SC 1643] and Ashok Kumar Gupta [Ashok
Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P., (1997) 5 SCC 201 : 1997 SCC (L&S)
1299] , referred to above, has laid down that
Article 142
empowers
this Court to mould the relief to do complete justice.

To conclude
this point, the purpose of holding that
M. Nagaraj [M.
Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC
(L&S) 1013] would have prospective effect is only to avoid
chaos and confusion that would ensue from its retrospective
operation, as it would have a debilitating effect on a very
large number of employees, who may have availed of
reservation in promotions without there being strict
compliance of the conditions prescribed in
M. Nagaraj [M.
Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC
(L&S) 1013] . Most of them would have already retired from
service on attaining the age of superannuation.

The judgment
of
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212
: (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] was delivered in 2006,
interpreting
Article 16(4-A)
of the Constitution which came
into force in 1995.

As making the principles
laid down in

M.
Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :

(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] effective from the year 1995 would
be detrimental to the interests of a number of civil servants
and would have an effect of unsettling the seniority of
individuals over a long period of time, it is necessary that
the judgment of
M. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India
,
(2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] should be
declared to have prospective effect."

I. The Seven-Judge Constitution Bench judgment in case

of
State of Punjab & Ors. vs. Davinder Singh & Ors
, reported
in (2025) 1 SCC 1. Their Lordships was seisin with the
reference whether sub-classification of the Scheduled Castes for
reservation is constitutionally permissible.

The Punjab
Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in
Services ) Act, 2006 to provide for reservation in services for the
members of the SC and BC.
Section 4(5)
provided 50% of the
vacancies of the quota reserved for SCs in direct recruitment
shall be offered to Balmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs, if available, as a
first preference from the SCs Hon'ble High Court of Punjab &
Haryana declared
Section 4(5)
unconstitutional relying on the
judgment of the Constitution Bench in case of
E.V.Chinnaiah
Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh
(2005) 1 SCC 394.

On 27.08.2020
in
State of Punjab vs. Davinder Singh
(2020) 8 SCC 1, a
Constitution Bench held that the judgment in
E.V. Chinnaiah

(supra) requires to be revisited by a large Bench of Seven-
Judges because it failed to consider the significant aspects
bearing the issue.

Their Lordships were considering the
reference restricted to the issue of whether the judgment of this
Court in
E.V. Chinnaiah
(supra) requires to be reconsidered
since the High Court had held that the Punjab Act and Haryana
Notifications (by which Scheduled Castes in the State were
classified into two categories, A & B for the purposes of
reservation in direct recruitment for government jobs within
quota reserved for SCs) were unconstitutional solely being
contrary to law
laid down in

16. Clause (4) of
Article 16
contains an enabling provision to
empower the State to make reservation in appointment or posts
in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion
of State is not adequately represented in the service under the
State. Clause (4-A) has enabling provision and empowers the
appropriate Government/executives to provide for reservation in
promotion with consequential seniority in posts or classes of
posts in service under State in favour of SCs and STs. Clause
(4-A) of
Article 16
also provides "which in the opinion of the State
are not adequately represented in the service under the
appropriate Government".

17. Their Lordships in
Indra Sawhney
(supra) held that the
opinion of the appropriate Government/executive on the factors
determining the adequacy of representation of SCs and STs in
the public services of the State is a matter which forms a part of
subjective satisfaction of the State and also emphasized that
when an authority is vested with the power to form an opinion,
it is not open for the Courts to substitute its own opinion for
that of authority, nor can the opinion of the authority be
challenged on grounds of propriety or sufficiency.

18.
In
M. Nagaraj
(supra) Their Lordships dealing with the
parameters governing the assessment of the adequacy of
representation or of the impact on efficiency of administration.
Their Lordships in para 45, 49 and 102 held that it is the State
who is in the best position to define and measure merit in
whatever ways it to be relevant to public employment and
reservation in
Article 16(4)
and
Article 16(4-A)
is enabling and
discretion is to be subjective satisfaction of the existence of
backwardness, inadequacy of representation in public
employment and the inadequacy has to exist factually. Their
Lordships also held in para 49 that the inadequacy has to
factually exist and resultantly now judicial review comes in.
Their Lordships further emphasized that however, whether
reservation in a given case is desirable or not, as a policy is not

for the courts to decide as long as parameters mentioned in

Article 16(4)
and
16(4-A)
are maintained. The five-Judge
Constitution Bench held that
Article 16(4-A)
is an enabling
provision and the State/executive is not bound to make
reservation for SCs and STs in promotions, but if it decides to
implement reservation in promotion, it must collect quantifiable
data on three factors (i) the backwardness of class; (ii) the
inadequacy of the representation of that class in public
employment; and (iii) the general efficiency of service as
mandated by
Article 335
would not be affected.

The aforesaid
principles governing enabling provision is expressly evident
from dictum in the constitution Bench decision in
M. Nagaraj

(supra).

19. Now dealing with the submissions of learned counsel for
the respective parties on the material underlying collection of
data by the executives in the case in hand on the adequacy of
representation and impact on efficiency.

20. Reverting to the case in hand to scrutinize the quantifiable
data, if any collected by the Union/Executive in this case to
satisfy the requirement of inadequacy of representation of SCs
and STs and impact on the efficiency of administration to satisfy
this Tribunal that reservation in promotion to SCs and STs in
the cadre of Assistant Commissioner, Central Excise now
Central Goods Service Tax (CGST) and Central Excise became
necessary.

23.9 What comes out loud and clear that as per promotion

roster prepared for filling up 2118 temporary posts created and
the roster prepared based on post based roster and vacancies
calculated based on vacant roster points for reserved categorires
for SCs and STs, the same has to be filled by reserved category
employees from feeder cadres of CX, CP and CA and in each
cadre there is shortage of representation of SCs and STs
employees is matter of record, as evident from the quantifiable
data. So far as promotion orders dated 23.02.2016, 11.05.2018,
13.01.2023 and 03.11.2023 from feeder cadres of CX, CP and
CA and exercise undertaken shows that there is shortfall of
representation of SCs and STs and analysis of data submitted
by the respondents prior to determination of inadequacy of
represenetation to SCs and STs, the quantifiable data so far
promotion to grade of Asstt. Commissioner, there was shortfall
of their representation and after conducting requisite exercise
relatable to cadre concerned roster prepared and there is no
infirmtity in the exercise of power to extend reservation in
promotion.

23.10 The aforesaid promotion roster as extracted
hereinabove has been prepared based on law
laid down by
a
Constitution Bench in case of
R.K. Sabharwal
(supra)
reservation in promotion be also on the basis of post based
roster instead of vacancy based and it is well settled legal
preposition that the collection of quantifiable data to be
collected for analysis for taking decision to determine
inadequacy of representation in the cadre specific for the post in
question and overall representation not exceeding the ceiling
limit, shows the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs.
The data as collected and extracted based on detail exercise and
analysis is clear indication as to the inadequacy of
representation of SCs and STs in grade of Assistant
Commissioner of Customs and Indirect Taxes (Group-A) in the
CBIT and Customs and in the CBIT and Customs against

temporary basis. During pendency of this OA, the Office Orders
dated 13.01.2023 and 01.11.2023 also have been issued by the
Ministry of Finance, Government of India to promote officers in
Annexure-I, II and III to the grade of Assistant Commissioner of
Customs and Indirect Taxes and applicants have chosen not to
challenge the same and no relief can be granted on this count
also.

24. Having considered in detail the exercise undertaken
by the executives/respondents in the case in hand based on
material record and analysed the relevant data and hold that
the compelling reasons which
M. Nagaraj
(supra) require
appropriate Government/executives to demonstrate have been
established and there is inadequacy of representation of SCs
and STs in the cadre of Assistant Commissioner and
respondents were justified in assessing the inadequacy of
representation with reference to a benchmark in the cadre on
adequacy. On creation of additional 2118 temporary posts and
shortfall in the cadre of Assistant Commisssioner is not
disputed.

25. Thus, there is no infirmity in determination of adequacy of

representation of SCs and STs on collection of quantifiable data

as to the cadre of Assistant Commissioner in accordance with

dictum of
M.Nagaraj
(supra).

EFFICIENCY IN ADMINISTRATION

dictum in the Constitution Bench decision in case of

case the existence of compelling reasons inadequacy of

making provision for reservation. The Union or State has to also

administration of government is to use a merit based approach

and fulfilling benchmark criteria is centered around
Article 335

of Constitution of India, reads as

"335. Claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to
services and posts
The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently
with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making
of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs
of the Union or of a State:

[In
Article 335
of the Constitution, the following proviso shall be
inserted at the end]
Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent in making of any
provision in favour of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in qualifying marks in any
examination or lowering the standards of evaluation, for reservation
in matters of promotion to any class or classes of services or posts
in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State."

[Emphasis supplied]

26.2 In the case at hand as evident from the record that

the DPC has considered the relevant OMs and assessed the

suitability of officers for extending reservation in promotion

based on service records and ACRs for five years and made own

assessment based on benchmark 'Good' for Assistant

Commissioner and prescribed benchmark and accordingly

assessed for promotion and officers assessed as unfit not been

included in the select panel. The material placed for assessing

fitness as Annexure R-6 and also as Annexure CPR-4 from

page 520 to 705 filed by respondents, and based on prescribed

benchmark criteria for all employees being same. There is no

relaxation to reserved category employees and efficiency of

administration not been adversely impacted.

THE ISSUE OF CREAMY LAYER

27. So far as the issue related to the concept of creamy layer

whether applicable to the SCs and STs. The Tribunal is bound

by the nine-Judge Bench judgment of the Constitution Bench in

case of
Indra Sawhney
(supra) and followed in case of
M.

Nagaraj
(supra) clarified in
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra).

Their

Lordships clearly held in majority in
Indra Sawhney
(1) (supra)

in paragraph 792 that the test or requirement of social and

educational backwardness cannot be applied to SCs and STs

when individually fall within the express Backward Classes of

Citizens and SCs and STs are a separate class by themselves

and creamy layer principle is not applicable in the incident of

promotion and protection of consequential seniority also an

incidence of service as to incidence of promotion.

27.1 Their Lordships in case of
B.K. Pavitra (2) &

Others Vs. Union of India
, reported in (2019) 16 SCC 129 in

paragraph 138 to 148 has also dealt the issue related to concept

of creamy layer in reservation in promotion to SCs and STs and

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

Hon'ble Court examined in light of the nine-Judge Bench

decision of majority in Indra Sawhney (1) and also in case of
M.

Nagaraj
(supra) and in paragraph 148 held as under:-

"148.......This being the true constitutional position, the
protection of consequential seniority as an incident of
promotion of the creamy layer test.
Articles 16(4-A)
and
16(4-
B)
were held to not obliterate any of the constitutional
limitations and to fulfill the width test. In the above view of
the matter, it is evident that the concept of creamy layer has
no application in assessing the validity of the Reservation
Act, 2018 which is designed to protect consequential
seniority upon promotion of persons belonging to the SCs and
STs."

[Emphasis supplied]

27.2 Thus, having considered and of the opinion that

principles
laid down by

Indra Sawhney
(supra) on exclusion of

creamy layer apply only to OBCs and not been extended to SCs

and STs.

So also no question arose in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) on

exclusion of creamy layer in respect of SCs and STs. Their

Lordships in the constitution Bench decision in case of Jarnail

Singh (1) dealt with competence of the Parliament to enact a

law in relation to creamy layer and did not lay down preposition

on its exclusion.

CONSEQUENTIAL SENIORITY

28.
In case of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra), Hon'ble Supreme
Court has given guidelines to implement mandate of
Article
16(4)
, 16(4-A)
and
16(4-B)
of the Constitution of India.

Undisputedly, the post based roster is being maintained in the
manner of filling up of the posts in promotion also as prescribed
by constitution Bench decision in
R.K. Sabharwal
(supra).

The
quantifiable data to be collected based in the cadre as per post
the post based roster maintained as
laid down in
para 121 of
the dictum in the case of
M.Nagaraj
(supra) and clarified in

NARESH NARESH
KUMAR KUMAR AHUJA
2025.09.16
AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'
OA No.407/2020

para 17-18 of
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra). The cadre has been
held to be the unit and the quantifiable data in possession with
the respondents. The respondents are maintaining post based
roster as per mandate of Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
applicants have failed to challenge the promotion orders in the
cadre of Superintendent. The executives/Union or State has the
requisite data and sufficient material to determine inadequacy
of representation for SCs and STs to be analysed in the cadre.

The Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001
came into
effect from 17.06.1995 to grant consequential benefits on
promotion to SCs and STs as to consequential seniority on their
promotion on the basis of rule of reservation following mandate
of
M.Nagaraj
(supra) and
R.K. Sabharwal
(supra), the
impugned draft seniority list of Superintendent, Mumbai Zone
as on 01.01.2019 had been issued and the zone of
consideration for promotion to the post of Assistant
Commissioner also based on seniority list of feeder cadre of
Superintendents as on for period 1986-92 for CX, for period
1993-97 for CX and for period 1998-2006 for CP, for period
from 1.8.1994 and for CA for period 1.4.1997 to 31.12.2002 as
evident from Annexure R-6 and dictum in
M. Nagaraj
(supra) is
applicable prospectively. The amendment to
Article 16 (4-A)
is to
provide consequential seniority in case of promotion by virtue of
rule of reservation. The words "in the matters of promotion, with
consequential seniority to any class" were substituted in clause
(4-A) of
Article 16
for words "in matters of the promotion to any
class".

The
Article 16(4-A)
vested the consequential seniority on
promotion to reserved category candidates fulfilling data
requirement to determine adequacy in the cadre specific based
on the post based roster and dictum of
M.Nagaraj
(supra).

So
also OM dated 21.01.2002, seniority of SC/ST on promotion by
virtue of reservation and clarified by
Jarnail Singh
(2) (supra).

Their Lordships in case of B.K. Pavitra (2) (supra) has held
that reservation adopts the principle that consequential

OA No.407/2020

seniority is not an additional benefit but an incidence and
consequence of the promotion which is granted to SCs and STs.

CONCLUSION

29. For all the reasons stated supra and having considered
quantifiable data to determine adequacy of representation in the
cadre and benchmark for suitability is same for all, hence the
issue is decided in favour of the respondents and against the
applicants. I concur with the conclusion arrived at by Hon'ble
Member (Judicial) that the applicants are not entitled for the
relief sought in OA No.407/2020.

30. Consequently, OA No.407/2020 liable to be and is hereby
dismissed. No costs.

31. Reference is accordingly answered.
