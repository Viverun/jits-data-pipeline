JUDGMENT

Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J

1. In this batch of cases which emanates from Uttar Pradesh, five hundred and twelve

convicts who are undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for life seek premature

release.
2. On 1 August 2018, the Government of Uttar Pradesh issued a policy governing

premature release of convicts with the approval of the Governor under
Article 161

of the Constitution. The policy is described as a “Standing Policy regarding

premature release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment on the occasion of

every Republic Day (26th January)”. The policy sets out categories of convicts

entitled to premature release. Among those categories is para 2(b). The translation

provided by the Additional Advocate General is extracted below:

“2(b). All male convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life whose
crime is not covered by any of the sub-rule under prohibited category
defined in para-3 below and who have undergone, including undertrial
custody, sentence of 16 years without remission and 20 years with
remission.”

3. ‘Prohibited categories’ are spelt out in para 3 of the policy. Clause (vi) of the

prohibited categories is set out below:

“(vi) All such convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life who
have been convicted for the crimes related to incidents of massacre
(three or more than three murders).”

4. Para 4 of the policy provided as follows:

“4. All Senior Superintendent/Superintendent/ Superintendent In charge
shall examine the eligibility of all such convicted prisoners sentenced
to imprisonment for life detained in jails in terms of the prescribed
policy/directions contained in the aforesaid paras and shall make
available in the prescribed proforma enclosed herewith the proposal
of premature release of all eligible prisoners to Zonal Deputy
Inspector General of Prisons by 31st October every year.”

5. Each Zonal Deputy Inspector General of Prisons was required to examine all
proposals in light of the policy so as to ensure that no eligible person is left out of

consideration. Each Zonal DIG had to submit the proposal to the Inspector General

of Prisons annually by 15 November. The Inspector General of Prisons was further

required to forward the proposal to the Government annually by 30 November. A

Committee was constituted in terms of para 8 of the policy for examining and

disposing all cases upon the receipt of the proposal. The Committee was required

to submit its recommendations for premature release of convicted prisoners

sentenced to imprisonment for life to the Government annually by 15 December

on which the Government was to take a decision in terms of the prescribed

procedure.

6. On 28 July 2021, an amendment was brought about to the policy. Para 2(b) of the

earlier policy document dated 1 August 2018 was modified so as to provide that a

convict undergoing imprisonment for life would not be released until the age of

sixty years is attained. Para 2(b) as amended on 28 July 2021 was in the following

terms:

“2(b) Such male convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life and
are incarcerated in prison, whose crime is not covered by any of the
sub-rule under prohibited category defined in para-3 below and who
have completed age of 60 years and have undergone, including
undertrial custody, sentence of 16 years without remission and 20
years with remission.”

7. However, convicts falling within the prohibited category set out in para 3(vi) of the

original policy document were granted a relaxation in the amended policy dated

28 July 2021. Para 2(g) of the amended policy dated 28 July 2021 is as follows:
“2(g) Such convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life and are
incarcerated in prison, whose crime is covered by the sections
mentioned in prohibited category in sub-rule-(vi), (viii) and (ix) of para-
3 below, and who have completed age of 60 years and have
undergone, including undertrial custody, sentence of 25 years without
remission and 30 years with remission.”

8. The imposition of the requirement that a convict undergoing imprisonment for life

would not be eligible for premature release until attaining the age of sixty years led

to the institution of petitions under
Article 32
of the Constitution before this Court.

The challenge was inter alia on the ground that the plea for premature release

must be considered on the basis of the law as it stood on the date of conviction

and that a subsequent policy which operates to restrict the ambit of a policy

prevailing on the date of conviction must not be allowed to obstruct the plea for

release. Moreover, it was urged that the requirement that a convict cannot be

considered for premature release before the age of sixty would violate the right to

life under
Article 21
by subjecting a convict to long years of incarceration.
In several

judgments of this Court, including
State of Haryana v Jagdish,1
it has been held

that an application for premature release has to be considered on the basis of the

policy as it stood on the date when the accused was convicted of the offence by

the trial court.
A similar view was taken in State of Haryana v Raj Kumar @ Bitu.2

9. Subsequently, on 27 May 2022, the policy dated 1 August 2018 (as amended on

28 July 2021) was further amended. The amendments are specific to paras 1, 2(b),

2(f) and 2(g) and by the insertion of para 12 in the policy dated 1 August 2018, as

1 (2010) 4 SCC 216
2 (2021) 9 SCC 292
amended. For the present purpose, it would suffice to note that the requirement

that a convict undergoing life imprisonment could be considered for release only

after attaining the age of sixty has been deleted. The amended clause in terms of

the amendment dated 27 May 2022 reads as follows:

“2(b) All such male convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life
and are incarcerated in prison, whose crime is not covered by any of
the sub-rule under prohibited category defined in para-3 below and
who have undergone, including undertrial custody, sentence of 16
years excluding remission and 20 years including remission.”

10. Moreover, as regards prisoners who fall in the prohibited category contained in

para 3(vi), the relevant clause reads as follows:

“2(g) All such convicted prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for life and
are incarcerated in prison, whose crime is covered by the sections
mentioned in prohibited category in sub-rule–(vi), (viii) and (ix) of
para-3 below, and who have undergone, including undertrial custody,
sentence of 25 years with excluding remission and 30 years including
remission.”

11. Following the amendment, counter affidavits were filed before this Court in several

pending proceedings, including among them the following:

(
i) Dev Nath Singh v State of U P
;3

(
ii) Rajkumar v The State of Uttar Pradesh
;4 and

(iii) Brij Bhushan v The State of Uttar Pradesh.5

3 Writ Petition (Crl) No 528 of 2021 decided on 21 February 2022
4 Writ Petition (Crl) No 36 of 2022 decided on 11 March 2022
5 Writ Petition (Crl) No 75 of 2022 decided on 14 March 2022
12. The orders of this court in above petitions under
Article 32
noted that the cases of

the convicts undergoing life imprisonment would be dealt with in accordance with

the policy as it existed prior to the amendment which was brought about on 28 July

2021.

13. In order to facilitate the disposal of this batch of cases, an order was passed by

this Court on 24 August 2022 requiring a tabulated statement to be prepared

dealing with:

(i) The offence for which the petitioners were convicted;

(ii) The date of the judgment of the trial court;

(iii) The year of the filing of the criminal appeal before the High Court;

(iv) The period of imprisonment undergone:

(a) Without remission; and

(b) With remission;

(v) Whether the petitioners are on bail; and

(vi) The current status of the application for premature release.

14. Such a statement has been shared by counsel for the petitioners and has been

shared with Ms Garima Prashad, AAG appearing on behalf of the State of Uttar

Pradesh. The AAG has facilitated a due verification and submitted a statement

containing the details of 512 prisoners covered by the present batch of cases,

whose cases would require to be considered in terms of the policy. The statement

is annexed to this order.6

6 Annexure-A
15. We have heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners in the

proceedings under
Article 32
of the Constitution and Ms Garima Prashad, AAG.

16. The implementation of the policy for premature release has to be carried out in an

objective and transparent manner as otherwise it would impinge on the

constitutional guarantees under
Articles 14
and
21.
Many of these life convicts who

have suffered long years of incarceration have few or no resources. Lack of

literacy, education and social support structures impede their right to access legal

remedies. Once the state has formulated its policy defining the terms for premature

release, due consideration in terms of the policy must be given to all eligible

convicts. The constitutional guarantees against arbitrary treatment and of the right

to secure life and personal liberty must not be foreclosed by an unfair process of

considering applications for premature release in terms of the policy.

17. Significantly, the policy has been amended to remove the requirement of convicts

submitting an application for premature release and instead places the

responsibility on the officers of the state to consider eligible prisoners. The prison

administration, legal services authorities at the district and state level and officers

of the police department and the state must diligently ensure that cases of eligible

prisoners are considered on the basis of policy parameters. We have gained a

distinct impression, based on the cases which have come before the court here

and even earlier that there is a general apathy towards ensuring that the rights

which have been made available to convicts who have served out their sentences

in terms of the policy are realized. This results in the deprivation of liberty of those
who are entitled to be released. They languish in overcrowded jails. Their poverty,

illiteracy and disabilities occasioned by long years of incarceration are

compounded by the absence of supportive social and legal structures. The

promise of equality in our Constitution would not be fulfilled if liberty were to be

conditional on an individual’s resources, which unfortunately many of these cases

provide hard evidence of. This situation must change and hence this court has had

to step in. We now proceed to formulate peremptory directions.

18. We direct that:

(i) All cases for premature release of convicts undergoing imprisonment for life

in the present batch of cases shall be considered in terms of the policy dated

1 August 2018, as amended, subject to the observations which are

contained herein. The restriction that a life convict is not eligible for

premature release until attaining the age of sixty years, which was

introduced by the policy of 28 July 2021, stands deleted by the amendment

dated 27 May 2022. Hence, no case for premature release shall be rejected

on that ground;

(ii) In the event that any convict is entitled to more liberal benefits by any of the

amendments which have been brought about subsequent to the policy dated

1 August 2018, the case for the grant of premature release would be

considered by granting benefit in terms of more liberal amended para/clause

of the policies. All decisions of premature release of convicts, including

those, beyond the present batch of cases would be entitled to such a
beneficial reading of the policy;

(iii) In terms of para 4 of the policy dated 1 August 2018, no application is

required to be submitted by a convict undergoing life imprisonment for

premature release. Further, through amendment dated 28 July 2021, para

3(i), which included convicts undergoing life imprisonment who have not filed

application for pre-mature release in the prohibited category, has specifically

been deleted. Accordingly, all cases of convicts undergoing life sentence in

the State of Uttar Pradesh who are eligible for being considered for

premature release in terms of the policy, including but not confined to the

five hundred and twelve prisoners involved in the present batch of cases,

shall be considered in terms of the procedure for premature release

stipulated in the policy;

(iv) The District Legal Services Authorities in the State of Uttar Pradesh shall

take necessary steps in coordination with the jail authorities to ensure that

all eligible cases of prisoners who would be entitled to premature release in

terms of the applicable policies, as noticed above, would be duly considered

and no prisoner, who is otherwise eligible for being considered, shall be

excluded from consideration.

(v) These steps to be taken by DLSAs would, include but not be limited to,

Secretaries of DLSAs seeking status report on all prisoners undergoing life

imprisonment in the prisons falling under their jurisdiction in terms of the

format of table prepared in Annexure-A covering the details mentioned in
para 13 of this judgment and ensuring its submission by relevant authorities

within eight weeks of this order as well as on an annual basis. Further,

DLSAs would utilize this status report to monitor and engage with respective

authorities to ensure the implementation of our directions to ensure

premature release in terms of applicable policies in all eligible cases of

convicts undergoing life sentence on a continuous basis;

(vi) The applications for premature release shall be considered expeditiously.

Those cases which have already been processed and in respect of which

reports have been submitted shall be concluded and final decisions

intimated to the convict no later than within a period of one month from the

date of this order. Cases of eligible life convicts who are (i) above the age of

seventy years; or (ii) suffering from terminal ailments shall be taken up on

priority and would be disposed of within a period of two months. The Uttar

Pradesh State Legal Services Authority shall, within a period of two weeks,

lay down the priorities according to which all other pending cases shall be

disposed of. All other cases shall, in any event, be disposed of within a

period of four months from the date of this order; and

(vii) Where any convict undergoing life imprisonment has already been released

on bail by the orders of this Court, the order granting interim bail shall

continue to remain in operation until the disposal of the application for

premature release.
19. The petitions are accordingly disposed of. A copy of the present judgment shall be

transmitted also to the Secretary of the UP State Legal Services Authority.

20. In view of the disposal of the petitions, pending applications stand disposed of.
