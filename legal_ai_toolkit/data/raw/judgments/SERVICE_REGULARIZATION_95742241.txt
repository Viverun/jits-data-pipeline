4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the ad

hoc service rendered by the petitioner is liable to be counted for the

purpose of grant of time scale and seniority in view of the law laid

down by this Court in CWP No.8604 of 2007 - Dr. Surinder Kumar

Mishra and others v. State of Haryana and others - decided on

09.09.2010,, which has been upheld in

5. Per contra, learned State counsel has argued that present

petition is liable
liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. He

further submitted that even on merits also, the ad hoc service rendered

by the petitioner cannot be counted for the purpose of grant of time

scale and seniority.

6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused

the record.

7. The issues which arise in the present petition are as to

whether the instant petition filed by the petitioner
petitioner, after a considerable

delay, is liable to be dismissed on account of delay and laches and

whether the ad hoc service rendered by the petitioner from 01.12.1998

to 31.12.2004 can be counted for the grant of time scale and seniority

10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in "
Yunus (Baboobhai) A

Hamid Padvekar vs State of Maharashtra Through
its Secretary and

others",, 2009(2) SCT 24,
24, while referring to the issue of delay and

latches, had held as follows:-

follows:

"8.

8. Delay or laches is one of the factors which is to
be borne in mind by the High Courts when they exercise
their discretionary powers under
Article 226
of the
Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution'). In
an appropriate case the High Court may refuse to invoke
its extraordinary powers if there is such negligence or
omission on the part of the applicant to assert his right as
taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other
circumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party.
Even where
re fundamental right is involved the matter is still
within the discretion of the Court as pointed out in
Durga
Prasad v. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports
(AIR
1970 SC 769).. Of course, the discretion has to be
exercised judicially and reasonably.

9.. What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes
Peacock in Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Prosper
Armstrong Hurde etc.
(1874) 5 PC 221 at page 239 was
approved by this Court in
Moon Mills Ltd. v. Industrial
Courts
(AIR 1967 SC 1450) and Maharashtra State
Transport
sport Corporation v. Balwant Regular Motor Service
(AIR 1969 SC 329),, Sir Barnes had stated:

"Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of
Equity is not an arbitrary or technical doctrine.
Where it would be practically unjust to give a
remedy either because the party has, by his conduct
done that which might fairly be regarded as
equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct
and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving that
remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in
which it would not be reaso
reasonable to place him if the
remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of
these cases, lapse of time and delay are most
material. But in every case, if an argument against
relief, which otherwise would be just, if founded
upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting
to a bar by any statute of limitation, the validity of
that defence must be tried upon principles
substantially equitable. Two circumstances always
important in such cases are, the length of the delay
and the nature of the acts done dduring the interval
which might affect either party and cause a balance
of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the
other, so far as relates to the remedy."

10. It would be appropriate to note certain decisions
of this Court in which this aspec
aspect has been dealt with in
relation with
Article 32
of the Constitution. It is apparent
that what has been stated as regards that Article would
apply, a fortiori, to
Article 226.
It was observed in R.N
Bose v. Union of India (AIR 1970 SC 470) that no relief
can be given to the petitioner who without any reasonable
explanation approaches this Court under
Article 32
after
inordinate delay. It was stated that though
Article 32
is
itself a guaranteed right, it does not follow from this that it
was the intention off the Constitution makers that this
Court should disregard all principles and grant relief in
petitions filed after inordinate delay.

11. It was stated in
State of M.P. v. Nandlal
(AIR
1987 SC 251) that the High Court in exercise of its
discretion does nott ordinarily assist the tardy and the

indolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. If there is
inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner and such
delay is not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may
decline to intervene and grant relief in exer
exercise of its writ
jurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is premised on a
number of factors. The High Court does not ordinarily
permit a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy
because it is likely to cause confusion and public
inconvenience and bringg in its trail new injustices, and if
writ jurisdiction is exercised after unreasonable delay, it
may have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and
inconvenience but also injustice on third parties. It was
pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is iinvoked,
unexplained delay coupled with the creation of third party
rights in the meantime is an important factor which also
weighs with the High Court in deciding whether or not to
exercise such jurisdiction.

12. In view of the aforesaid position we are nnot
inclined to interfere in this appeal which is dismissed
accordingly."

11. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
State of

Uttaranchal and another v. Sri Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and

others
, 2013(6) SLR 629,
629, while considering the issue regarding delay

and
nd laches and referring to earlier judgments on the issue, opined that

repeated representations made will not keep the issues alive. A stale or

a dead issue/dispute cannot be revived even if such a representation has

been decided either by the authority or by getting a direction from the

court as the issue regarding delay and laches is to be decided with

reference to original cause of action and not with reference to any such

order passed. Delay and laches on the part of a government servant may

deprive him of the benefit which had been given to others.
Article 14
of

the Constitution of India, in a situation of that nature, will not be

attracted as it is well known that law leans in favour of those who are

alert and vigilant. Even equality has to be claimed at the right juncture

and not on expiry of reasonable time. Even if there is no period

prescribed for filing the writ petition under
Article 226
of the

Constitution of India, yet it should be filed within a reasonable time. An

order promoting a junior should
should normally be challenged within a period

of six months or at the most in a year of such promotion. Though it is

not a strict rule, the courts can always interfere even subsequent thereto,

but relief to a person, who allows things to happen and then approa
approach

the court and puts forward a stale claim and try to unsettle settled

matters, can certainly be refused on account of delay and laches.

Anyone who sleeps over his rights is bound to suffer. An employee who

sleeps like Rip Van Winkle and got up from slumb
slumber at his own leisure,

deserves to be denied the relief on account of delay and laches.

Relevant paragraphs from the aforesaid judgment are extracted below:

"13. We have no trace of doubt that the respondents could
have challenged the ad hoc promotion conf
conferred on the
junior employee at the relevant time. They chose not to do
so for six years and the junior employee held the
promotional post for six years till regular promotion took
place. The submission of the learned counsel for the
respondents is that they
ey had given representations at the
relevant time but the same fell in deaf ears. It is interesting
to note that when the regular selection took place, they
accepted the position solely because the seniority was
maintained and, thereafter, they knocked at the doors of

the tribunal only in 2003. It is clear as noon day that the
cause of action had arisen for assailing the order when the
junior employee was promoted on ad hoc basis on
15.11.1983.
In
C. Jacob v. Director of Geology and
Mining and another
, (2008) 10 SCC 115
115, a two-Judge
Bench was dealing with the concept of representations and
the directions issued by the court or tribunal to consider
the representations and the challenge to the said rejection
thereafter. In that context, the court has expre
expressed thus:-

"Every representation to the Government for
relief, may not be replied on merits. Representations
relating to matters which have become stale or
barred by limitation, can be rejected on that ground
alone, without examining the merits of the cl
claim. In
regard to representations unrelated to the
Department, the reply may be only to inform that the
matter did not concern the Department or to inform
the appropriate Department. Representations with
incomplete particulars may be replied by seeking
relevant
evant particulars. The replies to such
representations, cannot furnish a fresh cause of
action or revive a stale or dead claim."

137,, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, testing the equality
clause on the bedrock of delay and llaches pertaining to
grant of service benefit, has ruled thus:

thus:-

"... filing of representations alone would not
save the period of limitation. Delay or laches is a
relevant factor for a court of law to determine the
question as to whether the claim made by an
applicant deserves consideration. Delay and/or
laches on the part of a government servant may
deprive him of the benefit which had been given to
others.

In
New Delhi Municipal Council v. Pan Singh and

, (2007) 9 SCC 278,, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
opined that though there is no period of llimitation
provided for filing a writ petition under
Article 226
of the
Constitution of India, yet ordinarily a writ petition should
be filed within a reasonable time. In the said case the
respondents had filed the writ petition after seventeen
years and thee court, as stated earlier, took note of the
delay and laches as relevant factors and set aside the

approaching the High Court. In
the said judgment
, it has been held as

under:-

"10. What we wish to emphasize, in particular, is that
services of the appellant were regularized w
w.e.f.

01.04.1997. And, he was assigned a specific seniority
position in the cadre. Whereafter, he continued to serve the
department for nearly twenty five years, before attaining
the age of superannuation in January, 2022. Needless to
assert that during alll these years, he availed all admissible
benefits, promotions, and retired as Inspector. Thus, it
rather appears that institution of the petition by the
appellant was speculative and an attempt to resurrect a
stale and dead claim. The Supreme Court, in
New Delhi
Municipal Council v. Pan Singh & Ors.
, 2007(9) SCC
278, observed:

"15. There is another aspect of the matter
which cannot be lost sight of. Respondents herein
filed a Writ Petition after 17 years. They did not
agitate their grievances for a long ti
time. They, as
noticed herein, did not claim parity with the 17
workmen at the earliest possible opportunity. They
did not implead themselves as parties even in the
reference made by the State before the Industrial
Tribunal. It is not their case that after 11982, those
employees who were employed or who were
recruited after the cut-off
off date have been granted
the said scale of pay.
After such a long time,
therefore, the Writ Petitions could not have been
entertained even if they are similarly situated. It is
trite
ite that the discretionary jurisdiction may not be
exercised in favour of those who approach the Court
after a long time. Delay and laches are relevant
factors for exercise of equitable jurisdiction. See

11. Similarly, in Jagdish Lal & O
Ors. v. State of
Haryana & Ors., (1997) 6 SCC 538
538, it was held by the
Supreme Court:

"That apart, as this Court has repeatedly
held, the delay disentitles the party to the
discretionary relief under
Article 226
or 32 of the
Constitution. It is not necessar
necessary to reiterate all
catena of precedents in this behalf. Suffice it to state
that the appellant kept sleeping over their rights for
long and elected to wake up when they had the
impetus from Vir Pal Chauhan and Ajit Singh's
ratios..................... Therefore
Therefore, desperate attempts of
the appellants to re-do
do the seniority had by them in
various cadres/grades though in the same services
according to 1974 Rules or 1980 Rule, are not
amenable to judicial review at this belated stage...."

12. In the wake of the position as sketched out above,
we are dissuaded to interfere with the impugned order and
judgment rendered by the learned single Judge. The
appeal being bereft of merit is, accordingly, dismissed."

13. The Co-ordinate
ordinate Bench of this Court in "
Prem Nath and

others vs State of Punjab and others
", 2018(2) SCT 687, while

rejecting the claim of additional increments of acquisition of higher

qualifications has held as under:-

under:

"3. It is the case set up on behalf of the petitioners
that they had all been appointe
appointed before 19.02.1979 and

had even improved/acquired higher qualifications before
19.02.1979 and as such there would be no difference
between the employees working with the Punjab
Government, holding corresponding post and the
employees like the petitioners who have worked for
Punjab Privately Managed Recognised Aided Schools. It is
also the assertion made by counsel representing the
petitioners that their claim would be covered in terms of
decision dated 02.07.2013 rendered by this Court in a
bunch of writ petitions
etitions including CWP No.8083 of 1989
titled as
Radha Krishan Narang and others vs. State of
Punjab and others
.

4. Having heard counsel for the petitioners at length,
this Court is of the considered view that the claim of the
petitioners would not requiree any consideration on merits
and the writ petition deserves to be dismissed on the sole
ground of delay and laches.

5. Placed on record and appended at Annexure P
P-1
are the particulars of the petitioners. The tabulation at
Annexure P-11 would show that all the petitioners stand
retired on various dates between the years 1995 to 2012.
Out of 32 petitioners in all, 22 petitioners superannuated
more than 10 years back.

6. There is no justification coming forth as regards
the inordinate delay in having appr
approached the Writ Court.

There is also no explanation put forth by the petitioners as
to why the claim raised in the instant petition was not
agitated by the petitioners while they were in service. The
entire thrust of the submissions advanced by counsel is
that similarly situated employees had approached this
Court and have been granted relief.

extraordinary writ jurisdiction under
Article 226
of the
Constitution of India was considered by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in
Chairman, U.P. Jal Nigam and another
v. Jaswant Singh and another
(2006)11 SCC 464

464. In such
case, certain employees raised the issue that they were not
liable to be retired at the age of 58 years but should be
permitted to continue in service till th
they attain the age of
60 years. Such employees were still in service when the
writ petitions were filed. The writ petitions were ultimately
allowed. Placing reliance upon such judgment, some of the
employees, who had already superannuated, filed writ
petitions
ons seeking the same benefit. Even such petitions
were allowed by the High Court in terms of following the
earlier judgment. The judgment of the High Court was
challenged before the Apex Court and wherein while
referring to earlier judgments in
Rup Diamonds v. Union
of India
, (1989)2 SCC 356; "
Jagdish Lal v. State of
Haryana
, (
1997)6 SCC 538 and Government of West
Bengal v. Tarun K. Roy
, (2004)1 SCC 347
347, it was opined
that persons who approached the Court at a belated stage
placing reliance upon the order ppassed in some other case
earlier, can be denied the discretionary relief on the
ground of delay and laches. The relevant observations
made by the Supreme Court are contained in Paras 5, 6
and 16 of the judgment and are extracted here under:

under:-

"5. So far as the principal issue is
concerned, that has been settled by this court.
Therefore, there is no quarrel over the legal
proposition. But the only question is grant of
relief to such other persons who were not

their retirement

filed writ petitions after the judgment of this
court in
Harwindra Kumar v. Chief
Engineer, Karmik
, (2005) 13 SCC 300 300.
Whether they are entitled to same relief or not?
Therefore, a serious question that arises for
consideration

did not wake up to challenge their retirement

and accepted the same, collected their post post-
retirement benefits, can such persons be given
the relief in the light of the subsequent
decision delivered by this court?

6. Thee question of delay and laches has
been examined by this court in a series of
decisions and laches and delay has been
considered to be an important factor in
exercise of the discretionary relief under

Article 226
of the Constitution. When a
person who is not ot vigilant of his rights and
acquiesces with the situation, can his writ
petition be heard after a couple of years on
the ground that same relief should be granted
to him as was granted to person similarly
situated who was vigilant about his rights and
challenged
allenged his retirement which was said to
be made on attaining the age of 58 years. A
chart has been supplied to us in which it has
been pointed out that about 9 writ petitions
were filed by the employees of the Nigam
before their retirement wherein their
retirement was somewhere between 30.6.2005
and 31.7.2005. Two writ petitions were filed
wherein no relief of interim order was passed.
They were granted interim order. Thereafter a
spate of writ petitions followed in which
employees who retired in the year years 2001,
2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, woke up to file
writ petitions in 2005 and 2006 much after
their retirement. Whether such persons should
be granted the same relief or not?

xx xx xx

16. Therefore, in case at this belated stage if
similar relief is to be given to the persons who
have not approached the court that will
unnecessarily overburden the Nigam and the
Nigam will completely collapse with the
liability of payment to these persons in terms
of two years' salary and increased benefit of
pension and other her consequential benefits.
Therefore, we are not inclined to grant any
relief to the persons who have approached the
court after their retirement. Only those

persons who have filed the writ petitions
when they were in service or who have
obtained interim order for their retirement,
those persons should be allowed to stand to
benefit and not others."

8. The issue of delay was also dealt with by this
Court in
Tarsem Pal vs. Punjab State Power Corporation
Limited and others
, 2013 (3) SLR 314.

In the case of

(supra), the petitioner was serving as a Clerk
with the respondent-Corporation
Corporation and had retired on
31.03.2005. Claim in the writ petition was to grant to him
the benefit of proficiency set up in the pay scale on
completion of 23 years of service from the due date as per
policy of the Corporation. During the service career, he
had not agitated the claim for increments. For the first
time, such claim had been made on 28.02.2005 i.e. just
one month prior to superannuation. While nnon-suiting the
petitioner on account of delay and laches it was held as
follows:-

"11. In the aforesaid judgments, it has
been clearly laid down that discretionary
relief in a writ jurisdiction is available to a
party who is alive of his rights and enforc
enforces
the same in court within reasonable time. The
judgment in another case does not give a
cause of action to file a writ petition at a
belated stage seeking the same relief. Such
petitions can be dismissed on account of
delay and laches. As has already bee
been noticed
above in the present case as well, the
petitioner joined service in the year 1965 and
retired in the year 2005, but raised the issue
regarding benefit of proficiency step up in the
pay scale on completion of 23 years of service
from the due date more than five years after
his retirement referring to a judgment of this
court and filed the petition claiming the same
relief.

12. The petitioner retired from service
on 31.3.2005 and the claim pertaining to the
benefit of proficiency step up, which may be
admissible to the petitioner during his service
career, was sought to be raised more than five
years after his retirement, the claim made at
such a late stage deserves to be dismissed on
account of delay and laches only. The
petitioner could raise a gr
grievance about the
pay scales admissible to him or the last pay
drawn by him within a reasonable time after
his retirement. He cannot be permitted to
raise the same at any time on the plea that the
same is recurring cause of action.

13. Considering the enu
enunciation of law,
as
referred to above
, in my opinion, the
petitioner herein is not entitled to the relief
prayed for and the petition deserves to be
dismissed merely on account of delay and
laches."

9. At this stage, counsel appearing for the
petitioners would make an attempt to overcome the
obstacle of delay by placing reliance upon a Full Bench
Judgment of this Court in
Saroj Kumar vs. State of
Punjab
, 1998(3) SCT 664.. Counsel would argue that as
per dictum
laid down in

Saroj Kumar
's case(supra),
matters of pay fixation involve a recurring cause of action
and as such, writ petitions for such claim cannot be
dismissed on the ground of delay and laches and the Court
at the most, may restrict the arrears upto 38 months from
the date of filing of the petition and disallow the arrears
for the period for which even a suit had become time
barred.

10. The reliance placed by counsel upon the
judgment in
Saroj Kumar
's case, is wholly misplaced.

The
observations and aspect of delay in
Saroj Kumar
's case,
were in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in

M.R. Gupta vs. Union of India and others
, 1995(4) RSJ

502.. In
M.R. Gupta
's case(supra), it had been
categorically held that so long as an employee "is in
service" a fresh cause of action arises every month whe
when
he is getting his monthly salary on the basis of a wrong
calculation made contrary to rules. It was further held that
the claim to be awarded the correct salary on the basis of
a proper pay fixation "is a right which subsists during the
entire tenure of service".

11. In the present case, however the petitioners
choose not to agitate their claim while in service. It is
much subsequent to their superannuation that they have
woken up and seek to gain impetus from certain
decisions that may have been rendere
rendered in the case of
similarly situated employees.

12. Considering the dictum of law as
laid down in

Chariman, U.P. Jal Nigam
's case (supra), the petitioners
herein are not entitled to any releif as prayed for and the
petition deserves to be dismissed on the sole ground of
delay and laches.

13. Ordered accordingly."

14. The Division Bench of this Court in
in"
H.S. Gill vs Union of

India and others
", 2016(2) SCT 477,, has held that an employee cannot

claim the revised pay scale after retirement once he has been receiving

the pay scale granted by the employer for the last 09 years. The

relevant portion from
the said judgment
, reads as under:

under:-

"14. The petitioner is also not entitled to any relief
on account of principle of delay and laches. He has been
receiving the pay in the pay scale of Rs.6500
Rs.6500-10500 right
from his transfer to CSIO, Chandigarh i.e. 2.7.2002. For
the first time, he moved the representation on 29.8.2011,
so, he kept mum for about 9 years. Thus, the claim of the
petitioner is highly belated and st
stale."

eligibility for grant of ACP scales and provides that every
Government servant, after a regular satisfactory service
for a minimum period of 10 and 20 years, is eligible for
grant of first and second ACP scale. Rule 5 of the Rules
reads as under: -

overruled by holding that only the regular service can be

The
said judgment has been followed by the Hon'ble Supreme

Jagjiwan Ram
's case (supra), wh
wherein after
considering various judgments
judgments, it has been held as under:-

"10. The ratio of the above mentioned judgments is

Judges. By majority judgment, the
larger bench held that the service rendered by an
employee on the basis of adhoc appointment must
be clubbed with his regular service for the purpose
of grant of selection grade in terms of the policy
framed by the State Government. This Court
reversed the judgment of the High Court and held :

"Coming to the circular dated 22-6-1989,
issued by the Financial Commissio
Commissioner and
Secretary to the Government of Haryana,
Finance Department, it appears that the
aforesaid circular had been issued for
removal of anomalies in the pay scale of
Doctors, Deputy Superintendents and
Engineers, and so far as Engineers are
concerned, which
ich are in Class I and Class II,
it was unequivocally indicated that the
revised pay scale of Rs. 3000 to Rs. 4500 can
be given after completion of 5 years of
regular service and Rs. 4100 to Rs. 5300 after
completion of 12 years of regular service. The
saidd Financial Commissioner had issued yyet
another circular dated 16
16-5-1990, in view of
certain demands made by officers of different
departments. The aforesaid circular was
issued after reconsideration by the
Government modifying to some extent the
earlier circular
ircular of 22-6-1989, and even in this
circular it was categorically indicated that so
far as Engineers are concerned, they would
get Rs. 3000 to 4500 after 5 years of regular

and satisfactory service and selection grade
in the scale of pay of Rs. 4100 to R
Rs. 5300,
which is limited to the extent of 20% of the
cadre post should be given after 12 years of
regular and satisfactory service.
The aforesaid two circulars are unambiguous and
unequivocally indicate that a Government servant
would be entitled to the higher scale indicated
therein only on completion of 5 years or 12 years of
regular service and further the number of persons to
be entitled to get the selection grade is limited to
20% of the cadre post. This being the position, we
fail to understand how services rendered by Rakesh
Kumar from 1980 to 1982, which was purely on ad
hoc basis, and was not in accordance with the
statutory rules can be taken into account for
computation of the period of 12 years indicated in
the circular. The majority judgment oof the High
Court committed serious error by equating
expression "regular service" with "continuous
service". In our considered opinion under the terms
and conditions
ons of the circulars dated 22-6-1989 and
16-5-1990,
1990, the respondent Rakesh Kumar would be

which date he was duly appointed against a
temporary post of Assistant Engineer on being
selected by the Public Service Commission and not
from any earlier pointt of time. The conclusion of the
majority judgment in favour of Rakesh Kumar,
therefore, cannot be sustained."

Rules, 1970 and held :-

"A combined reading of the aforesaid
provisions of the Recruitment Rules puts the
controversy beyond any doubt and the only
conclusion which could be drawn from the
aforesaid Rules is that the services rendered
either on an ad hoc bbasis or as a stopgap
arrangement, as in the case in hand from
1980 to 1982 cannot be held to be regular
service for getting the benefits of the revised
scale of pay or of the selection grade under
the Government memorandum dated 22- 6-
1989 and 16-5--1990, and therefore, the
majority judgment of the High Court must be
held to be contrary to the aforesaid
provisions of the Recruitment Rules,
consequently cannot be sustained. The initial
letter of appointment dated 66-12-1979
pursuance to which respondent Rakesh
Kumar joined as an Assistant Engineer on an
ad hoc basis in 1980 was also placed before
us. The said appointment letter unequivocally
indicates that the offer of appointment as
Assistant Engineer was on ad hoc basis and

provides that the appointment will be on an
ad hoc basis for a period of 6 months from
the date of joining and the salary was a fixed
salary of Rs. 400 p.m. in the scale of Rs. 400
to Rs. 1100 and the services were liable to be
terminated without any notice and at any time
without assigning any reason and that the

any seniority or any other benefit under the
Service Rules for the time being in force and
will not count towards increment in the time
scale. In view
ew of the aforesaid stipulations in
the offer of appointment itself we really fail to
understand as to how the aforesaid period of
service rendered on ad hoc basis can be held
to be service on regular basis. The conclusion
of the High Court is contrary to the very
terms and conditions stipulated in the offer of
appointment and, therefore, the same cannot
be sustained. The regular letter of

Rakesh Kumar along with others had applied

Commission for being appointed as an
Assistant Engineer and the Service
Commission after selecting the number of

The conclusion of the majority judgment of

(supra) and held that adhoc service

their regular service for the purpose of grant of

13. A reading of the scheme framed by the Board
makes it clear that the benefit of time bound
promotional scales was to be given to the employees
only on their completing 9/16 years regular service.
Likewise, the benefit of promotional increments
could be given only on completion of 23 years
regular service. The use of the term 'regular service'
in various paragraphs of the scheme shows that
service rendered by an employee after regular
appointment could
ould only be counted for computation
of 9/16/23 years service and the service of a
temporary, adhoc or work charged employee cannot
be counted for extending the benefit of time bound
promotional scales or promotional increments. If

recruitment and status should be counted for the

purpose of grant of time bound promotional scales
or promotional increments, then instead of using the
expression '9/16 years regular ser
service' or '23 years
regular service', the concerned authority would
have used the expression '9/16 years service' or '23
years service'. However, the fact of the matter is
that the scheme in its plainest term embodies the
requirement of 9/16 years regular sservice or 23
years regular service as a condition for grant of
time bound promotional scales or promotional
increments as the case may be. For the reasons
mentioned above, we hold that the respondents were
not entitled to the benefit of time bound promotio
promotional
scales/promotional increments on a date prior to
completion of 9/16/23 years regular service and the
High Court committed serious error by directing the
