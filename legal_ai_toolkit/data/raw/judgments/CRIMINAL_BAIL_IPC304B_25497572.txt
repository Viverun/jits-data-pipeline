M.P. No.310/2018

Indore; dated 14.03.2018
Shri Sachin Sabnis, learned counsel for the petitioner.

The petitioner has filed the present petition
being aggrieved by order dated 23.11.2017 by which
learned trial Court has rejected the application filed under

Order 22 Rule 9 of C.P.C
.. The plaintiffs have filed the suit
for permanent injunction and removal of illegal
construction raised by the defendant / plaintiff .

After receipt of summon, the defendant filed
written statement contending that he has not raised any
illegal construction but he purchased the constructed house
and there is no illegal construction. On the basis of
pleadings the learned trial court has framed the issues. The
issue No.1 and 2 are in respect of the illegal construction
raised by the defendant. The defendant has already filed an
affidavit under
Order 18 Rule 4 of the C.P.C
. and the case
is fixed for cross examination his witnesses. At this stage
the defendant has filed an application under
Order 26 Rule
9 of C.P.C
. The learned trial has rejected the aforesaid
application by observing that the provision of under
Order
26 Rule 9 of C.P.C
. cannot use for collection of evidence.
The
Order 26 Rule 9 of C.P.C
. provides that :- "In any suit in
which the Court deems a local investigation to be requisite
or proper for the purpose of elucidating any matter in
dispute, or of ascertaining the market value, may issue a
commission. The language of Order 26 Rule 9 is very plain
and simple, according to which, if any court deems it
proper to appoint a commission for the purpose of
clarification of any issue in dispute, may appoint a
commission. That any clarification requires only after the
evidences are produced by both the parties. The parties in
suit must prove their case by way of evidence and if the
court wants that any issue or matter in dispute requires any
clarification or elucidation it may appoint a commission. In
the present case the plaintiff as well as defendants have not
given their evidences so far. They have to stand on their
lags as they have to prove their case by way of evidence
and if thereafter any issue is required to be clarified then
they may file an application or court suo moto may appoint
a commission". The important is that at which stage
application under
Order 26 Rule 9 of C.P.C
. is filed in the
suit.

In view of the above, the application filed by the
respondent is premature and petition is disposed of with liberty
to the petitioner to revive his application after cross
examination of his witnesses. The learned trial Court has rightly
dismissed the application at this stage.

Accordingly, petition is disposed of with above
liberty.

Certified copy as per rules.

Vinod Kumar Nakda Vs. State of M.P. and others
)
Indore; dated 12.03.2018
Ms. Rekha Shrivastava, learned counsel for the
petitioner.

Ms. Bharti Lakkad, learned counsel for the
respondents/ State.

The petitioner has filed the present petition being
aggrieved by order dated 04.11.2015 by which services of
the petitioner has been terminated. The petitioner was
appointed as Pharmacist on contract basis vide order dated
05.09.2013. The period of contract of the petitioner was
extended time to time. That, alongwith the petitioner other
candidates were also appointed as Pharmacist. After the
appointment the CMO, Mandsour (M.P.) has considered
the eligibility of the petitioner and found that the
appointment of the petitioner was against the rules and he
was not eligible for the post of Pharmacist and his
appointment is forged also.

The similar case came up for hearing before this
Court in W.P. Nos. 749/2016, 1479/2016 & 1500/2016. By
order dated 07.02.2018 all the writ petitions have been
dismissed. The operative part of order is reproduced
below:-

" The original record reflects that advertisement
was issued for appointment on the post of Pharmacist
and after scrutiny of the applications, initially the merit
list dated 7/3/13 was prepared. Thereafter a complaint
was received alleging irregularities in preparing the
merit list. Hence the selection process was stayed and
appointment orders dated 20/3/13 were kept in
abeyance. After the enquiry and considering the
objections, the fresh select list was prepared and
forwarded by the Incharge Officer to CMHO Mandsaur
on 3/5/13. The said select list was displayed in the
notice board of CMHO Mandsaur on 3/5/13 and
objections were invited. The petitioner in WP No.
749/16 had submitted the objection which was
rejected.

The appointment of petitioner in WP No. 749/16
was under OBC category and order of appointment of
petitioner dated 31/8/2013 states that petitioner was
appointed in pursuance to the revised merit list dated
3/5/13 but a perusal of the revised merit list dated
3/5/13 reveals that under the OBC male category, the
last selected candidate had obtained 63.55% marks and
last candidate in the waiting list had obtained 53.28%
marks, whereas the chart containing the details of
marks obtained by all candidates namely "all forms of
pharmacist" reveals that petitioner's name figures in
that chart at Sr.No. 595 and he had obtained only
36.12% marks. Since petitioner had obtained less than
the cut-off marks in the main merit list and waiting list
of OBC male candidate, therefore, he was not entitled
for appointment on the post of Pharmacist.

So far as the petitioner in WP No. 1479/16 is
concerned, he belongs to General Category and he was
issued the notice dated 9/10/15 for cancellation of his
appointment on the ground that neither his name
figures in the select list nor he had submitted any
application for appointment.

It has been pointed out by learned counsel for
respondents that the name of petitioner does not figure
in the table of all forms of pharmacist which contains
the details and marks of all applicants who had made
the application for appointment nor does his name
figure in the merit list or waiting list of selected
candidates which means that the petitioner was
appointed even without applying for the post.

In WP No. 1500/16 the petitioner was a candidate
under Female General Category and she had obtained
36.15% marks whereas the cut-off marks in the merit list
of the Female General Category was 55.13% and the
cut-off marks in the waiting list of Female General
Category was 39.27%. Since the petitioner had obtained
less than the marks of last candidate of waiting list
unreserved women candidate, therefore, she could not
have been appointed.

The record further reflects that petitioners were
issued the show cause notice and after giving an
opportunity of hearing the impugned orders have been
passed terminating their services on the ground that
they had obtained less than the cutoff marks of the final
select list and waiting list or had not even submitted the
application for appointment. That apart it is also noticed
that appointment of petitioners was on contract basis
which as per terms of the appointment could be
terminated after giving one month's notice or the
contract amount in lieu thereof and in compliance of
said condition, the petitioners have been paid the
contract amount of one month.

Having regard to the aforesaid, I am of the
opinion that no error has been committed by
respondents in passing the impugned orders and
terminating the services of petitioners. The writ
petitions are found to be devoid of any merit which are
accordingly dismissed. The signed order be placed in
the record of WP No.749/16 and copy whereof be placed
in the record of connected writ petitions.

In view of the above, the petition filed by petitioner
is hereby dismissed.

and 3.

Shri N.Bhati, learned counsel for the respondent No.4
and 5.

Petitioner has filed present petition seeking follwing
reliefs:

"a. A writ in the nature of certiorari/mandamus or
any other appropriate writ, order or direction be issued for
quashment of the order Annexure P/14 as also for directing
the respondents to decide the application submitted by the
petitioner for allotment of the land in question.

b. Costs of the petitioin be awarded to the petitioner
from the respondents.

c. Any other relief, as this Hon'ble Court may deem
fit in the facts and circumstances of the case, be granted to
the petitioner."

Petitioner is proprietorship firm having bussiness
within the District Ratlam. The Madhya Pradesh
Government came with a policy to faciliated the Industrial
Groath in the State to provide the land for setting up
Industrial Unit. The said policy was framed under M.P.
State Industrial Land and Industrial Building Management
Rules, 2005 and came into force w.e.f. 01.04.2015.

The petitioner has submitted an application to
respondent No.5 on 05.07.2016 for allotment of
undeveloped plot of land admeasuring 4.348 hectare
comrpised in servey No. 22/1/min-1 situated at Village
Kumhari, Tahsil Jaora, District Ratlam.

The application of the petitioner forwarded to the
Joint Director Industries, with recommendation, thereafter,
the various communications were exchanged but no final
order be passed. The petitioner was awaited the decision of
the respondent in respect of allotment of the land on his
application and meanwhile the respondent No.1 issued a
order dated 28.02.2017 whereby the land in question has
directed to be hand over by the respondent No.4 to the
respondent No.5. Hence, the petitioner has filed the present
petition assailing the order dated 28.02.2017 on the ground
that before considering his application for allotment the
land in question oguht to have been transferred to
respondent No.5.

After notice, respondent No.2 and 4 filed reply by
submmitting that that after the order dated 28.02.2017 the
land in question has already been handed over to
respondent No.5, therefore, respondent No.4 has returned
the application of the petitioner vide letter dated
03.05.2017, therefore, no relief can be granted to the
petitioner and the respondent No.2 and 4 are not competent
to allote the land.

The respondent No.1, 3 and 5 also filed the return by
submitting that the petitioner has applied with the project
report of investment of approximately ..... and employment
to about 80%, therefore, he is not eligible for allotment of
the land against proposed unit. The petitioner comes within
the purview of the larg scale industries which comes under
the Commerce and Industrial Department. The respondent
No.5 empowered to allote the land to micro, small and
medium interprises. The land in question was ... of the land
Jagra Sugar Mill and after .. of the mill the said land vested
Joint Director AKVN vide letter dated 08.12.2015 therefore
the the matter was transferred AKVN vide letter dated
27.07.2015 and thereafter out of 112 hectare land
possession of land having area 42.7 hectare of survey No
2/21-Min has been handed over to respondent No.5 vide
impugned letter dated 28.02.2017.

The grievance of the petitioner is that when he has
submitted for allotment of the land that the respondent
ought to have been considered.

In view of the policy envoke at the relevant time
therfore the present petition is disposed of with direction
respondent No. 1, 3 and 5 to consider the application of the
petitinoer for allotment of the land as per law.
Petitioner has filed present petition being aggrieved by the
order dated 17/11/2017 by which he has been transferred

transfer mainly on the ground that his son studying in Class
12th and taking coaching for IIT entrance examination and
his transfer would adversly effect in study of his son.

Vide order dated 21/11/2017 this court has stayed the
transfer order.

Indore, dated 03.11.2017
Shri Abhay Saraswat, learned counsel for the
applicant.

Shri Swapnil Sharma, learned counsel for the
respondent/State.

Case-diary is available.

Arguments heard.

This is first application under
Section 439
of Cr.P.C.
filed by the applicant for grant of bail.

The present applicant was arrested by Police Station-
Jawad, District-Neemuch, in Crime No.342/2016, under

Sections 8
/
,
of NDPS Act.

As per prosecution story, the co-accused Banti was
arrested for having in his possession 196 kg of poppy straw
and so far as the present applicant is concerned, he was
having 60 kg of poppy straw, which was seized from joint
possession of the present applicant and the co-accused Banti.

Learned counsel for the applicant submits that there
is no criminal antecedent of the present applicant and the
quantity of contraband seized from his possession, is slightly
above the commercial quantity prescribed by the Schedule
appended to the Act. He further submits that co-accused
Banti was granted bail by this Court in M.Cr.C.
No.19950/2017 dated 04.09.2017.

Learned counsel for the State opposed the application
on the ground that quantity falls within the limits of
commercial quantity prescribed by the Schedule appended to
the Act.

Taking all the facts and circumstances of the case
into consideration and without commenting on merits of the
case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail.
Accordingly, the application filed under
Section 439
of the
Cr.P.C. is allowed.

It is directed that the applicant shall be released on
bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of
Rs.75,000/- (Rs. Seventy Five Thousand only) and one
solvent surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the
concerned Magistrate for his appearance on all the dates of
hearing as may be directed in this regard during trial.

By way of abundant caution, it is further directed that
the applicant shall also mark his presence in the concerned
police station on first Sunday of every month between 10
a.m. to 12 noon during the pendency of the trial. Any default
in attendance in Court and marking his presence in the
concerned police station, would result in cancellation of bail
granted by this Court thereby entitling the police to take the
applicant in custody immediately.

He is further directed that on being so released on
bail, he would comply with the conditions enumerated under

section 437(3)
Cr.P.C. meticulously.

Certified copy as per rules.

Shri Deepak Jaat, learned counsel for the

Learned counsel for the complainant submits
that he is filed the Vakalatnama on behalf of the
complainant during the course of the day and he has
no objection if bail is granted to the appellant.

Case diary is available. Counsel for the State
submits that complainant has been served with an
intimation regarding pendency of this appeal before
this Court.

This criminal appeal under Section 14(A)(2) of
SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is directed
against the order passed by the Special Judge (SC/ST
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act), district Ratlam in
Special S.T. No.137/2016 dated 10/01/2017 whereby
the learned Special Judge dismissed the application
filed by the present appellant under Section 439
Cr.P.C.

The accused/appellant is facing trial in Special
S.T. No. 137/2016, registered at Police Station AJAK
district Ratlam for offences under
Sections 363
,

366(A)
and
376(2)(n)
of IPC and
Section 5
/
of the
POCSO Act, 2012 and
Section 3(2)(V)
of SC/ST
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

According to the prosecution story, present
appellant took the prosecutrix, who was aged about
16 years with him under a false promise of marriage
and had physical relationship with her.

Learned counsel for the appellant submits that
the prosecutrix was examined before the trial Court
and she completely turned hostile and did not submit
before the Court that present appellant had physical
relationship with her.

Learned counsel for the complainant submits
that he has no objection if appeal is allowed and bail
is granted to the appellant.

Learned counsel for the State opposes the bail
application.

After taking into consideration the facts and
circumstances of the case, it appears that the order
passed by the learned Special Judge deserves to be
set aside and accordingly this appeal is allowed. The
impugned order is set aside.

It is directed that the appellant shall be released
on bail on his furnishing a personal bond of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) and
one solvent surety of the like amount to the
satisfaction of the concerned Magistrate for his
appearance on all the dates of hearing as may be
directed in this regard during trial.

He is further directed that on being so released
on bail, he would comply with the conditions
enumerated under
Section 437(3)

meticulously.

Accordingly, the appeal stands disposed of.

As per the prosecution story, co-accused Iqbal Baig was

be arrested earlier. The applicant was absconded for a long
period and when the co-accused was acquitted by the trial
Court, the present applicant surrendered and was arrested.
Presently the trial is pending against him.

Learned counsel for the applicant submits that if the
test of purity is applied then quantity of the smack becomes
4.7 gms which is small than 5gms the small quantity of the
smack and in the light of the amendment in the schedule
even if the whole quantity smack is taken into consideration
i.e. 150 gms which is slightly less than commercial quantity
as prescribed in the schedule appended to the Act. He further
submits that there is no criminal antecedent of the present
applicant.

Learned counsel for the respondent/State opposed
the application, however, he admitted that as per report
received from concerning police station, no criminal case is
registered against the present applicant.

After taking all the facts and circumstances of the
case into consideration and without commenting on merit,
this application is allowed.

It is directed that the present applicant shall be

of Rs.75,000/- (Rs. Seventy Five Thousand only) and one

Case-diary is available.

Argument heard.

This is first application filed by the applicant under

Section 439
of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail.

The present applicant was arrested by Police Station-
Industrial Area, Jaora District-Ratlam in Crime No. 416/2016
under
Sections 302
,
120-B
/
of the IPC.

According to the prosecution story, dead-body of an
unknown woman was found in a well belonging to
Dharmendra Singh S/o Ishwar Singh. Subsequently, the dead-
body was identified as deceased -Sugan Bai, who was said to
be the wife of Ganeshilal and mother of Bharat. So far as the
present applicant is concerned, it is alleged that he agreed to
give Rs.15,000/- to co-accused Sheru and Ramlal to commit
murder of deceased- Sugan Bai.

It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the applicant that apart from the seizure of one mobile
phone, belonging to the deceased-Sagun Bai there is no other
evidence on record to connect the applicant with the murder of
deceased-Sugan Bai. There is no material to show any motive
for the present applicant to commit murder of the deceased.

Learned Panel Lawyer for State vehemently opposes the
prayer for bail on the ground that one mobile phone belonging
to the deceased-Sagun Bai was recovered from the possession
of the present applicant, however, he fairly admits that there is
no evidence to show any motive for the present applicant to
commit murder of the deceased.

After taking into consideration all the facts and
circumstances of the case and without commenting on merit of
the case, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail.

Shri Yashpal Rathore, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Jitendra Verma, learned counsel for the
complainant/objector.

Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Deputy Govt. Advocate for
respondent/State.

This is first application filed by the applicant under

Section 438
of the Cr.P.C. The applicant is apprehending his
arrest in connection with Crime No. 1228/2016 registered
under
Sections 420
,
,
and
of the IPC at Police
Station Chimanganj Mandi District Ujjain.

No other bail application is filed, pending or decided by
any other court, by this Court or before the Hon'ble Apex
Court. The applicant has filed an affidavit in support of the
application.

Bail application filed by the applicant before Additional
Sessions Judge, Ujjain has been dismissed by the Additional
Sessions Judge, Ujjain vide order dated 08/11/2016 passed in
B.A. No. 1082/2016.

Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant
was the owner of the disputed land and it was not the Govt.
land. He sold the land through will of Kanchan Bai, who
expired on 20/10/1995 and he executed the sale deed on
27/11/2015. False report has been filed against applicant
alleging that he has sold the Govt. land. He is innocent and
falsely implicated in this case, his detention is required for the
investigation . Therefore, he be granted anticipatory bail.

Shri Jitendra Verma learned counsel for the
complainant/objector with Shri Abhishek Soni, learned Deputy
Govt. Advocate appearing on behalf of the States objected the
bail application stating that applicant sold him a Govt. land by
fraud and he took away his registered sale deed stating that he
will get mutated the land on his name and that registered sale
deed has yet to be recovered from the applicant. They have
prayed for the rejection of the bail application.

According to the facts the objector has filed a complaint
against applicant alleging that he sold a piece of land to him
stating that he is owner of the land and Kanchan Bail sold him
this land through a will after getting saledeed executed. When
objector applied for mutation and also tried to fence the land
then his neighbours inform him that this is a Govt. land. He
contacted the Patwari, who also confirm the information and
revealed that this is a Govt. land and has earmarked as
residential colony of Govt. hospital.

Applicant also took away the registered saledeed from
the complainant stating that he will get the land mutated in his
name and has not returned the same. Alleging that applicant
has obtained Rs.15 lacs from him by fraud. Objector has filed a
FIR, which was registered as stated above.

Considering the aforesaid and other facts and
circumstances of the case so also the facts that matter is under
investigation. I do not think it is fit case for grant of
anticipatory bail at this stage. Accordingly, this petition is
hereby dismissed.

Shri Sanjay Karanjawala, learned Panel Lawyer for
respondent/State.

Heard on IA No. 9760/2016, an application under

Section 389(1)
of the Cr.P.C. for suspension of jail sentence
and grant of bail.

At the very outset learned counsel for the appellants
seeks permission of this Court to withdraw this application in
respect of appellant No.2 Rem Singh.

Prayer is allowed.

Accordingly, this application is dismissed as withdrawn
in respect of appellant No.2 Rem Singh.

Appellant No.1 Bala alongwith other co-accused Rem
Singh and Babu were convicted for the offence punishable
under
Section 302
/
of the IPC and sentenced to life
imprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000/- each with default
stipulation.

Learned counsel for the appellants submits that statement
of the prosecution witnesses Dhan Singh(PW/1), Panu
Bai(PW/4) and Ramesh (PW/6) are unreliable as there is
material contradictions and omissions in their statement
recorded under
Section 161
of the Cr.P.C. She further submits
that Dhan Singh(PW/1) in his statement submits that he has
reached at the spot when he heard the cries of wife of the
deceased i.e. Panu Bai(PW/4), however, in her statement she
stated that she heard the noise of deceased Jhanjhad. Similarly
Ramesh (PW/6) in his statement has stated that he heard the
cries of Panu Bai (PW/4) but in his statement recorded under

Section 161
of the Cr.P.C. he said that he heard the cries of
Dhan Singh(PW/1).

Learned Panel Lawyer for the State opposes the prayer.
After going through the statement of these three
prosecution witnesses, who are recorded as eye witness, we
find there is no material contradiction in their statement and
statement recorded under
Section 161
of the Cr.P.C. Their
presence at the spot is natural as they lived near the spot, where
the crime was committed. Present appellant and other co-
accused were known to him and the night was of full moon so
there is also a source of light and therefore, their statement
cannot be disbelieved on the ground of such minor
contradictions and their evidence is corroborated by the
medical evidence also.

Considering the aforesaid we are of the view that no
case is made out for suspension of jail sentence. IA No.
9760/2016 devoid of any force and liable to be dismissed and
dismissed accordingly.

Shri Vivek Dalal, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Kshitij Vyas, learned Panel lawyer for the
respondent/State.

Heard.

This application under
Section 482
of the Cr.P.C. is
preferred by the applicant Kamal Singh for quashment of order
dated 24/11/2016 passed by learned Special
Judge( SC/ST(Prevention of Atrocities)) Act, 1989, Ujjain in
ST No. 302/2011, whereby learned Special Judge dismissed the
application filed by the prosecution for recalling the medical
witnesses Dr. Shyam Badliwal & Dr. Sharad Dubey , who
treated Kamal Singh and for exhibiting the query report where
he mention in bed had ticket of Pawan S/o Rameshwar
grevious in nature and could be dangerous to life at the time of
admission.

Application has been dismissed only on the ground that
session has been pending since 2011 and ample opportunities
have been granted to the prosecution.

Learned counsel for the applicant has no objection in
allowing the petition.

Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that in
case the query report given by Dr. Shyam Badliwal is not
exhibited, the case of the prosecution would suffer enormously.
According to him this would not amount to filling of lacuna
because the document was already on record and due to
inadvertance and lake of promptness on the part of the
prosecution, document remained to be exhibited. Therefore,
one last opportunity should be given to the applicant to
examine Dr. Shyam Badliwal and exhibit the query report .

After due consideration this petition is allowed and
impugned order passed by the learned Special Judge is hereby
set-aside. Accordingly, application filed by the prosecution is
allowed.

Prosecution is at liberty to recall the witness Dr. Shyam
Badliwal and to exhibit the query report filed by him.

With aforesaid observation and direction this petition
stands disposed of.

Certified copy as per rules.
